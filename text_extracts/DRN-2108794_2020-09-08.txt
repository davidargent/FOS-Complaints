Our adjudicator upheld Mr Qs complaint and thought loans 6 and 7 shouldnt have been 
given. Lending Stream agreed with the adjudicators conclusions and said it would pay 
compensation in line with our usual approach to redress. 
But Mr Q said he didnt think the suggested compensation was enough. He considered 
Lending Stream should do more to compensate him for the financial difficulty and stress hes 
experienced.
I issued a provisional decision for the complaint on 13 July 2020. I provisionally decided that 
in addition to loans 6 and 7, Lending Stream shouldnt have arranged loan 5 for Mr Q. Ive 
summarised my provisional findings below:
I didnt think it was unreasonable for Lending Stream to arrange loans 1 and 2 for Mr 
Q. The loans were arranged during the early part of the lending relationship, and 
seemed to have been affordable to Mr Q. There was a gap of over eight months 
between loan 1 being repaid and loan 2 being taken, and the loans were repaid 
sooner than required by the loan agreements.
I also thought it was reasonable for Lending Stream to arrange loans 3 and 4 for Mr 
Q. Loan 3 was for a higher amount than loan 2, but loan 3 seemed to have been 
affordable for Mr Q. 
Loan 4 was taken out while loan 3 remained open, but it was for a lower amount than 
loan 3. So I wasnt persuaded that it was unreasonable for Lending Stream to 
arrange loan 4 for Mr Q, based on the proportionate checks that Lending Stream 
carried out. 
When Mr Q took loan 5, loan 3 remained open and it was taken a few days after hed 
repaid loan 4. Loan 5 was also Mr Qs fourth loan in just over five months, and was 
for more than loan 4. In addition, all of loans 1, 2 and 4 had been repaid sooner than 
required by the loan agreements. 
With that in mind, I thought it wouldve been reasonable for Lending Stream to carry 
out more detailed checks into Mr Qs finances. It shouldve carried out a 
comprehensive financial review for Mr Q, so that it had a full understanding of his 
financial position.
Lending Stream asked Mr Q about his income and outgoings and checked his credit 
file. Mr Qs credit file showed he had a number of short-term lending arrangements 
open with four other providers at the time he arranged loan 5 and loan 3 was also 
outstanding. Mr Q also had home credit arrangements with two different providers, 
and three unsecured loans. 
If Lending Stream had carried out a comprehensive review of Mr Qs finances, I 
thought it wouldve concluded that loan 5 was unlikely to be sustainable for Mr Q.
So I didnt think Lending Stream shouldve agreed loan 5.
The parties were in agreement that loans 6 and 7 shouldnt have been given because 
those loans were unlikely to be sustainable for Mr Q. 
The parties also agreed that in addition to a refund of interest for loan 7, all 
information about that loan should be removed from Mr Qs credit file. So I didnt  
need to make a finding about these loans, but I included what Lending Stream 
needed to do to put things right. 
I intended to uphold the complaint about loans 5, 6 and 7.
Mr Q and Lending Stream didnt make any further representations in response to my 
provisional decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In the absence of any further representations from the parties, I see no reason to depart 
from the position set out in my provisional decision.
Putting things right
I dont know whether Mr Q has been able to repay the outstanding balance on loans 6 and 7. 
Or if the debt has been sold to a third party. If the debt has been sold, Lending Stream, can if 
it wishes buy the debts back. However, if is unable to buy the debts back it needs to work 
with the third party debt owner to achieve the same results as below; 
refund all interest and charges Mr Q paid on loan 5;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
For loans 6 and 7 all the unpaid interest fees and charges need to be removed from 
the outstanding balances. Lending Stream then needs to apply all payments made 
to these loans by Mr Q as if they went towards the principal amount borrowed.  
If after doing this Mr Q has already paid enough to repay the principal amount 
borrowed than Lending Stream needs to refund any overpayments from the date 
they became due to the date of settlement. To this over payment Lending Stream 
needs to add 8% per annum simple interest.
If after carrying out the above for loans 6 and 7 an outstanding principal amount 
remains Lending Stream can use the refund due from loan 5 to offset any 
outstanding principal sum due. With any remaining balance paid directly to Mr Q. 
If however, even after the offset an outstanding principal amount remains Lending 
Stream and Mr Q should try and come to an agreeable and affordable repayment 
plan. But Id remind Lending Stream of its obligation to treat Mr Q fairly.
remove any negative information about loans 5 and 6 and from Mr Qs credit file;
the number of loans taken by loan 7 means any information recorded about that loan 
is adverse. So all entries about loan 7 should be removed from Mr Qs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. 
Lending Stream must give Mr Q a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
My final decision
My decision is that I partially uphold Mr Qs complaint. I direct Gain Credit LLC (trading as 
Lending Stream) to pay Mr Q compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Q to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 October 2020.
