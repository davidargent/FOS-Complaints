The complaint
Mrs M is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA havent upheld her Buyer dispute 
claim.
What happened
Mrs M ordered an item from a vendor and paid using her PayPal account. Mrs M decided 
that she didnt want the item, and so refused delivery of the item when a courier attempted to 
deliver it to her. Mrs M then asked PayPal to reimburse her the cost of the item under their 
Buyer Protection scheme. But PayPal declined Mrs Ms claim. Mrs M wasnt happy about 
this, so she raised a complaint.
PayPal responded to Mrs M and explained that theyd declined her claim because the 
vendor had provided proof that the item had been delivered. Mrs M wasnt happy with 
PayPals response, especially as shed refused delivery of the item when delivery had been 
attempted. So, she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But while they confirmed that Mrs M had 
refused delivery of the item, they noted that there was nothing to confirm that the item had 
ever been returned to the vendor. 
Given that the terms of PayPals Buyer Protection scheme included that items must be 
returned to the vendor for a claim to be successfully considered, our investigator didnt feel 
that PayPal had acted unfairly by declining Mrs Ms claim. Mrs M remained dissatisfied, so 
the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The terms of PayPals Buyer Protection scheme include that, for a claim to be potentially 
successful, the bought item must be returned to the seller. This seems reasonable to me, 
and I dont feel that it would be fair for a customer to expect PayPal to reimburse the cost of 
an item when that item hasnt been returned to the vendor from whom it was purchased. 
This is because if PayPal were to reimburse the cost of an item to a buyer without that item 
being returned to the vendor, then PayPal may also receive a claim from the seller, meaning 
that they may have to reimburse the cost of the item twice, and incur a loss accordingly.
However, in this instance, Mrs M didnt return the item to the seller, but instead refused 
delivery of the item  thus leaving it to the courier service charged with delivering the item to 
Mr M to decide how to handle the item shed refused to accept delivery of.
Mrs M has said that she was advised by PayPal in advance of the item being delivered to 
her to refuse deliver of the item and to then raise a reimbursement claim via PayPals Buyer 
Protection scheme. But PayPal have no record of this and dont agree that Mrs M was ever 
given such instructions or information by any of their employees. Additionally, Mrs M has 
also been unable to provide any information or evidence which would confirm that PayPal 
did tell her to refuse delivery of the item as she contends.
Furthermore, while tracking information for the item shows that it wasnt accepted by Mrs M, 
theres nothing to show that it was ever sent back to the seller such that PayPals 
requirement for the item to have been returned to the seller was fulfilled.
Accordingly, Im satisfied that Mrs Ms claim didnt meet PayPals requirements for it to be 
potentially successful  because the item has never been received back by the seller. And 
consequently, I dont feel that PayPal have acted unfairly towards Mr M by declining the 
Buyer Protection claim that she made.
Notably, when PayPal initially rejected Mrs Ms claim, they did so because theyd received 
information which showed that the item had been delivered to Mrs M. Its now understood 
that this wasnt correct, although I dont feel that PayPal acted unfairly by acting on that 
information in the first instance. 
Ultimately, I also feel that the outcome  the declining of Mrs Ms claim  was correct. And 
this is because while it wasnt the case that Mrs M took delivery of the item, it is the case that 
the item hasnt been returned to the seller. And in both scenarios, Im satisfied that its fair for 
PayPal to consider a claim made under their Buyer Protection scheme to not be successful.
Finally, I note that Mrs M is unhappy with the service shed received from PayPal in regard to 
how theyve handled her complaint. However, this service is only able to consider complaints 
about regulated activities. And how a business has handled a complaint  even a complaint 
about a regulated activity  isnt itself a regulated activity. This means that Im unable to 
consider this aspect of Mrs Ms complaint.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mrs M was wanting here, but it follows from all the above 
that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing PayPal to take any further action. I 
hope Mrs M will understand, given all Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2023.
