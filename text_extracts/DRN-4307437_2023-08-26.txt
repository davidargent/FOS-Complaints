The complaint
Mrs P complains that NewDay Ltd trading as John Lewis Credit Card refused her credit card 
account application.
What happened
Mrs P says NewDay took over the running of her credit card account and was invited to re-
apply for it. She says the application was refused and NewDay hasnt told her why. Mrs P 
says she feels like she has been discriminated against and would like the account to be 
opened.
NewDay says it considers a number of factors when considering an application and declined 
Mrs Ps application due to a default on her credit file. It accepts that Mrs P was kept waiting 
on a number of telephone calls and has offered £35 for that part of the complaint.
Mrs P brought her complaint to us, and our investigator upheld the complaint and 
recommended a total of £100 compensation. The investigator thought NewDay should have 
told Mrs P the reason for the account refusal and hadnt acted in line with the Lending 
Standards Board (LSB) guidance that a firm should provide the main reason for an account 
refusal.
NewDay doesnt accept that view and says it did provide reasons and its up to it to decide to  
whom it lends to.
I asked both sides for further information and in particular wanted both sides to provide 
information about when and if Mrs P asked for the exact reasons for the refusal. 
NewDay has provided the telephone calls but hasnt provided details of Mrs Ps initial 
complaint.
Mrs P has simply provided the final response letter from NewDay but hasnt provided her 
letter or e-mail of complaint.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and said I came to the provisional view that 
NewDay did provide reasonable information about the main reason for the account refusal, 
and I had not seen any evidence that Mrs P requested further information. I said I hoped 
both sides would provide the requested information about when and if further information 
was requested about the refusal decision.
I looked carefully at NewDays final response letter which I accepted was likely to be a 
generic account refusal letter. I appreciated that NewDay is likely to have to deal with 
numerous applications and that its entitled to make a commercial decision on how to 
respond to any rejected applications for accounts.
I explained that the LSB says that lenders should provide the high-level reasons on which it 
will decide to lend and provide the main reason for an account refusal. The final response 
letter from NewDay provided details of the factors NewDay considered but I thought also 
made clear that Mrs Ps credit file was considered. I was satisfied that NewDay did 
reasonably make clear that it considered factors on Mrs Ps credit file and that was the 
reason for the account refusal. So, I was satisfied that NewDay made reasonably clear that 
the main reason for the account refusal was due to information on the credit file.
I said I cant be sure, for the reasons I explained, that Mrs P then asked for details of the 
exact adverse information that was on her credit file. If she did then I would have expected 
NewDay to have provided that information and cant see why it would not do so. I made clear 
that I agreed with the investigator that NewDay was reasonably entitled to reject the 
application in circumstances where there was evidence of a default on Mrs Ps credit file.
I said the key issue here was if NewDay provided reasonable information to Mrs P that gave 
her the main reason for the account refusal. I thought the final response letter from NewDay 
told Mrs P the issue was with her credit file which I would have expected her to have been 
aware of. I made clear that at that stage I couldnt be sure Mrs P asked for further 
information. I said if either side provided further information on that point, I would of course 
consider it.
I appreciated the call wait times were not Mrs Ps main complaint point but thought the 
compensation offer of £35 was fair and reasonable. I didnt think the inconvenience of the 
call wait times justified further compensation or caused any significant impact. 
I made clear that I listened to the three calls between the parties but accepted the last call 
appears to have cut off. I couldnt fairly have expected NewDay to have treated that call as a 
request for the exact reasons for the account refusal in those circumstances, due to it ending 
before any agreement was reached.
I appreciated what the investigator said here and appreciated that of course there is an 
element of how to interpret what the LSB says. I accepted that NewDay says it provided the 
main reason namely an issue with the credit file whereas Mrs P said the main reason was 
the default. I looked at the letter and was satisfied that it reasonably explained the main 
reason but in more general terms than stating it was a default that caused the refusal. I 
thought in those circumstances it would be for the applicant to request further information or 
be aware of what may be contained on a credit file.
I made clear that I had not seen any evidence of discrimination as Mrs P suggested and was 
satisfied it was clear NewDay refused the account application due to a default on her credit 
file. I said it follows that I wouldnt be able to fairly direct NewDay open an account for Mrs P 
as she would like.
Mrs P has replied to my provisional view and says she called NewDay about her complaint. 
She disputes that she had a default on her credit file but accepts the compensation offer for 
the call problems.
NewDay has not replied
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the same overall view that I reached in my provisional decision and for the same reasons. I have not seen any evidence that Mrs P requested 
further information about the exact reasons for the account refusal. 
I appreciate Mrs P says the default is not correct, but I have looked at NewDays records and 
can see there is one registered. I think Mrs P could have provided evidence from her credit 
file is she disputes it, but I have not seen any evidence of a mistake.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the main part of this complaint and find NewDay Ltd 
trading as John Lewis Credit Card has made a fair and reasonable compensation offer of 
£35 for the telephone contact problem which I now direct it pays Mrs P if she accepts this 
decision.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 September 2023.
