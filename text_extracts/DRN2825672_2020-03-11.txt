K821x#15complaint
Mr M says Elevate Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny),  irresponsibly lent 
to him.
background
This complaint is about 33 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr M between  
September 2016 and May 2018. Mr Ms borrowing history is attached  as an appendix to this 
decision.
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mr Ms complaint and partially upheld it. She thought the 
loans from loan five onwards  shouldnt have been given. And that for loan five any adverse 
information about the borrowing should  be deleted from Mr Ms credit file. From  loan six 
onwards she concluded  that all information  about those loans was adverse so all the records  
should be deleted  from Mr Ms credit file. 
Sunny disagreed but it did offer to update its previous assessment of the complaint. It had 
originally offered to uphold the complaint from loan 17 onwards but after further review 
offered to uphold from loan 14 onwards.  
The offer was put to Mr M but he disagreed.
A second adjudicator looked  at the complaint. He agreed the complaint should be upheld 
from loan five but that all adverse information being  removed from Mr Ms credit file should 
occur from loan eight onwards. 
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me decide in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN28256722the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr M didnt  comment  on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to four shouldnt be upheld.  
Because of this, I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But the loans were  part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr M had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan five would most likely  have 
shown that Mr M:
was having  problems managing his personal finances. His borrowing behaviour was 
starting to show this. Loan one was repaid early, less than two weeks after it was 
taken which can be an indication that someone  is juggling their money which  might  
be because of borrowing  further to repay existing debt. 
From  loan two Mr M came back very shortly afterwards for further borrowing. Loan 
two was for the larger amount of £400 compared to the loan one borrowing of £250.  
He then returned again two days later for an additional £150  which  could be a further 
indication of erratic  money management  and that Mr M was struggling to manage his 
personal finances adequately. 
Mr M did the same for loans four and five. Borrowing £150 on 1 November and an 
additional £100 on 6 November. Any by loan five, loans two, three and four were  still 
outstanding so his combined monthly repayments were increasing.   
Ref: DRN28256723Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  like the second  adjudicator  I think  that 
this point was reached  by loan eight. I say this because:
at this point Sunny  ought to have  realised Mr M was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr M had taken  out seven  loans within four months. So Sunny  ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr M was having to borrow  further to cover  
the hole repaying  his previous loans  was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Ms 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ms first loan was for £250 and loan eight was for £500.  At  this point Sunny ought 
to have known  that Mr M was not likely borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall  in 
their income but to meet an ongoing need.  
From  loan eight onwards at various times Mr M was provided with a new loan within 
days of settling a previous  one. As examples, loan eight was taken  the same day as 
loans four, six and seven were repaid. Loan ten was taken on 10 March 2017  and 
repaid two days later and Mr M returned again for additional  borrowing on 14 March.  
Such a quick uptake should have flagged up to Sunny  that Mr M was remaining 
consistently in debt and not using short-term lending as it was intended  to be used.
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  33 was 
taken out 20 months after Mr Ms first. Mr M had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan eight 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loan five onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
Ref: DRN28256724putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  five to 33;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans five to seven  from Mr Ms credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan eight onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  eight to 33 should be removed 
from Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 April 2020.
