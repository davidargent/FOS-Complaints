The complaint
Mr B complains that the refund that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) offered to him 
for a mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) policy was insufficient. 
What happened
Mr B took out a loan in 2000, and a PPI policy was sold to him alongside this. He says he 
was unaware of the PPI. NatWest upheld his complaint and offered a refund of premiums 
plus interest. It later offered an additional £25 compensation because it took more than 28 
days to respond to his letter rejecting NatWest's offer. 
Mr B was unhappy with NatWest's offer. This was because he understood the total premium 
was much higher than the amount refunded. He also wanted to be compensated for his time 
at a rate of £300 per day. 
Our adjudicator didn't uphold the complaint. They thought NatWest's offer was fair and 
explained that the refund covered the actual premiums Mr B had paid. This was because Mr 
B paid back the loan after about four months rather than over the expected loan term. Mr B 
reiterated that he wanted to be compensated for his time dealing with the complaint, and he 
didn't think the £25 offered was sufficient to do this.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I've decided that NatWest's offer of settlement is fair and reasonable. I'll explain why. 
Mr B paid off his loan early, after making only four monthly repayments. So he didn't actually 
pay the full cost of the PPI policy, because a refund of premiums was deducted from the final 
loan settlement amount. 
NatWest's offer of settlement takes full account of the actual cost of the PPI to Mr B. And as 
such I think the refund covers everything he paid for the PPI, plus interest to compensate for 
the time he was without this money. This is in line with what I'd award if I upheld a complaint 
about the mis-sale of PPI. 
Mr B wants to receive additional compensation for his time spent making the complaint. It's 
very rare that I'd award compensation for this. And I see no reason to do so in this instance. 
NatWest took some time to respond to Mr B's letter rejecting its offer of settlement. But 
NatWest has acknowledged it missed its own service standards and offered a small amount 
of compensation to recognise this. 
I acknowledge that Mr B says he didn't receive NatWest's letter explaining the settlement, 
which may have resolved the complaint. But it was correctly addressed, so I don't think 
NatWest was at fault for this. My final decision
For the reasons I've explained, I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 April 2020.
