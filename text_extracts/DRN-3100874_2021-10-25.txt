The complaint
Mrs C is unhappy with how Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax have allocated a payment 
she made to her credit card. She believes she has incorrectly been charged interest on the 
outstanding balance.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
The credit card statement sets out how payments are allocated to the account
As Mrs C had an outstanding balance her payment was allocated to that amount 
instead of the spending she made on the card a few days earlier
There was a 0% interest free period for spending and Halifax correctly charged 
interest when that expired
Halifax has refunded one months interest payment and has waived a further month. I 
think this is fair and reasonable in the circumstances
I appreciate Mrs Cs intention was for the payment to be used against her spending, 
and it would have been a shock to realise interest was being charged. However, 
Halifax hasnt done anything wrong in allocating the payment the way it did.
For the reasons above, I do not uphold this complaint. 
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mrs Cs complaint against Bank of Scotland plc 
trading as Halifax.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2021.
