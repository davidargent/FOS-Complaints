K821x#15complaint
Mr D complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA caused unnecessary delays  when 
processing payments  to his account.
background
Mr D sells items online. He uses a PayPal account  to process payments. He told us he was 
advised by PayPal to change the type of account  he held with them because of the number 
of chargeback claims he received. Mr D started to encounter issues  with payments after 
changing the type of account he held. 
In November 2017 Mr D logged into his PayPal account and noticed  there  were  a number of 
payments pending.  
Mr D called PayPal two days  later and asked them what  was happening to these  payments. 
He says that PayPal  told him the transactions would be reviewed within  24 to 72 hours.       
Mr D felt very strongly that this shouldve been  resolved over the phone there and then. He 
felt it was unacceptable that he was told it could take 24 to 72 hours to resolve.
The pending  payments were then rejected by PayPal. Mr D says PayPal didnt tell him the 
payments were going to be rejected. PayPal have said emails were  sent to his email 
address about  the payments. 
Mr D wanted to know specifically why the payments were rejected. He explained  they 
werent fraudulent  and in his view shouldnt have been rejected. There were  some additional 
payments that had come into the account  and he was reassured  over the phone that these 
payments wouldnt  be delayed. He was told an exemption would be added  to the account. 
Four days later the second group  of payments were rejected. Mr D was frustrated because 
he believes  he was reassured  this wouldnt happen. 
Mr D said because of the time of year this issue had a significant impact on his earning and 
he lost out on sales because payments continued to be rejected. And he didnt understand 
why or how this was happening so he couldnt take any steps to rectify  the issue. Mr D 
complained to PayPal  and asked  them to reimburse  him for the loss of earning and consider 
compensation for the distress  and inconvenience  they had caused over the two and a half 
week period. 
In response to Mr Ds complaint PayPal sent him an email on 13 December 2017.  In this 
email they told Mr D to ask his customers to make the payments again.  
Mr D got in touch with our service  as he was unhappy with the response received from 
PayPal. 
PayPal investigated  the issues raised  by Mr D and issued a final response  on 
27 March 2018.  In this response they explained  that the payments Mr D had received were 
subject to a compliance  review. They  explained  within their terms and conditions  they 
reserve the right to review  or deny payments and they were satisfied that the actions taken 
on Mr Ds account were  in line with the agreed terms of use. 
Ref: DRN55072142They said there was an exemption referral  on Mr Ds account  but this exemption was not a 
guarantee. And it was still possible for compliance  reviews to be required on payments. They 
said they have  an email which was sent to Mr D explaining that the exemption wasnt 
guaranteed.   
PayPal said they sent payment notifications regarding the transactions  and they 
recommended Mr D contact his email provider  to discuss the fact he didnt receive these 
emails. 
PayPal apologised  and accept that Mr D was given  incorrect  information when he contacted 
them. To recognise the frustration caused to Mr D they offered to pay him £200 to put things 
right.  
Mr D didnt accept PayPals offer of £200.  Mr D brought his complaint to our service to 
review. He explained to us that he had lost out on a number of Christmas sales as a result of 
the issues he had with PayPal. Our investigator  looked into the case and he recommended  
that PayPal pay Mr D £500 because he felt there were shortcomings  in PayPals handling of 
the case.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ds complaint  for broadly the same  reasons as our investigator, as 
Ill explain. 
reviewing Mr Ds account
PayPal have legal and regulatory obligations  to observe whilst administering  accounts. 
PayPal are, of course, expected to adopt a set of procedures for administrating accounts. 
Whilst I cant specify what these procedures should be, I can look into whether PayPal did 
follow their procedures. 
Ive looked into what happened in this case and the timeline of events. Im satisfied that 
PayPal are entitled to review Mr Ds account and any payments  coming  in or out of that 
account in line with their legal  and regulatory obligations. However  part of my role is to 
ensure that Mr D was treated fairly during this process and that PayPal didnt cause any 
unnecessary delays. 
When Mr D called PayPal he was reassured that the issue would be resolved  within  24 to 72 
hours. Mr D firmly believed that the issues that arose were an error and that PayPal 
shouldve been  in a position  to resolve the issue over the phone. It wasnt  until March 2018 
that PayPal issued a final response  letter and explained that payments he received were  
subject to a compliance  review. PayPal explained:
From time to time,  we need to take a little longer to review transactions to ensure that 
the payments meet our regulatory requirements. While I appreciate  your concerns, 
PayPal reserves the right to review or deny  any payment. Therefore,  I am satisfied all 
actions taken in this case were in line with our agreed  terms of use.
Ref: DRN55072143This is the first point Mr D was told the issues on his account  where  linked to PayPals 
regulatory requirements. This was four months  after the initial  payment was reviewed. 
During the numerous calls Mr D had with PayPal  he was convinced that they made an error 
in reviewing the payments. Although I accept in this case  PayPal were entitled to review the 
payments. I havent seen  sufficient evidence to show they followed their procedures  when 
reviewing the payments.  Which means that I cannot  be satisfied that they didnt  cause any 
unnecessary delays in line with their policies and procedures. However, it appears from the 
records that PayPal  acted quickly in reviewing the payments and making decisions within 
two and a half weeks. So, I dont think there  were  any unnecessary delays. Compliance 
reviews do take a number  of weeks and the timescales taken by PayPal are in line with what 
Id expect to see. 
customer service
Mr D had to call PayPal on a number  of occasions  to get an update on his account.  He was 
reassured that the payments would  be reviewed within 24 to 72 hours. However  this was 
inaccurate and raised Mr Ds expectations. When Mr D sent a complaint  by email, PayPal 
responded by saying:
Thank you for contacting  PayPal. I apologize  for any inconvenience  this may have caused. 
Please feel free to have your customers make the payment  again.
This again appears to suggest  there was an issue with PayPals systems and the customers  
simply had to make the payment again.  For this reason Mr D has asked for PayPal to 
consider the losses  to his business  during this time. He says one of his customers had their 
payment rejected twice and because of this they would not attempt another  payment. 
PayPals staff shouldve  been in a position to explain that PayPal were carrying out 
compliance checks in line with their legal and regulatory obligations. Mr D wouldve been in a 
better position to explain  to his buyers what was happening with his account. 
PayPal accept that they didnt provide Mr D with the level of service they should have. And 
they offered  him £200 to recognise the impact the issue had on him. I have considered  
everything that happened and I agree with the investigator that the compensation should be 
increased to £500.  This is to recognise  that PayPal  had a number of opportunities to explain 
to Mr D why they were carrying out the review. PayPal raised  Mr Ds expectations of when 
the review would be completed  by and this meant that Mr D was more upset during the calls 
he had with PayPal  and was left feeling  very frustrated  by the whole process.  
I appreciate that Mr D wants to be compensated for the payments which were rejected to his 
account as he lost sales. Im not in a position  to say that PayPal should refund Mr D the 
additional payments.  Ive listened to the calls Mr D had with PayPal and he does explain he 
didnt send the items on. Later on in calls he said he did send items. But PayPal staff did 
explain that Mr D should always check his account  before  sending  items. Mr D does 
acknowledge that his account  said payments were  pending. Even if Mr D did send the items  
I would find it difficult to say that PayPal are responsible for this because Mr D should check  
his account before sending items  out. 
In any case money in an account is not always readily available  following compliance 
reviews PayPal rejected  a number of payments in line with their legal and regulatory  
obligations. So, I cannot say that they have made an error in rejected these payments. 
Ref: DRN55072144I appreciate this issue has had an impact  on Mr D and caused him trouble and upset. 
So, taking everything  into account, I agree with the investigator that PayPal  should  pay Mr D 
£500 for the trouble and upset caused.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is I uphold Mr Ds complaint against  PayPal 
Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA. I require PayPal to pay Mr D £500.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 August 2019.
