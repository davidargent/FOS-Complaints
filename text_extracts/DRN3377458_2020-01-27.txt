K820x#14complaint
Ms O complains, through  her representative,  that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has 
unfairly debited  her account  so she now owes it money.
background
Ms O sold a valuable item through  an online  market.  The buyer raised a complaint with the 
online market which was resolved in Ms Os favour.  But the buyer  then raised a dispute with 
PayPal saying the item wasnt as described. But she said the online market  told her she 
didnt need to take any further action. So she didnt think she had to do anything. She then 
discovered PayPal  had closed the account and refunded  the buyer Â£501 without having the 
item returned to her.
PayPal said Ms Os buyer contacted it on 27 February 2019  saying  the item was 
significantly  not as described. It said it sent her five emails asking her for information so it 
could review the matter.  It said these  emails made  it clear that it needed a response from Ms 
O and failure to do so would result in the payment being  reversed  to the buyer.  She didnt 
reply within the timescale. So it closed the case and refunded  her buyer. It said its a 
separate entity to the online market  so its not able to comment  on any of Ms Os dealings 
with that organisation. 
Our investigator could  understand  what a frustrating time this had been  for Ms O. But she 
explained she could  only look at the complaint against PayPal to see if itd done anything  
wrong. She couldnt  take into account the action by the online market. She thought that the 
emails PayPal sent to Ms O made  it clear  what she needed to do. PayPal had acted in line 
with its user agreement and followed its normal procedure. So she didnt think PayPal had 
done anything  wrong.
Ms O wasnt  happy with this but didnt give any further reasons.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
conclusion as our investigator  for very similar reasons. And theres little I can add.
When PayPal contacted Ms O it told her that if the dispute was found in favour of the buyer it 
couldnt guarantee the return of the item.  And it asked her to provide any information that 
would help it with its investigation. It reminded her that if she didnt  reply  by a certain date 
the case would be closed and decided in the buyers  favour.
So although,  Ms O didnt think she needed to do anything further after speaking  to the online 
market, I think  the information PayPal sent her on several occasions shouldve  alerted her to 
the fact that she needed to respond  to PayPal and send it some information. And I think 
PayPal made it clear what would happen if she didnt  do that. As our investigator said, 
PayPal acted in line with its user agreement and followed  its normal procedure.  So although 
I know Ms O will be disappointed with my decision,  I cant find PayPal was at fault when it 
refunded the buyer without asking for the item to be returned.
