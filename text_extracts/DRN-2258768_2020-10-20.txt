The complaint
Mr C (by the way of a representative) has complained that he was on a very low wage and
he could not afford his loan repayments to S.D.Taylor Limited (trading as LAH).
What happened
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be upheld in part. LAH disagreed with the 
adjudicators opinion. The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Mr Cs complaint should be upheld in part. A 
copy of the background to the complaint and my provisional findings follow this and form part 
of this final decision:
What I said in my provisional decision:
Mr C took 10 home credit loans from LAH between March 2004 and December 2007. A

It seems that Mr C had three separate agreements with LAH and the number under the
agreement denotes the order of the loans.
Initially, one of an adjudicators looked at the case as LAH objected to us looking at any of
Mr Cs loans as they were taken out more than six years before he complained. The
adjudicator reviewed the information provided by Mr C and the lender. But she didnt think
there was any information suggesting Mr C was aware, or should have been aware that he
had a reason to complain about the lending at the time of the loans, or more than three
years before he complained.
LAH disagreed with the adjudicators opinion that we could consider Mr Cs loans. 
Subsequently, the case was looked into by another ombudsman who decided that we could
consider Mr Cs loans.
One of our adjudicator's then considered the merits of Mr Cs case. The adjudicator
explained why we couldnt consider any loans taken out before 6 April 2007. As a result, she
investigated Mr Cs re-loans taken out on 20 June 2007 (loan 9) and 19 December 2007
(loan 10).
The adjudicator thought that by loan 9, Mr Cs borrowing history suggested he had become
persistently reliant on LAHs lending, and the borrowing had become unsustainable for Mr C.
So, she upheld the complaint for loans 9 and 10.
It appears that Mr C agreed with our adjudicators opinion. LAH disagreed and provided the
following points:
These loans were taken over 12 years ago, with no supporting documentation from
either party to support the claim.
The decision based solely on a pattern of relending with nothing to support the
circumstances of the lending or borrowing.
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account the law, any
relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice at the time the loan was provided.
Having carefully thought about everything Ive been provided with, Im intending to uphold
Mr Cs complaint. I will explain my reasons in more detail below.
This Service is not able to consider any lending before 6 April 2007 (loans 1 to 8). This is
because LAH didnt come under our remit until this date. Whilst I am unable to look into the
merits of the first eight loans, I will still take them into consideration when looking at Mr Cs
overall borrowing history. So to be clear, this decision will only focus on Mr Cs re-loans
taken out on 20 June 2007 (loan 9) and 19 December 2007 (loan 10).
To begin with, due to the time these loans were taken out, LAH is, understandably, unable to
provide information showing what affordability checks were completed at the time of each
loan application. LAH has given us a transaction history showing how Mr C ran each of his
loans. It appears that Mr C was given loans which he could repay in weekly instalments via
cash. And he was able to have up to two loans running alongside each other at any given
time.
At the time LAH provided the loans to Mr C, it was licensed by the Office of Fair Trading
(OFT). LAH had to act responsibly but I acknowledge that in 2004 (which is the first evidence
of Mr Cs borrowing) there wasnt too much by way of guidance to those businesses as to
what that meant in practice.
Broader good practice dictated that responsible lenders should ensure that all loanapplications went through sound and proper credit assessments and that the interests of the
borrowers should be taken into full account. But before January 2008 when the OFT issued
Consumer Credit Licensing  General Guidance for Licensees and Applicants on Fitness
and Requirements, direction from the regulator as to its expectations with regards to
responsible lending hadnt been comprehensive.
The Finance & Leasing Association (FLA) issued the Lending Code guidance from 1 June
2006. And this guidance was in place at the time Mr C took out his last two loans. Section
1C.1 of the Lending Code explains responsible lending, and that all loan applications should
go through a sound and proper assessment. The Lending Code further says an assessment
may look at a combination of the following:
a customers credit commitments;
a customers ability to repay the loan;
how a customer has handled their financial affairs in the past;
information from credit reference agencies;
the results of credit assessment techniques, for example, credit-scoring;
a customers income;
The Lending Code goes on to say we may also consider factors which may show a high risk
of experiencing financial difficulty which include:
having four or more credit commitments;
spending more than 25% of gross income (before deductions) on consumer credit;
and
spending more than 50% of gross income on consumer credit and mortgages.
There are also other consumer factors which could be considered by lenders. But I think
what is clear, is that a lender needed to lend responsibly. In practice this means that it
should have carried out reasonable checks to understand whether Mr C could repay his
loans in a sustainable manner.
Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less thorough  in terms of
how much information it gathers and what it does to verify that information  in the early
stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, the consumers income was low or
the amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the
risk of it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So, wed
expect a lender to be able to show that it hasnt continued to provide these loans to a
customer irresponsibly.
As Ive explained, due to the time these loans were taken out, LAH is unable to provide
information showing what affordability checks were completed at the time of each loan
application. And we have no information from Mr C showing what his circumstances were
likely to have been at the time of these loans.
But even so, I think the number of loans Mr C had borrowed by loan 9, would have
warranted comprehensive checks at the time he took out this loan. I say this because this
was Mr Cs ninth loan in just over three years with no breaks in between loans. This meant
Mr C was continuously indebted to the lender for all this time, even though these loans were
not designed for extended use.
I can see the amounts Mr C borrowed remained fairly consistent. As he kept re-borrowingthe same amounts, this suggests to me that he was continuously borrowing to cover a hole
in his finances as a result of the payments. Or its possible that Mr C had other credit
commitments elsewhere, and his need to keep taking out credit was a result of a deeper
worsening financial position.
Although I am unable to see what checks LAH completed, this doesnt mean that Im unable
to consider other information about Mr Cs circumstances at the time. And whether, LAH
would or should have reasonably known this.
At the time Mr C took out his ninth loan, this was his largest loan to date. And he was still
repaying loan 8. This meant Mr Cs combined repayments for both loans totalled £45 a week
(around £195 a month). In addition to this, Mr C had two home credit loans with another
lender. These loans were for £1,200 and £300, with the combined repayments being £45 a
week. So, in total, this meant Mr C was repaying £90 per week for four home credit loans
and the monthly repayments wouldve been around £390. And as per the Lending Code,
I think this showed that there was a high risk of Mr C experiencing financial difficulties.
Whilst we have no information regarding Mr Cs income and what percentage of his income
was being used to finance the repayments for his loans, I can see that Mr C had a minimum
of four loans at the time of his ninth application. And I think its reasonable to say that had
LAH completed a credit check (which it may have done) or have asked for information in
order to verify his financial circumstances. I think its more likely than not that LAH would
have found out this information. And that further lending was detrimental to Mr Cs financial
position. And I think this is further shown by Mr Cs need to continue borrowing from the
lender shortly after he took out loan 9.
So, I think LAH were wrong to approve loans 9 and 10.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C didnt raise any new points after receiving my provisional decision. 
LAH is keen to understand the relevance I have placed on the FLAs Lending Code in my 
provisional decision. LAH says it has never been a member of the association, so it has 
queried why it would follow the Lending Code 2006 guidelines.
The code outlined a long list of things a business might look at when doing when carrying 
out an assessment to lend money. Some of these included assessing a consumers ability to 
repay the loan, information with credit reference agencies, and how a consumer had handled 
their financial affairs in the past.
I accept that LAH may not have been a member of the FLA. But the code represented what 
was considered good industry practice at the times these loans were given, and this is 
something this service is able to take into account when deciding whether something has 
gone wrong. 
So, Ive reached the same conclusions as I reached in the provisional decisions. So, for the 
same reasons I still think LAH was wrong to have provided loans 9 and 10. 
Putting things right
Refund all interest, fees and charges for the loans taken on 20 June 2007 (loan 9)and 19 December 2007 (loan 10).
add 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr C, calculated from
the date Mr C originally made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
Remove any adverse information about loan 9 and loan 10 from Mr Cs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires you to deduct tax from this interest. LAH should give
Mr C a certificate showing how much tax is deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in my provisional decision I uphold Mr Cs 
complaint, in part.
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 November 2020.
