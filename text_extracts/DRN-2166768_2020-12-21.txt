The complaint
Mr A complains that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Audi Financial 
Services, wont refund to him the money that he paid for a car that was supplied to him 
under a hire purchase agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mr A under a hire purchase agreement with Audi Financial 
Services that he electronically signed in June 2019;
he complained to the dealer about some issues with the car and it agreed to replace 
the car  Audi Financial Services settled the hire purchase agreement at no cost to 
Mr A and he entered into a hire purchase agreement for the replacement car that he 
electronically signed in January 2019;
Mr A says that he was expecting a refund of the payments that hed made under the 
original agreement and but, when Audi Financial Services said that it wouldnt be 
refunding those payments to him, he made a direct debit indemnity claim for a total of 
£3,331.20;
he received an arrears notice from Audi Financial Services about that amount and 
complained to this service;
his complaint was considered by two of our investigators  neither of whom thought 
that it should be upheld as Mr A had been able to use the original car (or courtesy 
cars provided by the dealer) for six months and there was no evidence to show that 
Mr A had been told that the payments would be refunded to him;
Mr A has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman but he says 
that he's prepared to contribute £1,650 to resolve this issue  but that hasnt been 
accepted by Audi Financial Services;
theres no dispute that there were faults with the original car and the dealer agreed to 
replace it  Audi Financial Services says that it and the manufacturer each 
contributed £3,268.73 so that the agreement could be settled at no further cost to 
Mr A and he entered into a new agreement;
Mr A was able to use the car, or courtesy cars provide by the dealer, until the car 
was replaced and I consider that replacing the car was a fair and reasonable 
response to the issues that Mr A had with that car  Ive seen no evidence to show 
that Audi Financial Services, or the dealer, agreed that it would refund the monthly 
payments that hed made under the agreement and I consider that its fair and 
reasonable for Audi Financial Services to keep those amounts as payment for the 
use that he had from that car;
Mr A entered into the second hire purchase agreement in January 2020 and it set out 
the basis on which the replacement car was being supplied to him  he agreed to 
make 48 monthly payments of £555.20 and a final payment of £1,790  theres no 
reference in that agreement to a refund of the monthly payments that hed made 
under the first agreement;
Mr A says that the dealer agreed to refund those payments to him but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it did so  and if such a refund 
had been agreed, I consider it to be reasonable to expect that the refund would be 
referred to in the second agreement or in other documents agreed at that time; 
I sympathise with Mr A for the frustration that he clearly feels but Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that Audi Financial Services has acted 
incorrectly in not refunding the monthly payments to him; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Audi Financial Services to refund to Mr A any of the monthly payments that he made 
under the first agreement, to waive or reduce the outstanding amount that he owes to 
it, to accept his offer of £1,650 or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 January 2021.
