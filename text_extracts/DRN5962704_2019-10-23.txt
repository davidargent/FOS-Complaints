K820x#14Complaint
Mr D complains that errors by Shop Direct Finance Company Limited led to him being 
overcharged. 
Background
Mr D has an account with Shop Direct that was opened in May 2016. On 13 October 2017 
Mr D ordered some computer parts for £799.99  under reference LU3LN15. Mr D opted for 
the buy now pay later (BNPL) option. But on 16 October 2017  the order  was cancelled  
because the parts werent available. On the same day, Shop Direct credited Mr Ds account 
with two lots of £799.99. 
On 16 October 2017 Mr D ordered  a different computer part for £799.99 under reference 
LKGE413 and, again, opted for the BNPL arrangement. 
In October  2018 Mr D returned the part hed bought under reference LKGE413 as it was 
faulty. Shop Direct refunded the £799.99 Mr D paid. But when looking at his account Shop 
Direct says it noticed it had made  two credits  of £799.99 for LU3LN15.  On 27 October  2018  
Mr Ds account was debited for £799.99.  
On 1 November  2018 Shop Direct refunded  £355.15  of interest the account  was charged in 
relation to LKGE413. 
Mr D complained as he felt hed been  overcharged.  Shop Direct  didnt agree it had 
overcharged Mr D but it did accept there were delays and mistakes  with his account.  Shop 
Direct says it paid Mr D £205  to resolve  his complaint. 
Mr D referred  his complaint to our service and an investigator looked  at what  had happened.  
She said Shop Direct had dealt  with the complaint fairly and didnt  ask it to do anything else.  
Mr D asked to appeal  so his case has been  passed  to me to make  a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Mr D is concerned hes been overcharged. The way his account has 
been charged and credited is confusing and Shop Direct has clearly made some errors. But 
one of our key focuses  as a service is whether a consumer has lost out financially due to 
errors made by a business. So before I look at the way Shop  Direct handled Mr Ds account, 
Im going  to talk about whether theres been a loss. 
I know Mr D is concerned  hes been  overcharged.  As Ive said above,  the way the 
transactions have  been processed by Shop  Direct isnt easy to follow.  However, I havent 
found that Mr Ds been  overcharged  or that hes paid too much.  Ive looked at all the 
available information  and I think Shop Direct  has correctly reconciled Mr Ds account. Ill 
explain why. 
LU3LN15 was cancelled  on 16 October 2017 but the systems information Ive seen shows 
Shop Direct credited  the payment back to the account twice. That meant Mr Ds outstanding 
balance was lower  than it should  have  been.  When Mr D returned the part he bought  under 
Ref: DRN59627042reference LKGE413 in October 2018 Shop  Direct realised it had made a mistake  and 
debited Mr Ds account again. Whilst I agree there  were mistakes in the way Shop  Direct 
applied payments and refunds to Mr Ds account,  I havent found hes been overcharged or 
that hes lost out financially.  
On 1 November  2018 Shop Direct refunded  £355.15  of interest it had applied  in respect of 
LKGE413 under the BNPL terms which means he didnt  incur any costs  in relation to that 
purchase. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Mr D but looking at all the transactions raised, Im satisfied  Shop  
Direct has returned the account to the correct position and I havent found any evidence of a 
financial loss. 
There is some dispute over the level of compensation paid in this case.  Mr D says Shop 
Direct paid him £50 but it says its paid £205.  The investigator recently asked Shop Direct to 
provide evidence of the compensation its paid Mr D. The evidence shows Shop Direct 
credited Mr Ds account with £75 on 12 October 2018 followed by another credit of £30 on 
22 January 2019.  In addition, Shop Direct  has provided evidence to show  it sent Mr D two 
£50 cheques in March 2019,  totalling  £100, and both were cashed. Taken together,  Im 
satisfied Shop Direct has paid Mr D £205.  
Ive thought about whether £205  fairly  reflects the impact of Shop Directs mistakes on Mr D. 
I can see hes spent time dealing with the issues and trying to get to the bottom of things. 
But I think the £205 Shop Direct  has paid does fairly  reflect  what  happened and the trouble 
and upset its caused Mr D. 
As I havent  found  that Mr D has lost out financially and I think Shop Directs dealt with his 
complaint fairly, Im not telling it to take any further action to resolve this complaint. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 November  2019.
