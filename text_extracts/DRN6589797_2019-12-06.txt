K820x#14complaint
Mr C has complained that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA wouldnt refund a payment it 
made on his behalf  for items he didnt receive.
background
In April 2018 Mr C purchased a number of items  which  he paid for through  PayPal. He says 
the seller sent him some of the items hed ordered but one of them  was incorrect.  He made  a 
buyer dispute claim with PayPal and reached  an agreement with the seller  who gave him a 
partial refund.  PayPal  then closed the claim on the basis it had been resolved.
In May 2018  the seller told Mr C they were  insolvent  and had ceased trading. Mr C asked 
PayPal to refund the remainder of the payment it had made to the seller. PayPal said it 
couldnt reopen Mr Cs claim. He then made  a claim for a chargeback with his card provider 
and received a refund  for the cost of the items he hadnt received from the seller.
Mr C wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred his complaint to this service.
our initial conclusions
Our investigator didnt  recommend the complaint should be upheld. They didnt think 
PayPals terms and conditions allowed  it to reopen Mr Cs claim.  Also,  Mr C had successfully 
recovered his money  so he hadnt  lost out financially.
Mr C didnt accept our investigators recommendation. He says PayPal didnt  fulfil its 
advertised promises with regard to buyer purchases.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen PayPals  terms and conditions which dont allow  it to reopen buyer dispute claims 
that have been resolved. Im aware  Mr C is unhappy about this. But he was able to make  a 
chargeback claim and he received a refund of the amount hed paid for the items  he didnt 
receive. I dont think the chargeback would have  caused Mr C significantly more  trouble and 
upset than he would have suffered if PayPal had reopened his claim.
In the circumstances Im not persuaded I could reasonably require PayPal to pay any 
compensation to Mr C for not reopening his claim and I dont uphold his complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given my final decision is I dont uphold  this complaint. I make  no award 
against PayPal  Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 January 2020.
