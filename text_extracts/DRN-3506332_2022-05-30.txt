The complaint
Miss A complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (trading as Barclaycard) did not refund 
several payments she made to a company she thought was a legitimate investments trading 
company (HBC).
What happened
In short, Miss A says she made several international payments to what she thought was her 
trading account with HBC.  These payments were made using Miss As Barclaycard Visa 
credit card.  At the time, Miss A says she believed HBC were a legitimate investments 
trading company.  However, she lost all her money and discovered HBC were operating a 
scam.
Miss A asked Barclaycard to recover her money.  As this did not happen, she raised a 
complaint which she also referred to this service.
One of our investigators considered the complaint and did not uphold it.  He held that Miss A 
did not have any chargeback or section 75 rights.  He also did not think the payments 
concerned would have appeared unusual or suspicious to Barclaycard considering Miss As 
normal account and payment activity.  So, he thought Barclaycard could not have been 
reasonably expected to prevent these payments.  For these reasons, he did not ask 
Barclaycard to refund Miss A her money.
Miss A did not accept the investigators findings.
As an agreement could not be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to make a 
decision.
It is unclear what payments Miss A is actually disputing.  This is something Barclaycard has 
also had difficulty with.  Therefore, I have relied on the transactions the investigator set out in 
his findings, which neither Miss A nor Barclaycard appear to dispute.
The investigator highlighted the following transactions in his assessment:

On 6 May 2022, I issued a provisional decision not upholding this complaint.  For 
completeness, I repeat my provisional findings below:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome the investigator reached.  However, I do so for 
different reasons.  I will explain why below.
Chargeback
First, I will consider whether Barclaycard acted fairly in how it dealt with Miss As request for 
a refund of the card payments in question.Chargeback is an entirely voluntary scheme, which means banks are under no formal 
obligation to raise a chargeback claim.  The scheme operator can ultimately arbitrate on a 
dispute between the merchant and customer if it cannot be resolved between them.  
However, such an arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme  so there are limited 
grounds on which a chargeback can succeed.  My role is to determine whether the regulated 
card issuer (in this case, Barclaycard) acted fairly and reasonably in its decision not to 
pursue a chargeback on behalf of its cardholder (in this case, Miss A).
Based on the evidence before me, it appears that some of the merchants Miss A made her 
card payments to were cryptocurrency exchanges.  The service they provided Miss A was 
purchasing cryptocurrency.  Because of this, if Barclaycard had pursued a chargeback claim 
 irrespective of whether it received Miss As submissions or not  I am persuaded it would 
have likely been unsuccessful.  I say this because the alleged scammer (in this case, HBC) 
was not a party to the card payments, so Miss A could not have a valid claim against the 
legitimate merchants she paid.  These companies provided the services as intended, which 
was to purchase cryptocurrency.  The subsequent transfer to a wallet would not give rise to 
a valid chargeback claim. 
It follows then that Barclaycard acted fairly and reasonably by not pursuing a chargeback on 
Miss As behalf, as the merchants concerned would have likely been able to defend the 
claim successfully.  
Even if some of the merchants in this case did not provide a cryptocurrency service, there is 
nothing significantly unusual about Miss As card payments which, to my mind, would have 
warranted Barclaycard to intervene or automatically block them. 
I can see that Barclaycard raised chargeback claims regarding some of Miss As payments; 
whereby some were defended.  I do not think raising a chargeback was something that 
Barclaycard was obliged to do or continue pursing.  I say this because in addition to the 
reasons I set out above, I cannot see that Miss A had the necessary evidence required 
under the Visa scheme to raise a successful chargeback.
Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974
I have also considered whether Miss As payments attracted any section 75 rights.  As a 
starting point, I think it would be helpful if I set out what the section says:
75(1) If the debtor under a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement falling within section 12(b) or 
(c) has, in relation to a transaction financed by the agreement, any claim against the supplier 
in respect of a misrepresentation or breach of contract, he shall have a like claim against the 
creditor, who, with the supplier, shall accordingly be jointly and severally liable to the debtor 
 (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to a claim
a) under a non-commercial agreement, 
b) so far as the claim relates to any single item to which the supplier has attached a 
cash price not exceeding £100 or more than £30,000
So, the first requirement is that there is a debtor-creditor-supplier (DCS) agreement falling 
under section 12(b) or 12(c).  
In this case, Miss A is the debtor, Barclaycard the creditor and HBC the supplier.  This 
relationship is referred to as a DCS chain and needs to exist  unbroken  for section 75 
rights to apply.  However, Miss As payments were not made directly to HBC, but instead to 
various merchants (set out above).  This amounts to a break in the DCS chain.I have not seen any persuasive evidence showing, for example, that HBC had an 
agreement with the merchants concerned about the payments Miss A made.
Therefore, I am satisfied that Barclaycard was not liable to Miss A under section 75 
regarding her payments.
As I mentioned above in the Chargeback section of this decision, I would not have 
expected Barclaycard to have flagged the payments.  I say this because they were not 
significantly unusual.  Further, from what I can see, there are no published warnings 
about any of the merchants concerned.
Responses to my provisional decision
Miss A responded to say she respected my findings; and Barclaycard said it was happy with 
them.
What I have decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given the above  I see no reason to depart from my provisional findings.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 June 2022.
