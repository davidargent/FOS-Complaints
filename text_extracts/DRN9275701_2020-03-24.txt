Our adjudicator uphel d Miss Ds complaint and thoug ht the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shoul dnt have been given because proportionate checks would have shown Miss D was 
struggling to manage her money . Sunny disagreed and offered to uphol d loan 6. Miss D 
rejected Sunny s offer.
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive consi dered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonab le in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints abou t short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
indus try practice - on our website.
Sunny  needed  to take reasonab le steps to ensu re that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means  that it shou ld have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss D could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner . These  checks could consi der a number of different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consu mers 
income and expendi ture. In the early stages of a lending relationshi p, I think less thorough 
chec ks might be reasona ble and proportionate.

Ref: DRN9275701But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny shou ld fairly and reasonabl y have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consum er. These factors include:
the lower a consu mers incom e (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repay ments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of incom e);
the greater the number and frequency of loans , and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinanci ng may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becom ing, 
unsust ainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsus tainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss D could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pound s and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consum er could sustainably make their repay ments. But it doesn t automatically follow this is 
the case. This is beca use the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer shoul d be able to make repay ments on time, while meeting
other reasonabl e commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repay ments. 
And it follows that a lender shoul d realise, or it ought fairly and reasonabl y to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repay ments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repay ments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully consi dered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Ds complaint. Having done so, Im partially uphol ding the 
complaint. Ill explain why.
Our adjudicator thought Sunny had carried out proportionate chec ks for loans 1 to 3. Miss D 
didnt respond  to the view. As there is no longer a dispute about these loans, I wont be 
making any further findings on them.
Sunny  says it carried out chec ks before it lent loan 4 to Miss D and the results of these 
chec ks didnt raise any concer ns. But as this was Miss Ds fourth loan in less than three 
weeks, I think Sunny  shoul d have been  looking to build a clearer picture about Miss Ds 
financ es before lending her this loan.
Had Sunny carried out proportionate chec ks before lending loan 4, its likely to have found 
that Miss D was borrowing from other short-term lender s as well as having out-standing 
loans  with Sunny itself. The repay ments for these loans would have been  increasing her 
monthly outgoings by over £300. This behav iour was most likely an indication she was in a 
cycle of debt and the further borrowing was to cover the hole that repay ing her previous 
loans  were leaving in her finance s.
So, Im also uphol ding the complaint about loans 4 to 7 and Sunny shoul d put things right.
Ref: DRN9275701putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest and charges Miss D paid on loans 4 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about  loans 4 to 7 from Miss Ds credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Miss D a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially uphol ding Miss Ds complaint. Elevate Credit
International Limited should put things right as set out abov e.
Under the rules of the Financ ial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 April 2020.
