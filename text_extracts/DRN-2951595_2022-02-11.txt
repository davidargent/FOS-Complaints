Complaint
Mr A is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) wont pay him a refund 
after he used its service to buy an item online that wasnt delivered. 
Background
In January 2021, Mr A bought an electric car jack online for just under Â£30. He paid for it 
using his PayPal account. The seller sent the item with Royal Mail and it was assigned a 
tracking number.
According to the information recorded against that tracking number, the item was delivered 
from a delivery office in Mr As local area on 16 January 2021. Mr A says that it wasnt 
received and thinks that hes been the victim of a scam. He complained to PayPal about 
what had happened. PayPal contacted the seller who responded to provide the tracking 
information on the Royal Mail website showing that the package had been delivered. PayPal 
declined to pay him a refund under the terms and conditions of his account.
Mr A was unhappy with the response he received from PayPal and so he referred a 
complaint to this service. It was looked at by an Investigator who didnt uphold it. The 
Investigator found it reasonable for PayPal to accept the evidence of a successful delivery 
on the Royal Mail website and noted that the terms and conditions of his account meant it 
wasnt required to pay him a refund. She encouraged Mr A to raise his concerns about a lost 
parcel with Royal Mail. Mr A disagreed with the view of the Investigator and claimed that 
hed been a victim of racial discrimination at the hands of PayPal.
I understand he raised a query with Royal Mail around the same time he made a complaint 
to PayPal. However, he didnt provide the correct tracking number for the package in his 
email and so, as I understand it, Royal Mail didnt investigate further. 
Because Mr A disagreed with the Investigators opinion, the complaint has been passed to 
me to consider and issue a final decision.
Findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same overall conclusions as the investigator and for 
broadly the same reasons. The terms and conditions of Mr As PayPal account say that a 
customer wont be entitled to refund where a seller is able to provide proof of delivery.
Mr A says that the parcel wasnt delivered to him. I dont doubt or disbelieve him when he 
says that, and I cant know for certain what happened to the package. However, I dont find it 
unreasonable for PayPal to rely on the evidence logged against the delivery tracking number 
on Royal Mails website. This shows that the parcel was recorded as delivered and that the 
individual who carried out the delivery was working from a delivery office very close to Mr As 
home. If the parcel wasnt correctly delivered to him, its possible that there was a problem 
outside of the control of the sender of the goods and PayPal  for example, an error on the 
part of Royal Mail. 
I understand Mr A contacted Royal Mail to query this but didnt pursue his complaint further 
and it is now outside of its time limits for consideration. Mr A has also claimed that PayPal 
has discriminated against him on the basis of race, but Ive found no evidence to support 
that allegation. 
Final decision
I sympathise with the position that Mr A has found himself in here, but Im not persuaded 
PayPal has acted unreasonably or treated him unfairly and so I dont uphold his complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 March 2022.
