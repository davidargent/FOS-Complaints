The complaint
Miss M complains that her account with Telefonica UK Limited was passed to a debt 
collection agency.  
What happened
 I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. Briefly, I said that although Telefonica 
could have been clearer in the information it provided to Miss M about her account and 
should pay compensation for trouble and upset because of the poor advice, I didnt think the 
debt should be written off because Miss M had missed payments on her account. 
I invited Miss M and Telefonica to let me have any further evidence of arguments they 
wished to make before I finally determined the matter.
Miss M said she agreed with the compensation I had awarded but wanted the debt to be 
written off and for it to show as settled on her credit file. 
Telefonica replied and said it agreed with my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Ive thought about whether the debt should be written off and Miss Ms credit file amended 
as per her request. However, and as I said in my provisional decision, Im not persuaded that 
the debt should be written off, because Miss M has missed payments on the account long 
before Telefonica gave the misleading advice. It follows that the credit file shouldnt be 
amended, because the debt still exists, and I dont think Telefonica has acted unfairly in 
pursuing it. 
Putting things right
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision - my 
view remains the same as set out in my provisional decision.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. Telefonica should pay Miss M compensation 
of Â£100 for the trouble and upset caused by the poor advice.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 February 2021.
