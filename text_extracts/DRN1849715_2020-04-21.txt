Mr T says Elevate  Credit  International Limited trading as Sunny irresponsibly lent to him.
background
In February 2020  I issued  my provisional  decision.  A copy  of my provisional  decision is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.
In it I explained  why I was intending  to uphold Mr Ts complaint from loan 4 onwards and I 
set out how I thought  Sunny should  put things  right.
I asked both parties to come back to me with any further information they wanted me to take 
into account before I made my final decision.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Mr T confirmed he had received my decision was happy to accept my findings.  Sunny hasnt 
added anything further for me to consider. So, I see no reason to depart from the findings I 
set out in my provisional decision.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4,5,6,7  and 8 and loans 9, 10, 11 and 12 and 
asking Sunny to put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr T loans 4 onwards.
I understand Sunny has sold the debts  in relation to loan 11 and loan 12 which were repaid 
by Mr T. Because Sunny sold loans  11 and 12 to a third party,  it will need to liaise  with this 
third party in order to make sure the redress is completed as outlined below.
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  4 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4,5,6,7, and 8 from Mr Ts credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loan 9 - 12 should be removed from 
Mr Ts credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN18497152my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr Ts complaint from 
loan 4 onwards.  Elevate Credit International  Limited  should put things right as Ive set out 
above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 May 2020.

This complaint is about  12 instalment loans all payable  weekly over a period of 24 weeks. Sunny 
provided Mr T these  loans between December 2014  and May 2015. A summary of Mr Ts borrowing 
history is set out below:

Mr T had to make weekly repayments. In some months Mr T had to make repayments over 5 weeks.
Mr T says Sunny  failed  to identify that he had become dependent on these  short-term  loans and stuck 
in a cycle of borrowing which caused  and exacerbated his financial problems.
In its final response, Sunny told Mr T that it was unable to uphold  his complaint. It believed that 
proportionate and responsible checks were carried out and as a result of these  checks Mr T was 
offered a small amount of credit relative to Mr Ts stated  income.
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ts complaint and thought loans 4 -12 shouldnt have been given. Sunny 
disagreed with this view but offered  Mr T £115.40 to put him in the position  he would have been in if 
he hadnt taken loans 10, 11 and 12. As the parties did not agree the complaint has been passed to 
me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Ref: DRN18497154Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr T could repay the loans 
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish  whether  Mr T 
could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis  might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.  Having done so, Im intending  to uphold Mr Ts complaint 
from loan 4 onwards. I will explain why.
Sunny says it carried out various checks before it lent to Mr T, including looking at his income,  
expenditure and carrying out a credit  check to assess his creditworthiness. It says all the information  
showed that Mr T would be able to make the loan repayments he was committing to and they were 
affordable.
On balance I dont think I can safely say that Sunny  failed to do enough when it was making its 
assessment about the first three  loans. At this time Mr T was a new customer and he was in the early 
stages of his relationship with Sunny.  In the circumstances of this case, I think on balance it was 
reasonable for Sunny to rely on the information Mr T provided when they gave him loans 1,2 and 3.
Sunny asked the same  questions  and did the same checks for loan 4 as it had for loans  1, 2 and 3. 
But from loan 4 onwards I think it should have carried out further checks and taken steps to verify Mr 
Ts income and expenditure. Mr T had been borrowing from Sunny for around two months but despite 
the short  period of borrowing, Mr T was being provided  with credit and then repaid it quickly  and then 
re-borrowed similar amounts  again in quick succession - sometimes within hours on the same date. I 
think by this time Sunny  should have been alerted to the fact that Mr T wasnt managing  to repay  his 
debt sustainably.  
Ref: DRN18497155Ive explained above that although a loan may appear affordable on a pounds and pence basis it 
doesnt necessarily mean that a consumer can afford to repay  the loan in a sustainable manner.
The regulations in place  at the time provided  guidance  about  what  sustainable meant - the 
payments could be made without undue difficulties, on time,  while meeting other  reasonable 
commitments and without having to borrow  to meet the repayments, over the life of the agreement, 
and out of income or savings.
If it had done further checks Sunny would likely have seen that Mr T had numerous other short-term 
loans as well as larger,  longer term expensive credit which he also had to repay. From  Mr Ts 
statements from around this time it looks as if Mr T was circulating the same money  to repay  debt and 
to cover the hole in his finances. I dont think it was reasonable for Sunny to conclude that Mr T was 
going to be able to repay his debt in a sustainable manner. Mr T continued  to borrow  when he took 
out loans 5  8. Sunny ought to have done the same checks that Ive suggested for loan 4. Had it 
done so I think its likely it would have  seen a similar pattern and therefore wouldnt have agreed to 
these loans either.
Sunny says Mr T benefited  from repaying his loans  early but the fact he did repay many of his loans 
early does not mean he did so from sustainable sources. And if hed had to borrow  from elsewhere to 
meet his repayments  - which  looking at his statements from the time would suggest that this was 
more likely, then that wasnt sustainable. 
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ts case, I think that this point was reached by loan 9. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have  realised  Mr T was not managing to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr T had taken out nine loans  within  four months and Mr T had been indebted to 
Sunny for all that time save for a few days. So Sunny ought  to have realised  it was more  likely  
than not Mr T was having  to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was 
leaving in his finances  and that Mr Ts indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ts first loan was for £600 and loan 9 was for the same amount. So, the amount  Mr T was 
borrowing wasnt reducing. So, it doesnt  seem likely that Mr Ts need  for cash  was reducing 
which also points  to him having a longer term need for funds. At this point Sunny ought to 
have known  that Mr T was in significant debt and was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From loan 9 onwards  Mr T was provided with a new loan within days of settling a previous 
one. Mr T had by now established a pattern of borrowing where he was rapidly  taking up the 
loans, paying them off quickly, sometimes on the same day or within a few days  so it does not 
appear he was using the loans as they were intended to be used for.
Mr T borrowed loan 9 for a similar  amount  to the previous loans  and he wasnt  making any 
real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 12 was taken out within approximately  5 
months after Mr Ts first. And although  by loan 12 it was for a smaller amount there was 
already a pattern  of borrowing which showed that Mr T was borrowing the loans quickly and 
repaying them  more likely  from taking out other short-term borrowing and from other 
unsustainable sources.  Mr T had paid a relatively large amounts of interest to, in effect, 
service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
Ref: DRN18497156I think  that Mr T lost out because  Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 9 onwards  
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Ts indebtedness  by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number of loans and the length  of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely  to have had 
negative implications  on Mr Ts ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these  high-cost  loans.
So, Im intending to uphold the complaint about  loans 4,5,6,7 and 8 and loans 9, 10, 11 and 12 and 
asking Sunny  to put things right.
putting things  right  what Sunny needs to do
Sunny shouldnt  have given Mr T loans  4 onwards.
I understand Sunny  has sold the debts  in relation to loan 11 and loan 12 which were repaid by Mr T. 
Because Sunny  sold loans  11 and 12 to a third party, it will need to liaise with this third party  in order 
to make sure the redress  is completed as outlined  below.
refund all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  4 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans  4,5,6,7,  and 8 from Mr Ts credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information  recorded about them 
is adverse. So, all entries about loan 9 - 12 should be removed from Mr Ts credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr T a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
Subject to any further information the parties wish me to consider before I make my final decision and 
for the reasons given above, Im intending to partially  upholding Mr Ts complaint and direct Elevate 
Credit International  Limited to pay Mr T compensation as set out above.
