K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that Western Circle Ltd (trading as Cashfloat) gave him loans that he 
couldnt afford to repay.
background
Mr C was given eight  loans by Cashfloat  between  February 2016  and May 2017. Each of the 
loans was repayable in monthly instalments as shown below. Mr C repaid all his loans 
before the due date. A summary of Mr Cs borrowing from Cashfloat is as follows;

Mr Cs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. She thought that the 
checks Cashfloat did before agreeing the first four loans had been sufficient. But she thought 
more checks should have been  done  before Cashfloat agreed the remaining loans. And she 
thought that better checks would have shown  Cashfloat  that Mr C couldnt sustainably  afford  
them. So she asked Cashfloat to pay Mr C some  compensation.
Disappointingly Cashfloat didnt respond  to that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt 
been resolved  informally,  it has been  passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide. This is the 
last stage of our process. If Mr C accepts my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Cashfloat was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make  checks to see whether Mr C 
could afford  to pay back each loan before it lent to him. Those checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr C was borrowing, and his lending  history,  but 
there was no set list of checks Cashfloat had to do.
Each of Mr Cs loans was repayable in monthly  instalments. So the amounts that Mr C 
needed to repay each  time were smaller than if hed taken a normal payday loan. But of 
course he was committing to making those repayments over a longer period.
Ref: DRN03129502Cashfloat has told us about the checks it did before  lending to Mr C. Before agreeing each 
loan it asked him for information about  his income, and his normal expenditure. It then 
validated this information using standard industry data, and where this suggested Mr C might  
have under-declared his expenditure, Cashfloat  used  the higher figure. Cashfloat also 
checked Mr Cs credit commitments using data from a credit reference agency  and checked  
for any historical problems with repaying debt.
I think that the checks Cashfloat  did before agreeing the first four loans were proportionate. 
The amounts that Mr C asked to borrow  were  relatively modest compared to what  he 
declared about his income. And the repayments  he needed to make appeared easily 
affordable even after Cashfloat  had increased  the expenditure he declared. Although  I think 
Cashfloat should have started to become concerned about Mr Cs repeated borrowing I dont 
think it needed to do any more checks than it did on these loans.
When Mr C asked for his fifth loan hed been borrowing, almost constantly,  from Cashfloat 
for over ten months. I think by now Cashfloat  should have realised that it was unlikely that 
Mr Cs finances were  as healthy as he was declaring. I think at this stage  Cashfloat  should 
have decided it was no longer reasonable to base its affordability  assessment on information  
being provided by Mr C. I think from this point  onwards Cashfloat  should have taken steps  to 
independently check Mr Cs true financial position.
But although  I dont  think the checks Cashfloat did from loan 5 onwards were sufficient, that 
in itself doesnt mean that Mr Cs complaint should  succeed. Id also need to be persuaded 
that what I consider  to be proportionate checks would have shown Cashfloat that Mr C 
couldnt sustainably  afford the loans. So Ive looked at Mr Cs bank statements, and what  
hes told us about  his financial situation,  to see what better  checks  would have shown 
Cashfloat.
The loans on which I think Cashfloat  needed to do more checks  were taken between 
December 2016  and May 2017. Over that time there  was little change in Mr Cs income or 
normal living  costs. And having  looked  at his bank statements  I can see that Mr C would 
have some money left over each month after paying his normal living  costs.
But at the same time Mr C was borrowing from Cashfloat he was also borrowing heavily from 
a number of other short  term lenders  money that he would need to repay at the same time 
as his repayments to Cashfloat were due. And Mr C was borrowing that money to support an 
increasing and substantial amount of spending on what appear to be online gambling 
transactions. By the time of his last loan Mr C was spending significantly more  than his 
income each month on these transactions.
If Cashfloat had done what I consider to be proportionate checks  from loan 5 onwards it 
would have seen  that Mr C wasnt able to repay any borrowing in a sustainable manner  
that is out of his income and savings  and without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  
Having seen that, and as a responsible  lender, I dont think Cashfloat would have agreed  to 
give these loans to him. So Cashfloat  needs to pay Mr C some  compensation.
Ref: DRN03129503putting things right
I dont think Cashfloat  should have agreed to lend to Mr C after, and including, the loan that 
he took on 19 December  2016. So for each of those loans Cashfloat should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Cs credit file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Cashfloat to take off tax from this interest. Cashfloat must 
give Mr C a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Cs complaint and direct Western Circle Ltd to put things 
right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 February  2019.
