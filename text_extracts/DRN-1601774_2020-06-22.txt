DRN-1601774 
Our adjudicator thought the loans from loan 6 onwards shouldnt have been given because 
the overall pattern of Mr Ds borrowing indicated he was reliant on these loans and the 
borrowing was becoming unsustainable. 
Sunny disagreed but offered to uphold loans 11 to 14 and later loans 9 to 14. Both offers 
were put to Mr D, but he declined them. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr D could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint. Having done so, I am partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Ds complaint about loans 1 to 5. Mr D hasnt provided any 
further evidence or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because they no longer appear to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr D, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Ds case, like the adjudicator, I think that this point was 
reached by loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr D was not managing to repay his loans
sustainably. Mr D had taken out six loans in seven months and had taken out loan 5
only four days before taking loan 6. So, it should have realised it was more likely than
not Mr D was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan
was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ds indebtedness was increasing
unsustainably.
From loan 6 onward Mr D was provided with a new loan within weeks  sometimes
days  of settling a previous one. For example, Mr D took out loan 9 on the same day
he repaid loans 6 and 7.
Mr D wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 14 was
taken out 16 months after Mr Ds first. Mr D had paid large amounts of interest to, in
effect; service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr D lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of
time.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Mr D borrowed was likely to
have had negative implications on Mr Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding Mr Ds complaint about loan 6 onwards. 
Putting things right  what Elevate Credit International Limited needs to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts Sunny should buy these back if Sunny is able to do 
so and then take the following steps. If Sunny cant buy the debts back, then Sunny should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) Sunny should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr D towards interest,
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made byMr D which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr D originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr D as though they had been
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr D having made
overpayments then Sunny should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest*
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus,
then the surplus should be paid to Mr D. However, if there is still an outstanding balance
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr D. Sunny shouldnt
pursue outstanding balances made up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
E) The overall pattern of Mr Ds borrowing for loans 6 to 14 means any information recorded
about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely from Mr Ds credit file.
Sunny does not have to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Ds credit file until these
have been repaid, but Sunny should still remove any adverse information recorded about
these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit International Limited to take off tax from 
this interest. Elevate Credit International Limited must give Mr D a certificate showing how 
much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ds complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 July 2020.
