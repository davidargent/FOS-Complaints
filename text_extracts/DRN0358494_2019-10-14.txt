K821x#15complaint
Mr C says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about one flex credit  account  and 47 instalment loans Sunny provided to 
Mr C between August 2013  and February 2018. Mr Cs borrowing history is summarised at 
the end of this decision.
When Mr C complained to Sunny, it upheld his complaint about loan 1  the flex credit 
account and has paid the redress on that loan. Sunny said it didnt  think it had done anything 
wrong when it lent the other loans. One of our adjudicator  looked  at the complaint and 
thought that loans 6 to 48 should also be upheld.  Sunny disagreed and offered to uphold  
Mr Cs complaint about loans 26 to 47. 
Mr C didnt accept Sunnys offer and so the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr C could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN03584942Loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
When Sunny  issued its final response letter  to Mr C, it agreed that it shouldnt have lent him 
loan 1 and made an offer.  Our adjudicator didnt think that Sunny did anything  wrong when  it 
lent Mr C loans 2 to 5. There have been no further disputes about  loans  1 to 5 and so Ive 
focussed my decision on the loans still in dispute.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 48 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so and I think the pattern of lending here is concerning. 
So Ive looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.
By the time of loan 6, Mr C had essentially  established a pattern  of taking several  advances  
over a long period of time. So taking  into account  what Sunny knew about Mr Cs borrowing 
and repayment  pattern,  it ought to have  been concerned about lending further to Mr C. 
Loans 6 to 48 were  instalment loans due to be repaid in six monthly instalments but I can 
see that Mr C repaid most of those loans within two weeks. This wasnt how these instalment 
loans were intended to be used and I think that the fact Mr C was using these instalment 
loans in this way may have suggested that he had wider financial problems that ought to 
have concerned Sunny.
At this point of loan 6, Sunny ought  to have realised Mr C was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr C had been indebted to Sunny  for around  24 months. So Sunny  ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Mr C was having to borrow  further to cover the 
hole repaying  his previous borrowing was leaving in his finances and that his indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably. Sunny ought to have known that Mr C was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 6 onwards Mr C was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of settling a previous 
one and I cant see that there were any noticeable breaks. So Mr C wasnt  making any real 
inroads to the amount  he owed Sunny. Loan 48 was taken out around  30 months after 
Mr Cs first. Mr C had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny 
over an extended period.
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time the 
number of loans.   The length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely  to have had 
negative implications on Mr Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN03584943I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 onwards. I can see that Sunny agrees it 
shouldnt have lent Mr C loans 26 to 47 but I think that loans 6 to 25 and loan 48 should also 
be upheld. So Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 6 to 48;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken means  any information recorded  about them  is adverse. 
So all entries about loans 6 to 48 should be removed from Mr Cs credit file.
I can see that there was an outstanding balance on loan 48 which  Sunny wrote  off, it can 
chose to offset the capital amount it wrote off for this loan from the redress.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partially  uphold Mr Cs complaint and require Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things  right as stated  above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 November  2019.
