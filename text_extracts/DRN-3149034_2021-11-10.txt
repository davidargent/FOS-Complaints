The complaint
Miss B complains that a car that was supplied to her under a conditional sale agreement with 
Close Brothers Limited, trading as Close Brothers Motor Finance, wasnt of satisfactory 
quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Miss B under a conditional sale agreement with Close Brothers 
in July 2020. She says that she returned the car to the dealer less than two weeks later 
because it had gone into limp mode and hadnt been serviced and that she asked for the 
timing belt to be looked at. The dealer repaired and serviced the car and she says that she 
was told that the car had a timing chain that didnt need to be replaced. Miss B complained 
to Close Brothers and said that she wanted to reject the car  but it said that it had been 
repaired so it was unable to accept a rejection.
Miss B paid £295.90 in April 2021 for a new timing belt and water pump and the car stopped 
working in June 2021. A garage quoted £3,895 plus VAT for repairs to the gearbox and a 
suspected head gasket failure and Miss B made a statutory off-road notification about the 
car. Miss B then complained again to Close Brothers but it said that it would require 
evidence to show that the faults with the car had been present when it was supplied to her. 
Miss B wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She said that 
Miss B was able to carry out over 7,000 miles before the faults with the timing belt, water 
pump and gearbox presented itself, so she couldnt say that the car was of unsatisfactory 
quality when it was sold to her.
Miss B has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that shes 
left without a car and believes that some of the faults were there at the time of purchase due 
to the car was being returned less than two weeks later. She says that she doesnt expect a 
car purchased on finance to have to be declared off-road less than a year later due to faults 
and that she has no means of paying for a car which she can't run. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
Close Brothers, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss B - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Miss B was nearly ten years old, had been driven for 
about 81,600 miles and had a price of £3,500;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Miss B returned the car to the dealer less than two weeks after it had been supplied 
to her because it had gone into limp mode and shed been told that it hadnt been 
serviced and she asked the dealer to look at the timing belt;
the dealer repaired and serviced the car and Miss B she says that she was told that 
the car had a timing chain that didnt need to be replaced  she complained to Close 
Brothers and said that she wanted to reject the car but it said that it had been 
repaired;
Miss B says that the car hadnt been serviced before it was supplied to her  but the 
dealer serviced the car, I consider it to be more likely than not that the car had had 
some services before it was supplied to her, the car wasnt advertised as having a full 
service history and Miss B was able to use the car between August 2020 and April 
2021 without any major issues - the car had also passed an MOT test in July 2020 
before it was supplied to Miss B;
I consider it to be more likely than not that Miss B accepted the repair in August 2020 
and continued to use the car;
Miss B paid £295.90 for a new timing belt and a water pump in April 2021 and the 
cars mileage at that time was 88,164 - so more than 6,500 miles more than the 
mileage when the car was supplied to her  Im not persuaded that shed have been 
able to use the car between August 2020 and April 2021 and to drive more than 
6,500 miles in that time if there had been a fault with the cars timing belt when it was 
supplied to her;
Miss B was then able to use the car between April and July 2021 when it stopped 
working  the cars mileage at that time was 89,417 so the car had been driven for 
1,253 miles between April and July 2021;
a garage quoted £3,895 plus VAT for repairs to the gearbox and a suspected head 
gasket failure and Miss B has made a statutory off-road notification about the car  
but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that those issues with 
the gearbox and head gasket were present when the car was supplied to her and I 
dont consider that shed have been able to use the car until July 2021 and to drive it 
for about 7,800 miles if those issues had been present or developing in July 2020  
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that those issues are 
linked to the repairs that the dealer made to the car in August 2020;
I sympathise with Miss B for the issues that shes had with the car, the costs that 
shes incurred for repairs to the car and the difficulties that she now faces with a car 
thats been declared off-road and which requires extensive repairs, but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of satisfactory 
quality when it was supplied to her because of issues with the timing chain, gearbox 
or head gasket; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Close Brothers to allow Miss B to reject the car, to pay for it to be repaired, to pay her 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
Miss B says that she has no means of paying for a car which she can't run. I suggest that 
she asks Close Brothers about her options under the agreement and explains to it any 
financial difficulties that shes experiencing. Its required to respond to any such difficulties 
positively and sympathetically.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 December 2021.
