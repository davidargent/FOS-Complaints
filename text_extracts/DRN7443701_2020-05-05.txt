Mr R took an additional  fifty one loans up to January 2019,  ranging in value from £50 to 
£500.
Mr R explains  that the loans caused  a debt spiral, leading to repeat borrowing and financial 
difficulty.
In its final response,  Sunny partly  upheld Mr Rs complaint, offering to put things right from 
loan 54 onwards. Otherwise it said it had carried out the necessary checks  and the loans 
were affordable. Later  it said as a gesture of goodwill  it would uphold  the complaint  from loan 
30 onwards.
In our latest  assessment, our adjudicator upheld Mr Rs complaint  and thought the loans 
from loan 8 shouldnt  have been given.
As the parties havent  reached agreement the complaint has been passed to me to make  a 
final decision.
Ref: DRN74437012my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.  I agree that the loans from loan 8 
should not have been given. I will explain why.
Both parties  havent  disagreed about  our adjudicators  opinion  about the first seven loans.  
So, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement  about these loans, and I wont be making  
a decision about  this lending. But loans 1-7 were part of the borrowing relationship Mr R had 
Ref: DRN74437013with Sunny. So, they are something  I will take into account when  considering the other loans 
Mr R took out.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr R, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr R was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr R had taken out eight loans within a three months period without any 
gaps. This was also Mr Rs fourth  batch  of lending, so hed borrowed loans 1 and 2, 3 
and 4, 5,6 and 7 within the three months. Mr R had been  indebted  to Sunny for the 
whole time without any gaps save for a few days.  Mr R had only just repaid loan 5,6 
and 7 four days before taking out loan 8. So Sunny ought to have  realised it was 
more likely than not Mr R was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Rs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr Rs first loan was for £250 and loan 8 was for £300. So, it doesnt look like Mr Rs 
need for cash was reducing which also points to a longer term need  for funds. At this 
point Sunny ought to have known that Mr R was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 8 onwards  Mr R was provided  with a new loan within  days or weeks of 
settling a previous  one. On many occasions Mr R had multiple  loans running  at the 
same time.
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  71 was 
taken out over three years after Mr Rs first. And although it was for £150, a smaller 
amount than Mr Rs first loan - at that time Mr R still had loan 68 outstanding which 
hed taken out for a sum of £300. So, in effect  Mr R had taken on a larger  amount of 
debt than his first loan. In addition, on the same  day as taking out loan 71 he had 
repaid loans 69 and 70. Mr R had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service 
a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 9 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr R borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Rs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 8-71 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Ref: DRN74437014refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 8-71;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 -71 means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  loans  8-71 should be removed from Mr Rs 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 June 2020.
