K821x#15complaint
Mr C has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny. Mr C says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
Ill refer mainly to Sunny  in this decision.
background
We now know that Mr C took out 13 loans from Sunny  between  March 2017 and May 2018.  
Ive enclosed a summary  of Mr Cs borrowing with Sunny, based on the information  it 
provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan 6 onwards. Sunny initially didnt agree it had done anything wrong but 
it later offered a part-settlement, which Mr C declined. The complaint has therefore come to 
me for an ombudsmans  final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Cs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr C could 
repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These  checks  ought to have  taken 
into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total repayment  
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
Ref: DRN68851052whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr C could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr C. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending history to 
him with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  Ive considered  whether, at 
some point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans. 
Our adjudicator said that he thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ought not to 
be upheld as they appeared affordable. Ive looked carefully at these and taken note of Mr 
Cs job and of the income declared by him at around  the time.  Ive also looked  at what he 
said about his monthly  expenditure. 
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which Sunny most likely carried  out appear to have  
been proportionate for loans 1  5. And I think these  levels  of checks,  together  with the 
income and expenditure details provided  by Mr C, would  have  made those particular loans 
appear affordable  for him. 
However, I think the emerging and repeated lending pattern from the point of loan 6 onwards 
in this case would have looked  different and therefore required a more thorough and 
responsible approach. The overall  pattern of Sunnys lending to Mr C should  have caused it 
to see, in my view,  that it shouldnt have  provided any further loans from this point onwards. 
This is because this was his sixth short-term loan application with Sunny loan in less than 6 
months with no significant breaks  in lending. And in common with his borrowing pattern thus 
far, he was again asking  to borrow from Sunny relatively quickly after applying for a previous 
loan and whilst a previous Sunny loan balance was still outstanding. So Sunny ought to have  
realised that Mr C was probably borrowing to meet  regular shortfalls  in his income and an 
ongoing need. He was having to consistently  take out high interest, short-term lending  and 
his indebtedness  was becoming  unsustainable.  Sunny should have seen this and ought to 
have realised Mr C was at risk of not managing to repay his loans sustainably. 
So Im upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 6 - 13. Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr C in 
an unsustainable manner  because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
Ref: DRN68851053putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 6 - 13
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 11 - 13 and treat any 
payments Mr C made towards this loan as payments towards the capital;
if reworking Mr Cs loan 11 - 13 accounts  as Ive directed  results  in him effectively 
having made payments above  the original capital borrowed, then Sunny should 
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated  on the overpayments,  
from the date the overpayments would  have arisen, to the date of settlement.  
If reworking Mr Cs loan 11 - 13 accounts  leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, 
then Sunny can use the total refund for loans 6 - 10 to offset  this. And if there is still 
an outstanding  capital balance then I would remind  it that it should take a 
sympathetic view when seeking  to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr C for 
the remaining  capital
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 13 should be completely 
removed from Mr Cs credit file.
If Sunny sold any of the debt on, it should attempt to buy it back or otherwise see that 
all the above is complied with.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr C a certificate  
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  International Limited  
should put things right for Mr C as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 March  2020.
