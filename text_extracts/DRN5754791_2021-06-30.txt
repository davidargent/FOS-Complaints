K821x#15Complaint
Mrs P complains that TSB Bank  plc wont refund money she lost having fallen victim to a 
scam, and that it provided her with an unaffordable loan, that she only applied  for as a result 
of the scam.
Background
I issued my provisional decision on 30 March 2021.  A copy of my provisional  decision is 
attached to, and forms part of, my final decision.  
Mrs P, through her representatives,  responded to say they accepted  my provisional decision.  
TSB responded and made a number of further points (which I have summarised only briefly  
in my findings below   for accessibility and to comply with our statutory duty to resolve 
disputes with minimum  formality). But in summary TSB said;
In respect of the affordability of the loan;
-it should not be held liable where it has completed its normal checks  and accepted  
the word of a long-standing customer.
-it can only assess a loan at the point of sale, with the information that is available to 
it. In this case it said, Mrs Ps credit file was clear, she had good  account activity and 
on this basis, she was a low risk applicant.
-it was pleased it had been accepted that it was unlikely  Mrs P was visibly distressed 
during the loan interviews.
-it thought it was fair and reasonable for the outstanding balance  of the loan to be 
cleared, in full, from any potential refund  of transactions  (noting that it would not be 
able to remove the loan from Mrs Ps credit file, until the debt is cleared).
in respect of the scam  itself;
-it thought Mrs P was fully aware at the outset she had been  approached by 
scammers because;  shed  accepted  shed never  entered  the lottery and her 
daughters told her it was a scam.
-with this in mind TSB said Mrs Ps actions should be considered  to have  fallen 
significantly below the standard  reasonably  expected.
-it didnt see how questioning Mrs P would have  made any difference to the scam  
occurring, considering Mrs P had misled her family and the bank in order to follow  the 
fraudsters instructions.
-it considers the provisional findings  to refund  half seemed inequitable in the 
circumstances.
-the scam  pre-dated  the Banking  Protocol  and this was not an option open  to branch 
staff. And even if it had applied  the highest standard of questioning, in line with 
industry standards, it is more likely than not Mrs P would have provided a plausible 
Ref: DRN57547912reason for the withdrawals.
-it didnt consider withdrawals of £500  and £100  to be unusual.
-it noted that if it refunded half of the value of the money transfers, it would  be 
refunding more than half of the amount withdrawn  from TSB.  It said only the cash 
withdrawals should be considered, as these were all it could influence.
Overall TSB said it did not believe that Mrs P had a reasonable basis for believing that she 
had won the Dubai lottery, as she knew she hadnt entered the lottery, and had been  told it 
was a scam  by her family. So it felt TSB should therefore not be liable for her loss.
I considered everything  that TSB had said and sent it my further  thoughts, in summary I said;
-for the reasons explained in my provisional decision,  I remained  persuaded that the 
loan was unaffordable and that;
-in any event, I considered an intervention from TSB would have  made a difference  
and prevented further payments being  made.   And that I thought  the point at which 
an intervention would fairly and reasonably have made a difference  was 8 May 2017, 
which was prior to the loan being  taken.   So it followed  that had TSB acted  as I think  
it ought to have done, in terms of intervention, then I consider the scam would have 
come to light before the loan conversation took place and therefore the loan wouldnt 
have been taken. 
-I considered the general principles of the Banking Protocol  for example to look out 
for unusual and out of character transactions, to ask questions and to escalate  
internally when  in doubt, were  already  known  to TSB in 2017 and steps that were  
open to take.
-I remained persuaded that, for reasons explained in my provisional decision, Mrs P 
wouldnt have been able to continue to give plausible answers to reasonable 
questions that I think  TSB ought to have asked.   
-As my provisional decision  had explained, I considered Mrs P should  fairly take a 
share of the blame for her own actions/omissions, which had been reflected in the 
order I was intending to make, being to ask TSB to refund 50%, rather than the entire 
sum lost, from the point I think it ought to have  made a difference.
-I considered the point  TSB made, regarding the value of funds made via the money 
transfer companies and I agreed it would be fairer to base any redress  on the 
withdrawals made  from TSB, rather than on amounts paid through  the money  
transfer companies. 
-I also agreed TSB shouldnt need  to refund a proportion of the £100 withdrawal, that 
was made on 29 August 2017.  I said this because, having looked at the timing of the 
cash withdrawals, against the dates when  the payments were made through  the 
money transfer companies,  it is not obviously clear to me that this £100  was then 
sent to the fraudsters.   
Overall, I said it was fair and reasonable for me to adjust what I was intending to order TSB 
to pay. In view of this I said I was intending to ask TSB to;
Ref: DRN57547913-refund  Mrs P any interest and charges she has paid on the loan she took out for 
£25,000 in May 2017
-refund  Mrs P £36,000  - being  50% of the total cash withdrawals made  between  8 
May 2017 and 29 September  2017  (this excludes a withdrawal for £100  made  on 29 
August 2017)
-TSB can use part of this redress to settle the outstanding principle amount of the loan 
(which TSB has indicated is £21972.43), before refunding  the remaining redress  to 
Mrs P
-pay Mrs P £500 for the trouble and upset caused
-once the loan has been  redeemed,  it should be removed from Mrs Ps credit  file
I invited Mrs P and TSB to make any further  comments. 
TSB confirmed it had nothing further to add to the case and would await  the decision. Mrs P, 
through her representatives, said they would  be accepting  my revised recommendations.
Now both sides have had the opportunity to comment, I can go ahead with my final decision.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mrs P has accepted  the findings of my provisional decision and my revised thoughts on 
redress that followed and as TSB has said it has nothing further  to add, I see no reason to 
depart from the conclusions I indicated in my provisional decision and in my follow up note to 
both parties, indicating what I was intending  to order TSB to pay. 
I remain of the view that this complaint should be upheld for the reasons set out in my 
provisional decision and my follow up note. 
Ref: DRN57547914my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, my final decision is that I uphold  Mrs Ps complaint  and TSB 
Bank plc should;
-refund  Mrs P any interest and charges she has paid on the loan she took out for 
£25,000 in May 2017
-refund  50% of the total cash withdrawals made from Mrs Ps account  between 8 May  
2017 and 29 September 2017  (excluding  a withdrawal for £100 made on 29 August 
2017)
-TSB can use part of this redress to settle the outstanding principle amount of the loan 
(which TSB has indicated is £21972.43), before refunding  the remaining redress  to 
Mrs P
-pay Mrs P £500 for the trouble and upset caused
-once the loan has been  redeemed,  it should be removed from Mrs Ps credit  file
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 July 2021.

Complaint
Mrs P complains that TSB Bank plc wont refund money she lost having fallen victim to a scam, and 
that it provided her with an unaffordable loan, that she only applied  for as a result of the scam.
Background
Mrs P is being  represented  by her daughters. Unfortunately, Mrs P has been in poor health recently 
and the scam  happened some time ago - so it has not always been possible to get detailed testimony 
of how the scam unfolded.
I understand the key points  of the background to this complaint are well known to both parties, but Ill 
still provide an overview of events, as I understand them from the testimonies Ive received. 
At some time during 2016  Mrs P fell victim to a scam, where she was persuaded  to send money to 
fraudsters, under the pretence that she had won some money in a lottery.
Mrs Ps daughters tell us that in the autumn of 2016, Mrs P told them that shed  received a call over 
the summer saying that shed won money in the Dubai  lottery. Mrs P had never entered  the lottery  but 
was told shed  initially  won $200,000, with this increasing  to $10,000,000,  when her numbers  were 
entered into the draw  again. The fraudsters  told Mrs P that in order to release the money she would 
have to pay tax.
Mrs Ps daughters have  said that at this point, in the autumn of 2016,  they told Mrs P that this was a 
scam and that she shouldnt  pay any money. Mrs Ps daughters believe she had paid some money to 
the scammer by this time  but are unaware  of any date or amounts paid. Mrs Ps daughters assumed 
this would  be the end of things. Mrs P made payments to the fraudsters  via two money  transfer 
service companies, but I havent  seen any evidence of payments being made, through  these 
companies, to the fraudsters  before the Autumn of 2016. 
Unknown to Mrs Ps daughters, Mrs P continued  to receive calls from the fraudsters asking for money  
and from what Ive seen, begun to make payments  to the fraudsters  from December  2016.  I 
understand during  these  calls Mrs P received threats against her and her son, who she cares for. She 
was told by the fraudsters not to tell anybody and that harm would come to her and her son, if she did 
tell anybody. 
When Mrs P indicated  to the fraudsters, in May 2017,  she had no more money to give,  I understand 
the fraudsters  told her she should go and get a loan from her bank and tell the bank the loan was for a 
caravan. 
Mrs P attended a TSB branch, with her son, in May 2017, to discuss a loan.  From what Ive seen, by 
this point, Mrs P had already made around 15 payments to the fraudsters, by withdrawing cash  and 
making payments through  the money transfer services, totalling over £25,000. Mrs Ps recollection  is 
that during the loan meeting  she was distressed and crying, due to the pressure she was being  put 
under by the fraudsters. So she didnt  go ahead  with the loan, instead returning the next day to 
complete the loan application  which was approved for £25,000 over an 84 month period, with a 
monthly repayment of £432.51.
Mrs P has acknowledged that, during the interview  for the loan, she lied to the member  of TSB staff. 
Shes told us in order to help with her application she told TSB staff that her son paid for household 
bills, although this was not the case. Mrs P told TSB staff that the loan was to purchase a caravan, as 
she said this is what the fraudster instructed her to do. 
Ref: DRN57547916Once in receipt  of the loan funds Mrs P made further large cash withdrawals in branch and then paid 
the money to fraudsters. Alongside the loan funds and throughout  the scam, Mrs P also borrowed  
money from her daughters. 
Mrs Ps daughters have  said that she told them  the money was to buy a flat in India.  Mrs P already 
owned a flat in India, but told her daughters she intended to sell this in order to buy a larger flat, in a 
nicer area, that would better suit the needs of her and her son when they travelled to India.  Mrs Ps 
daughters said she had dealt with a previous property purchase in India  and Mrs P told them an uncle 
was helping her organise the sale and that she had a solicitor. So they believed what  they were being 
told and have  said they thought it was a good investment. 
Mrs P told her daughters that she would repay the money to the them,  once the sale of her old flat 
had been completed. Her daughters also recalled  that their mother  had visited India around this time,  
which supported what they were being told. But unknown to Mrs Ps daughters, the money theyd lent 
would also be sent to the fraudsters, through the same method of large  cash withdrawals and 
payments through  money  transfer services. 
The scam came to light again in October  2017,  when the pressure of what  was happening  eventually 
took its toll on Mrs P and she broke down  and opened up to her daughters with regards to what had 
happened. 
It is difficult to know for sure a precise amount of what Mrs P has sent the fraudsters. Mrs Ps 
daughters have been  able to provide some receipts from the two money  transfer services that Mrs P 
used. Our investigator  has also been able to get some detail from those two services. This information  
indicates that Mrs P made  the following  transfers, to the fraudsters from these two money  transfer 
service companies. Ive referred to these companies as A and B in the tables below:

Mrs P complained to TSB that it didnt carry out due diligence when it agreed to loan her £25,000. 
Shes said the monthly loan repayment left her with hardly anything to live on.     Mrs P says she was 
under duress when taking the loan out and TSB shouldnt  have allowed  her to borrow  this money. 
TSB looked into Mrs Ps complaint and issued  its final response  on 6 December  2017. It didnt uphold 
Mrs Ps complaint.  It said that what Mrs P had told it during the loan interview, regarding  her income  
and expenditure, was supported by her bank statements.  It said it added  expenditure  for food, to the 
income and affordability  assessment it completed at the time  even though Mrs P didnt  want it to do 
that. Overall, the bank considered the loan to be affordable, which it said was supported by Mrs P 
being able to keep up with her repayments, seemingly until the scam came to light. 
Alongside this it said that its member of staff who carried out the loan interview had no recollection of 
Mrs P being distressed or upset during the conversations they had about  the loan. It said it had no 
reasons to doubt what a long-standing  customer, with a good account history was telling it. 
Mrs P didnt agree  with TSBs position and so, represented by her daughters, brought  her complaint  
to our service.  One of our investigators initially looked into whether the loan ought  to have been 
agreed. Overall, she didnt  think TSB treated  Mrs P fairly  by assessing the loan as affordable.  She 
also said there was an issue as to whether TSB ought to have taken action to protect Mrs P where 
she was the victim of a fraud. 
Our investigator said she thought TSB should refund any interest charged on the loan and to not add 
any further interest. As well as this, she said it should also work with Mrs P on putting in place an 
affordable repayment plan. Our investigator said the matter of whether  TSB should have protected 
Mrs P would be investigated further.  
TSB didnt agree with our investigators assessment of the loan being  unaffordable, nor did it think  it 
should be responsible for refunding Mrs P the money shed lost to fraudsters. 
The matter of whether TSB ought to have protected Mrs P from the scam more  than it did, was then 
reviewed by another of our investigators. Our investigator thought  there was enough going on that 
TSB ought to have intervened. Our investigator asked TSB to consider the window of opportunity  she 
thought it had missed to intervene  and prevent the fraud. She asked TSB to bear in mind a withdrawal 
on 3 January 2017 as a starting  point. Our investigator suggested TSB should consider refunding Mrs 
P the payments she made to the fraudster from this point.  She also thought  TSB should  refund Mrs P 
any interest payments  made  towards her loan and agree not to charge  any further interest. Alongside 
this, she recommended Mrs P should be paid £500 for the trouble and upset  caused.
Mrs Ps, through her daughters, accepted our investigators findings. TSB didnt agree. In summary it 
thought even  if it had suspicions about the withdrawals Mrs P was making,  which it didnt have, it 
thinks Mrs P would have been able to give plausible reasons for the withdrawals. It didnt consider the 
pattern of spending,  before the loan was taken  out, to be out of character.
The case has now been passed to me for a decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.  
It is important to point out that were an informal  dispute resolution service, set up as a free alternative 
to the courts for consumers.  In deciding this complaint Ive focused  on what  I consider to be the heart 
Ref: DRN575479110of the matter rather than commenting on every issue or point made in turn. This isnt intended  as a 
discourtesy to either party, it reflects the informal  nature  of our service, its remit and my role in it. Ive 
set out my provisional findings under the following headings: loan affordability and lottery scam.
loan affordability
Having carefully thought about everything Ive been provided,  Im intending to uphold this part of Mrs 
Ps complaint.  
Id like to explain why in a little more detail. Mrs P was provided with a loan for £25,000 in May 2017. 
The loan was to be repaid in 84 monthly instalments  of £432.51  the purpose of the loan was for a 
caravan. TSB says it agreed to Mrs Ps application after shed provided details of her monthly income 
and it had carried out a credit check. It added that she had a good standing  with the bank having  been 
a customer for many years.
It says the information Mrs P provided on her income and expenditure  showed  that shed be able to 
make the repayments she was committing to. As well as this, there was nothing in the credit check 
which called into question any of the information provided  and her bank statements  supported what 
Mrs P told it about her income and expenditure.
It is accepted  that Mrs P wasnt truthful when taking out the loan. TSB has said it had no reason to 
doubt what a longstanding customer was telling it. It considers that it was reasonable to lend and for 
some months  after the loan was granted,  Mrs P maintained her payments.
It isnt for me to tell the bank what lending criteria it should use before agreeing to lend to someone. 
But when deciding whether  to lend to a customer, a bank has certain obligations that it needs to meet, 
including carrying out reasonable and proportionate checks  to see if a customer can afford to repay 
any new borrowing. It also needed to consider  whether Mrs P could repay her borrowing  in a 
sustainable manner. 
I dont think that TSB completed proportionate checks, based on what they knew about    Mrs Ps 
circumstances and the purpose  of the loan, to have offered her such a large loan over such  a long 
period. Even by the banks own figures, this took affordability right to its margins and based on what  
Ive seen Im not persuaded the loan payments, Mrs P would have been required to make, would 
have been sustainable and I dont think TSB has made a fair lending decision.
TSB has provided evidence of an income  and affordability assessment it carried out at the time,  and 
has said it added £100 per month to Mrs Ps expenditure, on top of what  she had told it  and that this 
showed she had sufficient surplus income  to service the debt.  
But from what  Ive seen its difficult  to fairly  and reasonably conclude that Mrs P would have been  able 
to continue to make  the monthly  loan repayments without experiencing difficulties. With this, I think  
further considerations should have been taken into account, such  as, but not limited to;
-Mrs P was on a fixed  monthly income  (pension). The loan repayments of £432 equated to 
over 60% of her monthly income
-The monthly loan payments left little contingency for Mrs P for unexpected events
-While  Mrs Ps income and expenditure indicated household bills were  paid from another  
source  there was no guarantee this would always be the case
-Had Mrs P been  employed,  the bank may reasonably have believed her income may have 
increased  but this is not the case here. Mrs Ps monthly income  was unlikely to increase, 
but the cost of living would  likely  have gone up
-There doesnt appear to have been any consideration of the associated  costs that would 
come with the purchase Mrs P was intending to make. When buying  a caravan  its fair to 
assume there will be other costs (e.g. site fees/maintenance fees). It is difficult to see how 
Mrs P would have been able to afford these  based on her income
Ref: DRN575479111-There is no evidence of any surplus  funds in Mrs Ps bank account.  If Mrs P had been 
spending c. £400  under  her monthly income  each month, I would reasonably  have expected 
some savings to have  been built up  but there is no evidence of this or evidence of any 
discussion of what the surplus funds may have been used for in previous  months
-Following on from this point, Mrs Ps bank  statements at the time would have evidence her 
building up funds in her account, but then withdrawing cash   it doesnt appear this was 
questioned
Ive thought carefully about  what  TSB has said. In that Mrs P wasnt truthful with the information she 
gave in her loan interview. But overall,  with the information  it had available to it and with what Mrs P 
did tell it, Im persuaded that it doesnt appear to be the case that   Mrs P wouldnt  have suffered 
future difficult consequences in terms of taking this loan and I dont think this loan could have 
sustainably been repaid.
Im aware Mrs P and her daughters  have  said Mrs P was upset and distressed at the time this loan 
was taken  out. But this is not supported by the recollections of TSB staff, who have said Mrs P didnt 
appear upset.  On the balance of probabilities, I think it more likely  than not that TSB would have 
recalled if Mrs P was upset and would  have looked to have  asked after her wellbeing if she was 
crying. While I dont doubt Mrs P may have been anxious,  after all she was under pressure to get this 
money, Im not persuaded her distress  would have been evident to the member of TSB staff,  who she 
was talking  to about this loan. 
Sadly, Mrs P went on to pass the funds from this loan onto a fraudster. I will talk about that later in this 
decision. I think  TSB should refund any interest  and charges it has added which are associated  to this 
loan.  
I also consider  TSB should  remove  the loan from Mrs Ps credit file, so she isnt negatively  impacted  
because of whats  happened. It is the case that Mrs P is still required  to repay her outstanding loan 
balance. Id expect TSB to engage with her in a positive  and sympathetic manner, taking  into account 
her current circumstances, regarding  the repayment of the loan.

In deciding whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of a complaint, Im required to take into 
account relevant: law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance  and standards; codes of practice; 
and, where  appropriate, what I consider to have  been  good  industry  practice at the time. 
In broad terms, the starting position at law is that a bank is expected to process  payments and 
withdrawals that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance with the Payment Services 
Regulations and the terms and conditions  of the customers account.  That was the case  in 2017,  and 
remains so now, and I have  taken that into account  when deciding what is fair and reasonable in this 
case.
But that is not the end of the story:  
Regulated firms  like TSB are also required to conduct their business with due skill, care and 
diligence (FCA Principle for Businesses 2) and to pay due regard to the interests of its 
customers (Principle 6). 
Firms  also have a longstanding regulatory duty to take reasonable care to establish and 
maintain effective systems and controls for compliance with applicable requirements and 
standards under  the regulatory  system and for countering the risk that the firm might be used 
to further  financial crime (SYSC 3.2.6R, which  has applied since 2001).  And over the years,  
the FSA and its successor the FCA have published  a series of papers  setting out non-
exhaustive examples of good and poor practice found when reviewing measures taken by 
banks to counter financial  crime.
Ref: DRN575479112Firms  are required to comply with legal  and regulatory anti-money laundering  and countering 
the financing of terrorism requirements.  In July 2017 those requirements  included 
maintaining proportionate  and risk-sensitive policies and procedures to identify, assess  and 
manage money laundering risk  for example  through customer  due diligence measures and 
the ongoing monitoring of the business relationship (including through the scrutiny  of 
transactions undertaken throughout the course of the relationship).   
In addition, as a matter of good industry practice in 2017, I consider firms should  in any event have 
taken proactive steps to: 
identify  and assist  vulnerable consumers  and consumers in vulnerable  circumstances, 
including those at risk of financial exploitation (something also recognised by the FCA in 
recent years and by the British Bankers Associations  February  2016 report  improving 
outcomes for customers in vulnerable circumstances);
look to identify and help prevent transactions  particularly unusual  or out of character 
transactions  that could  involve fraud or be the result of a scam.   
in relation to branch  transactions  follow the Banking Protocol when  available.
In this case, I need to decide whether TSB acted fairly and reasonably in its dealings with Mrs P when 
she made multiple cash withdrawals in its branch, or whether it should  have done more  than it did.
Did TSB act fairly and reasonably  in Mrs Ps case?
Ive taken into account what both parties to the complaint  have said about what went on during  Mrs 
Ps visit to the branch, but Im conscious that memories can fade as time passes  and that, due to her 
health, Mrs P has not been able to provide detailed testimony, and it is not entirely clear precisely  
what cash withdrawals ended up being sent to fraudsters, and what withdrawals may have been for 
other uses. But I understand that the payments  Mrs P made via the money transfer services,  were all 
to the fraudsters.
Alongside this, TSB hasnt provided  any contemporaneous  notes  relating to the cash  withdrawals,  
which is unfortunate in the circumstances.
As Ive explained, as a matter of good practice staff should  have been on the lookout  for unusual and 
out of character transactions.
Having reviewed  Mrs Ps statements,  from October 2016,  Mrs P mostly used the account for the 
receipt of her regular income and for direct  debits.  Its not evident until the beginning of December 
that Mrs P starts to make  cash  withdrawals.  Where I can see she makes several  cash  withdrawals 
between the beginning of December 2016 and the beginning of January 2017.  This correlates with 
when payments started to be made through the money transfer services. With this Im persuaded  its 
more likely  than not that no payments were  made  to the fraudsters before December 2016. 
Ive thought carefully about  these initial withdrawals Mrs P has made, against how Mrs P typically  
operated her account, I consider an unusual pattern of transactions was starting to emerge  and where 
Mrs P was withdrawing over a thousand pounds in cash, I think TSB ought  to have intervened to 
discuss the account activity.  
But at this point I think Mrs P would  have  been able to give plausible and persuasive  answers to the 
bank. She would have been able to explain she was going on a trip to India, that she was purchasing 
a flat in India  and that she already owned a flat in India that she was selling. I think  it more likely than 
not under further questioning, she could  have further explained she had a family member helping  her 
with the purchase  and that her daughters were also investing in the property,  which would have been 
supported by the credits into her account.  She would more likely  than not also have said the flat was 
being built and the builders  had asked for payments in stages, as this is what the fraudsters had 
Ref: DRN575479113instructed her to say. Im mindful Mrs P had convinced her daughters about the purpose of the money 
they were sending  to her and so I think its likely  shed have been able to assure  the bank  of this too.
 
Following the withdrawals in January 2017, there is a break in withdrawals until May 2017.  Mrs Ps 
daughters have said that their mother had travelled  to India  between January 2017 and April 2017,  
which would reasonably  explain this.
However, on her return  from India, Mrs P makes a further cash  withdrawal of £4,000 on       8 May 
2017 and £800 on 10 May 2017. The withdrawals cleared  almost the entirety of     Mrs Ps account  
balance and the £4,000  was larger than any of the previous cash withdrawals.
I dont think a withdrawal of £4,000 was typical of how Mrs P usually  operated her account, so I think  
TSB should have made enquiries  about  the purpose of the withdrawal, before allowing it to be made. 
Had TSB intervened  Id have expected it to ask Mrs P some questions about the withdrawals.  For 
example, it could have asked questions such as, but not limited to, what  the payment was for and why 
was she paying in cash (rather than an alternative method of payment  that may have offered more  
security). 
I do think there comes a point where the answers Mrs P was giving to TSB  to account for the cash  
withdrawals would have started to have become implausible  and it seems strange  that so many cash  
withdrawals, for such large amounts, can go unchallenged. Where Mrs P makes a cash  withdrawal of 
£4,000 on 8 May 2017, I think there was enough going on at this point that TSB ought reasonably to 
have been concerned  and suspicious of the activity  on Mrs Ps account.
While I accept  branch  staff ultimately have  to make decisions  based on information  they are given by 
customers  it is up to branch staff to find out enough  information about the purpose of the payment  
before they make such decisions. In doing  so, given  the unusualness of the transaction, considering 
Mrs Ps age and considering the pattern of spending on the account that had begun to emerge, Im 
persuaded at this point TSB shouldve asked further, more probing, questions  in order to satisfy itself 
Mrs P wasnt likely to be at risk of financial harm,  rather than just accept at face value that the 
purpose of such large and frequent withdrawals was so that she could purchase a flat in India.   
Im not persuaded  its typical for purchases of properties abroad to need to be funded by cash. So I 
think TSB here could reasonably have  asked further questions about  the purchase and importantly I 
think it would have been fair and reasonable for it to have asked to see some paperwork  to support 
what Mrs P was telling it. I dont think Mrs P would have been able to provide any paperwork or 
answer continued  questions feasibly and this would have done nothing to reassure TSB that Mrs P 
wasnt at risk of financial  harm.
I also think  it ought to have been of some significance  to TSB branch staff at the time that Mrs P was 
withdrawing such a large amount of cash, rather than arranging for the payments to be made via bank 
transfer, CHAPS  or cheque. I say this because Im of the view that most  people would likely  feel quite 
vulnerable carrying large amounts of cash  around with them, and I think  this ought  reasonably  to have 
alerted TSB to the possibility that Mrs P might be at risk of financial harm.  And at the very least, Id 
have expected  there to have been some  concern about Mrs Ps personal safety given she would be 
leaving the branch with this amount of cash in her possession.
When thinking  about  this Ive also explored the point  Mrs Ps daughters have raised about Mrs P 
being vulnerable. Im mindful Mrs P was in her late seventies at the time of the scam and I think  this is 
a relevant factor here, as Mrs Ps age profile  is one that is disproportionately targeted by scammers. 
This has been recognised  by the industry for a long time, and more recently by the Banking Protocol 
and the BBAs report improving outcomes for customers in vulnerable circumstances.  Im satisfied 
TSBs branch  staff ought reasonably to have kept this in their mind  at the time Mrs P was making 
these withdrawals - though  its important  to note that branch  staff should be on the lookout for any 
unusual or out of character transactions  whether a customer is vulnerable or not.
Ref: DRN575479114Overall, I dont think Mrs P would  have  been  able to answer follow up questions plausibly and I dont 
think she would have been able to provide any evidence  to support the flat purchase she was saying 
she was intending to make. Ive considered  Mrs P has said she was being  threatened and she may 
not have been forthcoming about what was actually  happening to her. But Mrs P had told her 
daughters about the scam back in the Autumn of 2016 and she told them again  a few months after 
these transactions were made.
So, Im persuaded its more likely than not Mrs P would  have either told TSB what  was happening or 
gone away and told her daughters. From this point on 8 May 2017,  I think  the fraud would have come  
to light and I think  there was an opportunity to stop the fraud. I dont think this or further payments 
would have been made to the scammers  and Mrs P wouldnt  have lost any further money from this 
point. Im persuaded TSB, with its knowledge  of scams, could have spoken to Mrs P about  fraud and 
scams in the context of the withdrawals Mrs P was making and relayed the serious concerns  it ought 
to have had about her being  at risk of financial harm. I think the banks message would  have re-
enforced what Mrs Ps daughters had told her previously and she is more likely than not to have taken 
heed of its advice.  
In any event, while I dont think payments before  this point, on 8 May 201,7 would have appeared  
concerning enough to TSB,  that I think it ought fairly  and reasonably  to have not carried  out Mrs P 
transaction requests.  From  8 May 2017,  where  Mrs P is likely have been unable  to provide any 
supporting paperwork for the property purchase and faced with an elderly customer  making  
substantial and frequent  cash withdrawals, I think TSB ought to have been suspicious enough to have 
not processed the transactions to protect Mrs P, even if she had been inclined to carry  on with them.
What should TSB refund?
When answering this question, Ive thought carefully about what  TSBs obligations were, as set out 
above. But another key issue is whether Mrs P acted reasonably taking into account  all the 
circumstances of the scam and taking into account that its not entirely  clear what funds  went to the 
fraudsters and what may have been  was used for other purposes.
From the receipts and information I have from the money transfer  service companies, I can see that 
from 8 May 2017, Mrs P made transfers totalling £81,751.02, broken down  between  the two 
companies as follows:
Company  A £25,568.02
Company  B £56,183.00
I consider these to be the fairest and most reliable figures to use, when considering what  I think  TSB 
ought to refund.  
But, I do have some  concerns about how readily  Mrs P fell for this scam having  been approached,  out 
of the blue,  and being told shed won millions of dollars in a lottery. She willingly handed over a 
considerable amount of money  to the fraudsters based on very little evidence to support  the claims  
they were making about  the lottery win. Im also conscious Mrs P has said she had never even 
entered the lottery.
I do have empathy for Mrs P, that shes said she and her son were threatened  if they didnt comply 
with the fraudsters demands. But I cant ignore that at the outset she was to gain financially from the 
transaction. And she was willing to mislead her daughters and the bank  by giving false  reasons  for 
borrowing money  from them   in order to get the money she needed to proceed with the transaction 
and from which she expected  to draw a considerable monetary benefit.
I think,  in these circumstances, it wouldve been more difficult for the bank  to accurately assess 
whether or not she was at risk of financial harm so that it could easily  unravel the scam and/or or 
break the spell which Mrs P was acting  under  (albeit, for the reasons  explained I think  there was still 
enough going  on that TSB ought to have realised Mrs P may have been at risk). Im also conscious 
Ref: DRN575479115that in the Autumn of 2016, Mrs Ps daughters  had warned her that she was being  scammed and told 
her she shouldnt  send any payments  yet Mrs P still went ahead and made  payments  to the 
fraudsters. 
Im also conscious that it doesnt feel entirely fair to hold a bank liable for the entire  loss an individual 
suffers, when that loss has resulted from the individual misleading the bank for  at least in part  her 
own personal  gain. 
Ive already covered  how and why I think  TSB ought  to have  intervened, and the likely impact of this. 
And I think TSB was at fault for allowing some of the cash withdrawals to be made. But I also think it 
fair that Mrs P takes a share of the blame  for her losses, due to her own actions and/or omissions.
So, overall,  while I think  TSB ought to have  done  more to satisfy itself that Mrs P was not falling  victim 
to a scam. I dont currently  think  it would  be fair to say it should refund the entire  amount, from the 
point Ive identified as where it ought to have intervened.
For all the reasons Ive explained, I think its fair and reasonable to instruct  TSB to refund 50% of the 
total transfers Mrs P made through the two money transfer service  companies between 8 May 2017 
and 29 September 2017, being the point at which  Ive explained I think TSB ought to have intervened, 
where I reasonably think it would have made a difference.  
Additional compensation
The investigator recommended  that TSB should pay £500 compensation in recognition of any trouble 
or upset caused to Mrs P.
Mrs Ps daughters have  told us the scam  has caused Mrs P mental  health issues and made her 
unwell. I acknowledge the main perpetrator here is the fraudster, but I see no reason  not to award  this 
sum given that at least some of the anxiety  and distress Mrs P has suffered wouldve been  avoided if 
TSB had met its obligations  in protecting Mrs P from financial harm.
my provisional  decision
My provisional  decision  is that I intend on upholding this complaint in part and instructing TSB Bank 
Plc to:
refund any interest and charges Mrs P has paid on the loan she took out for £25,000 in May 
2017
remove the loan account  from her credit file
refund Mrs P £40,875.51 (being 50% of the total payments made  through the two money  
transfer service  companies between 8 May 2017  and 29 September 2017)  
TSB should pay Mrs P 8% interest on the amount  of £40,875.51 (from  the date of transaction  
to the date of reimbursement)
pay Mrs P £500  for the trouble and upset caused
