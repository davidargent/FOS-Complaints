K821x#15complaint
Miss K complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.
 
background
Miss K was given 11 loans by QuickQuid between October 2016 and December 2017. Apart 
from the first and last loans all of Miss Ks borrowing  was repaid on or before the agreed 
date. Miss K was unable  to repay the first loan when it was due so deferred her repayment  
for a month by paying  some  additional interest.  And after topping up her final loan, by taking 
some additional  borrowing  shortly after the original  loan,  Miss K still had an outstanding 
balance when she made her complaint to the lender. A summary of Miss Ks borrowing from 
QuickQuid is as follows;

Miss Ks complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think that 
QuickQuid should  have agreed  to lend to Miss K after,  and including,  the fifth loan that she 
was given at the end of May 2017. So he asked QuickQuid to pay Miss K some 
compensation.
QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Miss K accepts my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN32018972QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Miss K could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These  checks  could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Miss K could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ks complaint.
The repayments on Miss Ks first four loans were relatively modest  compared  to the income  
that she declared to QuickQuid. And although she had failed  to repay her first loan on time 
I dont think that should  necessarily have given QuickQuid significant concerns about  her 
financial situation. So given  Miss Ks repayment amounts, what was apparent about her 
circumstances at the time, and her history  with the lender, I dont think  it wouldve been  
proportionate for QuickQuid to ask her for the amount of information that would be needed to 
show the lending  was unsustainable.   
Ref: DRN32018973And there wasnt anything  in the information  Miss K provided or the information QuickQuid 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
she was saying.  So I dont think QuickQuid was wrong to give these  four loans to Miss K.
But, looking  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids  lending history with Miss K, I think by loan 5 
the lender should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful. And so QuickQuid should  have realised that it shouldnt  provide any further loans. 
I say this because:
By the time Miss K asked for loan 3 shed been  borrowing from QuickQuid for a 
lengthy period  and she wasnt making any inroads  to the amount she owed the 
lender. Her fifth loan was by far the largest she had taken  to date.  By then Miss K 
had paid a considerable amount of interest  to QuickQuid  to effectively service a debt 
over an extended period.
From  loan 5 onwards  Miss K was borrowing regularly  and repeatedly from 
QuickQuid. So QuickQuid  ought  to have realised  it was more likely  than not Miss K 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances and that Miss Ks indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably. 
Although there were  some gaps, of up to three  weeks,  between  Miss K repaying a 
loan and asking  to borrow again, I dont  think it would have been reasonable for 
QuickQuid to conclude  these  were any indication that Miss Ks finances had moved  
on from whatever situation had required  her previous loans. 
I think that Miss K lost out because  QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ks indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Ks 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 11 and QuickQuid should  put things right.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Miss K after, and including, the loan 
that she took on 30 May 2017 (loan 5). So for each of those loans QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Miss K on the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loan 5 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  5 to 11 should be removed from Miss Ks 
credit file.
Ref: DRN32018974*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss K a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
If Miss K still owes QuickQuid any of the principal balance she borrowed on her final loan, 
QuickQuid may deduct this from the compensation that is due to her. But, to be clear,  that 
outstanding balance should be recalculated to remove any interest and charges, but taking 
account of any repayments Miss K has made on that loan as though they were  applied 
against the principal sum borrowed.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Miss Ks complaint and direct CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 June 2019.
