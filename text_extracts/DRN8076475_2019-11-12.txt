Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint in part and thought loans 6 to 13 shouldnt  have 
been given. Sunny disagreed so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN80764752But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
There was a significant break in Mr Hs borrowing  from Sunny. There was a gap of just over 
two years between loans 13 and 14. I think it would have been  reasonable for Sunny to view 
this gap as an indication that Mr Hs finances had stabilised after whatever the 
circumstances that had caused him to take out his previous loans. So I will look at Mr Hs 
borrowing in two separate lending chains.
The first chain was made up of loans 1 to 13, and the second loans 14 to 18. I agree with the 
adjudicator, and for the same  reasons,  that there was nothing to indicate  Sunny needed to 
do more when it approved loans 1 to 2 and 14 to 17. And whilst I also think  it should have 
carried out more  checks for loans  3 to 5 and loan 18, I havent seen any evidence  that better  
information would have made  a difference to its lending decisions.  So I dont think  Sunny 
was wrong to give loans  1 to 5 and loans 14 to 18 to Mr H.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history  with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN80764753Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached at loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr H was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr H had taken out six loans in under six months. When Mr H took out 
loan 6 hed only recently repaid loans 3 and 5. So Sunny ought to have realised it 
was more likely than not Mr H was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying previous  loan(s) was leaving  in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Hs first loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £300. This amount was higher than 
three of his previous five loans. At this point  Sunny  ought  to have known that Mr H 
was not likely borrowing  to meet a temporary  shortfall in their income  but to meet  an 
ongoing need. 
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. He had taken 
out 13 loans (looking solely at the first lending chain)  in the 12 months after his first 
loan. Sunny ought to have known that Mr H was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. Mr H had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because Sunny provided  loans  6 to 13 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
giving  these loans  was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Hs ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
I have carefully considered Sunnys  response  to our adjudicators view. In summary, it 
explained the checks it had carried out on eligibility,  affordability and credit worthiness 
setting out why it felt the loans were affordable. It also disagreed with our adjudicators  
finding that Mr Hs pattern  of borrowing suggested hed become reliant on its loans, pointing 
to the gap between loans  13 and 14 and other  shorter gaps. As I said earlier,  I agree it was 
reasonable for Sunny to conclude Mr Hs finances had stabilised after loan 13 and thats  why 
loans 14 onwards have been  reviewed as a separate  lending chain. I disagree that there 
were any other gaps long enough for Sunny to conclude Mr H wasnt reliant on its loans for 
the reasons set out above. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 13, and Sunny should put things right.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 6 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 means  any information  recorded about loans 6 
to 13 is adverse, so the entries about loans 6 to 13 should be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file.
Ref: DRN80764754 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should pay Mr H compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 December  2019.
