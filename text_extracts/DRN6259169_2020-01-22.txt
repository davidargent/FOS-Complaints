K822xcomplaint
Mr O and Ms O have  complained that National Westminster Bank Plc has provided  poor 
service and treated  them unfairly during an ongoing period of financial difficulty. They want  
NatWest to agree to payment  arrangements  with them on their mortgage which  will not be 
reported on their credit  files. 
Mr O has also complained  about  a lack of assistance from NatWest in relation to an 
unsecured personal  loan in his sole name.
To settle  the complaint, Mr O and Ms O want NatWest to put the mortgage on an interest-
only basis or agree to a reduced  payment plan without any impact on their credit files.
The complaint has been brought with the help of family members,  but I will refer to 
Mr O and Ms O throughout.
background 
Mr O and Ms O have  a repayment mortgage with NatWest secured on their home.  I am very 
sorry to note that Mr O has been  diagnosed with a serious illness.  Mr O and Ms O 
approached NatWest to see what help the bank could give them.
After looking at their income and expenditure, NatWest said it could  offer a payment 
concession where  it would agree to accept a reduced amount each month for several  
months, reviewing the situation from time to time.  Technically,  this would mean  that the 
mortgage would then be in arrears. But given  Mr Os situation,  NatWest said it would not 
take any action  over this. But NatWest  explained  that arrears  would be reported on 
Mr O and Ms Os credit  files.
Mr O and Ms O wouldnt agree to this because they dont want any arrangement to impact 
on their credit files. For the present time their daughter  is helping  her parents with their 
mortgage repayments, but cant do this indefinitely.
Mr O and Ms O complained to NatWest.  They say theyve been  treated unsympathetically 
and that the solutions  NatWest has offered them will not be of benefit to them if their credit 
files are affected
NatWest acknowledged  it should have identified Mr O and Ms O as vulnerable customers  
when they first contacted the bank.  NatWest was also satisfied that there  had been some  
customer service  failings  in relation to the information given  to Mr and Ms O about their 
credit files. 
NatWest offered £75 for any trouble and upset caused by its poor customer service, along 
with £10.80 for the cost of telephone  calls.  But NatWest explained that as a responsible 
lender it wasnt able to offer any further  concessions beyond those already offered.
Mr O and Ms O complained to us. An investigator  looked at the complaint but didnt  think  
NatWest had acted  unfairly by not agreeing to concessions without being allowed  to report  
these on Mr O and Ms Os credit files. But he thought NatWest should  pay compensation of 
£150 for poor customer service, which the bank agreed to do.
Ref: DRN62591692Mr O and Ms O didnt  accept the investigators findings. They maintain that NatWest should 
be offering them solutions to their financial difficulties which wont affect their credit files.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I confirm Ive read everything provided  by 
Mr O and Ms O and NatWest. I note Mr O and Ms Os daughter  wanted  to speak with me 
about the complaint. But Im satisfied that the documents  on file set out clearly  the issues  in 
the complaint  and the viewpoints of the parties  on those issues.
I am very sorry  to learn of Mr Os illness. I have no doubt this has been  a very upsetting time 
for the family. But I have to put aside my natural empathy  for Mr O and Ms O and decide the 
case impartially and fairly, without being  swayed  by emotion.
The starting point  is that lenders have a duty to treat all customers, but particularly those 
facing financial hardship, fairly. Balanced against that, one of the fundamental principles 
underpinning the mortgage contract is that a lender has the right to receive payment of the 
money owed to it. 
The Mortgages and Home Finance: Conduct  of Business Sourcebook (known  as MCOB)  
sets out at MCOB 13 what lenders are required to do to help borrowers in arrears. The 
Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML)  also has its own guidelines about what it expects 
lenders to do to comply  with MCOB, which mirror closely  the requirements  of MCOB.
A lender is required to explore ways  to resolve an arrears situation, especially if the problem 
that created  the arrears to begin  with is one that looks to be short-term and capable  of being 
resolved.
For long-term difficulties, a lender must also look at other ways  to help, such transferring  a 
mortgage from capital  and interest  repayment to interest-only for a period of time, deferring 
interest for a period  of time or capitalisation of arrears.  Balanced  against that is the lenders 
obligation to ensure that any arrangement is affordable and sustainable.  
The lender  is required to report accurate information to credit  reference agencies about  the 
account, including any arrangements to pay or missed payments. Usually the lenders  right 
to do this forms part of the terms and conditions  which apply to the loan. 
Im satisfied that NatWest  has explored  the ways  in which it could  offer help to 
Mr O and Ms O. Unfortunately they dont meet NatWests criteria  to have the mortgage 
transferred onto an interest-only  basis  permanently.  But NatWest  is willing  to consider  an 
interest-only concession,  subject to review from time to time. NatWest is also prepared to 
consider a payment holiday. 
But both these solutions would involve NatWest reporting the arrangement  and the payment 
shortfalls to the credit  reference agencies. Whilst I acknowledge Mr O and Ms O dont want  
NatWest to do this, Im satisfied that its not unfair or unreasonable  for the bank to report the 
true position  on the account,  if any arrangement is put in place.  Data  protection  law requires  
that information recorded on Mr O and Ms Os credit files is an accurate reflection of their 
credit history.
Ref: DRN62591693Mr O also has a personal loan with NatWest, and has complained about the lack of help with 
this. Neither Mr O nor NatWest has been able to provide  a copy  of the loan agreement, so 
Ive not been able to ascertain the terms and conditions which  apply to it. This means  that I 
can only comment generally on this part of the complaint.  
I would expect NatWest  to treat Mr O sympathetically in relation to this loan, particularly 
given his vulnerability. But this does not override NatWests obligation to report any 
arrangement to credit reference agencies. 
I see that on its website  NatWest refers customers who are already, or who may in the near 
future be, in financial difficulty  to a free debt advisory service,  PayPlan. There are also other 
free debt advisory  services available, such as StepChange, Citizens  Advice  or Shelter.  We 
can provide Mr O and Ms O with details  of these, if they would like them.
I see that NatWest has acknowledged  that its customer  service could have been better. I 
think the £150 its agreed to pay as compensation is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances. But Im unable to uphold the complaint that NatWest has treated 
Mr O and Ms O unfairly in relation to assisting  them  with their financial difficulties.
I know this isnt the outcome Mr O and Ms O were  hoping for, and I am truly sorry if my 
decision adds to their distress. I would urge Mr O and Ms O to maintain  an open dialogue 
with NatWest about their mortgage and Mr Os personal loan. 
my final decision
My decision  is that National Westminster Bank Plc must pay Mr O and Ms O £150 
compensation for poor customer  service.  I make no other order or award.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O and Ms O to 
accept or reject my decision  before  22 February  2020.
