The complaint
Mr B complains that his wifes credit card limit with NewDay Ltd was reduced while his
remained the same. He advises that he is autistic and further complains that NewDay failed
to make reasonable adjustments when communicating with him and closing his account.
What happened
In August 2022 Mr Bs wifes credit card limit was reduced by NewDay whilst his remained
the same. He complained of discrimination and asked for his account to be closed. The
account was duly closed but Mr B didnt receive any information about it before closure. He
also complained about the way NewDay communicated with him and said this was
discrimination on the grounds of his disability.
NewDay said there was no discrimination in the way it dealt with his account. It apologised
for not adding one email to an email trail (as hed requested) and for not giving him the
closure information required before closing his account. It offered him £60 for the trouble and
upset.
On referral to the Financial Ombudsman Service our Investigator said that NewDay should
write to Mr B explaining what was considered when it reviewed his account, and pay him a
further £200.
NewDay disagreed, though did say that its final response letters could have been clearer. It
offered a further £50.
I issued a provisional decision. In it I said that I thought NewDay had acted reasonably. 
I pointed out that I had based my decision on what I thought was fair and reasonable and if 
Mr B wanted a decision that NewDay had breached the Equality Act 2010, then hed need to 
go to Court.
I understand that the initial £60 offered by NewDay hasnt yet been paid.
NewDay accepted my provisional decision.
Mr B was unhappy that I had gone against the recommendation of a payment of £200. He 
further said that:
In the Ombudsman's view, keep to this email trail only, does not mean keep to this email 
trail. How to say you discriminate against autistic people without saying it.
Also the Ombudsman plays on semantics regarding neurodiversity.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My provisional findings are set out below, in italics:
not reviewing the credit limit
First of all Mr Bs original complaint is that NewDay discriminated against his wife and for
that reason was closing his account. He later expanded on that to complain that NewDay
was positively discriminating in his favour.
I dont intend to discuss Mr Bs wifes account here for data protection reasons. NewDay
didnt take any steps in relation to Mr Bs account either positive or negative. So I dont think
it could be said it was acting in a way that was unfavourable towards Mr B. And as no action
was taken by NewDay in respect of his account, any explanation it gave would be to
describe a hypothetical situation. So I cant really see what further action it could take. I note
NewDays offer of a further £50 . Whilst I note the offer I wont be requiring it to pay that. Its
a matter for NewDay if it wants to pay it voluntarily, and for Mr B if he wants to accept it..
communication
Mr B complains that having asked for communication in one email trail, and for
communication by email NewDay sent him two letters by post and failed to attach one email
to an email trail. I agree that it should have followed Mr Bs instructions in that respect.
In his original letter of complaint Mr B said I am autistic and work with clarity, order and
organisation. Keep to this e-mail trail - and do not start a new one. He didnt specifically say
he preferred all communication by email until his email of 27 October 2022. He received two
letters by post, dated 20 October 2022, one acknowledging the complaint and the other
advising that the investigation was taking longer than expected. Whilst I can understand that
Mr B didnt want to receive letters by post, these were automatically produced and before
Mr B told NewDay he preferred email communication.
Mr B also complained of the language used in NewDays communications with him, saying it
was passive aggressive and discriminatory in respect of his disability. Without going into
detail about the emails themselves I dont think there was anything wrong in the language
used, and I think NewDay acted reasonably in that respect.
closure of the account
Mr B said in his first communication with NewDay that he wanted his account closed. But he
thought hed be receiving instructions about what he should do in preparation for closure. So
he was disturbed to find when he attempted to look up his account, that it had been closed.
NewDay said it should have given him details as to what would now happen before closing
his account. It apologised for not doing this, and paid Mr B £60 for the trouble and upset
caused. I understand that Mr B wanted clarity and that it would have been disturbing to him
to find the account had been closed without any instructions or advice coming to him from
NewDay. But I think NewDay acted reasonably in paying him the £60 and apologising.
Mr B has complained that NewDay has failed to make reasonable adjustments for him. In
other words it has failed in its duty to make reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act
2010. Ive taken the Equality Act 2010 into account when deciding this complaint  given that
its relevant law  but Ive ultimately decided this complaint based on whats fair and
reasonable. If Mr B wants a decision that NewDay has breached the Equality Act 2010, then
hed need to go to Court.
To be clear, the £200 was recommended by our Investigator at the Financial Ombudsman 
Service. The FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) hasnt been involved with this complaint. 
Mr B was advised (in our Investigators email of 31 March 2023) that if the Ombudsmans conclusions are different (from the Investigators), they will explain why and let
him (Mr B) reply before they give (him) their decision. This was the reason for my making 
provisional findings.
Im sorry that Mr B feels that I didnt consider his request that NewDay keep to the email trail. 
And that I played on semantics. All I can say is that as I have found, NewDay did fail to keep 
to the email trail in respect of one email. And that the letters were sent automatically before 
Mr B said he wanted all communication to be by email. That said I can understand his 
annoyance at getting two letters by post at the same time.
I understand that the £60 proposed by NewDay in its final response letter hasnt been paid  
I will remedy that by making an award for that sum. This is different from the further £50 
offered by NewDay after our Investigators view which, as I said  in my provisional finding, I 
wont order it to pay  its a matter for NewDay if it wants to pay it voluntarily, and for Mr B if 
he wants to accept it.
I remain persuaded by my provisional findings. These are now final and form part of this final 
decision.
My final decision
NewDay has already made an offer to pay £60 to settle the complaint and I think this offer is 
fair in all the circumstances.
So my decision is that NewDay should pay Mr B £60.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 October 2023.
