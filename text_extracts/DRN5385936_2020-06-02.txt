Mr H complains Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent to him 
irresponsibly.
Background
Mr H took one running credit account (RCF) and then 10 instalment loans. Ive included  
some of the information  weve  received  about  these loans from Sunny in the table  below.

11 £350 30/05/2015 07/09/2016
Loan 1, is a RCF, is different to the instalment loans that Mr H took afterwards. The RCF 
allows a consumer to either request funds up to their agreed credit  limit in one go or take 
multiple drawdowns up to their limit. Mr H had a credit limit of £350.  Each  drawdown  could  
be repaid via five monthly instalments. 
In our latest  assessment our adjudicator thought proportionate checks  would have shown
Mr H was having difficulty managing his finances  when loan 2 was given. So he didnt think  
Sunny should  have  lent loan 2 or subsequent  loans.  This adjudicator also thought  the 
pattern of lending showed  that loans 6 to 11 werent  sustainable.  
Mr H agrees with the latest adjudicators assessment. Sunny hasnt replied. But, Sunny had 
previously accepted that something may have gone wrong when it provided  loan 11, so it 
agreed to refund interest  on this loan together with 8% simple  interest.  It also agreed to 
amend Mr Hs credit file to reflect its offer. Mr H didnt accept this offer when it was made.   
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed  to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN53859362Mr H doesnt appear  to disagree  with our adjudicators findings that Sunny wasnt  wrong  to 
grant the RCF. It seems therefore that this lending isnt in dispute and so I no longer think 
that I need to make  a finding  about  it. 
Ive also not considered whether Sunny should  have lent loan 11 as it has already agreed  it 
shouldnt. But for clarity  Ive set out how Sunny should amend Mr Hs credit  file for this loan.   
So instead,  this decision will focus on whether Sunny  did anything wrong when it lent loans 2
to 10. But I have kept the other lending in mind when thinking  about the overall  lending  
relationship between Sunny and Mr H. 
For the lending  that remains in dispute, Sunny had to assess  if Mr H could afford to pay back 
the amounts hed borrowed without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which  was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could  have taken  into account a number  
of different  things, such as how much was being  lent, the size of the repayments and Mr Hs 
income and expenditure. With this in mind,  I think in the early  stages  of a lending  
relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr H. These factors include:
Mr H having a low income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr H having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr H coming  back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr H.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr H could  sustainably repay his instalment loans 
 not just whether he technically had enough money  to make his repayments. Having 
enough money to make  the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mr H was able 
to repay  his loans  sustainably.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. The 
Financial Conduct  Authoritys (the industry  regulatory)  says in the Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC) states payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and in particular, made  on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and 
without having  to borrow to make  them.  If a lender realises, or ought reasonably  to have 
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, 
then it follows that it should  conclude those  repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Hs complaint.
Ref: DRN53859363Our adjudicator thought Sunny shouldve realised by the time he applied for loan 2, that Mr H 
would have struggled to repay this and further loans in a sustainable way. This is because 
the adjudicator  felt proportionate checks would have  shown Mr H had a significant amount of 
outstanding short-term lending with other lenders that needed to be repaid.  
I can see that Mr H declared a monthly  income  of £1,300 and monthly expenses of £12 
when loan 2 was lent. This figure seems fairly small for a monthly outgoings. But,  I 
understand that Sunny used a notional figure of £175 for expenses when it assessed  
whether the loan was affordable. Its not clear  why £175 was used and so I cant  really  make 
a finding as to whether this was a fair amount.  I do think however that further  checks should 
have been completed by Sunny in order verify  the seemingly  low expenses Mr H declared. 
So, Ive considered what Sunny would most likely  have seen if it had completed further 
checks. 
Mr H has provided bank  statements,  which is one way Sunny could have completed further 
checks - and from what I can see, he had regular expenses  of around £80 and was making 
some payments for food and travel. I can also see that its likely Sunny would have also 
known that Mr H had taken short term loans on five occasions in the month  before loan two 
was taken with over £1,000 that needed to be repaid. So, I think  by completing  further  
checks, the information Sunny would  have gathered would have shown that Mr H was 
having problems  managing his money. In these circumstances, I think  it ought  to have 
realised it was unlikely  he would have been  able to sustainably repay loan 2  and any 
subsequent loans. 
Having looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr H, I also agree with 
our adjudicator that Sunny  should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided loan 6. I say this because:
By loan 6 it was almost eight  months into the lending  relationship  with no significant 
breaks between  loans.  Mr H had drawn down six times under the RCF and then 
taken a further five instalment loans, some  of which overlapped. In my view, Mr Hs 
loan history up until this point was a clear  indication that his underlying financial 
situation didnt seem to be improving. 
The RCFs drawdowns and the instalment loans show a broadly similar pattern of 
borrowing. Mr H initially took a total of £275  through the first three  drawdowns  in    
July 2014 and then topped  up the RCF three  times to the credit limit of £350. And 
through his instalment  loans, in January  2015  Mr H borrowed £350 followed  by £200 
in February 2015 and £350  in March 2015.  I think its most likely this consistent 
pattern of borrowing  over the period showed that Mr H didnt just have  a short-term 
cash-flow problem  but was probably supporting regular living expenses or other  
financial commitments.     
Mr Hs lending history was prolonged and continued into April and May 2015.  Indeed,  
by May 2015, ten months into the lending relationship, Mr Hs finances didnt seem  to 
be improving when a £600 loan was provided,  his highest monthly borrowing. The 
amount of time that Mr H spent indebted  to Sunny also meant  that he was servicing a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out when Sunny provided loans 6 to 11 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period and;
Ref: DRN53859364the sheer number  of loans and time in debt was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Hs complaint about  loans  2 to 11. And Ive set out what  Sunny should  
do to put things right as detailed below.
Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loan 2 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 2 to 5 from Mr Hs credit file;
remove loans 6 to 11 from Mr Hs credit  file entirely, this is because the period of time 
Mr H owed Sunny money means that any information  still recorded about these loans 
is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Hs complaint.  
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr H as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 July 2020.
