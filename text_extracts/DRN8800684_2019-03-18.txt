K821x#15complaint
Mr and Mrs M complain  about the administration  of their share dealing account (account) 
by Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays). They say that Barclays administration of their 
account has caused them a financial loss and a degree of trouble and upset for which they 
should be fairly compensated.
Mr and Mrs Ms account is managed  by Barclays on a platform called, or known as, 
Smart Investor.
background
Mr and Mrs M say that they wanted to sell 1,200 shares they held in Prudential PLC on 
29 December 2017, but they were unable to do so because  of maladministration by 
Barclays. Mr and Mrs M were eventually  able to sell their 1,200 Prudential  PLC shares on 
8 February 2018.
Barclays considered  Mr and Mrs Ms complaint. It accepted there  had been  some 
maladministration on its part for which it was prepared to pay £350. But it said it wasnt 
prepared to pay anything  for the movement in the Prudential PLC share price between  
29 December 2017 and 8 February  2018.
Mr and Mrs Ms complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators who concluded it 
should be upheld.  In summary he said he was persuaded that on the balance of probabilities 
Mr and Mrs M wanted to sell their Prudential PLC shares on 29 December  2017,  and had it 
not been for Barclays  maladministration,  they would have done so. And because  
Mr and Mrs M were  unable to sell their Prudential PLC shares on 29 December 2017 
(ultimately selling them on 8 February  2018), they had suffered a loss of £1,344 
(1,200 x (£19.055 - £17.935)).
By way of compensation the adjudicator said Barclays  should  pay Mr and Mrs M this 
identified loss of £1,344  plus:
Interest on the sum of £1,344 from 8 February  2018 to date of settlement (at 8% 
simple per annum)
Interest on the sum of £22,866 (1,200 x £19.055) from 29 December 2017 to 
8 February 2018 (at 8% simple  per annum)
£350 for the trouble  and upset this matter had caused them.
Mr and Mrs M responded to the adjudicators view to say that it thought Barclays should  pay 
them £500  for trouble and upset, rather than £350.  They also said that Barclays  own notes 
show it was aware of their intention  to sell on 13 January 2018,  meaning that their loss is 
arguably higher  than £1,344.
Barclays responded to the adjudicators view to say it didnt agree with it. In summary it said 
it wasnt persuaded that Mr and Mrs M wanted  to sell, or would have sold,  their 
Prudential PLC shares before they did. They also questioned why Mr and Mrs M had raised 
their various concerns  with a branch of Barclays, rather than Smart Investor directly.
Ref: DRN88006842my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I can confirm that Ive 
come to the same overall conclusion as the adjudicator and for broadly the same  reasons.
Its clear that both parties have strong feelings  about this complaint. Both have provided 
detailed submissions in support  of their respective views which  I can confirm Ive read and 
considered in their entirety. However,  I trust that the parties will not take the fact that my 
findings focus on what I consider to be the central  issues, and that they are expressed in 
considerably less detail, as a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address  every  
point raised, but to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them. 
I would also point out that where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory,  I 
make my decision  on the balance of probabilities   that is, what  I consider  is most likely to 
have happened  given the evidence that is available and the wider surrounding 
circumstances. 
Its not in dispute  that Mr and Mrs M sold their Prudential PLC shares  on 8 February 2018. 
Its also not in dispute  that Mr and Mrs M were unable, or would have been  unable, to sell 
their Prudential PLC shares between  29 December 2017 and 7 February 2018 had they 
wanted to.
So in essence what I need to decide  in this case is:
did Mr and Mrs M want to sell their Prudential  PLC shares  before 8 February  2018,  
and if so on what date
what loss, if any, have Mr and Mrs M suffered as a result  of selling their 
Prudential PLC shares on 8 February 2018  rather than on a date between  
29 December 2017 and 7 February  2018
what, if anything,  Barclays should have to pay Mr and Mrs M for the trouble and 
upset its maladministration of their account  has caused them
This is a finely balanced case, with Mr and Mrs M saying they wanted to sell, and would 
have sold, their Prudential  PLC shares before  8 February 2018  (had they been able to) and 
with Barclays saying  Mr and Mrs M didnt want to sell, nor did they express a desire  to sell, 
their Prudential PLC shares until they did (or just immediately prior to doing  so).
Mrs M called  Barclays on 29 December 2017. Now I accept that in this call Mrs M didnt say 
that she and Mr M wanted to sell their Prudential PLC shares and that they were  unable to 
do so. I also accept that 29 December 2017  was the last date by which Mrs M needed to 
update her details  (for reasons not material to this complaint) in order that she and Mr M 
could trade  without restrictions going  forward, and that being  unable to update her details 
(rather than being unable to place  a particular trade) might have been the only reason for her 
calling. 
Ref: DRN88006843But equally,  Im not persuaded  that Mrs M would have thought to have brought to Barclays 
attention during this call, based  on my view of how this call went and was conducted, that 
she and Mr M wanted to sell their Prudential PLC shares and they were unable  to do so. 
Furthermore, I think it should have been  apparent to Barclays  that if Mrs M was unable to 
update her details,  because  of its maladministration, then she and Mr M might be deprived 
the opportunity  of being able to sell their Prudential PLC shares, or buy or sell any other  
lines of stock, going forward.
Following the above  call, and at Barclays suggestion, Mrs M (and Mr M) visited a branch. 
They did this on 13 January 2018.
Now I accept that I cant say for certain  what was discussed during this branch visit, which it 
should be remembered was at Barclays suggestion. But based  on Barclays own notes 
dated 31 January  2018 about  this visit (and possibly further contact from Mr and Mrs M after 
13 January 2018) Im satisfied that on the balance of probabilities some sort of conversation  
around Mr and Mrs M wanting to sell, or having  wanted to sell, their Prudential PLC shares  
took place.
I also accept that selling their Prudential PLC shares when they did isnt conclusive evidence  
of a desire on Mr and Mrs Ms part to have  sold them any sooner. But I find that given 
Mr and Mrs M sold their prudential PLC shares  as soon as they were able to, to be indicative 
of such a desire.
So taking everything into account Im satisfied that in the particular circumstances of this 
case Mr and Mrs M wanted  to sell their Prudential PLC shares before they did and that they 
were prevented from doing so by Barclays maladministration. And that Mr and Mrs Ms 
desire in this respect was either known, or should  have been  known, to Barclays some  time 
well before 8 February 2018.
So what  I now need to decide is when Mr and Mrs M would have sold their Prudential PLC 
shares had it not been for Barclays  maladministration.
In response to the adjudicators view Mr and Mrs M suggest that a date of mid-January 2018 
should be taken  as the date they would have  sold their Prudential PLC shares.  But I find 
Mr and Mrs Ms original  submission that they wanted to sell their Prudential  PLC shares on 
29 December 2017 to be both plausible and persuasive and the fairest  date against which 
their loss should be assessed.
Finally I can see that Barclays have questioned why Mr and Mrs M raised their various 
concerns with a branch of Barclays, rather than Smart Investor directly. But in my view 
Mr and Mrs M did this because that is what they were  advised to do. 
Having listened  to Mrs Ms call to Barclays on 29 December 2017 its my understanding  that 
she was put through to Smart Investor  and it was it who advised her (and Mr M) to go to a 
branch.
I dont underestimate  the trouble and upset  this whole  matter has caused  Mr and Mrs M. But 
taking everything into account Im satisfied that £350  represents an appropriate sum for 
Barclays to have to pay in this respect. I would also add that our awards for trouble and 
upset are designed to compensate the consumer (in this case Mr and Mrs M) not to fine or 
penalise Barclays.
Ref: DRN88006844my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and Barclays  Bank UK PLC must pay 
Mr and Mrs M:
£1,344 representing the difference in the approximate Prudential  PLC share price on 
29 December 2017 and 8 January 2018  (1,200 x (£19.055  - £17.935)).
Interest on the sum of £1,344 from 8 February  2018 to date of settlement (at 8% 
simple per annum)  this is for Mr and Mrs M being  deprived this sum of money since  
8 February 2018.
Interest on the sum of £22,866 (1,200 x £19.055) from 29 December 2017 to 
7 February 2018 (at 8% simple  per annum)  this is for Mr and Mrs M being  deprived 
this sum of money  between 29 December 2017  and 7 February 2018.
£350 for the trouble  and upset this whole matter  has caused Mr and Mrs M.
If Barclays Bank UK PLC considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs  to withhold 
income tax from the above interest, it should tell Mr and Mrs M how much its taken off. It 
should also give Mr and Mrs M a tax deduction certificate  if they ask for one, so they can 
reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs M to 
accept or reject my decision  before  18 April 2019.
