K820x#14complaint
Mrs J says she was mis-sold a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy.
I cant consider this complaint against  the policy seller directly because  the sale took place 
before it, or its predecessor-in-title, was regulated by the then Financial Services Authority 
(FSA) for insurance intermediation activities, or otherwise covered by our jurisdiction.
The party that at the time of the sale was the policy insurer, has accepted that the seller  was 
acting as its agent at the time - so it accepted responsibility for the sale.  Following a transfer 
of business, AXA France IARD (AXA)  has taken on that responsibility.  To keep things 
simple, Ill only refer to AXA in this decision, rather than any other business.
background and summary to complaint
Mrs J bought the policy at a meeting  in 2001 at the same time as taking a store card.  She 
was employed at the time as a teacher and had been there  four years. Shes  told us of a 
minor operation she had six years before the sale. She hasnt told us of having any problems 
after that as a result of that health  issue or its treatment  or of having suffered  any other 
health issues before the sale.
Mrs J has told us she was entitled to less than six but at least  three months full sick pay and 
at least 12 months redundancy pay. She hasnt said this was 12 months full pay  and, 
considering all shes told us about  her job role, benefits and length of service,  I think  it likely 
Mrs Js redundancy entitlement at the time of the sale wasnt  worth  as much as 12 months 
full pay. Mrs J has told us that, aside  from her work  benefits,  she didnt have any other 
means with which  to pay her card if she couldnt work.
The PPI policy provided cover for accident,  sickness and unemployment, and life cover,  
subject to its exclusions and limitations. For a successful disability or unemployment claim, it 
offered to pay 15% of Mrs Js card balance. It cost at the time £1 per £100 of the monthly 
outstanding balance. The premium still had to be paid during a successful  claim and 
attracted interest. The life cover,  subject to its terms, would clear  the balance  on death.  
The policy also provided purchase protection and price protection  - Mrs J hasnt  complained 
about this element of the insurance policy so I will not consider  it further  in this decision. 
 
Mrs Js representative has made lengthy and substantial representations on her behalf. Ill 
not restate  them all here,  but I have read and considered them  all carefully. In summary,  
Mrs Js representative says:
The policy excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress,  which  are some  of the 
most common reasons people  are off work. This significantly reduced  the value of cover;
AXA failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the time. In those 
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on handling 
PPI complaints under DISP App 3, it should be presumed Mrs J wouldnt have taken  the 
policy and the complaint  should  be upheld. Mrs Js representatives believe there to be no 
evidence to rebut that presumption;
The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a successful 
claim meant  the policy was of inherently poor value  as shown by the low claims ratio. 
Ref: DRN26314862The common law duty of utmost good faith means  AXA should have told Mrs J about  the 
poor value;  
The common law duty of utmost good faith also means AXA should have explained the 
significance of the exclusions and limitations of cover to Mrs J and the impact  they would  
have had on her chances of making a claim; and
The information Mrs J received was misleading. These policies were promoted as 
providing peace of mind, but the number of exclusions and limitations on the scope of 
the cover  meant this was untrue.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint  both parties have seen and had a chance to 
give their responses to the adjudicators  opinion.  Mrs J disagreed  with the adjudicators  
opinion for several  reasons. As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been  
passed to me for a decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; relevant regulators rules, guidance  and standards;  relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mrs Js. I dont intend to set that out in 
much detail here but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Js complaint.
This sale took place  in 2001 before the sale of general insurance products like this became 
regulated by the FSA in January 2005.  So, the FSAs (and FCAs) overarching Principles for 
Businesses and insurance  conduct  rules (ICOB and ICOBs) arent applicable to this 
complaint, nor is the FCAs Perimeter Guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself was with a third-party  and not AXA. That means the unfair  
relationship provisions set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court  
judgment in Plevin  about s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance  made by the FCA 
about the handling of complaints  about  the non-disclosure of commission  in light of the 
Plevin judgment, arent  applicable.
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at the time, which I am satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint: 
The General  Insurance  Standards Councils  General Insurance Code for private customers  
the GISC  Code. 
Ref: DRN26314863This sale was made during a period  of industry  self-regulation by the General Insurance 
Standards Council (GISC).  It published the GISC Code, which  set out minimum standards  of 
good practice for its members to follow when selling  insurance, including  PPI. 
The Association of British Insurers General Insurance Business Code of Practice for all 
intermediaries (Including Employees of Insurance Companies) other  than Registered 
Insurance Brokers   The ABI Code.  
The ABI Code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct Marketing/ 
Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries  
Among other  things, the code said that As a condition of membership of the Association  of 
British Insurers (ABI),  members undertake  to enforce this Code  and to use their best 
endeavors to ensure that all those involved in selling their policies observe its provisions. 
The insurer  was a member of the ABI and the seller  its agent  was acting as an 
intermediary. 
The Finance  & Leasing  Association (FLA) Code of Practice
This code  was introduced in 1992  and set out standards of good  practice  for the finance  and 
leasing industry. Section  4 of the code  covered  Credit  Protection Insurance. 
As Ive explained, the insurer was a member  of the ABI, so it was subject to the ABI Code 
and its associated requirements. The seller  but not the insurer  was a member of the FLA 
and subscribed  to the FLA Code, so I consider it reasonable to assume that the seller  (as a 
member of the FLA)  should have complied  with its code when selling PPI, and this extends  
to when it was acting as an agent  of the insurer.  
So I am satisfied its right I should take these codes  into account when deciding  what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in the circumstances  of Mrs Js case. I have also taken 
account of relevant law in reaching my decision,  including: the law relating to negligence, 
misrepresentation and contract (including the express and implied duty on professional 
advisers to give advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence); the law relating to the duty 
of utmost good  faith; and the law relating  to causation  and remoteness.  
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  Im also required  to take into account  what 
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Insurance  Ombudsman  Bureau 
 might have been expected to reach in relation to an equivalent complaint. 
I note under the Insurance Ombudsmans  terms of reference the Ombudsman was required 
to decide complaints by reference  to what was, in his opinion,  fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances  and that the Ombudsman was required  to observe any applicable rule of 
law or relevant judicial  authority. 
Im also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first issued 
by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating  to the sale 
Ref: DRN26314864of PPI. This sale took place before insurance  mediation became a regulated activity, so AXA 
was required to take into account  the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were guidance 
when considering Mrs Js complaint.  
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me the key questions  I need to 
consider in deciding what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this 
complaint, are:
-If AXA gave advice,  whether it advised  Mrs J with reasonable care and skill  in 
particular, whether the policy  was appropriate  or suitable for her, given her needs and 
circumstances. 
-Whether AXA gave  Mrs J sufficient, appropriate  and timely information  to enable  her to 
make an informed choice  about whether to take the policy,  including drawing to her 
attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main  provisions 
of the policy  and significant limitations  and exclusions. 
-If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Mrs J, I 
must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Mrs J suffered loss or damage  
and what I consider would amount to fair compensation for that loss or damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by Mrs J and AXA, Ive 
decided not to uphold Mrs Js complaint. Ive set out my reasoning below.  
did Mrs J know she had a choice?
AXA had to make  it clear the PPI was optional. Mrs J has said she had no interest in PPI 
and says it was just included as part of the package with her card.  But the credit  agreement 
she signed for the card had a PPI section with a space for her to sign if she wanted the PPI, 
separate from where she signed to take the card itself. Mrs J signed this space and Ive seen 
nothing above  where she signed, or elsewhere  on the agreement,  to say she had to take the 
PPI or had to sign in the space for it if she didnt want  it. Ive nothing to make me think Mrs J 
was pressured  into opting for the cover  either.  Taking everything into account, I think its 
more likely Mrs J knew the PPI was optional and agreed to take it without undue pressure. 
did AXA provide advice?
AXA and Mrs J agree  advice wasnt provided during this sale.  This means AXA didnt have 
to check if the PPI was suitable for Mrs J. Instead,  it had to give her sufficient, appropriate  
and timely  information  to enable her to make  an informed  choice  about  whether to take the 
policy, including drawing  to her attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading 
way  the main  provisions  of the policy and significant limitations and exclusions. 
the information
AXA has provided us with Mrs Js credit agreement  showing PPI had been selected.  Ive 
also seen policy terms and conditions  which  I accept - on a balance  of probabilities - applied 
to policies like Mrs Js. Looking at the information provided to Mrs J at the time, I dont think 
AXA gave her the information she fairly and reasonably needed to make an informed 
decision about whether or not to take the policy. 
Ref: DRN26314865This sale took place  at a meeting. I dont know what AXA told Mrs J about the PPI, but I think 
it unlikely she wouldve agreed  to take it without  having at least a broad understanding  of the 
cover it provided  i.e. life, accident, sickness and unemployment cover. And I think it 
unlikely she wouldve thought it was free  bearing  in mind also that above where she signed 
for the cover it said: Please debit my Account with the relevant monthly  premium
But it was AXAs responsibility  to draw to Mrs Js attention the important information  i.e. 
the key information about the nature of the cover and any significant  exclusions and 
limitations which might be relevant to her decision. 
I dont think its likely  AXA did enough  to do this. For example, I dont think  its likely the true 
cost of the policy was made clear to Mrs J, including the need to maintain premiums  during a 
claim or that payments would attract interest. In addition, its unlikely AXA adequately drew  
to her attention the main provisions of the policy and significant limitations and exclusions.
So I dont  think AXA gave Mrs J sufficient, appropriate and timely information to enable  her 
to make an informed choice about  whether  to take the policy,  including  drawing her attention 
to and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main  provisions  of the 
policy and significant  limitations and exclusions.  
I have considered how my findings interact with the FCAs list of significant  failings  in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out at DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, Im persuaded there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Mrs Js representative has raised a number 
of general points in regards  to the requirements on a business when providing information  in 
PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like Mrs Js. Ive considered  
these carefully and summarised them  as:
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have explained 
the low claims  ratio  what Mrs Js representative considers to be poor value. 
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just told 
Mrs J about the limitations and exclusions,  it should have gone further and explained  the 
significance of them to her. 
Im not persuaded by Mrs Js representatives  views on this. The duty of utmost  good faith in 
insurance law imposed a duty on both parties  to the contract  to disclose material facts  and 
not to make  material misrepresentations. While I cant be certain what  a court  would say  I 
think it unlikely a court would find this extended to the insurer  having to disclose the claims 
ratio information or explaining the significance of the limitations and exclusions  in the way 
Mrs J has suggested. And, taking into account the law, industry codes and standards of 
good industry practice applicable to this complaint,  I dont think it would be fair or reasonable 
to impose such requirements on AXA. 
what effect did AXAs shortcomings have on Mrs J? To what extent  did she suffer 
loss or damage as a result?
I have found that AXA did not do all it should  have done when it sold this policy  to Mrs J. So I 
have gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude she suffered 
loss and damage as a result. To answer  this, I must decide whether  or not she wouldve still 
Ref: DRN26314866taken the policy had AXA done things  properly. Mrs J says she wouldnt have taken it and 
believes I should presume  this to be the case given the significant  failings identified  above. 
As this was a non-advised sale, Mrs J had to weigh up in her own mind  the cost of the policy  
against the benefits offered and the potential consequences if she didnt insure against the 
risk of being  unable  to work. 
As Ive found above, Mrs J chose to take this policy. So I consider it reasonable to conclude 
she had some interest in the benefits offered by this type of insurance. But she made this 
decision based on incomplete information.  So, what Mrs J thought she was getting is not 
exactly what she got. The extent to which this differed is a relevant consideration when 
determining if Mrs J has suffered any loss or detriment.  
In relation to the costs, Im satisfied Mrs J ought  reasonably to have known she would have 
to pay something for the PPI and that it would cover  a portion of her outstanding balance.  
But I accept AXA didnt  make clear the on-going  cost information. So, while Mrs J didnt 
know some  things, the ultimate position  in the event of a successful claim was not dissimilar 
to what she would reasonably have thought from the information she based her decision to 
take the policy on and found  acceptable.  
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mrs J thought she had bought and 
what she actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to health issues  Mrs J knew or should have known 
about, or for which  she had been advised or treated by a medical practitioner in the 12 
months before the policy start;
The policy contained limitations on claims relating to back and mental health conditions 
placing more onerous evidential requirements  to support a claim on those  grounds;
The policy limited, and in some situations  excluded, unemployment  cover  if Mrs J wasnt 
a permanent employee; and
The requirement that, to be eligible for a disability claim, Mrs J be stopped from doing 
her own or any similar job, and be stopped  from doing any paid work her experience, 
education or training reasonably qualified her to do.
I do accept theres a possibility the limitations or exclusions above might  well have caused 
Mrs J pause for thought   and may well have  caused her to conclude  the policy was not as 
good as she thought and she might have decided not to proceed. The limitations on the 
cover, when  coupled  with the other shortcomings in this sale, might  have  dissuaded some  
consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mrs J from taking the policy.  
But, the evidence  about Mrs Js circumstances at the time of sale shows  the policy  wasnt 
fundamentally wrong for her. She was eligible for its benefits and it provided cover that, 
despite its limitations and exclusions, couldve proven valuable  to her should  the insured 
risks have become  a reality. 
Mrs J couldnt have  claimed for work  absences related  to the health  issue shed had six 
years before the sale, but I havent  seen anything to suggest shed  had any problems related 
to that issue once shed had the minor operation  to treat it. With this and all Mrs J has said 
about that health issue in mind, Im not persuaded her decision to take the policy wouldve 
been affected by knowing  she couldnt  claim for future work absences related to that past 
health issue. Mrs J hadnt had any other  health issues  the policy mightve excluded, and I 
havent seen anything to suggest she wouldve  been caught by any of the other significant 
Ref: DRN26314867exclusions  Mrs J was in permanent employment,  for example. So, with all Ive said above 
in mind, I think Mrs J still had some good  reasons to take the policy.
I accept back pain and mental health conditions are common problems and the steps 
required to make a disability claim for these conditions were  more onerous than Mrs J might 
reasonably have expected. But its unlikely she would have expected to be able to make a 
disability claim without  having to provide some evidence to support that claim.  And while this 
limitation might have dissuaded  some consumers in slightly different circumstances to Mrs J 
from taking the policy,  Mrs J, in her circumstances, still had some  good reasons to take it.
If Mrs J had known she could only claim for disability if she were not only unable  to do her 
own or any similar job, but also unable  to do any paid work  her education, experience  or 
training might reasonably qualify her to do, it might  have  played into her thinking about what 
to do. And I accept  it may have given her pause for thought  although, given Mrs Js 
circumstances, on balance I think she would  still have  been interested  in taking the cover.
Having considered all the evidence and arguments in this case,  I consider  it more likely than 
not Mrs J wouldve still taken the PPI. It was sufficiently  close to what she thought  she was 
getting, and I think  it couldve provided a useful  benefit at a difficult time, notwithstanding her 
employment benefits. And, in those circumstances, I consider it more  likely than not she 
wouldve taken the policy in any event.  
Mrs Js representatives say the rules  about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 3) 
make it clear  that, where  a significant  failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have  taken PPI, unless there is evidence to outweigh  the presumption. 
They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration  so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
I have thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, I have found  it would be reasonable to conclude  there  
were substantial flaws  in the sales  process.  In those  circumstances, DISP App 3 says it 
should be presumed Mrs J would not have  bought  the PPI she bought unless, in the 
particular circumstances  of the complaint, there is evidence to rebut the presumption. 
I am satisfied, applying DISP App 3, it is reasonable to conclude  the presumption  is rebutted 
in the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account Mrs Js 
circumstances as detailed  above, I consider it reasonable to conclude  the position  Mrs J 
found herself in as a result of the sale was the same position  she would have been in had 
the breach or significant  failings not occurred. 
Mrs J believes  the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws in the sales  process 
were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were  highly material and we have failed to give 
proper weight to the evidence  including her own comments  that she would not have taken 
the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments.  
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out at DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because  I do not consider, in this case,  that it would 
Ref: DRN26314868represent fair compensation to put Mrs J in the position  she would have been in if she had 
not bought the policy.  
That is because,  while I accept its possible Mrs J wouldnt have taken the policy, Im 
satisfied, of the two possibilities, its more likely than not she would still have taken the PPI 
had she been  given clear,  fair and not misleading information about the policy she was 
buying. So Im not persuaded  it would  be fair and reasonable, in those circumstances, to 
conclude AXA should pay Mrs J compensation, as that would put her in a better position 
than she would have  been in had everything happened as it should have done. 
Im also aware Mrs J thinks AXA misrepresented  the terms of the policy in how it described 
the PPI. While I accept theres a possibility a court might conclude  some of AXAs 
statements misrepresented the contract, in my opinion the reason why AXA failed to act 
fairly and reasonably was not because  of what it did or didnt say in the information it 
provided  but because  the overall information  AXA gave Mrs J, in the way it did, was 
insufficient to meet  the standards I consider it fair and reasonable to expect it to have met in 
2001 when providing information  about an insurance  policy.  
Ive also thought about the approach Mrs Js representative  says a court might take if it were 
to find AXA negligently  misrepresented the contract  to Mrs J and about the remedy a court 
might award if it were  to find that AXA had been  in breach of its duty of utmost good faith. 
But this doesnt  persuade  me to alter my conclusions about what  is fair and reasonable in all 
the circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this case.  For the reasons Ive already set out, I dont think  it would be fair 
and reasonable to put Mrs J in a better position  than if everything had happened  as it should 
have done. 
my final decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 January 2021.
