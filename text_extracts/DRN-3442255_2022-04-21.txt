The complaint
Mrs L has complained about loans granted to her by Loans 2 Go Limited (L2G). She 
says that L2G didnt carry out the required checks before lending to her.
Mrs L has brought her complaint to us via a Claims Management Company but for 
simplicity I will refer to her throughout.
What happened
L2G agreed five loans for Mrs L between 2017 and 2019. Some of the information 
L2G provided is shown in the table below (all figures rounded to the nearest 
pound).

I understand that the first three loans were repaid with some of the capital from the 
following loan. As shown in the table there was a gap of a few months between Mrs Ls 
fourth loan being settled and her fifth loan being agreed.
These were all log book loans, in other words they were granted on the basis that Mrs L 
provided L2G with a bill of sale for her car. This meant that if Mrs L didnt make her loan 
repayments L2G could potentially recoup any losses through the sale of her vehicle.
Mrs L says that L2G didnt look into her finances properly before lending to her and, 
had it done so, it would have seen that the loans were unaffordable for her.
L2G says it asked Mrs L about her income and expenditure each time she applied for 
a loan. It says it undertook credit checks and validated Mrs Ls income and 
expenditure information, which led it to conclude that the loans were affordable. L2G 
also says that Mrs L did not miss any payments at all during the loan terms or give any 
indication that she was facing any financial problems.
One of our investigators looked into what happened when each of Mrs Ls loans were 
agreed. They found that L2G didnt carry out proportionate assessments before lending 
to Mrs L. However, they also found that they didnt have enough information to come to 
a view about what L2G might have learnt about Mrs Ls circumstances, had it carried out 
further checks. So they didnt uphold Mrs Ls complaint. Mrs L provided some further 
information in response, but our investigator didnt consider it to be sufficiently relevant 
to the time period to change their mind. 
Mrs L asked for the complaint to come to an ombudsman for a formal resolution and it 
came to me. I issued a provisional decision on 13 April 2022 explaining that Id found 
L2G shouldnt have agreed loans 3, 4 or 5 for Mrs L and so her complaint should be 
upheld in part. 
Mrs L agreed with my provisional decision and L2G said  that it didnt have any further 
comment or information for me to consider. This is my final decision on the matter and will 
be legally binding on both parties if Mrs L accepts it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, and as Ive had no new information or comment to consider, my initial 
conclusion remains unchanged. Ill set out my reasons and conclusion again for 
completeness.  
As Id said in my provisional decision, L2G will be familiar with the regulations in place 
at the time so I will summarise its main obligations. L2G needed to check that Mrs L 
could afford to meet her repayments without difficulty before agreeing each loan. In 
other words, it needed to check that she could meet her repayments out of her usual 
means without having to borrow further and without experiencing financial difficulty or 
other adverse consequences. The necessary checks needed to take into account both 
the nature of the credit (amount, term etc.) and Mrs Ls particular circumstances.
The overarching requirement was that L2G needed to pay due regard to Mrs Ls interests 
and treat her fairly. The Consumer Credit (CONC) handbook paragraph 2.2.2G gave an 
example of contravening this requirement as targeting customers with regulated credit 
agreements which are unsuitable for them by virtue of their indebtedness, poor credit 
history, age, health, disability or any other reason.
With this in mind, my main considerations are did L2G complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks when assessing Mrs Ls applications to satisfy itself that she would 
be able to make her repayments without experiencing adverse consequences? If not, 
what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown and, ultimately, did L2G 
make fair lending decisions?
Ive started by looking at the information L2G relied on. Mrs L told L2G that her net 
monthly income was £1,400 when she applied for her first loan. She said her monthly 
living costs came to £473 and her monthly credit commitments came to £565, a total of 
£1,038.
L2G provided copies of Mrs Ls payslips from around that time and I can see that her 
usual wages (without overtime) came to £1,463 a month. So, L2G knew that Mrs L was 
spending almost 40% of her monthly income on repaying debt. Adding this loan to her 
commitments would increase that proportion to over half.
L2G also relied on Mrs Ls credit report and provided a copy of the report from that time. 
Ive noted that:
Mrs Ls total debt was almost £4,000 and she had taken out a large loan of
£3,000 just six months before in February 2017 which had monthly 
repayments of£298;
She had 10 active accounts, four of which had been opened within the 
last six months;
One account was delinquent and she had six defaults recorded, one 
within the last year;
She was in an arrangement to pay on a short term loan shed taken out 
within the year at £25 a month.
About three months later, Mrs L applied for another loan. As before L2G asked Mrs L 
about her income and expenditure and checked her payslips and her credit file. Mrs L 
said she spent £862 a month, £370 of which was on repaying existing credit (excluding 
L2Gs loan). Her payslips show her usual wages (without overtime) were £1,451. 
Agreeing this loan would potentially leave Mrs L paying over 40% of her wages each 
month repaying debt.
The credit report L2G provided shows that Mrs L was now making repayments on a 
second defaulted account of £50 through a debt collector and shed continued with her 
arrangement to pay on her short term loan. The report also shows she had taken out 
another payday loan just before her first L2G loan and had repaid this at £150 a month 
for three months. Mrs L had continued to meet her repayments of £298 on her large loan 
and her credit cards, while meeting her repayments on her first L2G loan.
Having considered all the information I have available, I dont think L2G was 
irresponsible to have agreed these two loans for Mrs L. However, I do think L2G was 
on notice that Mrs L had a relatively high level of existing debt and was continuing to 
borrow from short term high cost lenders. I think the additional information L2G had 
available to it when Mrs L applied for later loans should have prompted it to decline to 
lend to her.
In February 2018, Mrs L applied for a third loan. She said her average monthly income was
£1,473 and her total outgoings came to almost £1,090. L2G estimated that Mrs L had 
£386 approximately left over each month. Mrs Ls payslips from around that time show 
that her income without overtime (for example for the month of November 2017) came 
to £1,451. This means Mrs L would potentially have £100 left to meet any unexpected 
costs in any one month after meeting the loan payment of £262, and Ive borne in mind 
she had a dependent. I note that Mrs L said she spent over £700 repaying existing debt 
(excluding her second L2G loan), which included paying for a car for a family member 
and repaying two short term loans. Agreeing a third loan for Mrs L would potentially 
mean committing her to repaying £980 a month or 66% of her (average) wages on 
existing debt.
Mrs Ls first loan with L2G was for £1,000. Now, ten months later, Mrs L wanted to 
borrow almost double that amount, and this was her third loan and second refinancing. I 
think L2G ought to have realised at this point that Mrs L wasnt making inroads into her 
debts either with it or with other lenders and that agreeing further credit for her was 
simply adding to her level of indebtedness. Given the margin Mrs L would potentially 
have left over each month, the proportion of her wages she was spending and would 
potentially continue to spend on repaying debt, and that this was her third loan within a 
year, I think L2G didnt treat Mrs L fairly when it agreed to lend to her a third time.
Mrs L went on to take out two more loans from L2G within 14 months and I havent seen 
anything which makes me think her circumstances had significantly improved over that 
time. The credit file report provided by L2G at the time of Mrs Ls fourth loan (September 
2018) shows she had incurred a county court judgement in April 2018 and had been in 
sustained arrears on her existing large loan (with the payments of £298) throughout 2018, eventually defaulting on this in August 2018. In addition Mrs L had taken out 
several short term loans since her previous L2G loan. The credit file report for Mrs L's 
fifth and final loan shows she had continued to rely on short term loans in the interim and 
was spending approximately £870 each month repaying existing debt. I appreciate 
Mrs Ls wages had increased to £1,650 by this point, but her debt repayments were still 
taking up more than half her wages and her credit score as shown on the reports from 
L2G had decreased considerably.
In summary, I think L2G shouldnt have agreed to lend to Mrs L a third, fourth or fifth 
time. I think shes ended up paying interest and charges on these loans and potentially 
had her credit file adversely impacted. Ive set out below what L2G should do to put 
things right.
Putting things right
I think its fair that Mrs L repays the principal she borrowed on her third, fourth and fifth 
loans as shes had the use of this money. However, I dont think Mrs L should be liable 
for any interest or charges on these amounts or have her credit record adversely 
impacted.
In order to put things right for Mrs L, L2G needs to:
a) Refund to Mrs L all payments she made above the principal amounts she 
borrowed for the three loans taken out in 2018 and 2019;
b) Add 8% simple interest per annum to these overpayments from the date 
they were paid to the date of refund; and
c) Remove any adverse information about these loans from Mrs Ls credit file; and
d) Revoke the Bill of Sale for Mrs Ls car if this is still in place and return any 
relevant documents to her if it hasnt already done so.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires L2G to deduct tax from this interest. It should give 
Mrs L a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above Im upholding Mrs Ls complaint in part and 
require Loans 2 Go Limited to put things right as Ive set out.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2022.
