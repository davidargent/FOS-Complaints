K820x#14complaint
Ms M says AXA France IARD (AXA) mis-sold her a payment protection insurance  (PPI)  
policy. 
I cant consider this complaint against  the policy seller directly because  the sale took place 
before it, or its predecessor-in-title, was regulated by the then Financial Services Authority 
(FSA) for insurance intermediation activities, or otherwise covered by our jurisdiction.
The party that at the time of the sale was the policy insurer, has accepted that the seller  was 
acting as its agent at the time  so it accepted responsibility for the sale. Following a transfer 
of business, AXA has taken on that responsibility. To keep things simple, Ill only refer to 
AXA in this decision, rather than any other business.
background and summary to complaint
Ms M bought the policy in 1998 at the same time as taking out a hire-purchase agreement to 
buy electrical goods. She applied for the hire-purchase agreement  and PPI policy  in-store.  
The policy provided  cover  for accident, sickness unemployment and life  subject to its 
exclusions and limitations. It offered to repay  the monthly repayment of Ms Ms hire-
purchase agreement  in the event of Ms M being unable to work due to accident, sickness or 
unemployment. 
According to AXAs records  Ms M paid a total of Â£75.94 for PPI during the policys lifetime.
At the time,  Ms M was employed  as a sales person. She has told us she was not entitled  to 
any sick pay and didnt  have any other  means  of repaying her hire-purchase  agreement  
should she be unable  to work.  
Ms M told us she had a hysterectomy in 1992. Ms M also had some problem with her neck in 
1996. Ms M missed a couple of weeks work  with this issue and took non-prescription 
painkillers.
Ms Ms representative has made lengthy and substantial representations on her behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have  read and considered  them all carefully. In 
summary, Ms Ms representative says:
AXA failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the time. In those 
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on 
handling PPI complaints  under  DISP  App 3, it should be presumed Ms M wouldnt 
have taken out the policy and the complaint should be upheld.  Ms Ms 
representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that presumption;
The policy excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress,  which  are some  of the 
most common reasons people  are off work. This significantly reduced  the value of 
cover;
The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a 
successful claim  meant the policy was of inherently poor value as shown by the low 
Ref: DRN72390122claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good  faith means AXA should have told 
Ms M about the poor value; 
The common law duty of utmost good faith also means AXA should have explained 
the significance  of the exclusions  and limitations of cover  to Ms M and the impact  
they would  have had on her chances  of making  a claim; and 
 
The information Ms M received was misleading. These policies were promoted as 
providing peace of mind, but the number of exclusions and limitations on the scope of 
the cover  meant this was untrue.
Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint   both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Ms M disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  for 
several reasons.  
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, I am required to take into account: relevant 
law and regulations;  relevant  regulators  rules,  guidance and standards; relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Ms Ms. I dont intend to set that out in 
much detail here but Ive taken this into account in deciding Ms Ms complaint.
This sale took place  in 1998 before the General Insurance Standards Council (GISC) 
published its code  of practice in June 2000  and before the sale of general insurance 
products like this became  regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC Code, the FSAs (and 
FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses  and insurance conduct rules (ICOB and 
ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint,  nor is the FCAs Perimeter  Guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself was with a third-party  and not AXA. That means the unfair  
relationship provisions set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court  
judgment in Plevin  about s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance  made by the FCA 
about the handling of complaints  about  the non-disclosure of commission  in light of the 
Plevin judgment, arent  applicable.
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at that time, which I am satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint: 
Ref: DRN72390123The Association of British Insurers General Insurance Business Code of Practice for all 
intermediaries (Including Employees of Insurance Companies) other  than Registered 
Insurance Brokers   The ABI Code.  
The ABI Code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries  
Among other  things, the code said that As a condition of membership of the Association  of 
British Insurers (ABI),  members undertake  to enforce this Code  and to use their best 
endeavors to ensure that all those involved in selling their policies observe its provisions. 
AXA was a member  of the ABI and the seller  its agent  was acting as an intermediary. 
The Finance  & Leasing  Association (FLA) Code of Practice
This code  was introduced in 1992,  and set out standards of good  practice  for the
finance and leasing  industry. Section 4 of the code covered  Credit  Protection
Insurance. 
As Ive explained, AXA was a member of the ABI, so it was subject to the ABI Code and its 
associated requirements.  The seller  but not AXA  was a member of the FLA and 
subscribed to the FLA Code, so I consider it reasonable to assume that the seller (as a 
member of the FLA)  should have complied  with its code when selling PPI, and this extends  
to when it was acting as an agent  of AXA. 
So I am satisfied it is right that I should take these codes into account when deciding  what  is, 
in my opinion, fair and reasonable  in the circumstances of Ms Ms case.  
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including:  the law relating to 
negligence, misrepresentation and contract  (including the express  and implied duty on 
professional advisers  to give advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence); the law 
relating to the duty of utmost good faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness.  
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  I am also required to take into account what  
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Insurance  Ombudsman  Bureau 
 might have been expected to reach in relation to an equivalent complaint. I note that under 
the Insurance Ombudsmans terms of reference the Ombudsman was required  to decide 
complaints by reference to what was, in his opinion, fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances  and that the Ombudsman was required  to observe any applicable rule of 
law or relevant judicial  authority. 
I am also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first 
issued by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating to the 
sale of PPI. This sale took place before insurance mediation became a regulated  activity,  so 
AXA was required to take into account the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were  guidance  
when considering Ms Ms complaint.  
Ref: DRN72390124key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me that the key questions I need  
to consider in deciding  what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of 
this complaint, are:
-If AXA gave advice,  whether it advised  Ms M with reasonable care and skill  in 
particular, whether the policy  was appropriate  or suitable for her, given her needs 
and circumstances.  
-Whether AXA gave  Ms M sufficient, appropriate  and timely information  to enable  her 
to make an informed choice about  whether  to take out the policy,  including drawing to 
her attention and highlighting  in a clear,  fair and not misleading way  the main 
provisions of the policy and significant  limitations  and exclusions.  
-If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Ms M, I 
must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Ms M suffered loss or 
damage and what  I consider would amount to fair compensation for that loss or 
damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Ms M and AXA, 
Ive decided not to uphold  Ms Ms complaint. Ive set out my reasoning below. 
did Ms M know  she had a choice?
AXA had to make  it clear that the PPI policy was optional.  
Ive seen a copy  of the credit agreement signed by Ms M. I can see it contains a box that 
could be crossed to add the PPI to the account, and I can see the box has been  marked with 
a cross.
Taking everything into account,  I think its more likely that Ms M knew  the policy was optional  
and she agreed  to take it out without undue pressure.  
did AXA provide advice?
The sale took place  in a store while Ms M was shopping. I think  it is unlikely Ms M would 
have been given personal financial advice  in these circumstances.
This means  AXA didnt  have to check if the PPI was suitable for Ms M. Instead, it had to give 
her sufficient, appropriate and timely information  to enable Ms M to make an informed choice 
about whether  to take out the policy, including drawing to her attention and highlighting  in 
a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main provisions of the policy  and significant 
limitations and exclusions.  
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not Ms M was given  a broad description of what  the policy 
was intended  to cover (that is that the policy would protect her payments if Ms M was unable  
to work through accident, sickness and unemployment) and of the approximate  costs. Ive 
reached this conclusion because I think its unlikely Ms M would have taken out the policy  
without any sense of what the policy was for and of how much the premium might be.
Ref: DRN72390125But the evidence  from the time of sale doesnt tell us whether  AXA gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit, the actual cost or about  the exclusions or 
limitations before Ms M agreed  to take out the policy. 
So I dont  think AXA gave Ms M sufficient, appropriate and timely information to enable  her 
to make an informed choice about  whether  to take out the policy,  including drawing her 
attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main  provisions of 
the policy and significant limitations and exclusions.  
I have considered how my findings interact with the FCAs list of significant  failings  in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out at DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, I am persuaded that there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Ms Ms representative has raised a number 
of general points in regards  to the requirements on a business when providing information  in 
PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like Ms Ms. I have 
considered these carefully and summarised them as:
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Ms Ms representative considers to be poor 
value. 
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just 
told Ms M about  the limitations and exclusions, it should have gone further and 
explained the significance of them to her. 
Im not persuaded by Ms Ms representatives  views on this. The duty of utmost  good faith in 
insurance law imposed a duty on both parties  to the contract  to disclose material facts  and 
not to make  material misrepresentations. While I cannot be certain what  a court would say  
I think it is unlikely that a court would find that this extended to the insurer having to disclose 
the claims ratio information  or explaining the significance of the limitations  and exclusions in 
the way Ms M has suggested. And taking into account the law, industry codes and standards  
of good industry  practice applicable to this complaint, I dont think  it would be fair or 
reasonable to impose such requirements on AXA. 
what effect did AXAs shortcomings have on Ms M? To what extent did Ms M suffer 
loss or damage as a result?
I have found that AXA did not do all it should  have done when it sold this policy  to Ms M. So I 
have gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude Ms M suffered 
loss and damage as a result. To answer  this, I must decide whether  or not Ms M would have 
still taken out the policy,  had AXA done  things properly. 
Ms M says she would not have taken it out and believes  that I should  presume  this to be the 
case given the significant failings identified  above. Ive considered the representations of 
both sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
As this was a non-advised sale, Ms M had to weigh up in her own mind  the cost of the policy  
against the benefits offered and the potential consequences if she didnt insure against the 
risk of being  unable  to work. 
Ref: DRN72390126As Ive found above, Ms M chose to take this policy out. So I consider that its reasonable to 
conclude she had some  interest in the benefits offered by this type of insurance. But she 
made this decision  based  on incomplete information. So what Ms M thought she was getting 
is not exactly what she got. The extent to which this differed is a relevant consideration when 
determining if Ms M has suffered any loss or detriment.  
Although I consider it more likely than not that Ms M knew she would have to pay something 
for the policy, it doesnt appear AXA told them the exact premium at the point Ms M applied 
for the policy. Having  said that, it seems likely Ms M would  have  been  told the cost before 
the policy started and she paid for the policy for a number of years, so if the costs  were  
significantly at odd with their expectations at the point of sale,  its possible they might  have 
raised that with AXA at the time or reconsidered  their decision.
Overall, I am not persuaded Ms M would  have found the cost unacceptable if she had been 
given the exact figure during the meeting in which they agreed to the policy.
In addition, Im not persuaded  AXA made clear exactly  what Ms M would  get back  in return  
in the event she made a successful claim. But I think its unlikely Ms Ms expectations about 
what the policy would pay in the event  of a claim (an amount sufficient to meet  her 
repayments under the hire-purchase agreement) were significantly different to what  the 
policy actually did.
Possibly the most significant differences between what Ms M thought she had bought and 
what she actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to medical  conditions that Ms M knew about or 
ought to have known about,  or which she saw a doctor about  during the 12 months 
before the start date of the policy; 
The policy contained limitations on claims relating to back and mental health 
conditions placing more onerous evidential requirements to support a claim  on those 
grounds;
The policy limited, and in some situations,  excluded unemployment  cover  if Ms M 
wasnt a permanent employee;
The requirement that in order to be eligible for a disability claim  Ms M be unable  to 
do her own job, a similar job or any paid work  which her experience, education or 
training reasonably qualified her to do.
I do accept that there is a possibility that the limitations and exclusions above might  well 
have caused Ms M pause for thought   and may well have caused  her to conclude  that the 
policy was not as good as she thought  and she might  have  decided  not to proceed.  The 
limitations on the cover, when coupled with the other shortcomings in this sale, might  have 
dissuaded some  consumers in slightly different circumstances from Ms M from taking out the 
policy. 
But, the evidence  about Ms Ms circumstances at the time of sale shows  that the policy  
wasnt fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. she was eligible for its benefits, she was in 
permanent employment  and it provided cover  that, despite its limitations and exclusions, 
couldve proved  valuable to her should  the insured  risks have become a reality,  particularly 
as Ms Ms employer offered no sick pay and she had no other  means to make the monthly  
repayments.
Ref: DRN72390127Ms M had a hysterectomy  in 1992.  But that was six years before the sale of the policy.  Ms M 
also suffered neck problems in 1996  and took non-prescription  painkillers for this. But Ive 
not seen any evidence that this continued  to trouble her, or that she continued  to receive 
treatment in the 12 months leading up to the sale of the policy  in May 1998. So I dont think 
either of these conditions  would  have  stopped  Ms M being  able to make a claim if shed  
have needed to.
I accept back pain and mental health conditions are common problems and the steps 
required to make a disability claim for these conditions were  more onerous than Ms M might 
reasonably have expected. But its unlikely she would have expected to be able to make a 
disability claim without  having to provide some evidence to support that claim.  And while this 
limitation might have dissuaded  some consumers in slightly different circumstances to Ms M 
from taking out the policy,  Ms M, in her circumstances, still had some good  reasons to take it 
out.
If Ms M had known she could only claim for disability if she was not only unable  to do her job 
or any similar job but also unable to do any work  which in the insurers  view she might 
reasonably be qualified for, it might have played into her thinking about  what she would  do. 
And I accept  it may have  given her pause for thought  although given Ms Ms 
circumstances and the limited other means  she had to make her repayments if she wasnt  
working, on balance,  I still think she would have been interested in taking  out the cover.  
Having considered all of the evidence  and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not that Ms M would  still have taken  out the policy.  The policy was sufficiently close to 
what it is likely she thought she was getting and provided benefits that would help her 
manage the consequences  were  Ms M made  redundant, or unable to work through  the 
accident or disability.  In the circumstances I consider  it more  likely than not that Ms M would 
have taken out the policy in any event notwithstanding the limitations  on cover.
Ms Ms representatives say the rules  about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 3) 
make it clear  that, where  a significant  failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have  taken out PPI, unless  there  is evidence  to outweigh  the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration  so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
I have thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, I have found  it would be reasonable to conclude  there  
were substantial flaws  in the sales  process.  In those  circumstances, DISP App 3 says it 
should be presumed Ms M would not have  bought  the PPI she bought unless, in the 
particular circumstances  of the complaint, there is evidence to rebut the presumption. 
I am satisfied, applying DISP App 3, it is reasonable to conclude  the presumption  is rebutted 
in the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account Ms Ms 
circumstances as detailed  above, I consider it reasonable to conclude  the position  Ms M 
found herself in as a result of the sale was the same position  she would have been in had 
the breach or significant  failings not occurred. 
Ref: DRN72390128Ms M believes  the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws in the sales  process 
were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were  highly material and we have failed to give 
proper weight to the evidence  including her own comments  that she would not have taken 
out the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out at DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because  I do not consider, in this case,  that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Ms M in the position  she would have been in if she had 
not bought the policy.  
That is because,  while I accept it is possible that she would not have taken out the policy,  I 
am satisfied  that of the two possibilities, it is more  likely than not that she would still have 
taken out the PPI had she been  given clear,  fair and not misleading  information about the 
policy she was buying. So Im not persuaded it would  be fair and reasonable in those  
circumstances, to conclude AXA should  pay Ms M compensation, as that would put her in a 
better position than she would  have  been  in if everything had happened as it should have 
done. 
Im also aware that Ms M thinks AXA misrepresented the terms of the policy  in how it 
described the PPI. While I accept there is a possibility a court  might  conclude some of AXAs  
statements misrepresented the contract, in my opinion the reason why AXA failed to act 
fairly and reasonably was not because  of what it did or didnt say in the information it 
provided  but because  the overall information  AXA gave Ms M, in the way it did, was 
insufficient to meet  the standards I consider it fair and reasonable to expect it to have met in 
1998 when providing information  about an insurance  policy.  
Ive also thought about the approach Ms Ms representative  says a court might take if it were 
to find AXA negligently  misrepresented the contract  to Ms M and about the remedy a court 
might award if it were  to find that AXA had been  in breach of its duty of utmost good faith. 
But this doesnt  persuade  me to alter my conclusions about what  is fair and reasonable in all 
the circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this case.  For the reasons Ive already set out I dont think it would be fair 
and reasonable to put Ms M in a better position  than if everything had happened  as it should 
have done. 
my decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 January 2021.
