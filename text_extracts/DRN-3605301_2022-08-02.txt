The complaint
Mrs H complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money prematurely 
recorded a default on her credit file. 
What happened
Mrs H had a loan with 118 118 Money, during the term of the loan, several Mrs Hs 
contractual payments failed. Mrs H repaid most of the missed payment but the payment for 
October 2019 remained outstanding.
118 118 Money recorded a default on Mrs Hs credit for that missed payment. Mrs H 
complained about the default, but 118 118 Money didnt uphold her complaint, it said the 
default was correctly recorded.
Unhappy with the response, Mrs H brought her complaint to this service where it was looked 
at by one of our adjudicators. Our adjudicator didnt think 118 118 Money had acted unfairly 
and so didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld.
Mrs H disagreed; she says shed requested a payment plan from 118 118 Money at the time 
as she was in financial difficulties.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both 118 118 Money and Mrs H have provided information about what happened around the 
time of the missed payment. Mrs Hs loan statement shows that the payment due in October 
2019 wasnt paid.
Ive also seen communication between 118 118 Money and Mrs H where shed asked for a 
payment plan, but this was never agreed and the full contractual amount of Â£210.87 
remained outstanding past its payment due date.
118 118 Money sent Mrs H several letters informing her about the arrears on her account 
and asked her to bring the account up to date. On 5 December 2019, 118 118 Money issued 
Mrs H a default notice in line with the requirements of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the 
Act). The letter explained what had gone wrong and gave Mrs H a date by which to make 
things right.
118 118 Money sent Mrs H a further letter on 19 December 2019 giving her further notice of 
the arrears on her account. As the payment remained outstanding, 118 118 Money recorded 
a default on Mrs Hs account on 22 January 2020  after the date Mrs H was given to act.
From everything Ive seen 118 118 Money gave Mrs H an opportunity to make the payment 
and gave her notice about the default. 118 118 Money asked Mrs H to call one of its agents 
to discuss her financial difficulties and the possibility of setting up a payment plan but I 
havent seen evidence that this was done and that a payment plan was agreed.
The information 118 118 Money has provided shows the default has now been settled. 
Overall, 118 118 Money has acted fairly and in line with the requirements of the Act and 
I wont be asking it to amend Mrs Hs credit file. 
I appreciate my findings will likely disappoint Mrs H, but I dont think 118 118 Money has 
done anything wrong here.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold Mrs Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 August 2022.
