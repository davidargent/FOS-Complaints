DRN-3811820
The complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA declined his item not received claim 
under their buyer protection policy. 
What happened
Mr C made a purchase online through a third party website, and he says his purchase was 
covered by PayPals buyer protection as although the third party courier said his item was 
delivered, he did not receive it. Mr C says the courier left the parcel in an unsecured location, 
which is different to how another postal service would have left his parcel. He says he has 
spoken to numerous parties involved, including the seller, the courier, the third party site he 
bought from, and PayPal, but PayPal customer services only offered him £37 compensation 
which they increased to a £50 voucher. Mr C made a complaint to PayPal. 
PayPal did not uphold Mr Cs complaint. They said the courier provided them a valid proof of 
delivery to the address provided by Mr C during checkout. They said they cant ask the 
courier to change their policies regarding their delivered packages. Mr C brought his 
complaint to our service.
Our investigator did not uphold Mr Cs complaint. She said that PayPal requested evidence 
from the seller of where his parcel was delivered, and although it wasnt left in a secure 
location, it was delivered to his postal address and the tracking evidence supports this. She 
said PayPals buyer protection policy says that if the sender can provide delivery to the 
correct address, there isnt a successful claim to be made. 
After our investigator issued her view of the complaint, PayPal offered to proactively settle 
the complaint for £200, but Mr C rejected this as he said the item (including delivery) was for 
£186, so they were only paying him £14 for distress and inconvenience. He asked for an 
ombudsman to review his complaint. He said PayPals protection does not take into account 
any difference between secure and insecure deliveries. He said PayPals buyer protection 
has been negated by their approach to secure/insecure deliveries.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I must make it clear to Mr C that I can only look at PayPals actions as part of this complaint, 
and I cant make a ruling against any other party involved in this complaint, such as a 
courier, as the courier is not a business covered under our jurisdiction. But Mr C may want to 
look into their complaints process, if they have one. 
It is not the role of this service to tell PayPal what wording their PayPal buyer protection 
should contain, or to insist that they differentiate between secure and unsecured wording 
regarding successful deliveries, as this is a commercial decision for PayPal to make.
What I have done though, is considered the wording of the PayPal buyer protection to see if 
PayPal had acted in line with the protection in this case. And Im satisfied that they have 
acted in line with the agreement, and Ill explain why.
As Mr C says he didnt receive the parcel, this would be covered under the Item Not 
Received claims part of the buyer protection agreement. This states Your claim will not 
qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not Received claim, and one 
of the reasons is The seller has provided proof of delivery. There is a link to click on the 
proof of delivery wording and this sets out the criteria for the proof of delivery, which I have 
listed below: 
Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:
An online and verifiable tracking number
Date of delivery and delivered status
An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the 
"Transaction Details" page
An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or 
zip/postal code (or international equivalent).
I have looked at the information provided to PayPal from the courier. This contains the 
tracking number, the date of the delivery, a delivered status and the address for the recipient 
(Mr C) which matches the address and contains the city and post code. So Im satisfied that 
this would not meet the criteria for a valid item not received claim. 
The buyer protection wording on the user agreement also says that If the seller presents 
evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in the favour of the seller for 
an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods. This is what 
happened here. Mr C claims he did not receive the goods, but as the seller presented 
evidence that the goods were delivered to his address, then PayPal did not find in Mr Cs 
favour.
While I cant say that PayPal were wrong to decline Mr Cs claim based on their buyer 
protection policy, they have agreed to pay Mr C £200 to proactively settle Mr Cs complaint. 
So although Im not persuaded PayPal have done anything wrong in rejecting his claim, Im 
satisfied it would be fair for them to pay Mr C the goodwill gesture they offered him.
Putting things right
PayPal have offered to pay Mr C £200 to proactively settle his complaint as a gesture of 
goodwill, so I think it would be fair for them to pay him this compensation here.
My final decision
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have offered to pay Mr C £200 as a goodwill gesture to 
proactively settle this complaint. 
So my final decision is that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA should pay Mr C £200. But I 
dont require them to do anything further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 November 2023.
