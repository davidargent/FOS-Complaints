The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) accused him of fraud after 
raising debit card disputes. 
What happened
In recent years, Mr D raised multiple chargeback claims following a purchase he made using 
his NatWest debit card. NatWest went on to investigate the chargebacks claims and applied 
refunds where appropriate. But towards the end of 2022 NatWest contacted Mr D and 
explained that hed raised an unusually high number of chargeback claims in relation to debit 
card purchases. NatWest explained that for future chargeback claims it would require Mr D 
to provide proof that his claim was valid and that hed tried to resolve the matter with the 
retailer directly first. 
Mr D complained and said NatWests comments made him feel like it was accusing him of 
fraud. NatWest issued a final response on 10 November 2022 but didnt uphold Mr Ds 
complaint. NatWest apologised if its comments had made Mr D feel it had treated him 
unfairly. But NatWest confirmed that before Mr D raised any further card disputes it would 
need him to show he had contacted the retailer to try and obtain a refund directly first. 
NatWest also explained that the level of card disputes raised on Mr Ds account can indicate 
fraudulent activity, but explained it wasnt accusing him of anything untoward. 
In January 2023 Mr D raised a chargeback claim which was approved the following month. 
NatWest issued a follow up final response to Mr D but didnt agree it had made mistakes or 
treated him unfairly. 
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Ds complaint. They thought NatWest had dealt 
with Mr Ds case fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else. Mr D asked to appeal, so his 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware Ive summarised the events surrounding this complaint in less detail than the 
parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by my approach which reflects the informal 
nature of this service. I want to assure all parties Ive read and considered everything on file. 
Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every point raised to fairly reach my decision. And if 
I dont comment on something, its not because I havent considered it. Its because Ive 
focused on what I think are the key issues. My approach is in line with the rules we operate 
under. 
Mr D has explained that hes found NatWests letters and advice that it would need evidence 
future chargeback claims had first been referred to the retailers made him feel as if he was 
being accused of fraud. But Ive looked at the available information, including the 
correspondence sent to Mr D, and I havent seen any accusations of fraud. I accept that 
NatWests letters advise that the level of disputes Mr D raised could indicate fraudulent 
activity. But NatWest also confirms it expects Mr D to show hes attempted to obtain refunds 
directly from the retailer before raising a chargeback claim. And thats in line with the 
chargeback scheme and way it operates. In my view, NatWest was providing Mr D with 
information to ensure any future disputes could be reviewed and considered in line with the 
scheme rules. 
Ive also reviewed NatWests systems notes and looked at the number of disputes Mr D has 
raised. I understand all the disputes raised were genuine and there was no element of fraud 
taking place. But I accept NatWests point that the number of claims made has been 
unusually high. I havent been persuaded it was unreasonable for NatWest to provide some 
additional guidance on the chargeback process or contact Mr D with this information. 
I also think its fair to say NatWest hasnt refused to consider further disputes from Mr D. 
NatWest has advised it requires Mr D to provide evidence of the validity of his claims and 
attempts to resolve with the retailer first before raising a dispute next time. Whilst I 
understand some of the retailers involved are abroad, I havent been persuaded NatWests 
request is unfair. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr D but as Im satisfied NatWest dealt with his complaint fairly Im 
not telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2023.
