Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Ps complaint and thought the loans werent unfairly lent. 
Mr P disagreed so the complaint was passed to me. 
my findings 
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Myjar needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loan in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint. 
Before lending to Mr P, Myjar asked Mr P for information on his financial  situation, such  as 
his monthly income  and his outgoings, including other creditor  repayments,  and it carried  out 
credit checks. 
Ive looked at each loan in turn and thought about  whether it was fair for Myjar to lend to 
Mr P.
Ref: DRN68558802When Mr P took out his first loan I think Myjar was entitled to rely on the information Mr P 
provided. This suggested that he was well able to afford this borrowing as hed said his 
monthly income was more  than £2,000 and his expenses were  less than £1000. 
When Mr P took out loans  2 and 3 his disposable  income was down  a little and his outgoings 
had increased. But these loans were for much smaller  amounts  than hed borrowed when he 
took out loan 1. And he took out loan 2 after hed already repaid loan 1 - without having  
given any indication that had been  difficult for him to do, as far as I can see. Although  he 
repaid loan 2 in just four days and took out loan 3 for more money, I dont think  that alone 
was sufficient to make  Myjar think that it shouldnt have kept lending  to Mr P. 
Looking at the information he provided  to Myjar it still looks  to me like the monthly 
repayments he had to make on loans 2 and 3 shouldve been easily affordable  for him. 
Mr P seems  to have made his repayments  to his loans on time, until after taking out loan 4. 
Although this was his biggest loan, his declared  monthly income was higher than it had been 
previously. 
And after allowing  for the monthly outgoings  he told Myjar about, it still looked like his 
disposable income was around four times  the amount of his monthly repayments on loan 4. 
Mr P says Myjar  shouldve known he was in financial difficulties at the time it lent to him, due 
to other  loans he had outstanding. 
If Myjar had looked  in more depth at Mr Ps finances, its likely it would've seen that he had a 
revolving credit facility set up when he applied for loan 4. I can see details of this on the copy  
of Mr Ps credit file which  hes provided. This shows the credit limit was £396 and hed 
mostly used  that. And it looks like he was also paying a car loan and he had a credit card.
I appreciate he was paying for other debt elsewhere.  But I can also see that Mr P declared  
that his outgoing monthly  credit commitments  were between £250 and £300 per month.  So 
I dont think it was wrong for Myjar to rely on the information Mr P provided in relation to how 
much he paid on a monthly  basis towards  that debt.  
And Ive seen nothing, and havent  been provided with any information, to suggest that 
further checks to verify what  Mr P was saying wouldve  shown that providing loan 4 to him 
was unfair.  
In order to uphold  this complaint I have to be able to safely say a lender did something 
wrong. And, in this case, overall, I dont think that Sunny did anything  wrong  in deciding to 
lend to Mr P. 
I appreciate that my decision will likely come as a disappointment to Mr P but I hope my 
explanations help him understand why Ive reached these conclusions. 
I take this opportunity to remind Myjar (or any third party if the debt has been sold on) that it 
should discuss payment  options with Mr P and treat him fairly and sympathetically if Mr P 
needs further time to pay what he still owes. And if Mr P would like help to manage  his 
finances theres more  information about how to get free debt advice on our website  or we 
can provide contact details if he gives us a call. 
Ref: DRN68558803my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 January 2020.
