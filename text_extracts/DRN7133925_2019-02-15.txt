K821x#15complaint
Mr P has complained about a series of instalment  loans he took out with Gain  Credit LLC 
(trading as Lending Stream).
Mr P says that he was in a debt spiral to the extent  that the loans were not affordable. 
Lending Stream didnt  properly carry out affordability checks  at each new loan to assess 
signs of his over indebtedness.
background
Mr P started borrowing from Lending  Stream in March 2015. In total, he went  on to take a 
total of 44 loans with the last of them being taken in June 2017.  For the sake  of clarity, Ive 
set out Mr Ps overall loan history in a table (Appendix A) at the end of this provisional 
decision.
When it looked at Mr Ps complaint, Lending Stream didnt agree that it lent irresponsibly to 
Mr P. It said that the checks  it carried out, amongst other things, included:
Mr Ps credit  rating  at the time of application;
Mr Ps employment status;
Mr P declared income and expenditure;
national  averages for expense categories as third party  verification of Mr Ps 
declarations;
Mr Ps other credit obligations at the time.
Lending Stream said that it considered all of this information before approving Mr Ps loans. 
And that it didnt think it had done anything wrong when providing any of them. So Lending 
Stream didnt uphold  Mr Ps complaint.  Mr P was dissatisfied with Lending  Streams  
response and referred the complaint to our service.
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mr Ps complaint. He thought that Lending Stream unfairly  
provided the loans  from loan eight  onwards to Mr P. So he partially upheld Mr Ps complaint. 
Lending Stream didnt  respond to our adjudicators  assessment. So the case  was passed to 
an ombudsman for a final decision.
the legal and regulatory framework
Lending Stream gave  Mr P his loans while it was regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA).  Lending Stream initially obtained interim permission to provide consumer 
credit before it went on to successfully apply for authorisation as a high-cost  short-term 
credit provider. Lending Streams interim permission to provide consumer credit and its 
eventual authorisation to do so meant  that it was subject to the FCA rules  and regulations  
from 1 April 2014.
the FCA Principles  for Business (PRIN)
The FCAs Principles for Business  set out the overarching requirements which all authorised  
firms are required to comply with.
PRIN 1.1.1G, says
Ref: DRN71339252The Principles apply  in whole or in part to every firm.
The Principles themselves are set out in PRIN 2.1.1R. And the most relevant principle here 
is PRIN 2.1.1 R (6) which says:
A firm must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.
the Consumer  Credit sourcebook (CONC)
This sets out the rules  which apply to providers of consumer credit  like Lending Stream.  
CONC 5 sets out a firms obligations  in relation to responsible lending. And CONC 6 sets out 
a firms obligations after a consumer has entered into a regulated agreement.
Its clear there is a high degree of alignment between  the rules  set out in CONC 5 and 
CONC 6 and the Irresponsible Lending Guidance (ILG) published by the former regulator  
of Consumer Credit providers the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in March  2010. As is evident 
from the following  extracts,  the FCAs CONC rules specifically note and refer back to 
sections of the OFTs Irresponsible Lending Guidance on many occasions.
Section 5.2.1R(2) of CONC  sets out what a lender needs to do before agreeing  to give a 
consumer a loan of this type.  It says a firm must consider:
(a)the potential  for the commitments  under the regulated credit agreement  to adversely 
impact the customers financial situation, taking into account  the information  of which  
the firm is aware  at the time the regulated credit agreement is to be made; and
[Note: paragraph 4.1 of ILG]
(b)the ability of the customer to make repayments as they fall due over the life of the 
regulated credit  agreement, or for such an agreement which is an open-end 
agreement, to make repayments  within a reasonable period.
[Note: paragraph 4.3 of ILG]
CONC also includes guidance  about  proportionality  of assessments. CONC 5.2.4G(2) says:
A firm should consider  what  is appropriate  in any particular circumstances dependent  on, for 
example, the type and amount of credit  being  sought and the potential  risks to the customer.  
The risk of credit not being sustainable directly  relates to the amount of credit  granted and 
the total charge for credit relative to the customers financial  situation.
[Note: paragraph 4.11 and part of 4.16 of ILG]
CONC 5.3 contains further guidance  on what a lender should bear in mind  when thinking 
about affordability. And CONC 5.3.1G(1) says:
In making the creditworthiness assessment  or the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R 
(1), a firm should take into account more  than assessing the customers ability  to repay the 
credit.
[Note: paragraph 4.2 of ILG]
Ref: DRN71339253CONC 5.3.1G(2) then says:
The creditworthiness assessment and the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R (1) should 
include the firm taking  reasonable  steps to assess the customers  ability to meet repayments 
under a regulated credit  agreement in a sustainable  manner without the customer  incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant  adverse  consequences.
[Note: paragraph 4.1 (box) and 4.2 of ILG]
CONC 5.3.1G(6) goes  on to say:
For the purposes of CONC  sustainable means  the repayments under  the regulated credit 
agreement can be made by the customer :
(a)without undue difficulties, in particular:
(i) the customer should be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments;  and
(ii) without having to borrow  to meet the repayments ;
(b)over the life of the agreement, or for such an agreement which  is an open-end 
agreement, within a reasonable  period; and
(c) out of income and savings without having  to realise security  or assets; and
unsustainable has the opposite meaning.
[Note: paragraph 4.3 and 4.4 of ILG]
In respect of the need to double-check information disclosed by applicants,  CONC 5.3.1G(4) 
has a reference  to paragraphs  4.13,  4.14, and 4.15 of ILG and states:
(a)it is not generally sufficient for a firm to rely solely for its assessment of the 
customers income and expenditure on a statement of those matters  made  by the 
customer.
And CONC 5.3.7R says that:
A firm must not accept an application for credit under  a regulated  credit  agreement where 
the firm knows or ought reasonably to suspect  that the customer  has not been  truthful  in 
completing the application in relation to information supplied by the customer  relevant to the 
creditworthiness assessment or the assessment required  by CONC 5.2.2R (1).
[Note: paragraph 4.31 of ILG]
CONC 6.7 sets out a firms obligations  in relation to its post contract business practices. 
CONC 6.7.21G, CONC 6.7.22G and CONC 6.7.23R  contained  specific obligations for 
high- cost short-term credit providers  like Lending  Stream.
CONC 6.7.21G says:
Ref: DRN71339254A firm should not refinance high-cost short-term credit where to do so is unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful.
[Note: paragraph 6.25 of ILG]
CONC 6.7.22G says:
A firm should not allow a customer to enter  into consecutive agreements  with the firm for 
high-cost short-term credit if the cumulative effect  of the agreements  would be that the total 
amount payable by the customer is unsustainable.
[Note: paragraph 6.25 (box) of ILG]
Section 6.25 of the ILG is set out on pages  four and five of this decision and is concerned  
with what the OFT referred to as deceptive and/or unfair practices.
CONC 6.7.23R (which applied from 1 July 2014) says:
A firm must not refinance high-cost short-term credit  (other  than by exercising forbearance) 
on more than two occasions.
CONC 6.7.17R defines refinancing and says:
(1)In CONC 6.7.18 R to CONC 6.7.23 R refinance  means to extend,  or purport to 
extend, the period over which one or more repayment is to be made  by a customer  
whether by:
(a)agreeing with the customer to replace, vary or supplement an existing 
regulated credit  agreement;
(b)exercising  a contractual  power  contained in an existing regulated credit 
agreement; or
(c)other means, for example, granting an indulgence or waiver to the customer.
(2)Exercise forbearance means  to refinance a regulated credit  agreement where the 
result is that no interest accrues at any time in relation  to that agreement or any 
which replaces, varies or supplements it from the date of the refinancing and either:
(a)there is no charge  in connection with the refinancing; or
(b)the only additional charge is a reasonable estimate of the actual and 
necessary cost of the additional  administration required in connection with the 
refinancing.
(3)The term refinance  within  paragraph (1) does not include where  under a regulated  
credit agreement  repayable in instalments  a customer  requests a change  in the 
regular payment date and as a result there is no charge or additional interest in 
connection with the change.
Section 140 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974
Ref: DRN71339255All of Mr Ps loans were given to him after Section 140 of the Consumer Credit Act came into 
force on 6 April 2007. Section 140A sets out circumstances where the court may determine 
that the relationship between a creditor and a debtor is unfair  to the debtor. Section 140A 
says:
140A Unfair  relationships between creditors and debtors
(1)The court may make an order under section 140B in connection with a credit 
agreement if it determines that the relationship  between the creditor and the 
debtor arising  out of the agreement (or the agreement taken with any related 
agreement) is unfair to the debtor because of one or more of the following-
(a)any of the terms of the agreement or of any related agreement;
(b)the way in which the creditor  has exercised or enforced  any of his rights 
under the agreement  or any related agreement;
(c)any other thing done (or not done) by, or on behalf  of, the creditor (either 
before or after the making of the agreement or any related  agreement).
(2)In deciding whether  to make a determination  under this section the court  shall 
have regard to all matters  it thinks relevant (including matters  relating to the 
creditor and matters  relating to the debtor).
(3)For the purposes of this section the court shall (except to the extent that it is not 
appropriate to do so) treat anything done (or not done) by, or on behalf of, or in 
relation to, an associate or a former associate of the creditor as if done (or not 
done) by, or on behalf of, or in relation to, the creditor.
(4)A determination may be made  under this section  in relation to a relationship 
notwithstanding that the relationship may have ended.
(5)An order  under section 140B shall not be made in connection with a credit  
agreement which is an exempt agreement [for the purposes of Chapter 14A of 
Part 2 of the Regulated  Activities Order by virtue of article  60C(2) of that Order  
(regulated mortgage contracts and regulated home purchase  plans)]
Section 140B sets out the types  of order the court could make should it determine  that the 
relationship between the creditor  and debtor is unfair to the debtor. Section 140B says:
140B Powers of court in relation to unfair relationships
(1)An order  under this section in connection  with a credit agreement may do one or 
more of the following
(a)require the creditor, or any associate or former associate of his, to repay 
(in whole  or in part) any sum paid by the debtor  or by a surety  by virtue of 
the agreement  or any related agreement (whether paid to the creditor,  the 
associate or the former associate  or to any other  person);]
Ref: DRN71339256(b)require the creditor, or any associate or former associate of his, to do or 
not to do (or to cease  doing) anything specified  in the order  in connection  
with the agreement or any related  agreement;
(c)reduce or discharge any sum payable by the debtor or by a surety  by 
virtue of the agreement or any related agreement;
(d)direct  the return to a surety of any property provided by him for the 
purposes of a security;
(e)otherwise set aside  (in whole or in part) any duty imposed on the debtor 
or on a surety  by virtue  of the agreement or any related agreement;
(f)alter the terms of the agreement or of any related agreement;
(g)direct  accounts to be taken, or (in Scotland) an accounting to be made, 
between any persons.
the law
Ive also taken account of the Consumer Credit Act (including the provisions  I havent  set out 
above), and other relevant  legislation, including the law relating  to negligence, 
misrepresentation and contract;  as well as the law relating to causation and remoteness.
my findings
I have read and considered all the evidence and arguments available to me from the outset, 
in order to decide what is, in my opinion, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the 
case.
Taking into account the relevant rules,  guidance,  good industry  practice and law, I think the 
overarching questions I need to consider in deciding whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint are:
Did Lending Stream, for each loan, complete reasonable  and proportionate  checks  to 
satisfy itself that Mr P would be able to repay the loan in a sustainable way?
oIf not, would  those checks have shown that Mr P wouldve been  able to do so?
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern 
of lending increase Mr Ps indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise 
harmful?
Did Lending Stream act unfairly  or unreasonably in some  other  way?
If I determine that Lending Stream did not act fairly and reasonably in its dealings with Mr P 
and that he has lost out as a result, I will go on to consider what  is fair compensation.
Ref: DRN71339257Did Lending  Stream, for each loan, complete reasonable  and proportionate  checks  to satisfy  
itself that Mr P would  be able to repay  the loans in a sustainable way?
A lender will determine its own risk appetite  when  providing short-term  loans. In other words, 
itll decide how much  risk  in relation  to not getting its money back  it is prepared to accept 
when deciding to lend to a consumer.  But the rules  throughout the time Mr P was 
borrowing from Lending Stream   also require  a lender to carry out a reasonable 
assessment of whether the borrower can afford to meet the repayment (or repayments) in a 
sustainable manner.
This is commonly  referred to or called an affordability assessment or affordability check. 
And a lender  is required to carry out any such affordability assessment in addition to any 
creditworthiness assessment to assess the level of its risk. Affordability checks  should be 
both borrower-focused  and proportionate. Its whether Lending Stream fulfilled this 
obligation to Mr P that is what Im concerned about and is the first key question I have to 
determine in order  to decide this case.
What constitutes a proportionate affordability  check will be dependent upon a number of 
factors including  but not limited  to  the particular circumstances of the borrower  (such  as 
their financial  history, current situation  and outlook, and any indications  of vulnerability or 
financial difficulty) and the amount / type / cost of credit they are seeking. Even for the same 
customer, a proportionate  check could  look different  for different  loan applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have  
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the longer  the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit  is likely 
to be greater and the customer is required to make  payments for an extended period); 
and
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed  a proportionate check 
should be for a given  loan application  including  (but not limited to) any indications of 
borrower vulnerability, any foreseeable changes in future circumstances, or any substantial 
time gaps  between loans. Ive thought  about  all the relevant factors  in this case.
Ive already explained on page one of this decision what Lending Stream  told Mr P about the 
checks it carried out before giving him his loans.
Ref: DRN71339258loans 1 to 4
Its important to note that loans one to three were Mr Ps first loans with Lending Stream. 
Lending Stream says that Mr P was asked for (and gave) details about his income  and 
expenditure when he sought  his first four loans.
Lending Stream also says that it completed a credit check  on Mr P before providing these 
loans. The guidance sets out that a proportionate  check may include checks  such  as a 
credit score or a credit  report from a credit reference agency. But Lending  Stream  has 
only provided details  of Mr Ps recorded credit score. And Lending  Stream hasnt provided 
any further context  about  what this score  represented.
So, at this stage,  its difficult  for me to place any weight on these scores in deciding whether 
Lending Stream completed proportionate  checks before approving this lending.  And while it 
has referred to the steps it took to validate  the information Mr P provided, Lending Stream 
hasnt provided  any details on how this was done  or what this showed.
I do think that there is an argument for querying  why Mr P would need to borrow £90, £100, 
£120 and £120 again and repay  it in instalments if hed genuinely  had in excess  of £1000 in 
disposable income available to him. Notwithstanding  my concerns  I cant see anything to 
suggest that Lending Stream  had a reason to conclude that the information provided was 
wholly inaccurate. Given the relatively small amounts borrowed and the fact that there  were  
some gaps between  loans being repaid and then new ones taken, I dont think that it was 
wholly unreasonable for Lending Stream to rely on the information  provided, or for it not to 
ask further questions.
So overall I dont  think that Lending Streams checks were unreasonable  and/or 
disproportionate in the circumstances. And as a result I dont think Lending Stream acted 
unfairly in providing  Mr P loans one to three.
loans 5 to 44
Lending Stream cant evidence  having  done anything differently to what  it did for loans one 
to four, before it decided to give Mr P loans five to forty-four. But while  Im prepared  to 
accept that the checks carried  out were just about reasonable and proportionate for loans 
one to four, I dont  think that this is the case for loans  five to forty-nine. And I think that it 
would have been fair and reasonable for Lending Stream  to have done more.
This is because Mr Ps fifth loan with Lending Stream  came  around a week  or so after him 
settling his fourth one. He was seeking nearly  double what hed borrowed for his first loan. 
And for this application Lending Stream recorded  that Mr P had a monthly income of £6000  
and monthly expenditure of £441, which left him with almost £5600 in disposable income.
While I was prepared to give Lending  Stream the benefit of the doubt  about  it not 
questioning the accuracy  of the information it obtained before loans one to four were 
provided, I cant see any reasonable  basis  for it accepting the information provided for loan 
five.
Mr Ps income was recorded as being almost  four times more than what it was around a 
week earlier. And despite supposedly having monthly disposable income  of around £5600 
Mr P needed  to borrow £160,  only a few days after repaying £120,  and repay it over six 
months. Im also concerned by the veracity of Lending Streams  verification of information.
Ref: DRN71339259Lending Streams  final response said that it used national averages  for expense categories 
as third party verification  of Mr Ps declarations. Yet it has not provided any detail 
whatsoever on how this verification took place and what  it showed in Mr Ps case.
Considering that this is information that Lending  Stream itself says it collected and it says it 
used to inform  its lending decisions,  its disappointing that Lending Stream has been unable  
to tell me what the data was and what it revealed about Mr Ps circumstances when he 
applied for his loans.
For the avoidance of doubt, Lending Stream is responsible for explaining why any lending it 
approved was fair. Given that Lending Stream has been  insistent  in saying that all of Mr Ps 
loans were responsibly lent, it ought  to know  and have explained  not only what  data it 
analysed, but also how it used and interpreted this information to make  responsible  lending  
decisions.
This service cannot and will not take it as read that any possible third party  verification 
resulted in fair lending decisions.  This is especially when its the case that weve been 
provided with nothing on the verification and in circumstances where  this verification doesnt 
appear to have highlighted any anomalies when presented by such  outrageous information. 
In these circumstances, I think Lending  Stream ought to have  suspected that the information 
it was provided with was wholly inaccurate.
Im also mindful that by this stage Lending Streams lending history with Mr P  in terms of 
the number of loans he needed during  what was a relatively short period - ought to have 
alerted it to the possibility that Mr P mightve  been  struggling to repay his borrowing from 
disposable income too. Mr P was coming back for a fifth loan mere  days  after settling his 
fourth one. And this time he was looking  to borrow more than hed ever borrowed before.
In my view, the clear and obvious anomalies in the information provided  and Lending  
Streams record  of its previous dealings  with Mr P mean that rather than simply continuing  to 
rely on what it had been told by Mr P about  his income and employment,  it wouldve been 
fair and reasonable for Lending Stream to have taken steps  to verify Mr Ps actual financial 
position. And I want to make it clear that given the lack of detail  about  its verification checks, 
Im not satisfied that Lending Streams verification was more likely than not sufficient to meet 
this.
In terms of the loans  from loan six onwards,  Mr P was borrowing  repeatedly  and regularly. 
And given  how far into its lending relationship  with Mr P it was, at this stage, it no longer  
mattered what Mr P was saying. In these  circumstances,  I think  that Lending Stream should 
have been taking steps to verify  the information  being provided in order  to get a better 
understanding of Mr Ps financial  position. It could have done this by asking for information 
such as bank statements, copies of bills, or even proof of Mr Ps income. In any event, the 
crux of what  Lending Stream  needed to get a better  understanding of was just why was Mr P 
kept coming back for further loans so often.
All of this means  that, to remain proportionate,  Lending Streams  checks  from loan five 
onwards needed to be more thorough than theyd been for loans one to four. Theres  no 
evidence that Lending Stream did any of this (even  its verification checks were done 
previously)  or any other additional assessment of Mr Ps circumstances  from loans 5 to 
44. So I dont  think Lending Stream completed reasonable and proportionate affordability  
checks on loans 5 to 44.
Ref: DRN713392510Would reasonable and proportionate  checks on loans 5 to 44 have indicated to Lending 
Stream that Mr P would have been unable to sustainably repay the loan(s)?
loans 5 to 7
As proportionate  checks werent carried out for these loans, I cant say for sure what  they 
wouldve shown. So I need to decide  whether it is more likely than not that a proportionate 
check would  have told Lending Stream that it was unfair to offer these loans to Mr P. Mr P 
has provided us with limited evidence of his financial circumstances at the time he applied 
for these  loans.
Of course,  I accept different checks might show different things. And just because something  
shows up in the information Mr P has provided, it doesnt mean it wouldve shown up in any 
checks Lending Stream mightve carried out. But in the absence  of anything  else from 
Lending Stream showing  what information it gathered (and how it interpreted it), I think  its 
fair and reasonable to place considerable weight  on it as an indication of what Mr Ps 
financial circumstances were likely to have  been at the time.
Having considered the information Mr Ps provided,  while my experience of short-term 
lending complaints leads me to have my own thoughts on what Mr Ps financial 
circumstances mightve  been like, overall I dont have enough to say its more  likely than not, 
reasonable and proportionate checks wouldve shown  Lending Stream  that Mr P couldnt  
have sustainably made the repayments for loans 5 to 7. But, for reasons Ill explain on page 
11, I dont think  this, in itself, means that this overall  pattern of lending  was sustainable.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 8 to 44 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Thinking about  the short-term purpose  of the loans  provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ps indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or harmful in some  
other way?
In addition to assessing the affordability  of each individual loan provided to Mr P by Lending 
Stream, I also think its fair and reasonable to look at the overall  pattern of lending. Bearing 
in mind the short-term  purpose of this type of credit  and the relevant rules (especially the 
need for a lender to ensure that a borrower could sustainably repay their loan), guidance and 
good industry practice at the time (as summarised in the earlier part of this decision), it 
seems to me that there may come a point at which a responsible lender would reasonably 
question whether continuing  to offer further short-term loans to a customer who appears to 
be persistently reliant upon them was unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
Ive already concluded that reasonable and proportionate affordability checks  werent  
completed from loan five onwards. And that based  on the evidence  on file, I cant  say that 
proportionate checks wouldve  shown loans five to eight to have been  individually  
unaffordable. Equally even though the number of loans was becoming quite high, these were 
instalment loans that were being  repaid early.  So the period of time that it took Mr P to reach 
his eighth loan (around eight and a half months) was still relatively short.
So even though I think that there were some  warning  signs that Lending Stream  ought to 
have been alert to, I dont  think I can say that the pattern of lending had, in itself, become 
demonstrably unsustainable  or harmful  such that I could reasonably say that the facts  
spoke for themselves  before loan eight.
Ref: DRN713392511Looking beyond loan eight, though, I think theres  a clear mismatch  between the intended  
purpose of this type of credit and the way in which Lending Stream has allowed it to be used. 
These loans are meant  to be a short-term  solution  to temporary cash flow problems as set 
out in CONC and referred back to in the ILG. Yet Lending Stream has persistently  and 
repeatedly provided  consecutive loans to Mr P over an extended period of time  a period 
encompassing well over two years.
From this perspective,  having carefully  considered everything,  I think  the point at which this 
chain of lending  became  unsustainable and harmful is from loan eight. For this reason, 
I dont think that theres any need  for me to recreate  individual,  proportionate checks  for 
loans 8 to 44.
To explain, Ive already said that there  was an emerging pattern, between loans 1 and 7, of 
Mr P taking out new loans  not too long after repaying previous ones. And I think  that by loan 
eight, Lending  Stream ought fairly and reasonably to have  regarded  that pattern as 
established and that Mr Ps financial  position  was worsening.
Furthermore Mr P applied for loan eight on the day he repaid loan seven. And he was 
seeking the highest amount hed sought  so far. In my view,  Mr P was never  able to recover 
and get himself on an even financial keel from this point onwards.
I say this because  while Lending Stream may have been received payments  from Mr P after 
this, he wasnt truly settling his loans  over the life of the credit  agreements.  Instead, what  
Mr P was doing was borrowing further  funds from Lending Stream in order  to cover the gap 
in his finances left by the repayment of the previous loan. In other words, he was only able to 
repay a previous loan because he knew hed be able to obtain another  one shortly 
afterwards.
Mr Ps borrowing  history  between his first and seventh loan shows  that the capital owing to 
Lending Stream hadnt reduced either. Loan seven  was for nearly as much  as loan one. And 
while there was one loan that was for a lower amount  all of the others  were  for more.
After loan eight,  the amounts Mr P borrowed  continued to fluctuate. But there  is a clear 
upward trajectory in the amount that was being lent by Lending Stream.
Looking at the loans in this chain (loans 8  44), I can see that:
only 5 were for less than his starting  amount  of £90  and on each occasion Mr P then 
went on to borrow substantially more  (on the same day on least  one occasion);
21 were for more than double  Mr Ps starting amount;
there are times when Mr P was borrowing more  than four times what  he initially 
borrowed;
on a number of occasions Mr P had more than one loan outstanding at a time.
Over the approaching three and a half year period of this loan chain,  Mr P borrowed an 
average amount  of £170. For access to this money, he paid approaching £1100  in interest, 
fees and charges.
Ref: DRN713392512I think, during  these  periods, that Mr P was, in effect, merely servicing his debt to Lending 
Stream  in other words,  he was paying  interest without making inroads into the outstanding 
capital. And although the amounts fluctuated,  there is a clear upward trend in what he was 
borrowing. For example,  he never  borrowed less than double his initial starting amount in 
2017.
In my view, this ought to have shown Lending Stream that these loans were  unsustainable.  
Mr P was proving unable  to clear his indebtedness within a reasonable period of time.  And 
Lending Stream was fuelling this by providing him with further borrowing to cover  the hole 
paying previous  loans  was leaving his finances.  Mr Ps lending  history with Lending Stream 
in itself suggests that he was only able to repay by further borrowing, which CONC 5.3.1G(6) 
says is indicative of unsustainable lending.
The effect of Lending Stream allowing Mr P to take such  a long sequence of loans was that 
he found himself paying  high interest charges over an extended period for loans that were 
only intended to be for short-term use. Lending  Streams  actions  had the effect of unfairly 
trapping him into repeatedly taking this type of credit.  Mr P was paying Lending Stream  high 
amounts of interest  for the privilege of it allowing him to delay dealing with his unsustainable 
debt. Lending  Stream arguably unfairly took advantage of Mr Ps position and left him 
continually owing it money.
So given all of Lending Streams obligations, the short-term purpose of this kind of high-cost 
credit, and what I think is fair and reasonable taking into account the circumstances and 
everything Ive covered  in this section, I think that Lending Stream acted unfairly  in providing 
Mr P with loans 8 to 44.
Did Mr P lose out as a result of Lending  Streams shortcomings in relation to loans 8 to 44?
I think that Mr P suffered adverse consequences  as a result  of Lending Stream  unfairly 
giving him loans 8 to 44. I think this is the case for two key reasons.
Firstly, these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness to Lending 
Stream by allowing him to take expensive  credit  which the rules and guidance made  clear  
was only intended  for short-term use  over an extended period of time (more  than two 
years).
These loans were very expensive although  I accept  that Mr Ps actions in settling some early  
took meant that some of them were  effectively taken over very short terms (sometimes a 
couple of days). For regular and prolonged access to relatively small sums of money (Ive 
already explained that it was an average  of £170), Mr P paid many multiples in interest, fees 
and charges. And I think that the overall  cost of these loans unfairly prolonged Mr Ps 
adverse financial  position.
Secondly, the sheer number of loans involved is likely to have had implications for Mr Ps 
ability to access mainstream credit. The greater the presence of short-term  loans on Mr Ps 
credit file the less likely Mr P was able to rehabilitate his finances  and regain access  to 
mainstream credit.
In my view, Lending Stream giving Mr P such a large number of loans (which  it shouldnt 
have done) unfairly placed him in a position where he was effectively trapped into taking  
very expensive high-cost  loans over an extended period as no-one else would lend to him. 
Ref: DRN713392513He kept turning to Lending  Stream because he no longer  had access to more  sustainable  
forms of credit. And because he constantly owed  it money.
So overall and having carefully thought  about everything provided and whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this case,  I think that Mr P lost out because Lending 
Stream unfairly gave  him loans 8 to 44, which it ought to have realised were unsustainable 
and harmful for him. And this means  that Lending Stream needs to put things right.
Did Lending  Stream act unfairly or unreasonably in some other  way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude Lending  Stream acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr P in 
some other way.
Overall and having carefully thought  about the three overarching questions, set out on page 
six of this decision, I think that Lending Stream unfairly gave Mr P loans 8 to 44, when it 
ought to have realised that they were  unsustainable  and otherwise harmful for him.
fair compensation  what  Lending Stream needs  to do to put things right  for Mr P
Ive thought about what amounts to fair compensation  in this case. Where I find that a 
business has done something  wrong, Id normally expect that business   in so far as is 
reasonably practicable   to put the consumer in the position they would be in now if that 
wrong hadnt taken  place.  In essence,  in this case, this would mean Lending Stream  putting 
Mr P in the position  hed now be in if he hadnt  been  given the loans Im upholding.
But when it comes to complaints about  irresponsible lending this isnt straightforward.  Mr P 
was given the loans in question and hes used the funds   albeit in reality,  on many 
occasions, what hes effectively done  is repaid previous loans with the funds. So, in these 
circumstances, I cant  undo  whats already  been  done. And its simply not possible to put 
Mr P back  in the position he would be in if he hadnt been given these loans in the first place.
As this is the case, I have to think  about some other way of putting things right in a fair and 
reasonable way bearing in mind all the circumstances of the case. And Id like to explain  the 
reasons why I think that it would be fair and reasonable for Lending Stream  to put things 
right in the following way.
interest and charges on the loans Mr P shouldnt have been given
As Ive explained throughout  this decision, Lending  Stream continually  lending to Mr P left 
him in a position  where he wasnt able to properly settle his debt. This was because Mr P 
kept having to find additional  funds to pay the (increasing) interest and charges on his 
Lending Stream loans.  And then he had to borrow again from Lending Stream to either 
repay others or cover  the hole in his finances  and he incurred more interest and charges 
when he did this. So to start with, I think that Lending Stream  should  refund the interest and 
charges Mr P paid on loans 8 to 44.
Mr P lost the use of the funds he used to pay the interest and charges, I now think that 
Lending Stream needs to refund to him. As Mr P lost the use of these  funds, I think that he 
should be compensated for this.
Ref: DRN713392514We normally ask a business to pay 8% simple interest where  a consumer hasnt had the use 
of funds because  its actions resulted in something having gone  wrong.  Bearing  in mind my 
conclusions in the paragraph  above,  I see no reason to depart from our usual approach here 
and I think awarding  8% per year simple interest,  on the interest and charges  that were  paid, 
is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this case.
So Lending  Stream should pay Mr P 8% per year simple interest on the interest  and charges 
he paid from the date those charges were paid to the date it settles Mr Ps complaint.
Mr Ps credit  file
Generally speaking, Id expect  a lender to remove any adverse information recorded on a 
consumers credit file as a result  of the interest  and charges  on the loans they shouldnt  have 
been given. After all its the interest and charges that the consumer  is being  refunded  and 
the expectation is they will have repaid, or they should repay what  they owe.
But Im upholding  Mr Ps complaint about  loans 8 to 44 because I think the overall pattern of 
lending increased  Mr Ps indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or harmful in some  
other way. I explained that there  were  two main adverse  consequences  of Lending Stream  
having given Mr P so many loans. Firstly it caused  him to pay an excessive amount of 
interest and charges. And Ive already  explained  how Mr P should be compensated for this.
I also explained that the sheer number of loans involved is likely to have had implications for 
Mr Ps ability  to access mainstream credit. The greater the presence of short-term loans on 
Mr Ps credit  file the less likely  Mr P was able to rehabilitate his finances and regain access  
to mainstream credit.  And I think my direction in relation to Mr Ps credit  file needs to reflect  
this.
So while I recognise  the importance  of preserving an accurate picture of Mr Ps credit  history 
and creditworthiness  so that a lender can make  an informed decision on whether lend to 
him, I think that the mere presence of this many loans on Mr Ps credit file, in itself, 
constitutes adverse  information. And I think that this many short term loans appearing on 
Mr Ps credit  file is likely to continue adversely affecting Mr P going forwards.
In these circumstances, I think that it is fair and reasonable  for Lending  Stream  to remove all 
reference to loans 8 to 44 from Mr Ps credit file, as the number of loans in itself is adverse 
information.
All of this means  that I think it would be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of Mr Ps 
complaint for Lending Stream to put things right in the following way:
refund  all the interest, fees and charges for loans 8 to 44; and
add interest at 8% per year simple on the above interest  and charges from the date they 
were paid by Mr P to the date of settlement;
remove all reference to loans  8 to 44 from Mr Ps credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest.  
Lending Stream must give Mr P a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
Ref: DRN713392515my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ps complaint. Gain  Credit LLC (trading as 
Lending Stream)  should pay Mr P compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 March  2019.
