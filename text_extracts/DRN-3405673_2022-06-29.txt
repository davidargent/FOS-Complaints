The complaint
Mr L complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) have unfairly placed a 
permanent limitation on his account and are withholding the funds in his account. 
What happened
Mr L says he operates a Pay Per View company which streams events online for his clients. 
Following an event, PayPal placed a restriction on Mr Ls account and requested further 
information about his business activity. PayPal explained this information was requested 
after a standard review indicated Mr Ls account activity required clarification. PayPal said 
they reserve the right to request additional information from their customers, should it be 
deemed necessary, in order to minimise any possible risk and reduce the likelihood of buyer 
complaints, chargebacks or other forms of reversal. Mr L provided the further information 
requested and PayPal then placed a permanent limitation on Mr Ls account as they said 
they found there may be excessive risk involved in doing business with Mr L. PayPal 
explained, due to the potential risk of chargebacks and other forms of reversals, the 
remaining balance of Â£14,594.66 would be held for up to 180 days. 
Our investigator looked into things for Mr L. He originally thought PayPal had acted unfairly 
in withholding Mr Ls funds. Following receipt of further information from PayPal, our 
investigator then thought PayPal hadnt acted unfairly in placing a permanent limitation on 
Mr Ls account. Mr L disagreed so the matter has come to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. I understand Mr L will be 
disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have made this decision. 
My starting point is the terms and conditions which a customer agrees to when using 
PayPals services. Ive looked at the PayPal User Agreement in place at the time and, under 
the heading Important it says PayPal may close, suspend, or limit your access to your 
Account or our Services, and/or limit access to your funds for up to 180 Days if you violate 
this Agreement including the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy, or any other agreement you 
enter into with PayPal.
I understand Mr L believes he hasnt breached any of PayPals policies or agreements and 
he has provided them with all information theyve requested to investigate the use of his 
account. PayPal have written to Mr L to say they can use commercial judgement to decide 
what factors to consider when making a decision to limit access to an account and they dont 
need to make these public because it would potentially open up routes for somebody to 
circumvent their system. They explained theyre not therefore required to communicate in 
depth information relating to their security review of Mr Ls account.  
PayPal have provided our service with their reasons and evidence to support their decision 
to place a permanent limitation on Mr Ls account. While I cant disclose the reasons to Mr L, 
due to it being commercially sensitive, I wish to reassure Mr L that Ive carefully considered 
the evidence and I dont think its unreasonable for PayPal to have taken the view that Mr L 
has breached the terms of PayPals policy which was in place at the relevant time. And, in 
view of this, the PayPal User Agreement allows PayPal to withhold access to funds for 180 
days. 
PayPal have explained to Mr L this is to guard against the risk of any chargeback claims or 
other forms of reversals. I can see the 180 days have passed and PayPal have now 
released the funds to Mr L. I acknowledge Mr L is concerned he was without his funds for 
180 days, but this is PayPals policy. Our service doesnt have power to require a business 
to change their processes. Or to direct a business on what their policy should be to guard 
against the risk of potential claims. I can look at whether PayPal have applied their policy 
fairly  and in this case, I think they have. 
I note Mr L feels PayPal should be transparent about their reasons so he can understand 
why the limitation was placed. I do acknowledge a customer will want to know specific 
reasons for why their account has been restricted, but PayPal have explained the reasons 
they arent able to disclose this  and I dont think thats unreasonable. 
I can see Mr L believes PayPals charges under their Acceptable Use Policy are unfair. 
Although Mr Ls account wasnt subject to these charges, he feels its an unfair practise and 
should be investigated. As mentioned above, our service doesnt have power to direct a 
business to change their processes  we can only determine if any policies and processes 
have been applied fairly. In this case, no charge has been applied to Mr Ls account so I 
cant say the policy has been applied unfairly. I acknowledge Mr L says he knows of other 
customers who have been subject to charges and feels the lack of transparency of the 
charges is an issue. If Mr L is concerned about PayPals charges process and would like to 
take this forward, then he can raise this complaint with the regulator. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given, it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2022.
