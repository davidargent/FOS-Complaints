The complaint
Mrs G complains that Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) removed the fee waiver on her Gold 
Account (GA) in September 2021 despite her holding over £2000 in her account for many 
years.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs G held a GA for many nearly twenty years and because she kept her balance over 
£2000, she enjoyed the benefits of the account for no fee.
Lloyds says it made a commercial decision to remove the waiver in 2021.
This meant Mrs G had to pay a fee and she says this was unfair.
I can see from Mrs Gs evidence that she is very upset about the change to her account, so 
Ive looked carefully at what happened.
The agreement that Mrs G and Lloyds entered when she took out the GA, allowed both 
parties to withdraw from the agreement with appropriate notice. And it allowed Lloyds to 
change the terms and conditions of the GA provide it gave appropriate notice and allowed 
Mrs G to close or downgrade her account if she wished to.
Ive looked at the letter that Lloyds sent to Mrs G in June 2021 and it provided her with two 
months notice of the removal of the fee waiver. And it offered her the chance to downgrade 
or close her account if she wished.
So, I can understand Mrs Gs feelings after having had the GA with the fee waiver for so 
many years, but in my view Lloyds was entitled to change the account if it wished, and it 
didnt anything wrong when it did so. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mrs Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 April 2022.
