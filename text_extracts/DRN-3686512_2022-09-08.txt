The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) have insisted he provide 
government issued photo identification before they will release funds they hold and allow him 
to close his account with them.    
What happened
In or around August 2020, Mr B attempted to make a payment for a purchase using his 
PayPal account. He experienced problems using their system on his computer which 
ultimately led to payment being processed by PayPal from Mr Bs personal credit card. 
As a result of the transaction problems encountered, Mr B discovered his PayPal account 
had been limited. So, Mr B complained to PayPal about this. PayPal told him he needed to 
provide a government issued identity document which included his photo and date of birth 
details. They said this would enable them to lift the account limitation.
Due to personal circumstances, Mr B didnt have the requested identification available, so 
wasnt able to meet PayPals requirement. Mr B also thought PayPals requirement for 
sensitive personal data breached guidance on the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) issued by the Information Commissioners Office (ICO).
Mr B is able to continue accessing his PayPal account using additional text message 
verification. Hes also able to continue making purchases using the account with payment 
made from his personal credit card. But PayPal arent willing to close his PayPal account or 
return any balance without provision of the photo identification.
In or around October 2020, Mr B complained again to PayPal. In response, PayPal sent him 
details of their account recovery process. But this still resulted in a request for photo 
identification. Mr B escalated his complaint further in or around December 2020. PayPal 
wouldnt change their position. So, in January 2021, Mr B decided to refer his complaint to 
this service.
PayPal wrote to Mr B on 7 January 2021. They confirmed the limitation had been applied to 
his account as they believed it may have been accessed by a third party. They said their 
actions were explained and permitted in their user agreement and lifting the account 
limitation required Mr B to provide the requested identification documents.
Having considered the circumstances of Mr Bs complaint, our investigator didnt think 
PayPal had acted unfairly or unreasonably, so didnt need to take any further action.
Mr B didnt agree with our investigators findings. He said the primary issue was not whether 
PayPal were justified in refusing to recognise his identity, but that they demanded a 
government photo ID containing his date of birth, when he doesnt have one.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Mr Bs complaint has been passed to me to consider. 
In doing so, I reached a different outcome to that of our investigator. Because of that, I 
issues a provisional decision on 4 August 2022  giving both Mr B and PayPal the 
opportunity to respond to my findings below before I reach a final decision.
In my provisional decision, I said:
PayPal told Mr B that the limitation on using his account was because they had reason to 
believe his account may have been accessed by a third party. Mr B has explained that 
changes PayPal made to their software meant cookies were sent to his computers browser. 
Cookies are small information files used by secure software systems to help them recognise 
an individuals computer and its browser as authorised. But the browser Mr B used 
automatically deleted those cookies. Mr B says this meant PayPals system was unable to 
recognise his computer when he tried to access his account.
Such measures are commonly used by financial institutions when an individual uses their 
account and payment software. So, I can understand why this may have created a problem. 
Im unable to conclude this was the specific reason that led to PayPals limitation. But given, 
PayPals concerns, I can understand why they would do what they did. 
Mr B says PayPal still allow him to process payments. But only when he uses his personal 
credit card. PayPals service includes various features. They include the ability to deposit 
funds to make payments or receive payments from other parties. The PayPal account can 
also be used to process payments using a credit or debit card. And as those payment cards 
are normally verified by the issuer, I can understand why PayPal are willing to continue 
processing them.
The issue here relates to the balance still held on Mr Bs PayPal account. Given PayPals 
belief his account may have been accessed by a third party, I can understand why they 
require Mr B to provide satisfactory identification in order to authenticate that any request for 
release of the funds held is legitimate. And, having considered the terms and conditions 
within their user agreement, I dont think PayPals request is unreasonable. 
Unfortunately, Mr B doesnt have identification documents available to meet PayPals stated 
requirement (i.e. government issued with a photo and confirmation of his date of birth). I 
accept this is PayPals process. And it isnt the role of this service to ask a business to alter 
its procedures or processes or impose improvements on the level of service offered to their 
customers. These aspects fall firmly within the remit of the regulator  in this case, the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
But it is our role to examine and decide whether PayPal have been fair and reasonable in 
the manner in which those policies and procedures are applied in the individual 
circumstances of Mr Bs experience with them. When considering whats fair and 
reasonable, Im required to consider; relevant law and regulations, relevant regulatory rules, 
guidance and standards and codes of practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider was 
good industry practice at the relevant time.
The UK Government website provides guidance on how to prove and verify someone's 
identity. Having considered this guidance, I think PayPal have other options available which 
would enable them to verify Mr Bs identity. And these wouldnt necessarily include the 
provision of the specific documents theyve insisted upon. Having considered the various 
exchanges between PayPal and Mr B, Im not persuaded that PayPal explored or offered 
those options in Mr Bs case. 
Our investigator did ask PayPal what would be reasonable for Mr B to provide in order to 
verify his identity. PayPal responded saying Mr B had, at no time, provided any form of 
identity. I think PayPal shouldve done more here. Mr B made it clear he couldnt meet their 
requirements. But I cant see hes ever refused to provide identification. I believe PayPal 
shouldve engaged further with Mr B to explore alternatives and resolve the situation. To summarise, I dont think PayPals request to verify Mr Bs identity before they released 
the funds held was unreasonable. But I do think they shouldve been more proactive in 
seeking an appropriate resolution. For that reason, I intend to uphold Mr Bs complaint. I also 
acknowledge that the whole situation has caused Mr B some inconvenience and is likely to 
have caused some distress. For this reason, I intend to reflect this within my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision, I asked both parties to respond with any new information or 
comments they wanted me to consider. 
Mr B says he believes my provisional decision is a fair summary of both the issues and 
resolution. He also says he now has access to his PayPal account by logging on with his 
username and password, coupled with additional confirmation with a code sent to his mobile 
phone. But hes still unable to update his linked bank account details or transfer his balance 
and close the account. He also says hes been able to send funds to PayPal using a verified 
bank account. He thinks this should be sufficient for PayPal to verify that the account he 
attempted to link was the one used for that payment and establish his identity.
PayPal didnt agree with my findings. They said, We require the customer to provide photo 
ID to confirm his identity. This is a requirement and most financial institutions will request this 
when opening an account or during the lifetime of the account and we are no different.
Ive considered Mr Bs further comments. While I appreciate why he might think that 
PayPals acceptance of payments from a verified bank account should be sufficient to 
establish his identity, I dont agree on this occasion. Its possible for payments to be made to 
Mr Bs PayPal account from any party using a debit or credit card. This is part of the 
payment processing service provided by PayPal. But this doesnt enable PayPal themselves 
to specifically verify that Mr B is the rightful account holder and, therefore, the beneficiary of 
any balance held. 
As I explained in my provisional decision, I dont think PayPals requirement for updated 
identification is unreasonable here. And I can appreciate why they wont release any funds 
held or close his account until theyve verified his identity. 
I also agree that PayPal are required to complete appropriate checks in order to verify Mr Bs 
identity and meet their regulatory obligations. But I dont agree this should be limited to 
government issued photo identification. 
PayPals user agreement includes the following: We may request information from you as 
we reasonably require to facilitate our actions described in this user agreement, enable us to 
reduce the risk of fraud or comply with our regulatory (including anti-money laundering) 
obligations
But the key word here is reasonably. This service makes its decisions on the basis of what 
would be fair and reasonable. Mr B doesnt hold either a passport or driving license 
displaying his photo. And government issued personal photo identification isnt currently a 
legal requirement in the UK. So, I dont think its reasonable for PayPal to insist that Mr B 
provides something he doesnt hold. That wouldnt be fair here.In my provisional decision, I referred to the UK Governments website which provides 
guidance on how to prove and verify someone's identity. I think this is clear there are 
alternative forms of identification that would be acceptable and would enable PayPal to meet 
their regulatory obligations. And for that reason, Im not persuaded to vary from my 
provisional decision.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold Mr Bs complaint.
I require PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to:
engage with Mr B to agree upon an acceptable form of identification, taking into 
consideration current published guidance; and
pay compensation to Mr B of £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 October 2022.
