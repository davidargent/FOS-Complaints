The complaint
Miss A complains NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (NewDay) gave her credit card lending that 
was unaffordable.
What happened
In September 2014 Miss A applied for a NewDay Aqua credit card. NewDay initially gave 
Miss A a £300 credit limit, but her Aqua credit limit increased as follows over the next few 
years:
January 2015  increased to £950 by NewDay
June 2015  increased to £1,200 by NewDay
December 2015  increased to £1,800 at Miss As request
May 2016  increased to £2,700by NewDay
October 2016  increased to £3,550 by NewDay
March 2017  increased to £4,750 by NewDay
By 2018 Miss As Aqua account was in arrears and NewDay passed it to a separate debt 
collector. In October 2019 the debt collector applied to court for a judgement in relation to 
this debt. Miss A admitted the claim and the court made a judgment against Miss A.
In July 2020 Miss A complained to NewDay about her Aqua account, as she thought it 
shouldnt have lent to her because her credit record showed other debts and missed 
payments. NewDay didnt give a final response to Miss As complaint, but did give Miss A 
the right to refer her complaint to our service. Miss A contacted us, saying NewDays Aqua 
lending financially affected her and resulted in a court judgment being made against her. 
Our investigator considered Miss As complaint but didnt uphold it, as he thought NewDay 
had carried out reasonable and proportionate lending checks for Miss As Aqua account. 
Miss A disagreed, saying NewDay should have seen her debt had started to spiral and 
shouldnt have increased the credit limit. Miss A provided evidence of payday loans and a 
copy of her credit report. 
Our investigator reconsidered Miss As complaint, and asked for more information regarding 
the court judgment. After considering this information, our investigator ultimately thought this 
was a complaint our service shouldnt consider, as it was more suitable for court. He said a 
court awarded a judgment against Miss A and our service didnt have the power to overturn 
it. And Miss A ought to have raised her lending affordability concerns with the court at that 
time. 
Miss A said she didnt know she could defend the court judgment on grounds of affordability 
and couldnt afford the cost of that in any case. She understood our service couldnt overturn 
the court judgment but still thought NewDay shouldnt have lent her so much given her 
financial circumstances. Miss A asked for her complaint to be passed to an ombudsman for 
a decision. She added that the Financial Conduct Authoritys Consumer Credit Sourcebook 
(CONC) meant NewDay should have done further creditworthiness assessments. Miss A 
explained shed had payday loans, as well as other short term, credit card and store card 
lending across during the time she had her Aqua account. And shed immediately spent any 
repayments she made to her Aqua account.
As Miss A requested, her complaint was passed to me to decide whether it was a complaint 
our service should consider. I contacted Miss A and NewDay to say I thought our service 
should consider it. I said this was because while a court judgment was later made against 
Miss A for debt related to the Aqua lending, that judgment wasnt sought by NewDay but 
instead by the separate debt collector. So I didnt think it would be fair or reasonable to say 
Miss A ought to have known she could raise an issue about her Aqua account as a defence 
to court action brought by a separate business.
Miss A accepted this. NewDay didnt provide any further comments. As I thought this was a 
complaint our service should consider, I went on to consider the merits of Miss As complaint 
against NewDay. On 17 December 2021 I issued my provisional decision, in which I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss A complains NewDays initial lending and the credit limit increases were unaffordable. 
Broadly speaking, when a business is lending or increasing lending, its required to carry out 
checks which are reasonable and proportionate to the amount being lent. And it should show 
it considered that the borrower wouldve been able to sustainably repay the credit provided, 
without causing undue difficulty and without having to borrow further to meet other financial 
commitments. Sustainably repay means the borrower should be able to repay the full 
amount of credit within a reasonable time.
NewDay says its Aqua card is for customers who are new to credit or trying to rebuild their 
credit, so it's not unusual to see customers with a poor credit history open this credit card 
account. From the credit card application, NewDay considered Miss As income and 
expenditure at that time. Miss A said she had a gross income of £15,000, with access to 
other household income of £3,000, and unsecured debt of £800. NewDay also considered 
Miss As credit record and saw she had two defaults, the last one being about two years 
prior to the application, and the value of the defaults was £200. And that Miss A had no 
adverse public records, no pay day loans and no accounts in arrears at that time. 
Miss As application passed NewDays lending criteria, and it gave her a relatively small 
credit limit of £300. Taking all this into account, Im satisfied NewDay carried out reasonable 
and proportionate checks when Miss A applied for an Aqua account, and that it made a fair 
lending decision. 
NewDay says that each time it offered Miss A a credit limit increase, it looked at various 
factors including how Miss A had managed her Aqua account and how much of her credit 
limit she was using, her pay day loan history, and how she was managing her other lending. 
Ill consider each of the credit limit increases NewDay decided to apply to Miss As Aqua 
account separately. 
January 2015  credit limit increased to £950 by NewDay
Miss A used her accounts cash advance facility in October 2014 and made a slightly late 
payment in December 2014. But set against this, she stayed well within her credit limit and 
paid significantly more than the minimum monthly payment. And while this increase came 
only four months after Miss As Aqua account opened and tripled her credit limit, the 
increased credit limit of £950 was still a relatively small amount compared to the income 
Miss A had told NewDay about not long previously. Given all this, I think NewDay made a 
reasonable lending decision when it increased Miss As credit limit to £950. June 2015  credit limit increased to £1,200 by NewDay
Miss As spending on the account rose to close to her credit limit and stayed there, with 
Miss A making only the minimum monthly payments or a small amount more than this. 
Nonetheless, Miss A did stay within her credit limit. The screenshots Miss A has provided 
shows she had missed or made late payments to other lender(s) in both January and 
February 2015 and took out a payday loan in June 2015. But I think the timescales for 
updating credit records means that payday loan wouldnt have been visible to NewDay in 
June 2015. And NewDay increased Miss As credit limit by £250, a relatively small amount.
Taking all this into account, I dont think it would be fair for me to say there was enough 
information here for NewDay to reasonably conclude Miss A was struggling with her credit 
limit or that she wasnt able to sustainably repay the Aqua credit card NewDay had already 
provided, without undue difficulty and without further borrowing. Therefore, I think it was 
reasonable for NewDay to increase Miss As credit limit to £1,200.
December 2015  credit limit increased to £1,800 at Miss As request
Miss A hadnt exceeded her NewDay credit limit  shed kept her account balance 
significantly below the credit limit, and generally lower than it was in the period before the 
previous credit limit increase. However, Miss A had continued only to make either the 
minimum or just above minimum monthly payments. NewDay would also at this time have 
been able to see Miss As June 2015 payday loan. I know the information Miss A has 
provided shows she had two more missed or late payments to other lenders in November 
and December 2015, but I think its likely at least the one in December 2015 wouldnt yet 
have been visible to NewDay at this time. 
Regardless, by December 2015 I think NewDay should have seen that since opening her 
Aqua account just over a year earlier, Miss A had taken a payday loan and had three 
missed or late payments to NewDay and other lenders. And that overall, her Aqua account 
balance had increased significantly with only minimum or close to minimum monthly 
payments being made. Taking all these things together, Im intending to say there was 
enough here for NewDay to have reasonably seen Miss A wasnt able to sustainably repay 
her Aqua borrowing within a reasonable time, and without causing undue difficulty and 
having to borrow further to meet other financial commitments. Therefore, Im intending to say 
NewDay should have decided not to offer Miss A another credit limit increase that would 
potentially lead her into further debt. 
May 2016  credit limit increased to £2,700 by NewDay
Miss A kept her account balance within her credit limit. However, she was only repaying a 
small amount over her minimum payment each month, and her account balance had overall 
increased so that by April 2016 it stood at £1,323.81. Miss A had a further three missed or 
late payments to other lenders in January, February and March 2016. She also took a further 
payday loan in February 2016. 
So, by this point, Miss A had taken two payday loans and had several missed or late 
payments for this and other lending since opening her Aqua account. And her account 
balance had increased significantly overall, with Miss A not make any meaningful reduction 
in her account balance at any time and making only the minimum or close to the minimum 
monthly payments. Im intending to say NewDay should have put these things together and 
seen that Miss A was struggling with the lending she already had, and should have decided 
not to offer her another, significantly large, credit limit increase that would potentially lead her 
into further debt. October 2016  credit limit increased to £3,550 by NewDay
Miss A remained within her credit limit and maintained her monthly repayments, on two 
occasions repaying significantly more than the minimum amount due. But Miss A had 
another payday loan in August 2016. And overall her NewDay Aqua balance had increased 
so that it stood at £2,562.23 in September 2016, with no significant or lasting reduction in the 
balance. So, this was a picture of increasing indebtedness involving payday loans and many 
missed or late payments by this point. Given this, Im intending to say it was unreasonable 
for NewDay to have decided to again significant increase Miss As Aqua credit limit in 
October 2016.
March 2017  credit limit increased to £4,750 by NewDay
Miss As Aqua account balance rose quickly and stayed very close to her credit limit. She 
generally paid more than the minimum amount due each month, but nothing that 
meaningfully reduced her balance. Miss A also had two further payday loans in December 
2016, plus others in January and February 2017, with three more in March 2017. Some of 
these later payday loans may not have been visible to NewDay, giving the timings. However, 
the picture here remained one of Miss As increasing indebtedness and difficulty in 
sustainably repaying her Aqua lending, without causing undue difficulty and without having 
to borrow further. Given this, Im intending to say it was unreasonable for NewDay to again 
significantly increase Miss As credit limit in March 2017.
I note NewDay says Miss A herself asked for one of these credit limit increases and didnt 
have to accept the others it offered her. But what matters here is that NewDay shouldnt 
have given Miss A increases which effectively increased her debt to a level she couldnt 
sustainably repay.
To put things right, Im intending to say NewDay should remove any adverse information 
NewDay recorded on Miss As credit record regarding her Aqua credit card account from 
the date of the credit limit increase in December 2015. And that it should refund all interest 
and any charges it applied to Miss As Aqua credit card account from the date of the credit 
limit increase in December 2015. NewDay may offset this against the amount which is now 
with a separate debt collection agency, if it repays the debt. If there remains a positive 
balance after doing so, NewDay should add 8% simple interest to this balance and pay it to 
Miss A.
Miss A accepted my provisional decision and didnt provide any further comments or 
evidence for me to consider. 
NewDay provided further comments. In summary it said:
Miss A had complained too late - her Aqua account opened on 9 September 2014 and 
she ought to have known she had cause for complaint when it defaulted in 2018. But 
Miss A didnt complain until 15 July 2020.
NewDay reiterated the Aqua card was for customers who had difficulty obtaining credit. 
It said it lent responsibly to Miss A, in line with its own affordability and eligibility 
assessments, and based on data provided by Miss A and credit reference agencies. 
And the account terms and conditions said the interest rate and credit limit may increase 
or decrease.  
Miss A managed her Aqua account very well until May 2017, with only one instance of 
a late payment in December 2014. It couldnt see a June 2015 payday loan. 
At the time of the increases, Miss A was managing her Aqua account well with no 
indicators of financial difficulty or affordability and no active payday loans.  Making minimum monthly repayment wasnt necessarily a sign of financial difficulties. NewDay 
couldnt see any external indicators of financial difficulty until October 2017, and Miss A 
had never told it about any such difficulties. 
NewDay is obliged to accurately record how a customer managed their account and 
wouldnt amend adverse credit record information unless it had made an error when 
reporting it. NewDay said the information it had recorded for Miss As Aqua account 
was correct. 
Im now in a position to make my final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, the further comments provided by NewDay dont change the conclusions I 
reached in my provisional decision. Ill explain why.
NewDay says Miss A has complained too late and has referred to the Dispute Resolution: 
Complaints rules set out by the Financial Conduct Authority. These are known as the DISP 
rules, and DISP 2.8 sets out the time limits that apply. DISP 2.8.2 says that, unless the 
business consents, our service cant look at a complaint if it was made:
more than:
(a) six years after the event complained of; or (if later)
(b) three years from the date on which the complainant became aware (or ought reasonably 
to have become aware) that he had cause for complaint.
The lending Miss A complains about happened when her Aqua account opened on 
9 September 2014 and the credit limit was subsequently increased in January 2015, June 
2015, December 2015, May 2016, October 2016 and March 2017. Ive seen Miss A 
complained to NewDay about this on 15 July 2020. As Miss A complained within six years of 
her initial Aqua lending, Im satisfied Miss A had brought this complaint within the six year 
time limit rule. So, there is no need for me to consider the rest of the DISP time limit rule. 
I acknowledge NewDays other comments. However, Miss A has provided our service with 
evidence of the high-cost short-term lending she took out, including in June 2015. And while 
I accept Miss A didnt tell NewDay she was having financial difficulties and that making 
minimum monthly payments isnt in itself necessarily a sign of financial difficulties, my 
provisional decision explained that by December 2015, NewDay should have seen that since 
opening her Aqua account just over a year earlier, Miss A had taken a payday loan and had 
three missed or late payments to NewDay and other lenders. And that overall, her Aqua 
account balance had increased significantly with only minimum or close to minimum monthly 
payments being made. Its still my opinion that taking all these things together, there was 
enough information by December 2015 for NewDay to have reasonably seen Miss A wasnt 
able to sustainably repay her Aqua borrowing within a reasonable time, and without causing 
undue difficulty and having to borrow further to meet other financial commitments.
I also acknowledge NewDays comments about amending adverse credit record information. 
But as I say, Im satisfied NewDay has made an error by providing Miss A with credit limit 
increases on her Aqua account, from December 2015, that it shouldnt have provided her 
with. 
Putting things right
For these reasons, its fair that NewDay should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Miss As credit record regarding her Aqua credit card account from the date of 
the credit limit increase in December 2015. And it should refund all interest and any charges 
it applied to Miss As Aqua credit card account from the date of the credit limit increase in 
December 2015. NewDay may contact the debt collection agency and offset this against the 
debt which is now with it, if it repays the debt. If there remains a positive balance after doing 
so, NewDay should add 8% simple interest to this balance and pay it to Miss A.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, and contained within my provisional decision, I uphold this 
complaint. NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua should:
Remove any adverse information NewDay recorded on Miss As credit record 
regarding her Aqua credit card account from the date of the credit limit increase in 
December 2015. 
Refund all interest and any charges it applied to Miss As Aqua credit card account 
from the date of the credit limit increase in December 2015. NewDay may contact the 
debt collection agency and offset this against the debt which is now with it, if it repays 
the debt. If there remains a positive balance after doing so, NewDay should add 8% 
simple interest to this balance and pay it to Miss A.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 February 2022.
