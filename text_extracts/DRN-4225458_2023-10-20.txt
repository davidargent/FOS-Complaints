The complaint
Mrs C complains about the service she received from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) in relation to some payments which it placed on hold.
What happened
Mrs C holds an account with NatWest. She wanted to transfer £80,000 from that account to 
an account she holds with another business which Ill call S. Her NatWest account has a 
daily payment limit of £20,000. So, she made four separate online transfers of £20,000 each 
on four separate days.
When Mrs C made the first transfer, the payment was put on hold. She says that NatWests 
Fraud Department contacted her and spoke to her husband. NatWest then released the 
payment to S. The next day, Mrs C made the second transfer. This was also placed on hold 
but released to S following a conversation between NatWests Fraud Department and Mrs 
Cs husband. The following day, Mrs C made the third transfer. Again, the funds were 
transferred to S successfully following a conversation with NatWests Fraud Department.
On 6 September, Mrs C attempted the fourth transfer. As before, the payment was placed on 
hold. Mrs C says that her husband had a lengthy conversation with NatWests Fraud 
Department, during which she says the line went dead. At that point, she didnt know 
whether the payment had been released or not. She says she didnt hear any more from 
NatWest. The next morning, she checked her account with S and saw that the payment 
hadnt arrived.
Mrs C called NatWests Fraud Department on 7 September. The agent told her that three 
payments were on hold. One of them was the fourth payment to S. The other two were credit 
card payments to two separate businesses which Ill call J and M. Mrs C says she has no 
idea why these payments were put on hold. She says that NatWest also froze her account, 
which meant she couldnt pay her bills or make any transactions. 
Mrs C says that NatWest sent her a link which should have unfrozen the account and 
allowed the payments to go through. But she says the link didnt work. So, she and her 
husband visited a branch around eight miles from their home. She says this was a great 
strain, given her age and health condition. The branch staff checked her documents and she 
spoke to someone from the Fraud Department and answered their questions. The account 
was then unblocked and she says it was fully operational after around an hour.
But Mrs C is very unhappy with the way NatWest handled the situation on 6 and 7 
September. She says that, when the phone call was cut off, NatWest should have called her 
back. She also questions why the three payments (to S, J and M) were put on hold and why 
her account was frozen. She says that the payment to M never arrived, so she had to pay it 
again to ensure the money arrived on time, as she didnt want to incur interest.
Mrs C raised her concerns with NatWest. It said it had acted in line with the terms and 
conditions of her account. It apologised for the inconvenience caused to Mrs C but said it 
had followed the right process. NatWest said that, if the risk of a potential fraud or scam is 
deemed high, its agents are required to follow a proof of payment process which requires the 
customer to verify themselves and the payment. It suggested that, if Mrs C wanted to make 
a large payment again, she could make a CHAPS payment from the branch which would 
reduce the risk of delays.
But NatWest acknowledged that the service Mrs C received from some of its staff had fallen 
below the high standards it expects. It apologised for the upset this caused and said it would 
provide feedback to the relevant department. It also paid £50 into Mrs Cs account. 
In relation to the payment to M, NatWest said it had raised a dispute form to request the 
return of the funds from M.
Mrs C wasnt happy with NatWests response and brought the complaint to this service. 
Since then, NatWest has credited her account with the amount of the missing payment to M. 
NatWest also offered to pay Mrs C a further £100, to bring the total compensation for the 
complaint to £150. Our Investigator thought that offer was fair. But Mrs C didnt agree and 
asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an Ombudsman. 
She remains very unhappy that the phone call with the Fraud Department on 6 September 
was cut off abruptly with no explanation. She says that NatWest didnt contact her to tell her 
the payment was still blocked or that it had blocked payments to J and M. She says it was 
only when she called NatWest the next day that she found this out and she has never been 
told why these payments were blocked. She also says that freezing her account was a 
draconian and unnecessary measure. She would like an apology and compensation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs C isnt unhappy about the security checks which were completed on the first three 
payments to S. She says that NatWests approach was perfectly reasonable and that she 
has no reason to complain about the way those payments were dealt with. So, she accepts 
that NatWest will sometimes stop payments to carry out security checks.
The issue here stems from the fourth payment to S being placed on hold. This didnt follow 
quite the same pattern as the previous three holds. NatWest says that, although Mrs C had 
already made three payments to S, that didnt prevent the fourth payment being stopped for 
checks as each payment is dealt with separately on a case by case basis. It says it cant 
determine which payments will be picked up by its system for a security check.
NatWest says that, following reviews by its fraud detection system, each transaction 
receives a score. For security reasons, it cant disclose how that score is calculated. But it 
has explained that it looks at multiple factors when assessing the payments. NatWest says 
that the payments Mrs C was making were large payments and unusual for her account. It 
says that the risk of a potential fraud or scam was deemed to be reasonably high here, so its 
agent requested evidence of Mrs Cs account with S. It says this was in line with its process.
Id expect NatWest to have security systems and procedures in place to safeguard 
customers accounts and prevent fraud so far as possible. As to exactly what those 
procedures are and how theyre carried out, thats for NatWest to decide. I think its 
reasonable that this payment to S was referred for further checks. NatWest hadnt asked for 
this information in relation to the previous payments, but I dont think that makes the request 
in relation to the fourth payment unreasonable. For security reasons, NatWest cant provide 
much information about why particular payments are stopped. But its possible that the pattern of payments here was a factor in the extra information being requested for the fourth 
payment. In any event, I think it was a reasonable request and Im satisfied that NatWest 
was acting within the terms and conditions of Mrs Cs account when it placed the payment 
on hold and asked her to provide additional information.
NatWest placed a restriction on Mrs Cs account until she provided the documents it had 
requested. Mrs C is very unhappy about this and I can understand that it was stressful and 
frustrating. But the terms and conditions of her account allow NatWest to suspend or restrict 
the use of her account for various reasons, including where it reasonably believes thats 
appropriate in order to protect her account. As it had referred a payment for additional 
security checks, I think it was reasonable for NatWest also to restrict the account pending 
the satisfactory conclusion of those checks. So, although I can understand that this was 
inconvenient for Mrs C, I dont think it was unreasonable for NatWest to restrict the account.
In relation to the payments to J and M, NatWest says these were put on hold because of the 
block on the fourth payment to S. NatWest had concerns about whether the payment to S 
was genuine. It had placed that payment on hold and restricted Mrs Cs account. In those 
circumstances, I think it was reasonable for NatWest also to place the payments to J and M 
on hold. It had concerns about the security of Mrs Cs account, so I wouldnt expect it to 
have continued allowing further payments out until its checks had been completed.
NatWest says that the payments to J and M would have been released once Mrs C had 
spoken to the Fraud Department, which she did during her visit to the branch on 7 
September. Her statement shows that the payments debited her account on that date.  I 
havent seen anything to suggest payment didnt reach J. So I cant conclude that Mrs C 
suffered any financial loss or significant detriment in relation this payment being held back. 
But she says the payment to M didnt arrive. Im satisfied that it was released by NatWest. I 
havent seen any further information about this payment, so I cant safely draw any 
conclusions about why it didnt reach its destination or who was responsible for that. But 
NatWest has refunded this payment to Mrs C. So, I dont think it needs to do anything more 
in this respect.
Mrs C says that NatWest hadnt told her that the payments to J and M were on hold and has 
never told her why they were stopped. She wanted me to listen to the calls from 6 and 7 
September. NatWest hasnt been able to locate the call of 6 September, but I have listened 
to the call of 7 September. Im satisfied that this was the first time Mrs C found out that the 
payments to J and M had been stopped. So I find that NatWest hadnt called her separately 
to tell her this; she found out when she called about the payment to S. 
Im satisfied that the agent explained on 7 September that the two smaller payments had 
been blocked as a result of the payment to S being referred for checks. She said this was 
NatWests procedure and explained that, when a customer is referred for a proof of payment 
check, their account is restricted and all payments are held until the matter is resolved. So, 
Im satisfied that Mrs C was told why these payments were being held. Its also clear from 
the call that the account was restricted by the agent during this call as a result of her request 
for proof of payment. So Mrs C was told about the restriction when it happened.
Overall, I think it was reasonable for NatWest to put these payments on hold, request proof 
of payment and restrict the account until it received that information. NatWest accepts that 
this was frustrating and inconvenient for Mrs C. Unfortunately, its in the nature of checks like 
this that they do sometimes cause inconvenience to customers. But the checks are in place 
to protect customers. I think NatWest tried to minimise the inconvenience by offering Mrs C 
two different ways of providing the information it wanted: either by using a link to upload the 
documents or by going into the branch. These options were discussed on the call Ive listened to. Mrs C says the link didnt work, so she had no alternative but to visit the branch. 
This was a great strain for her, but she says that she received good customer service in the 
branch and the issue was resolved. So, Im satisfied that the restrictions were lifted without 
delay and the impact of the restrictions was limited.
I think the problem here was communication and customer service. Mrs C says that her real 
issues start with the telephone line going dead on 6 September. I havent heard this call, but 
I dont doubt what she says. She says that the person she was speaking to should have 
called her back or made contact some other way. I think they should have done. Its not clear 
whether the payments to J and M had already been stopped at this point or whether it was 
just the payment to S which was on hold. But, in any event, the situation was unresolved 
when the call came to an end. So, Mrs C didnt know if the payment to S was going to be 
released. She didnt find this out until she called NatWest back the next day. I dont think that 
was reasonable and it caused Mrs C considerable distress. I think NatWest should pay Mrs 
C some compensation to reflect this.
NatWest has already apologised for the poor service Mrs C received and paid her £50 in 
recognition of this. It has since offered to pay a further £100, to bring the total compensation 
for the complaint to £150. I think thats fair in all the circumstances. So, Im going to direct 
NatWest to pay the further £100.
My final decision
For the reasons above, National Westminster Bank Plc should pay a further £100 to Mrs C.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 November 2023.
