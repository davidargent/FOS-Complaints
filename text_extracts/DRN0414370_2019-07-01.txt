K822xcomplaint
Mr F has complained about his secured  loan account, which is administered by Acenden  
Limited. His complaint  is that Acenden has unfairly  applied arrears fees and charges to his 
account, and about Acendens poor customer service.
background 
Mr F has a secured loan account which, since 2 September 2015,  is administered by 
Acenden. The loan was originally taken  out in July 2007. Unfortunately  it fell into arrears  and 
the lender was granted a possession order in 2010.  The order was suspended, but Mr F 
didnt comply with the terms  of the order.
As a result, the lender has continued with court action. In August 2018  the court suspended 
a warrant of eviction.  Mr F is unhappy  about  Acenden continuing with court action. Acenden  
continued to add fees and charges to the account, which Mr F thought was unfair.
Mr F also says that, during a telephone conversation  with Acenden,  its agent laughed at him.
Mr F complained to Acenden, which didnt uphold the complaint. Unhappy with this, Mr F 
brought his complaint to us. 
An adjudicator considered  the complaint. He didnt think  Acenden had acted unfairly  in 
continuing with court action on behalf  of the lender, looking at the position on the account. 
He explained  that Acenden wasnt able to provide a copy of the telephone  call between Mr F 
and its agent.  As a result, it wasnt possible  to conclude  one way or the other  if the agent 
had, as Mr F says, laughed at him. 
The adjudicator also noted that Acenden  had offered to refund fees and charges totalling  
£510. These are made up as follows:
period whether the debt was not being pursued:
22 March 2016 £70.00
8 April 2016 £70.00
8 May 2016 £70.00
8 June 2016 £70.00
30 September 2016 £70.00
8 October 2016 £70.00
months where legal  costs  had been applied:
8 December 2017  £55.00
8 April 2018  £35.00
Mr F disagreed with the adjudicators findings. He said that between 2012 and 2016 
thousands of pounds of charges were added  to his account. He also wants to claim for court  
costs and solicitors fees for 2018, because  Acenden pulled out of court and left Mr F and 
his partner over £5,000  out of pocket  for not continuing with the case.

Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This complaint relates only to Acenden, which took over the account on 2 September  2015.  I 
am also considering  Mr Fs other complaint about the mortgage lender, for the period it was 
covered by this service.  That is the subject of a separate decision.
court action: I appreciate Mr F is unhappy that possession action continued against him. 
Given the position on the account, I dont think this was unreasonable.  But if Mr F is 
unhappy about the possession order, this is something Mr F will need to take up with the 
court. 
customer service: Acenden has been  asked to provide a copy  of the call recording from 
14 November 2017 when Mr F says Acendens agent laughed at him. Acenden  has 
explained that it has not retained this call, so Ive not been able to listen to it. But in the final 
response letter sent in December 2017 Acenden says it reviewed all calls with Mr F for 
November 2017  and found  nothing  inappropriate. Im not able to say either way what  
happened. I appreciate Mr F might have thought Acenden wasnt taking his situation 
seriously. But in the absence  of any evidence to support his contention that he was laughed 
at, Im unable to uphold  this part of the complaint.
fees and charges: Ive reviewed the fees and charges Acenden has agreed  to refund. Im 
satisfied that these are fair and reasonable. Im not persuaded Acenden should be ordered 
to refund any further fees or charges. Mr F says hes been left out of pocket by £5,000 as a 
result of Acenden  pulling  out of court proceedings in 2018. As this is a new issue,  Mr F will 
need to raise this first with Acenden before we can consider it. Alternatively, Mr F can ask 
the court to consider this issue.
my final decision
My decision  is that, in full and final settlement  of this complaint, Acenden  must refund fees 
and charges to Mr Fs account  and remove any interest applied to those charges  totalling 
£510, as set out above. I make no other order or award.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 August 2019.
