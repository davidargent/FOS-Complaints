K820x#14complaint
Miss B complains  about Santander UK Plc (Santander) and its failure to remove  a default
and adverse credit data from her credit report.  She wants arrears data to be removed from
her credit file and compensation for her distress  and inconvenience.
background 
I set out the background  to this complaint, and my provisional findings, in a provisional
decision issued in March  2019. A copy of that decision  is attached  to this.
In that provisional  decision, I explained  why I thought  the complaint should be partially 
upheld, and that the business should  pay more  compensation to Miss B. 
That provisional decision has been  shared with the parties and they have been invited to
comment.
The business has advised that it accepts  the view. Miss B has not responded to the 
provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As no further  arguments or evidence have  been  submitted in response to my provisional
decision, my view remains the same as in that provisional decision.
I therefore adopt my provisional decision and reasoning as my final decision.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out in my provisional  decision,  I partially uphold  Miss Bs complaint and
direct Santander UK Plc to pay to Miss B a further Â£350 compensation. 
.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept
or reject my decision before 7 June  2019.
