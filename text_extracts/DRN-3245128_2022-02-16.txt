The complaint
Mr M complains Fairmead Insurance Limited unfairly declined his Commercial Property 
Insurance claim. 
All references to Fairmead also include its agents
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision
.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The policy says it excludes any loss, damage or liability arising from wear and tear, 
or damage that happens gradually over time.
While I appreciate Mr M has provided comments from the contractor via his letting 
agent, this doesnt explain the cause of damage or why the valve had been damaged 
by a change in the weather. 
The boiler had already been replaced before Fairmead had an opportunity to inspect 
it to find out what caused the failure. And considering the age of the boiler and the 
information available to Fairmead at the time, I dont think they have acted unfairly - 
or their conclusion regarding the valve, and that the boilers failure was due to wear 
and tear, is obviously wrong. So, I dont intend to interfere in its decision to decline 
Mr Ms claim.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ms complaint 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2022.
