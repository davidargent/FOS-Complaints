K821x#15complaint
Mr B has complained about short-term loans granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as Quick  Quid (Quick  Quid  or the lender). Mr B says that the loans were 
unaffordable for him and should not have been agreed.
background
Quick Quid agreed 19 loans for Mr B from April 2008 to July 2017. The amounts  ranged 
between £75 and £600. Mr B asked for additional advances  on some of his loans. Ive 
summarised some of the information that Quick Quid provided about  these  loans in a table 
at the end of this decision.  
Quick Quid initially objected to this Service looking into Mr Bs complaint  about some of his 
loans because it said he had complained  too late about these. One of our adjudicators  
explained why we could look into all of his loans and went  on to do so. They then upheld 
Mr Bs complaint in part and recommended  that Quick Quid refund the interest  and charges 
he paid for loan 3 onwards. 
Quick Quid didnt agree with this recommendation and so the complaint has come  to me, as 
an ombudsman, for review and final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
The Office  of Fair Trading  (OFT) was the regulator when Mr B borrowed his first 14 loans. 
This changed to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in April 2014.The relevant rules and 
guidance were  broadly  similar throughout. These said that Quick Quid needed to take 
reasonable care to check that Mr B could afford  to meet his repayments, taking full account 
of his interests in doing so. 
The regulations werent prescriptive  about what checks Quick Quid  needed to carry out. But 
they set out that such checks needed  to be proportionate, taking account  of the amounts 
involved, the nature of the lending relationship and the degree of risk to the consumer. So, 
the same  checks might  not be proportionate  for all consumers,  or for the same consumer in 
all circumstances.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending  including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. In general, Id 
expect a lender  to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the consumer of 
not being able to repay the credit.  So, for example, Id expect a lender to seek  more 
assurance by carrying  out more  detailed checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer the lending  relationship.
There may come a point  where the lending history and pattern of lending itself demonstrates  
that managing  the lending was unsustainable and where there  was a foreseeable risk that 
the borrower would  have  difficulty meeting any future repayments. The OFTs  guidance 
Ref: DRN76283542stated that payday  loans  were a short-term solution to cash flow problems and were not 
appropriate for supporting sustained borrowing. The FCAs guidance  also made it clear that 
lenders should  not relend  where the cumulative effect is that the repayments are 
unsustainable. 
Applying all of this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, and for the same reasons.
Quick Quid says that for each loan application  it asked  Mr B about  his income and 
expenditure and checked  his credit file. It says, however, that it didnt record his expenditure 
until loan 15 taken in September  2014. Mr Bs recorded income was generally about  £1,000  
until then, when he gave  a figure  of £1,600.  Quick Quid hadnt recorded an income  figure for 
Mr Bs first two loans though, had it asked, I think  he would probably have given a figure  of 
about £1,100 as this is what was recorded for loan 3.
The lender  says that from Mr Bs 16th loan, taken  in May 2015, it would have estimated his 
monthly disposable income figure  based on what it saw in his credit  file. It hasnt provided 
the results of its credit file searches or explained how it incorporated  what  it saw therein. But, 
irrespective of what assessments it carried out in later years,  Quick  Quid  should  have  
stopped lending to Mr B long before then for reasons Ill go on to explain. 
Mr B initially  borrowed £150  in April 2008,  which was to be repaid in two lots. He missed his 
first repayment and was charged a late fee. He then made his second  repayment on time 
and took out another  £150 loan five days later. Altogether, as our adjudicator  found,  I dont  
think it was unreasonable of Quick Quid to have agreed to these two loans, given  Mr Bs 
likely declared income  and the maximum loan repayment amounts of £188.  
Mr Bs second loan was due to be repaid in two lots with payments in July and August. Mr B 
didnt manage  to meet his second  repayment and was charged two late fees eventually 
repaying this loan in November.  
Mr B then asked for a third loan ten days later. This was for the lower amount of £75. 
Bearing in mind the issues hed had meeting his repayments for his previous loans and also 
that hed now been in debt to Quick Quid for about  seven months, I think it should  have been 
clear to Quick Quid that Mr B wasnt managing to make the repayments without difficulty  and 
also wasnt likely to be borrowing to meet an emergency shortfall in his income but rather  
had an ongoing  need. So I dont think it was fair of Quick Quid  to agree to this loan even 
though his repayments were lower because I think it was foreseeable that he would have 
difficulty repaying it.
Mr Bs third loan was due to be repaid  in two lots, with payments due in late November  and 
December. Mr B didnt make any repayments  to this loan, was charged two late fees and 
told that his account was severely delayed and court action might ensue. He eventually 
repaid the loan in February 2009.
Mr B then applied for a fourth loan over three  months later in May, this time for £100. I have 
thought about whether it was reasonable for Quick Quid  to think  that enough time had 
passed for his situation to have improved.  But Mr B hadnt managed  to repay his second or 
third loans on time and had incurred late fees on all his loans before this. And it was now 
over a year since hed first asked Quick Quid for a loan and was still in need of another.  So, 
again I dont think  it was fair for Quick Quid to have agreed to this loan. 
Ref: DRN76283543In the event, Mr B didnt  repay his fourth  loan according to original agreement either and 
asked for a fifth loan within  a week of clearing it. This loan was for £350, over three  times the 
amount of his previous loan and the highest  repayment amount came to almost half his 
declared income1. Again, I do not think  it was fair for Quick  Quid to have agreed this loan for 
Mr B. And by this point, if not before, it should have stopped lending to him.
Quick Quid went on to agree a further  14 further  loans  for Mr B, four with additional 
advances. It seems he only managed to repay one of these, his seventh loan, in accordance  
with the original loan agreement. And it seems loan 12 was taken out and repaid the same 
day, and loan 13 then agreed. Mr B paid late fees on several loans  and had to put 
repayment plans  in place a number  of times in order to clear  his balances.  As shown in the 
loan table, the repayment amounts sometimes came  to over 70% of his declared income. 
And he generally took out loans the next day or within a matter of weeks of managing to 
repay the previous one. 
There were three gaps lasting four months  or less  one Ive mentioned  above,  and two later 
gaps before loans  9 and 16. But in each  case,  given the period of borrowing  that went 
before, I dont it was reasonable  of Quick Quid to lend on the basis  that the relatively short  
pause meant Mr B no longer had an ongoing  need for additional funds and now needed 
money for a new short-term cash flow problem. 
Altogether Mr B was indebted to Quick Quid for over 10 years.  As Ive explained, Quick Quid  
shouldnt have lent to Mr B from November 2008 (loan 3) onwards and I think  he lost out 
financially because of this. He paid over £5,000 to have access  to, on average, a few 
hundred pounds at a time over those years. Furthermore, Mr B acquired a history of payday  
loans on his credit file which probably  had, and potentially, continues  to have, a negative  
impact on his credit rating, limiting his access to other sources  of credit that might have been 
more suitable  for his circumstances.  
what Quick Quid needs to do to put things right
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 3 (agreed  in November 2008) to 
loan 18a (agreed 18 October  2016) inclusive;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove all entries about  loans 3 to 19 from Mr Bs credit file.
I understand there was an outstanding balance on loan 19 when Mr B brought his complaint 
to this Service. This loan was for £500 and up to mid-2018 Mr B had repaid £389 in capital, 
interest and charges according to the Statement of Account provided by Quick  Quid.  I dont 
know if this loan remains outstanding or if Mr B has since  repaid  it or its been written off. 
If there is an amount remaining,  Quick  Quid should  remove any interest and charges that 
make up this balance, and treat the payments Mr B made as payments towards the capital 
amount. And in this case, given the length of time it agreed loans for Mr B and the 
1 I have  considered that this loan and others were due to be repaid over two or more periods, but after 
Mr Bs first two loans, I dont  think it was reasonable for Quick  Quid to lend on the basis that he might 
be able to manage his money across  months, given his repayment history and how quickly  he asked 
for new loans.
Ref: DRN76283544repayment difficulties  hes had, it should write off any remaining capital amount so that Mr B 
is no longer indebted to it. 
If Mr B has made further payments, Quick  Quid should refund any payments above the 
original capital amount  to Mr B, along  with 8% per annum  simple  interest*.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. Quick Quid must give 
Mr B a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above,  Im partly  upholding Mr Bs complaint  about 
CashEuroNet UK LLC Limited (trading  as Quick Quid) and it needs to put things right for him 
as Ive set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 August 2019.
