The complaint
Mr C complains that he was mis-sold an Advantage Gold Account (AGA) in November 2010 
by National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C says he didnt agree to taking out the AGA, and he didnt know what its fees and 
benefits were.
NatWest says he signed an application form for the AGA after it had informed him about the 
fees and benefits. 
Both parties agree the sale happened in a discussion probably in a branch.
NatWest has provided evidence and Mr C agrees that he had previously held both a fee free 
account and an AGA with NatWest before the sale of this second AGA to him in 2010.
I acknowledge Mr Cs point that NatWest accepted the first AGA was mis-sold and has 
refunded his premiums for that. But, having had an AGA and fee free accounts before, I 
think its more likely than not that Mr C knew a lot about the AGA in the 2010 sale including 
that it was optional, cost a monthly fee and had a range of benefits. 
NatWest has provided a copy of an application form for the AGA in 2010 which Mr C has 
signed and dated. The application form refers Mr C to a pack that contains all the information 
about the product, which I think its likely he received and was aware of. 
So, I think its more likely than not that Mr C knew he had a choice whether to take out the 
AGA or not, and he chose to do so based on the information in the pack that NatWest gave 
him.
Both parties agree that NatWest didnt advise Mr C to take out the AGA or recommend it to 
him. So, as our adjudicator explained, NatWest was only required to give Mr C enough 
information to make an informed decision about the AGA, which as I say above, I think it did. 
And from what Mr C has said about his circumstances at the time, I dont think there was 
anything Mr C wasnt told by NatWest that would have put him off.
So, I dont think NatWest did anything wrong in the 2010 sale of the AGA to Mr C.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 August 2021.
