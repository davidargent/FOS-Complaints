The complaint
Ms M complains about a loan provided to her by Madison CF UK Limited trading as
118 118 Money, which she says was unaffordable.
What happened
118 118 Money provided Ms M with a loan in June 2014. This was for £1000 to be repaid 
over 12 months with a monthly instalment of £117.39. 
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in February 2022. Both parties have 
received a copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from 
the decision below. I said;
Did 118 118 Money carry out proportionate checks?
I can see that 118 118 Money asked Ms M about her income and expenditure when she 
applied for the loan in June 2014. It also carried out a credit search.
118 118 Money has provided a screen shot of Ms Ms loan application and the figures it 
recorded down, declared by Ms M. It has recorded her income to be £1000 and her 
expenditure as £30. It has then provided the credit search results that it gathered. There are 
credit commitments within these search results that come to a higher amount than the £30 
expenditure declared by Ms M.
118 118 Money has retrospectively assessed the loans affordability for Ms M based on its 
own affordability calculator. But this is not what it did at the time that it granted the loan and 
although it says it didnt just rely on what Ms M told it, it hasnt been able to provide anything 
that shows what else it did do at that time. 
 
It is clear to me that Ms Ms expenditure at the time was not £30. As well as having living 
costs and essential expenditure she also had an additional loan repayment and credit cards 
to repay as well. I am minded to think, when I look at all this that the checks 118 118 Money 
carried out were not proportionate. I think it would have wanted to carry out further checks to 
assure itself that Ms M would be able to repay the loan in a sustainable way over the 12-
month term especially as she had a low monthly income. I think it ought to at this stage 
looked to have carried out a complete review of Ms Ms finances. 
As I cant see that this 118 118 Money did do this, I dont think that the checks it carried out 
before providing Ms M with her loan were reasonable and proportionate.
Did 118 118 Money make a fair lending decision?
Ive concluded the checks 118 118 Money carried out werent proportionate and that they 
needed to do more. But I dont need to look into what it would have seen if it had carried out 
proportionate checks, because I dont think 118 118 Money made a fair lending decision 
when it lent to Ms M anyway, based on what it had in front of it. 
I say this because when I look through the credit search results that 118 118 Money 
would have had in front of it, I can see that Ms M was already committed to credit 
totalling £165.33 a month. This was in relation to a monthly instalment on a hire 
purchase account and minimum payments on credit cards.
So, with the addition of the repayment from this loan of £117.39, in total Ms M would 
need to repay around £282.72 in credit repayments a month. This represented a 
significant part (more than 28%) of her income. Ms M had declared to it that she was 
receiving a fairly low monthly income and I think on balance, a significant payment to 
credit along with her living expenses would mean that in all likelihood this loan was not 
affordable for her.
I think on balance, 118 118 Money ought to have realised it was unlikely that she 
would be able to sustainably repay her loan over the 12 month term. And, in these 
circumstances, 118 118 Money should reasonably have concluded that it was not fair 
to lend to Ms M.
As Ms M has been indebted with a high amount of interest and charges on the loans that 
she shouldnt have been provided with, Im satisfied that she has lost out as a result of 
what 118 118 Money did wrong.
So, I think 118 118 Money needs to put things right.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response to 
my provisional decision. 118 118 Money responded and said it agreed with the 
provisional decision. Ms M didnt respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both parties have not made any further points. So, as neither party has anything further to 
add, I dont see any reason to depart from my findings within my provisional decision. With 
that being the case, 118 118 Money now needs to put things right. 
Putting things right
In line with this Services approach, Ms M shouldnt repay more than the capital amount she 
borrowed for the loan. With this in mind, 118 118 Money should:
add up the total amount of money Ms M received as a result of being given loan. The 
payments Ms M made should be deducted from this amount. Any payments made 
after the total repaid exceeds the amount Ms M was given should be treated as 
overpayments and refunded to her;
add interest at 8% per year simple on any overpayments from the date they were 
paid by Ms M to the date of settlement;remove any adverse information placed on 
Ms Ms credit file because of the loan.*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Ms M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Ms complaint and direct Madison CF UK Limited to put 
things right as described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 April 2022.
