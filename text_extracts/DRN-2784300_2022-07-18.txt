DRN-2784300
The complaint
Mr W complains that Investacc Pension Administration Limited caused a delay in processing 
an investment request in his self-invested personal pension (SIPP). Which caused a loss in 
potential investment returns.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Investacc processed Mr Ws application for the investment within his SIPP in line with 
its service delivery standard. Which was not unreasonable.
The application was sent by post, which is a reasonable way for correspondence to 
be treated. It contained wet copy signatures. And the application had been sent from 
Mr W to Investacc by post, albeit tracked delivery. There is no evidence that Mr W 
required this application to be processed in an expedited way.
The process and timescales were made clear and followed an investment application 
that Mr W made previously, that was processed in a similar way, without complaint.
Investacc were the pension administrators and didnt provide an investment platform. 
As long as Investacc processed the investment request in a fair and reasonable way, 
and were clear about the expected timescales, then I cant say that it did anything 
wrong. And Im satisfied that was the case here.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 August 2022.
