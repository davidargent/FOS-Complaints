K821x#15complaint
Miss H has complained about two loans she took out through a company called Madison CF 
UK Limited,  trading as 118 118 Money, in 2016  and 2017. Miss H says that it was 
irresponsible for the company to provide her with the loans as she could not afford  to pay 
them back.
background
I issued a provisional decision in this case in January 2021  setting  out why I intended to 
uphold this complaint.  A copy of my provisional decision is attached and forms part of my 
final decision.
I asked both parties to provide me with any further  comments and/or evidence  they would 
like me to consider  before I reached my final decision. Both parties have confirmed they 
have nothing further to add.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has provided me with anything further to consider following my provisional 
decision, there is no reason for me to depart from the findings set out in that decision. It 
follows that I uphold  Miss Hs complaint for the same reasons as those set out in my 
provisional decision  this is attached below.
putting things right
118 118 Money shouldnt have given  Miss H Loans 1 and 2. So 118 118 Money  should:
A)Add together the total of the repayments made by Miss H towards interest,  fees and 
charges on Loans 1 and 2 not including anything 118 118 Money have  already  
refunded.
B)Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Miss H which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss H originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)118 118 Money should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on 
Loans 1 and 2 and treat any repayments made  by Miss H as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on Loans 1 and 2. If this results in Miss H having  made  
overpayments then 118 118 Money should refund these overpayments  with 8% 
simple interest* calculated  on the overpayments,  from the date the overpayments 
would have arisen, to the date the complaint  is settled. 118 118 Money should then 
refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D)If there  is still an outstanding balance then the amounts  calculated  in A and B    
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should  be paid to Miss H. However if there is still an 
outstanding balance then 118 118 Money should try to agree an affordable 
Ref: DRN49786642repayment plan with Miss H. 118 118 Money shouldnt pursue outstanding balances  
made up of principal they have already written-off.
E)Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Hs credit  file in
            relation to Loans 1 and 2.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money  to deduct tax from this interest.  118 118 
Money should give Miss H a certificate  showing how much tax 118 118 Money have 
deducted, if they ask for one.
my final decision
I uphold Miss Hs complaint against  Madison CF UK Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 March 2021.

complaint
Miss H has complained about two loans  she took out through a company called Madison CF UK 
Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, in 2016 and 2017. Miss H says that it was irresponsible for the 
company to provide  her with the loans as she could not afford to pay them  back.
background
Miss H took out the first of the loans  (Loan 1) she is complaining about, online  in July 2016 for a 
period of 24 months. The loan was for £1000. The annual percentage rate (APR)  was 99.9%. The 
total interest to be charged on the loan was £934.88.  The total amount to repay was therefore 
£1934.88. The monthly repayment was £80.62.
The following year (March 2017) Miss H took out a further loan (Loan 2) with 118 118 Money online.  
This was for £2000 plus the outstanding balance  of £877.20 from the July 2016 loan. This was over a 
period of 24 months. The APR was 99.9%  and the total interest charged was £2412.88. The total 
amount repayable was £5290.08. The monthly repayment was £220.42. 
From January 2018 it appears  Miss H had difficulties keeping up with repayments on the loan. She 
complained that 118 118 Money shouldnt  have lent her these loans as they were unaffordable.
Our adjudicator didnt recommend that the complaint  regarding the first loan should be upheld.  But 
they did think  that 118 118 Money  shouldnt have provided Miss H with the second loan as the checks 
that it carried  out should  have alerted them  to concerns  regarding Miss Hs ability to repay the loan in 
a sustainable manner. So they concluded that 118 118 Money shouldnt have lent Miss H Loan 2.
118 118 Money  didnt agree  with our adjudicator and said that both loans were lent to Miss H 
responsibly.  So the complaint has come to me to decide. 
my provisional  findings  
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. 
In considering what is fair and reasonable I have taken into account  relevant  law and regulations; 
regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice;  and what I consider to have been good 
industry practice at the time. 
Taking this into account, I think  the overarching  questions I need to consider in deciding whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstance  of this complaint are:
Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that Miss H 
would be able to repay her loan in a sustainable way?
oIf so, did it make  a fair lending  decision?
oIf not, would those  checks have shown that Miss H wouldve been able to do so?
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably  in some  other way?
If I determine  that 118 118 Money  did not act fairly and reasonably in its dealings with Miss H and that 
she has lost out as a result, I will go on to consider what is fair compensation.
Ref: DRN49786644Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy themselves   that Miss H 
would be able to repay her loan in a sustainable way?
The regulations in place  when  118 118 Money lent to Miss H required  them  to carry out a reasonable 
assessment of whether  Miss H could  afford to repay her loans  in a sustainable manner. This is 
sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or an affordability  check.
The affordability check  should  have been borrower-focused  so 118 118 Money  had to think about 
whether repaying the loan sustainably would cause financial difficulties or adverse consequences for 
Miss H. In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 Money to only think about the likelihood that they 
would get their money back without considering  the impact of the loan repayments on Miss H herself.
The checks 118 118 Money carried  out also had to be proportionate  to the specific circumstances of 
the loan application.  In general, what constitutes a proportionate  affordability check will depend  on a 
number of factors including,  but not limited to, the particular circumstances of the borrower (e.g. their 
financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of vulnerability or financial 
difficulty) and the amount, type and cost of credit they are seeking. Even for the same customer, a 
proportionate check will more likely than not look different for different loan applications.
In light of that, I think reasonable and proportionate checks should generally be more  thorough:
-the lower a customers income (as it could be harder  to make any loan repayments from a
             lower income);
- the higher  the amount  to be repaid  (as it could be harder to meet  a higher repayment from a 
given income);
- the longer  the term of the loan (as the total cost of the loan is likely  to be greater and the
              customer is required to make payments  for an extended period).
-There may also be other factors which  could  affect how detailed a proportionate check  should  
be when it comes  to a loan application   including,  but not limited to, any indications of 
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in the consumers  future circumstances. 
Ive thought about all the relevant factors in this case.
Ive carefully considered what reasonable  and proportionate checks  should  have looked like
when 118 118 Money was in the process of approving  the loans  for Miss H. And Ive thought 
carefully about what checks  118 118 Money say it carried out and whether those  were 
proportionate in the circumstances. 
The loans were to be paid over two years. Due to the high interest charged,  the overall amount  
Miss H would have to pay back was almost twice what she had borrowed in respect of Loan 1 
and over twice  what she had borrowed for Loan 2. In these  circumstances, I would  have 
expected 118 118 Money to carry out detailed checks when assessing whether or not to give 
Miss H these loans.
In respect of both of the loans I note 118 118 Money asked Miss H for details  of her income and 
expenditure and they also considered her credit file. Following this they carried out a welcome 
call. Ive heard a recording of the call relating to Loan 1 - during which they checked with Miss 
H whether there was likely to be any change in her circumstances and whether or not she 
would be able to repay the loan. They  also confirmed, amongst other things,  the loan amount, 
interest payable and monthly repayments. Miss H confirmed that there was no change  in her 
circumstances and that she could afford the repayments. 
As far as 118 118 Money are concerned  they say the loans were affordable  based on 
everything they had.
Ref: DRN49786645Ive looked at the information 118 118 Money  collected  and have carefully  thought about  what  
118 118 Money  have said. But it isnt enough  just to carry out checks. A lender also needs to 
react to the information it receives. And, in this case I dont think 118 118 Money reacted as 
they should  have done. I will go on to consider each of the loans separately and explain why.
Loan 1
Miss H provided 118 118 Money  with information about her income and expenditure. It would, 
or at least should, have  been clear to 118 118 Money that the amount  Miss H had given as her 
expenditure on monthly loan repayments  was incorrect. She stated this was £150 but according 
to her credit  file her monthly repayments towards loans were more  than twice  this amount. 
The difference  in payments would still in theory have left Miss H with around £800 a month surplus  
on the face of it, still making this first loan affordable. But other things about  her credit search should  
have caused 118 118 Money  to question whether  she did have the surplus amount and whether the 
loan would have been affordable  for her.
From Miss Hs credit search I can see:
£11,500 existing  debt  this was fairly  high in comparison  to her income and was split almost 
equally between  loans and revolving credit. She was already over the limit on the revolving 
credit.
She was in overdraft  on one of her current accounts,  regularly having  to use it, including 
having used £1000 the previous month. 
Loan  opened in November 2014  she missed a payment on that loan in March 2016. She 
made it up the following month. But that corresponds  with a fairly large increase to her 
overdraft in May 2016 and she also reduced the payments she was making to both her credit 
cards in April 2016. These appear to me to be signs that she couldnt afford  to service all her 
existing debts  so was sacrificing payments to some to pay others. 
Credit Card opened  in August 2013  Miss H was over the limit on this (£1,793 against a limit 
of £1,750). I appreciate that on its own this is not much  but shed also had a few late 
payments in the fairly recent past. Shed  been very close to the credit limit for the last four 
months and had gone  over the limit on two previous  occasions (April and June 2016).  Shed 
also significantly reduced her payments in April (as mentioned above possibly because  she 
had to make up the loan payment shed missed). She also took £300 in cash advances on 
this card in March  and April 2016.
Mail order account   I can see sporadic late payments on this and the credit limit had reduced 
between February and March 2016 from £475 to £425   this is likely  to have been the lender 
reacting to the late payments. Although it appears the account  was in credit by £74 when the 
search was done    looking back  at the previous few months it was close to £400. So again 
whilst this might  not be concerning on its own on a credit search I think this is another  sign of 
a disorderly account/financial  situation.
Loan  beginning  July 2015  this is concerning. The current balance at the time of the search  
(£1,223) was higher  than the starting balance (£1,150). And the balance  had increased 
significantly in the previous five months (from £532). Although  the status  showed  as OK with 
no missed payments  there was clearly  something  which required further exploring. The 
increased balance again coincides with April 2016  when Miss H missed a payment to the 
other loan and her other debts were not being  serviced or were increasing.
Credit card beginning December  2013  this had been paid and up to date for the previous 
four months. But had been  2 to 3 months late in the recent past.  At the time of the search, 
Miss H was over the limit (£3,715  against a £3,600 credit limit). And had been over the limit 
Ref: DRN49786646for each of the previous eight months (as much  as by £366). The balance on this one wasnt 
reducing meaningfully and shed also reduced the payments she was making to it  
sometimes paying nothing. When she did pay it was only £85 which  wasnt going  to be 
sufficient to reduce the balance.
So I dont think this paints  a picture of someone who is likely to have £800 or more a month surplus. It 
paints a picture of someone at the start of what might be a debt spiral. Her reason to take the loan 
was expenses so she wasnt even  going  to be using  the money to consolidate and reduce  any of her 
existing liabilities. She was only going to increase them  yet her credit search clearly to me indicates  
that she couldnt  afford what she already had.
Loan 2
118 118 Money  say they carried out due diligence  in ensuring that their underwriters performed a 
manual affordability  check against  Miss Hs income  and credit file to make sure the new loan was 
responsible to lend to Miss H. They  say their checks  at the time validated that Miss H had enough  
disposable income  left after taking out the loan to increase her monthly  repayments and could still 
make additional or extra payments on any accounts  she may have been over limit with.
While again it may be correct that on the face of it Miss Hs disposable income  sufficiently exceeded 
her expenditure,  I think it should  have been clear  to 118 118 Money by looking at how Miss Hs 
accounts were being run according to the credit search, that Miss H was having  difficulties meeting 
existing repayments.  
According the credit search, Miss Hs mail order  account  was reported  as being  two months late, she 
had several  recent  months  of arrears on her credit  card account  (opened on 19 August 2013) and she 
was almost £500 over her credit card limit in relation  to the credit card opened on 18 December  2013 
 this was much higher  than when she had had been provided with Loan 1. She was consistently in 
arrears on this account and had recently entered into a payment arrangement  in relation to this card. 
So Miss H appeared  to have been in an even worse  position  to that when  she had taken out her first 
loan. 
118 118 Money  say its not fair to say Miss Hs financial situation had completely worsened between  
loan 1 and 2 and they provide their reasons for this, such as that Miss Hs hadnt  taken out additional  
credit between Loan 1 and Loan 2 and they differentiate  between the different accounts  that she held, 
in particular saying that Miss Hs repayment issues related to revolving  credit rather than her loans, 
current accounts or telecomms accounts.  And they refer to some improvements in Miss Hs accounts.  
For example, they say that Miss Hs credit card starting on 19 August 2013 was up to date with 
payments after a previous spell in arrears, the month before Loan 2 was approved the balance was at 
its lowest amount  for 6 months with over £100  being reduced  off the balance the month before. There  
had been consistent payments into the account  for 3 consecutive months showing  Miss H had been 
making a conscious effort to improve how the account is paid. The mail order account in question  was 
reported as being 2 payments down however  the account was always comfortably within  balance.  In 
February 2017 both the balance  and the limit have been reduced in comparison  to January, so with 
two positive actions on the accounts they say its possible this has not been reported correctly on 
Miss Hs credit file and there was no real reason  for concern. They accept Miss Hs final credit card 
was considerably over limit but the balance did not increase from December  2016 to January  2017. 
They say that as Miss H had recently entered an arrangement for this account  its evident she was 
actually seeking  to improve her finances. 
However, despite  these improvements that 118 118 Money cite, I think  it was clear from the credit 
search that Miss H was have  difficulties  keeping up with her existing repayment commitments. 
Although shed almost  paid off the July 2015 loan and was making  regular payments to the November  
2014 one, it looks like she was doing this at the expense of other debts. It is right that shed also 
brought her August 2013 credit card up to date, but this was only just the previous month after being 2 
Ref: DRN49786647to 3 months late several times. And this coincides  with the increase to her overdraft use  indicating 
she was just paying credit  with more credit. The card was still overlimit (£1,790  against a limit of 
£1,750) and had been  for each  of the previous  eight  months  by up to £205. The balance  wasnt 
coming down significantly (despite 118 118 Money pointing toward the £100 reduction the previous 
month the overall pattern is quite static). And Miss H was only making  £78 payments  meaning it 
would take a long to pay this off. 
With regard to the Mail order account  118 118 Money point  to the reduction in credit limit and being 
within it as good things. But again looking at the bigger picture,  Miss H went from £74 in credit to £384 
balance and it hadnt come  down much since  with sporadic late payments still. Again the credit limit 
reduction may well have been due to the lender reacting to the late payments. The December  2013 
credit card payments were still late most of the time over the previous six months (including up to 3 
payments late). It had been  brought up to date immediately before  the loan   but was overlimit  
(£4,091 against a limit of £3,600) and had been for the last eight months. Miss H often didnt pay 
anything or only paid £85. She also seems to have taken a short  term loan on 16 March 2017 for 
£1,000. Her debts had gone up and her balance  to limit was up to 109%  from 102%. She was around 
£900 into her overdraft and regularly  making use of it. 
In these circumstances and bearing  in mind that the repayments on this loan were almost  three times  
the repayments on Loan 1, I dont think it was fair for 118 118 Money  to have provided Miss H with 
Loan 2 as it should have  been clear to them that she would not have been able to afford the 
repayments in a sustainable  manner.
From the way Miss H had been managing her accounts 118 118 Money should  have known  that it 
was unlikely that she would  be able to sustain the repayments  for any significant  period of time. And 
in fact she wasnt able to sustain her repayments, and ran into difficulties meeting her repayments 
less than a year after taking the second loan out.
So having carefully considered everything Ive seen on this case, I think  118 118 Money failed to 
proportionally react to the information it was provided  with. This led to it unfairly  and unreasonably 
providing Miss H with loans she couldnt  have  sustainably repaid. 
As Miss H ended up paying interest and charges on a loan she couldnt reasonably have been 
expected to sustainably repay, I think that she lost out because of what  118 118 Money  did wrong.  
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Miss H hasnt said 118 118 Money acted  unfairly or unreasonably towards  her in some other way. 
And I havent seen anything else which  would  lead me to conclude that this was the case.
But as Ive found 118 118 Money acted irresponsibly  in give Miss H these loans, 118 118 Money 
should put things right as set out below.
putting things  right
Where a business has done  something wrong, our service usually aims to put the
consumer back in the position they wouldve been in had the incident  not occurred.
However, in cases where a business has lent irresponsibly, this isnt entirely  possible  as
the lending provided cannot be undone.
In this case, I think its fair that Miss H should only have to repay  the money she
borrowed and had the use of. So I think 118 118 Money should refund all of the interest and charges  
Miss H has paid on Loans  1 and 2.
While I think  its fair that Miss Hs credit  file is an accurate reflection  of her financial
history, I dont think its fair that she should be disadvantaged by 118 118 Moneys decision to lend to 
her irresponsibly. Therefore,  under the circumstances, I think  118 118 Money  should  also remove any 
negative information recorded on Miss Hs credit file in relation to Loans 1 and 2.
Ref: DRN497866481188 Money shouldnt have given Miss H Loans  1 and 2. So 118 118 Money should:
A)Add together the total of the repayments made by Miss H towards interest, fees and charges  
on Loans  1 and 2 not including anything 118 118 Money have  already refunded.
B)Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Miss H which were  
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss H originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled.
C)118 118 Money  should  remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on Loans 1 
and 2 and treat any repayments made by Miss H as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on Loans 1 and 2. If this results in Miss H having made  overpayments  then 118 118 
Money should refund  these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would  have arisen, to the date the complaint 
is settled. 118 118 Money should  then refund  the amounts  calculated in A and B and move 
to step E.
D)If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should  be 
used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus  then the 
surplus should be paid to Miss H. However, if there is still an outstanding balance then 118 
118 Money should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss H. 118 118 Money  
shouldnt pursue  outstanding balances made up of principal they have already written-off.
E)Remove any adverse information recorded on Miss Hs credit  file in
            relation to Loans 1 and 2.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  118 118 Money to deduct tax from this interest.  118 118 Money 
should give Miss H a certificate showing how much tax 118 118 Money have deducted,  if they ask for 
one.
My provisional decision
For the reasons  given,  I intend to uphold Miss Hs complaint against Madison CF UK Limited, trading  
as 118 118 Money.
