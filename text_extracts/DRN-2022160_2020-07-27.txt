The complaint
Mrs T complains that National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) blocked and closed her 
account, without giving any notice. And failed to release the funds held in her account.
What happened
On 11 July 2019, NatWest blocked Mrs Ts account and gave her notice that it would be 
closed in 14 days. At the time, Mrs T had an account balance of around £3,500.
Mrs T complained to NatWest, saying she was unable to pay her sons school fees because 
NatWest had withheld her funds. She also asked NatWest to confirm if it had registered a 
CIFAS marker against her name. NatWest issued its final response to Mrs Ts complaint on 
3 August 2019. 
It apologised for poor customer service Mr Ts had experienced in branch, but said it said it 
had acted in accordance with the terms and conditions of Mrs Ts account, when it blocked 
and closed the same. And it confirmed it hadnt registered Mrs Ts details with any credit 
reference agencies. But it didnt release the account balance to Mrs T until 26 September 
2019.
Mrs T remained unhappy so she brought her complaint to our service. Our investigator 
thought NatWest was entitled to block and close Mrs Ts account. But she said NatWest 
hadnt explained the delay in releasing funds to Mrs T, so she asked NatWest to pay Mrs T 
£200 in compensation.
NatWest accepted our investigators findings. But Mrs T didnt agree, so she asked for an 
ombudsman to review the matter afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Account closure
Just as a customer may close an account with a bank, a bank is entitled to close an account 
with a customer. But when it closes the account, it must do so in a way which complies with 
the terms and conditions of the account.
A bank doesnt always have to give reasons for its decision to close an account. Having 
considered the information NatWest has provided, Im satisfied it acted in accordance with 
the terms and conditions of Mrs Ts account when it closed Mrs Ts account.
I understand Mrs Ts frustration at the situation, and I know shell be disappointed with the 
outcome. But, having looked at all of the available evidence, I cant say that NatWest did 
anything wrong. So, Im not upholding this part of Mrs Ts complaint.Access to funds
Before a bank releases funds held in a customers account, its entitled to carry out checks to 
ensure its complying with its legal and regulatory obligations. And banks will follow their 
internal procedures before they release funds.
With that said, NatWest hasnt provided an explanation as to why it held onto Mrs Ts money 
until the end of September 2019. And its accepted our investigators findings that it could 
have released the money earlier. 
With that in mind, Ive considered what NatWest should do to put things right for Mrs T. 
Mrs T told our investigator she couldnt pay her sons school fees, and that she received 
arrears letters and bailiffs letters as a result. 
Ive thought about what Mrs T has said, and Ive looked at the evidence shes provided. 
From the emails Mrs T sent our investigator, I can see that Mrs Ts direct debits for school 
fees failed in April and May 2019, and that she hadnt paid school fees since 17 May 2019. 
Because Mrs Ts school fees were due long before NatWest closed her account, and 
because she hadnt made payment of the fees from her account prior to its closure, Im not 
persuaded NatWests delay caused her to delay paying the school fees.
Mrs T has provided a bailiffs letter dated 2 September 2019, relating to a debt with 
Greenwich Council. The Greenwich Council debt was much smaller than the school fees due 
and could have been settled in full using the funds in Mrs Ts NatWest account. It was not 
NatWests fault that this debt accrued in the first place, but Mrs T would have been able to 
avoid the bailiff action, had she had access to her funds earlier.
Putting things right
I recognise the bailiffs letter would have caused Mrs T some distress and inconvenience. 
So, to compensate Mrs T for the distress and inconvenience she experienced as a result of 
NatWests delayed release of her funds, NatWest must pay her £200 in compensation.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank PLC must pay Mrs T £200, for the 
reasons Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2020.
