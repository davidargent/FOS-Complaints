The complaint
Miss M complains that the loans she had from MYJAR Limited were unaffordable.
What happened
Miss M had four loans from Myjar between December 2017 and August 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly 
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 9 Dec 2017 £650 6m £186.31 1 Jun 2018 29 Jan 2018
2 29 Jan 2018 £2,100 12m £318.91 31 Jan 2019 2 Aug 2018
3 3 Aug 2018 £825 6m £245.67 31 Jan 2019 27 Aug 2018
4 29 Aug 2018 £1,000 6m £303.77 28 Feb 2019 6 Sep 2018
Miss M says she had to borrow again to repay each loan because of the amount of interest 
she was charged. She says she became trapped in the cycle of lending and couldnt afford 
to pay priority bills. She adds that she had to borrow money from friends and the stress of 
the situation affected her mental wellbeing. Miss M says Myjar partially upheld her complaint 
but only offered to refund a fraction of the interest shed paid.
Myjar says it asked Miss M for information about her income and outgoings and checked her 
credit file and other data sources. It says it was satisfied it made appropriate checks, but 
acknowledged Miss Ms borrowing pattern may have indicated that the approval of loan 4 
may not have been appropriate. It offered to refund interest and charges on loan 4 and 
remove any associated negative information from Miss Ms credit file.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He acknowledged that 
Myjar had already upheld Miss Ms complaint about loan 4, but found nothing in the available 
information that should have indicated to Myjar that loans 1 to 3 were unaffordable.
Miss M responded to say, in summary, that all the loans were unaffordable. She says that, 
although she repaid the loans, she couldnt afford to pay her bills so had to borrow again. 
Miss M provided bank statements to show her financial circumstances at the time.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Myjar was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks to make sure Miss M 
could afford to repay the loans before it lent to her. Those checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Miss M was borrowing, and her lending history. 
But there was no set list of checks Myjar had to do.
Loan 1
Im satisfied Myjar carried out proportionate checks for loan 1. I say that because this was 
the first loan Miss M had applied for and the repayments were a small proportion of her 
declared income. I cant see there was anything in the available information that should have 
indicated to Myjar that the loans were unaffordable.
Loan 2
When Miss M applied for a significantly larger loan on the same day that shed repaid loan 1, 
I consider Myjar should have carried out a full financial review, including the verification of 
the figures Miss M had provided. I say that because, the monthly repayment on loan 2 was 
almost £320 per month and Miss M needed to be able to sustain this level of repayment for 
12 months. In addition, Miss Ms credit file shows she had five defaults on her account, 
including one from December 2017 (although I accept the latest one may not have appeared 
to Myjar when it carried out its checks for loan 2 in January 2018).
Although I can see Miss M had another short-term loan at the time, as well as three credit 
cards, I cant see there was anything in the available information to show the repayments on 
loan 2 were unaffordable. So I cant conclude Myjar was wrong to have approved it.
Loan 3
By the time Miss M applied for loan 3, she had a further default on her credit file, from June 
2018. So, again, I consider a full financial review would have been proportionate. This would 
have shown Miss Ms income was £200 less than the figure shed declared, but again there 
isnt enough evidence to indicate the monthly repayment of £245 was unaffordable or that 
Miss M was struggling to manage her money. So I cannot uphold Miss Ms complaint about 
the affordability of loan 3.
Loan 4
As Myjar has already agreed to uphold Miss Ms complaint about loan 4, I wont consider it 
further here.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 31 August 2020.
