The complaint
Mr C is unhappy that NewDay Ltd authorised him for a credit account with an initial credit
limit of £600, and also that his credit limit was later increased to £1,200.    
What happened
Mr C applied for a credit account with NewDay in March 2017. Mr Cs application was
accepted, and he was issued a credit account with an initial credit limit of £600. In November
2017, NewDay increased the credit limit on Mr Cs account to £1,200.
In 2021, Mr C raised a complaint with NewDay on the basis that he felt that both the initial
credit limit and the later credit limit increase hadnt been affordable for him at those times.
NewDay looked at Mr Cs complaint, but they felt that they had conducted reasonable and
proportionate checks into Mr Cs financial position at the time of both the account application
and the later credit limit increase, and that there had been nothing resulting from these
checks that had given them cause to consider that the credit being offered to Mr C wouldnt
be affordable for him at those times. So, they didnt uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Mr C wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that it had been reasonable for
NewDay to have concluded at the point of application that the £600 credit limit would have
been affordable for Mr C at that time. So, they didnt uphold this aspect of Mr Cs complaint.
However, our investigator noted that Mr Cs credit file demonstrated that Mr Cs financial
position had deteriorated between March 2017  the time of the account application  to
November 2017  when NewDay had increased the credit limit on the account. Because of
this, our investigator felt that NewDay should have recognised that the credit limit increase
shouldnt have been offered to Mr C at that time, and they recommended that the complaint
be upheld in Mr Cs favour on this basis accordingly.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 9 August 2021 as follows:
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how 
much and on what terms. What this service would expect would be that the business 
would undertake reasonable and proportionate borrow focussed checks to ensure 
that any credit being offered to that customer  including any increases to existing 
credit limits  is affordable for that customer at that time.
NewDay say that they did that here. At the time of the initial account application in 
March 2017, NewDay took details from Mr C of his monthly income and expenditure 
to confirm that Mr C would be able to make the potential monthly repayments 
required by the account. Additionally, NewDay also obtained information about Mr 
Cs credit file from a credit reference agency in order to better understand Mr Cs 
wider financial position.
Furthermore, before offering to increase Mr Cs credit limit in November 2017,  
NewDay reviewed how Mr C had managed his NewDay credit account up to that 
time, and they also obtained updated information about Mr Cs credit file from a credit 
reference agency. And NewDay contend that there was nothing resulting from these 
checks that ought reasonably to have made them consider that the credit being 
offered to Mr C wouldnt be affordable for him at those times.
I can appreciate NewDays position here  to a degree - and having reviewed all the
information available to me regarding Mr Cs financial position at the time of the initial
account application in March 2017, it seems both fair and reasonable to me that 
NewDay would have concluded that Mr C should have been able to afford the credit 
limit of £600 being offered to him at that time. And I say this because the monthly 
income and expenditure information supplied by Mr C appeared to be able to support 
such a credit limit, and because Mr Cs credit file also didnt provide any reasonable 
indicators that such a credit limit would be unaffordable for him.
However, its also apparent from the information available to me that Mr Cs financial 
position did deteriorate shortly after being approved for the credit account, and while 
NewDay have stated that they took account of Mr Cs financial position before 
increasing the credit limit on his account, Im not convinced that NewDay developed 
an accurate understanding of Mr Cs financial position or that they fairly accounted 
for the deterioration of Mr Cs financial position at that time.
NewDay have explained to this service that the checks that they undertook into Mr 
Cs financial position prior to increasing the credit limit on his account showed that 
there were six payday loans being reported on his credit file at that time, but that 
none of these loans were active  meaning that all Mr Cs payday loans had been 
repaid, and had been repaid without incident.
However, having reviewed Mr Cs credit file, its evident that in the period between 
March 2017 and October 2017, Mr C took no less than ten payday loans, and that 
three of these payday loans were still being actively repaid by Mr C in November 
2017, when NewDay increased the credit limit on his account. Furthermore, its also 
evident that Mr C had also taken a personal loan and opened another credit card 
account during this period. And Mr Cs total level of external debt had risen from 
£3,400 in March 2017, to approximately £10,700 by the time of the credit limit 
increase.
Its difficult then not to conclude that the picture that NewDay should have obtained 
from their checks into Mr Cs wider financial position was one of significant increase 
in both short-term borrowing and total external debt, and while NewDay do correctly 
point out that Mr C hadnt missed any payments on any of the new borrowing that he 
had taken, its equally difficult not to conclude that NewDay ought reasonably to have 
considered that the significant change to Mr Cs financial position should have 
merited more robust checks than the ones that they undertook as standard.
And, had NewDay undertaken such further checks, which in all likelihood should 
have included contacting Mr C directly to discuss his wider financial position and his increased use of payday loans and total external borrowing, I feel that it would have 
been probable that NewDay should have reasonably concluded that Mr C couldnt 
afford the credit limit increase under consideration at that time  such that the 
provision of that credit limit increase would have served only to further worsen Mr Cs 
already deteriorating financial position.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that NewDay were wanting here, but it follows 
from the above that Ill be upholding this complaint in Mr Cs favour on the basis that I 
dont feel that the credit limit increase implemented by NewDay in November 2017 
was fair and reasonable. And my provisional decision will be that I uphold this 
complaint in Mr Cs favour accordingly.
My provisional instructions to NewDay will be as follows:
NewDay must reimburse to Mr Cs account all interest, fees, and charges, 
incurred or accrued on the account relating to any balance above £600 from 
November 2017 onwards.
If these reimbursements result in the account having a credit balance in Mr Cs
favour, NewDay must pay this credit balance to Mr C along with 8% simple 
interest.
NewDay must also remove all adverse reporting from Mr Cs credit file from
November 2017 onwards.
Finally, NewDay must make a payment of £100 to Mr C to compensate him for 
any inconvenience he may have incurred.
The instructions above differ from those recommended by our investigator in that our
investigator didnt feel that NewDay should be instructed to amend Mr Cs credit file, 
given that Mr C didnt make any payments towards the account after February 2018.
However, I feel that it cant be guaranteed that Mr C wouldnt have taken a different
approach to this account, had it been the case that his total balance was maintained 
in-line with his initial credit limit of £600, as I feel it should have been. A such, I do 
feel that NewDay should remove the adverse information from Mr Cs credit file from 
the point of the credit limit increase onwards, and my provisional decision include this 
instruction accordingly.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr C and NewDay the opportunity to provide 
any comments or further information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a 
final decision.
NewDay confirmed that they didnt agree with my provisional decision and stated that, while 
they could appreciate that Id had the benefit of having reviewed Mr Cs credit file, at the time 
that NewDay offered the credit limit increase to Mr C they hadnt seen Mr Cs credit file and 
depended on the information that they were given from the credit reference agency  which 
NewDay continue to maintain didnt include any information which should have given them 
cause to consider that the credit limit increase being offered to Mr C might not be affordable 
for him.
I can confirm that I did review Mr Cs credit file, but it must be noted that I did so on the basis 
of the information which NewDay have confirmed during their reiteration of their position to 
this service that they had gathered on Mr Cs financial position at the time that offered the credit limit increase to him  specifically, that Mr Cs total external borrowing had increased 
from £3,400 to £10,700 and that Mr C had a significant number of Payday loans.
And, while NewDay have stated correctly that the use of Payday loans doesnt necessarily 
means that a customer is experiencing financial difficulty, such that a credit limit increase 
might not be appropriate, it is the case that the use of Payday loans can be an indicator of 
financial difficulty, especially if other potential indicators of financial difficulty are present  
such as an over threefold increase in an individuals total external debt, as was the case 
here. 
NewDay have a responsibility to ensure that in providing a higher level of available credit to 
a customer, theyre not contributing to that customer falling deeper into a potentially 
unsustainable level of debt. I dont feel that NewDay met that responsibility here, and it 
remains my position that the information that was available to NewDay at the time of the 
credit limit increase  including a significant increase in Mr Cs total level of external debt 
along with the use of a number of Payday loans  should have given NewDay cause to 
consider that Mr C might have been experiencing financial difficulties at that time, such that 
further checks beyond the standard checks that NewDay employed, were necessary.
Furthermore, Im satisfied that had NewDay undertaken these further checks, that it would 
most likely have been the case that NewDay should have concluded that it wasnt 
appropriate to offer a credit limit increase to Mr C at that time, because doing so posed an 
unreasonable risk of contributing to Mr C falling into an unsustainable level of debt.
Because of this, I continue to conclude that the provision of a higher level of credit to Mr C 
by NewDay in November 2017 does constitute an incidence of irresponsible lending, and my 
final decision will therefore be that I uphold this complaint on the basis that I have previously 
explained in my provisional decision above.  
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse to Mr Cs account all interest, fees, and charges, incurred or 
accrued on the account relating to any balance above £600 from November 2017 onwards.
If these reimbursements result in the account having a credit balance in Mr Cs favour, 
NewDay must pay this credit balance to Mr C along with 8% simple interest calculated from 
the date of the reimbursed transaction to the date that NewDay make the payment to Mr C.
NewDay must also remove all adverse reporting from Mr Cs credit file from November 2017 
onwards.
Finally, NewDay must make a payment of £100 to Mr C to compensate him for any 
inconvenience he may have incurred.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 October 2021.
