The complaint
Mr M complains PrePay Technologies Limited (PrePay) blocked his prepaid currency card 
without any notification causing him inconvenience while overseas. 
What happened
Mr M says while he was overseas in 2021, he attempted to use his prepaid currency account 
(PCA) which he had held since 2016 with PrePay, but the transaction was declined. Mr M 
says he emailed PrePay as he needed access to the funds on the account of around US 
$100. Mr M says PrePay initially suggested he needed to call them and then emailed him to 
say it would call him back but failed to do so. 
Mr M says when he returned to the UK he took the matter up again with PrePay and the 
issue of inactivity fees charged to his PCA. Mr M says PrePay told him his PCA had been 
suspended in May 2020 due to a potential fraudulent transaction and the fees charged were 
in line with the terms and conditions of the PCA. 
Mr M says he hadnt received any notification of the suspension of his PCA, and this caused 
him extreme inconvenience and had to borrow money from friends because he couldnt 
access the money in his PCA. Mr M says PrePay offered him £50 for the poor service he 
experienced and doesnt feel this goes far enough to cover the stress and inconvenience this 
has caused him. 
PrePay says there was a transaction on Mr Ms PCA in May 2020 which triggered its fraud 
rules, so the card was suspended. PrePay says the inactivity fees have been correctly 
charged in line with its terms and conditions, that Mr M would have agreed to. PrePay says it 
was sorry that it failed to call Mr M when it promised to and offered Mr M £50 by way of 
apology. 
Mr M wasnt happy with PrePays response and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information and upheld Mr Ms complaint. The 
investigator says there was no evidence to show PrePay had ever informed Mr M his PCA 
had been suspended and so he wasnt aware that it couldnt be used. The investigator felt 
PrePay had however correctly charged the inactivity fees, as these are stipulated in the 
terms and conditions of the PCA that Mr M had agreed to when opening the account.
While the investigator understood the points PrePay made about Mr M having access to a 
second card on his account, this didnt alter the fact it hadnt advised Mr M the account he 
wanted to access while overseas had been suspended. As a result, the investigator felt 
PrePay should increase its offer of compensation by a further £100, making a total of £150. 
Mr M didnt agree with the level of compensation the investigator had suggested and asked 
for the matter to be referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I will also be upholding this complaint and I will explain how I have come to 
my decision. 
I can understand it would have been frustrating and upsetting for Mr M not to be able to 
access the balance of his PCA while overseas.
When looking at this complaint I will consider if PrePay acted fairly, when it suspended Mr 
Ms PCA and charged the inactivity fees when it did. 
Like the investigator having looked at the terms and conditions of the PCA it is clear that 
fees are charged if it isnt used for 12 months, so I cant say PrePay have done anything 
wrong in relation to that part of the complaint. 
Where I do have an issue is while PrePay perhaps acted in line with its fraud prevention 
rules in May 2020, when it suspended Mr Ms PCA, theres no evidence to show it ever let 
him know that. PrePay have made clear that is the reason why the card couldnt be 
accessed while Mr M was overseas. Although PrePay says Mr M had access to a second 
card on his PCA, I dont see this as directly relevant to the fact it had suspended his main 
currency card without letting him know.
Having said that I also have to take into account Mr M hadnt taken any steps to check his 
PCA before travelling, especially given it had been some years before he previously used it. 
In addition, I need to consider the fact, without trying to minimise the frustration this would 
have undoubtedly caused Mr M here, the balance was less than $100  - so any 
compensation here needs to be proportionate to the level of inconvenience caused by him 
not having access to that sum.
While Mr M may not agree, its not my role to penalise businesses when mistakes are made 
and here the main issue is Prepay couldnt provide any evidence to show it did let Mr M 
know his PCA had been suspended, as it suggested. Additionally, PrePay has apologised 
for the fact it failed to call Mr M when it said it would. 
So, taking all of this into account, like the investigator I am satisfied a more appropriate level 
of redress would be a total of £150 - £100 more than PrePay have offered. 
While Mr M will be disappointed with my decision, I feel this is a reasonable outcome here in 
the circumstances of this complaint.
Putting things right
I instruct PrePay Technologies Limited to pay Mr M a total of £150 for the trouble and upset 
caused. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
I instruct PrePay Technologies Limited to pay Mr M a total of £150 for the trouble and upset 
caused. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 July 2023.
