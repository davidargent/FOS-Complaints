The complaint
Mr M complains that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) lent him a loan 
he couldnt afford.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them all again
here.
118 118 Money lent Mr M a loan of £2000 in March 2017, this is not in dispute, so Ill focus 
on giving the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator, and I will explain 
why.
118 118 Money gathered some information from Mr M before it agreed to the loan. It asked 
him for his monthly income and then verified this amount using an online verification tool. It 
then asked him questions about expenditure. It finally then carried out a credit search to 
check against any existing credit commitments.
Mr M was entering into a significant commitment with 118 118 Money. He was agreeing to 
make monthly repayments for 2 years. So, I think it is right that 118 118 Money wanted to 
gather, and independently check (regarding his income and through the credit search), some 
detailed information about Mr Ms financial circumstances before it agreed to lend to him. I 
think that the checks it did achieved that aim. I think on balance its checks were 
proportionate. I say this as this was the first loan that Mr M had requested from 118 118 
Money. Mr Ms declared credit commitments would also seem to be around the same as the 
commitments that were given in its credit checks. So, I think it could have some assurance 
about what Mr M had told it.
But simply performing proportionate checks isnt always enough. A lender also needs to
react appropriately to the information those checks show. So, Ive looked at the information
118 118 Money gathered from Mr M to check whether I agree it was appropriate for him to 
be given the loan.
Mr M had declared to 118 118 Money that his monthly income was £2000 and that his 
expenditure was £700. I can see that 118 118 Money had worked out Mr M had enough 
disposable income to be able to comfortably afford the repayments. The credit search results 
wouldnt have shown any concerns to 118 118 Money from what I have seen. From the 
information it gathered, I think it would have been apparent to 118 118 Money that the loan 
was affordable and there was nothing that it would have had in front of it that would have 
shown it he was struggling to manage his finances.
So, overall, I agree with the investigator. I dont think 118 118 Moneys proportionate checks 
would have suggested that Mr M would have problems repaying this loan. So, I dont think 
118 118 Money was wrong on this occasion to give the loan to Mr M. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 March 2022.
