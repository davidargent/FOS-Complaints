The complaint
Mr C complains about the service he received from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) when he attempted to make an online payment.
What happened
In or around November 2021, Mr C attempted to make an online payment using NatWests 
online App. Shortly after setting up the payment, Mr C received a call from NatWest. They 
wanted to complete further security checks in order to verify that the payment Mr C wanted 
to make was genuine and not fraudulent or linked to any scam.
Mr C says NatWest acted in an unacceptable way asking questions that were hostile and 
aggressive. He says he was then required to call NatWest again to further verify 
information. Mr C says he was kept waiting for a considerable time, after which NatWest 
engaged in excessive quizzing. He ultimately demanded to speak to a supervisor. In total, 
Mr C says he spent an hour and 39 minutes on calls which wasted his time and caused him 
inconvenience. 
Mr C complained to NatWest about his experience. NatWest apologised for the delays hed 
experienced while on the calls and paid £20 compensation. But Mr C wasnt happy with 
NatWests response. He said their apology only recognised delays hed experienced when 
calling them back. He wanted NatWest to also recognise the manner of their staff when he 
spoke to them.
NatWest apologised for not fully addressing his complaint and for the poor level of service 
hed received. They paid further compensation of £55. Mr C wasnt happy with the amount of 
compensation paid by NatWest. In addition to the £20 previously paid, he thought they 
should pay £123.75. Hed calculated this amount based upon his own hourly charge out 
rates. NatWest didnt agree. They thought the compensation paid was fair.
As Mr C didnt agree with NatWest, he referred his complaint to this service. One of our 
investigators considered Mr Cs complaint. Our investigator acknowledged that NatWest had 
apologised for the delays and service Mr C experienced but didnt think they need to pay any 
more compensation. 
Mr C didnt agree with our investigators findings. He believes NatWest should calculate 
compensation in a defined way recognising his own individual circumstances and charge out 
rates. So, as an agreement couldnt be reached, Mr Cs complaint has been passed to me to 
consider. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The facts of Mr Cs complaint are not in dispute. NatWest has accepted that Mr C waited 
longer than expected when attempting to speak to them on the telephone. Theyve also 
apologised for the levels of service he experienced. So, I dont propose to expand on this 
any further.
At the outset, I believe its important to explain the role of this service when considering Mr 
Cs complaint here. 
It isnt the role of this service to supervise, regulate or impose fines on any business. Its also 
not our role to ask a business to alter its procedures or processes or impose improvements 
on the level of service offered to their customers. These aspects fall firmly within the remit of 
the regulator  in this case, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
But it is our role to examine and decide whether a business has been fair and reasonable in 
the manner in which those policies and procedures are applied in the individual 
circumstances of Mr Cs experience with them. NatWest have acknowledged their failings 
and apologised. I think that was the right thing to do here.
Mr C has expressed his dissatisfaction with the level of compensation offered by NatWest. 
Our investigator has already explained how this service looks at compensation. This is also 
clearly explained on our website. 
Compensation is a personal thing. What is seen as reasonable by one party may not be 
considered so by another. Mr C did experience some inconvenience. But I think the amounts 
paid feel fair in all the circumstances here. I appreciate that Mr C doesnt agree. But it isnt 
the role of this service to make awards in order to penalise NatWest for their mistakes. Any 
award is considered based upon the impact NatWests mistakes had upon Mr C. And I think 
NatWests have done that here.
I appreciate Mr C will be disappointed, but I shant be asking NatWest to do any more.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2022.
