The complaint
Mr B is unhappy that NewDay Ltd provided new and further credit to him at time when the 
provision of such credit wasnt affordable for him.
What happened
In March 2015, Mr B applied for a credit account with NewDay. His application was 
approved, and Mr B was issued with a credit account with an initial credit limit of £250.
In January 2017, NewDay increased the credit limit on Mr Bs account to £450. Further credit 
limit increases followed in July 2017, to £1,250, and in September 2018, to £2,250.
Mr B applied for a differently branded NewDay credit account in September 2018. His 
application was approved, and NewDay issued Mr B with a second credit account, this time 
with an initial credit limit of £900.
In 2021, Mr B raised a complaint with NewDay as he felt that he hadnt been able to afford 
any of the provisions of credit that NewDay had given to him. 
NewDay looked at Mr Bs complaint. They felt that theyd undertaken checks into Mr Bs 
financial position before offering any credit to him. These included obtaining information from 
Mr B about his income to ensure that hed reasonably be able to afford the credit, as well as 
obtaining information from a credit reference agency in order to gain a better understanding 
of Mr Bs wider financial position. 
NewDay felt that there hadnt been anything resulting from any of the checks theyd 
undertaken that should reasonably have given them cause to suspect that Mr B might not be 
able to afford any of the credit NewDay had offered to him. And because of this, NewDay 
didnt uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Mr B wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that Mr B had been in a 
demonstrably difficult financial position such that NewDay shouldnt have offered any of the 
new or further lines of credit to Mr B at those times, and that this should have been apparent 
to NewDay had the checks that theyd undertaken into Mr Bs financial position at those 
times been more appropriately focussed. So, our investigator recommended that this 
complaint be upheld in Mr Bs favour on that basis. 
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendations put forwards by our investigator, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much 
and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before approving a 
customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of credit available to a 
customer on an existing line of credit, the business would undertake reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure that any credit being offered to a customer is affordable for 
that customer at that time.
NewDay say that they did that here, and they note that when Mr B applied for the credit 
accounts with them that they took information from him about his income at those times in 
order to confirm that Mr B would in all likelihood be able to afford the credit that he was 
applying for. And NewDay also obtained information about Mr B from a credit reference 
agency, in order to gain a better understanding of Mr Bs wider financial position at those 
times.
Additionally, before offering further credit to Mr B, NewDay reviewed how Mr B had managed 
his credit account in the months leading up to the offer as well as obtained updated 
information from a credit reference agency to update their understanding of Mr Bs financial 
position. And NewDay maintain that there was nothing resulting from any of the checks that 
they undertook which they feel should have given them reasonable cause to suspect that    
Mr B might not be able to afford either the new or further lines of credit being offered to him.
First Credit Account Application
When Mr B applied for the first credit account in April 2015, he explained to NewDay that 
lived with his parents and that he was employed with an annual income of £25,000. NewDay 
also noted that Mr B had incurred two defaults on his credit file, with the most recent being 
eighteen months before the application, and that Mr B had outstanding existing credit 
totalling roughly £4,400, including a balance of £441 outstanding on short term payday 
loans. NewDay commented that Mr B had below average income while being highly 
indebted. But NewDay felt that Mr B was eligible  as per NewDays own criteria  for a new 
credit account with the relatively low initial credit limit of £250.
It must be acknowledged that NewDay position themselves as second chance lenders, 
which means that it isnt unusual for individuals with below average credit ratings to request 
credit from them. And NewDay often provide such applicants with credit accounts with 
relatively low initial credit limits  such as was the case in this instance  to allow that 
individual to demonstrate future creditworthiness by managing the NewDay credit account 
responsibly.
But NewDay still have a responsibility themselves to ensure that they dont offer new lines of 
credit to applicants where theres a reasonable chance that the applicant might not be able 
to manage the credit account responsibly, such that the individuals financial position 
worsens as a result of being provided such credit. 
In this instance, Mr B had defaulted on a prior credit commitment only eighteen months 
before his application to NewDay, and while that historical default may have been long 
enough ago that NewDay considered providing new credit to Mr B to be within their policy, I 
feel that this default  which confirmed that Mr B had struggled to meet credit commitments 
in the relatively recent past  as well as the fact that Mr B had an outstanding payday loan 
balance at that time  which indicated that Mr B might potentially be continuing to struggle to 
meet his financial commitments  should have reasonably given NewDay cause to consider 
that Mr B might not be able to afford any further credit at that time.
It's also notable that the information that NewDay assessed in regard to Mr Bs financial 
position at that time, while including the amount of Mr Bs annual income, didnt include any 
specific information about Mr Bs expenditure. Instead, NewDay relied on information about 
Mr Bs expenditure as estimated by a credit reference agency. But its notable that the information that NewDay have provided to this service that they obtained from the credit 
reference agency includes that Mr B didnt have any other outstanding credit commitments 
at that time, despite Mr B informing NewDay to the contrary at the point of application. 
NewDay were entitled to employ such an expenditure modelling strategy when assessing 
affordability. But in this instance I feel that the information that NewDay had about Mr Bs 
financial position at the time of the application  including that Mr B had a relatively recent 
default as well as an existing outstanding payday loan balance  should have given NewDay 
cause to undertake further checks into Mr Bs financial position before offering any line of 
credit to him.
And had NewDay undertaken such further checks, which I feel reasonably should have 
included reviewing Mr Bs current account statements for the months leading up to the 
application, I feel that the information that NewDay would have assessed here should have 
confirmed to NewDay that Mr B in all likelihood couldnt afford any further credit at that time.
I say this because Mr Bs current account statements for the months leading up to the 
NewDay application include the regular use of payday loans in conjunction with the balance 
of the account being maintained near the overdraft limit of £2,000, and also include several 
payments to debt collection agencies, other credit providers, and charges for using his 
unarranged overdraft.
The benefit of hindsight also confirms that Mr B couldnt reasonably afford the new credit 
that NewDay provided him, and I say this because Mr B went over the £250 credit limit, and 
incurred £12 over-limit charges as a result, for the first nine months that he held that 
account.
All of which means that I dont feel that NewDay did undertake reasonable and proportionate 
checks into Mr Bs financial position here, in light of the information available to them, and 
that if they had Im satisfied that NewDay should have concluded that they shouldnt have 
reasonably provided any credit to Mr B at that time. And it follows from this that Ill be 
upholding this aspect of Mr Bs complaint on this basis.
Second Credit Account Application
When Mr B applied for the second credit account with NewDay in September 2018, the 
information that NewDay assessed included that Mr B was employed with an annual income 
of £32,000, which equated to a net monthly income of £2,077. It also included that Mr B had 
monthly accommodation expenses of £500 as well as further essential living expenses of 
£300 per month, as well as an existing overall credit balance of £14,700.
Given that Mr B had £14,700 of existing credit commitments, the figure of £300 that NewDay 
used for his monthly essential living costs doesnt seem feasible here, and it seems likely to 
me that Mr B could have been paying significantly more than this amount in monthly credit 
repayments alone. 
Indeed, it must be noted that Mr B was making payments in excess of £40 per month 
towards his first NewDay credit account at that time, which was being maintained by Mr B 
with a balance of around £1,150. Furthermore, the credit reference agency information that 
NewDay continued to gather on Mr B for the first credit account showed that Mr B had 
existing credit commitments of over £20,000 at the time of the second account application, 
and not £14,700.
Taking this into account, it seems that Mr B already had credit commitments at the time of 
the second application that were more than 62% of his gross annual income. This doesnt feel sustainable to me, and I find it difficult to reach any conclusion other than that NewDay 
based their affordability assessment for the second credit account on incorrect existing credit 
information and a considerable overestimation of Mr Bs disposable income at that time.
Ultimately, I feel that from the information that NewDay did have available to them here, it 
should have been evident to NewDay that Mr B wouldnt in all likelihood be able to afford any 
further credit at that time, and that as such Im satisfied that NewDay shouldnt reasonably 
have provided a second line of credit to Mr B. And it follows from this that Ill be upholding 
this aspect of Mr Bs complaint accordingly.
Summary
As explained above, I dont feel that NewDay acted fairly towards Mr B by providing him with 
either credit account here. As such my final decision will be that I am upholding this 
complaint in Mr Bs favour.
Putting things right
NewDay reimburse to Mr Bs accounts all interest, fees, and charges, incurred or accrued on 
those accounts from the point of inception.
If these reimbursements result in either account having a credit balance in Mr Bs favour, 
NewDay must pay this balance to Mr B along with 8% simple interest calculated to the date 
of payment.
If after the reimbursements any outstanding balance remains liable for Mr B to pay, then 
NewDay must arrange a suitable interest free repayment plan with Mr B.
Finally, NewDay must remove all adverse credit reporting relating to these accounts from   
Mr Bs credit file.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2022.
