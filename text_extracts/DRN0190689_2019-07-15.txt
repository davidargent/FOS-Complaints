K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that Baker  Tilly Financial Management Ltd (as it is now known)  failed to 
advise him about  lifetime  allowance (LTA) protection in relation to his pension funds. He 
says this failure resulted in him incurring a tax charge of £22,386.82.
background
I sent my provisional decision on this complaint  to both parties on 4 June 2019. The 
background to the complaint and the reasons I intended to uphold it were  set out in that 
decision. The provisional decision is attached  and forms part of this final decision.
I asked both parties to send me any further evidence  or arguments that they wanted  me to 
consider before I made  my final decision.
Neither party had anything further  to add.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive seen no reason to 
depart from my provisional decision.
Ref: DRN01906892my final decision
For the reasons  set out in my provisional  decision attached, my final decision is that I uphold  
the complaint.  
I order that Baker Tilly Financial Management Ltd calculates and pays compensation to Mr H 
on the following  basis.
It should contact  the original SIPP  provider  and ask it for confirmation of the value of Mr Hs 
SIPP for LTA purposes at A-Day. It should  then calculate what  tax charge would have 
applied (if any), assuming Mr H had primary protection in place at the time he incurred the 
charge for £22,386.82 in July 2009.
The difference between the tax charge Mr H is liable for and what  he would have been liable 
for (if any) with primary protection is the headline  loss. 
If Mr H has paid the tax bill then the amount payable, plus any interest he had to pay, should 
be paid to Mr H. Interest  at the rate of 8% simple per annum should  be added  from the date 
it was paid to HM Revenue &Customs (HMRC) to the date of settlement. 
If Mr H hasnt yet paid the tax charge then interest  only needs to be added  to reflect  any 
interest charged by HMRC up to the date its paid to Mr H. 
Baker Tilly Financial Management Ltd should also pay Mr H £300 for the distress and 
inconvenience Im satisfied the matter  has caused him. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 August 2019.

complaint
Mr H complains that Baker Tilly Financial Management Ltd (as it is now known) failed  to advise  him 
about lifetime  allowance (LTA) protection in relation to his pension funds. He says this failure resulted 
in him incurring a tax charge of £22,386.82.
background
Mr H was advised  by the firm to transfer  his SIPP  arrangement from one provider to another. This was 
in early 2008.  The firm has said £846,793 was transferred.  And that Mr H also made a lump  sum 
contribution of £3,000. The firms also said Mr H was taking an annual income  from the original SIPP 
of £47,928.
Mr H signed a LTA declaration on 7 February 2008. This confirmed the benefit  crystallisation  event 
would not result  in a LTA charge. The LTA at that time was £1,600,000.
A file note dated 25 March  2008 said:
 [The adviser] spoke to the above  regarding the income  payments to be set up under  the above plan 
and agreed  that an immediate payment should be made as stipulated in the application, i.e. the 
previous [Providers] drawdown  payments, which should then be in the client's bank account  by the 
end of this week. Payments will then continue from 1st April onwards at the same level which  ties in 
with the previous date of receiving his [previous providers] payments.  
A file note dated 27 August 2008 said the adviser had spoken to Mr H regarding the client 
accessing additional funds  of £5,000 from his existing  SIPP. [The adviser] advised  [the provider] to 
take a special ad hoc income payment of £8,333 which  after tax at 40% and would equal a payment 
of £5,000  as required by the client.[The adviser] advised that this payment should  be taken from the 
investment in the Sterling One Fund and [the provider] confirmed that this would now be actioned  and 
the monies should be in the clients bank account in approximately 3 days  time.
A file note dated 13 January  2009 said, amongst other things:
[The adviser] met the above  to review  the up to date position as regards their above arrangement 
and to discuss  the options and ongoing requirements  of the client.
[The adviser] gave to the client the up to date valuation of the Phased  and Income Drawdown  Plans  
which confirmed current values etc.
One query regarding these details was that this seemed  to show maximum income as £30,046 per 
annum but the clients confirmed that they are probably taking something like £48,000 per annum 
gross at the present time. [The adviser] would investigate this accordingly.
[The adviser] explained  the up to date position regarding the clients' options with their existing plan 
including annuity  details for a joint life annuity if the clients wished to go down
this route and avoid investment and longevity risk. Having  discussed  this in detail
with the clients, they confirmed that they would  continue for the time being  with the
Income Drawdown plan preferring its flexibility and control although appreciating  its
risk by way of investment returns and longevity. [The adviser] also pointed  out to them  the
need to review  this plan in the years ahead particularly, with regard  to [Mr Hs age] and the "age 75 
limit" and the problems that this would  have for funds beyond this date.  [The adviser] also advised  
that it may be at a later date that the age 75 issue  may change in some way although obviously it was 
difficult to make forecasts at this time.
The clients confirmed  that their health remained good and their income  requirements
Ref: DRN01906894as at present are fine and their only requirement  was to match from time to time
some capital expenditure as previously. In this respect [the adviser] confirmed that a tax-free
option of around £51,000 currently existed under the Phased Retirement Plan plus
an additional income  that could be taken from the plan to the extent that income
being taken was below  the maximum GAD. The clients confirmed that as far as
capital expenditure is concerned  would require  funds  of £5,000. In addition,  certain home
improvements are being considered and it is likely that these will cost in the order of
£30,000[the adviser] then explained how the maximum tax-free  cash  sum and income situation 
could be utilised to facilitate  the capital  requirements.
.[the adviser]  would therefore  investigate the maximum income problems  specified  above and also 
suggest any possible "tweaking" of the investment fund allocations in the light of
current investment  markets etc.
File Note 21 January 2009
 [Mr H] contacted [the adviser]  following  the recent meeting to advise that following 'discussions at 
home' he wished to activate the immediate  payment from his SIPP of £10,000 net. In addition, he 
would require a further £5,000 in July. [The adviser] would therefore deal with matters accordingly  as 
regards how the client should take this and the access of funds  from the various different funds etc.
File Note 22 January 2009
This is a file note in respect of my telephone conversation with [the pension  provider][the adviser] 
gave instructions to [the provider] to take a gross payment from the Income Drawdown section of the 
plan i.e. £16,000 which nets down at around £9,600 which was acceptable to the client who required 
funds of around £10,000.  [The adviser] also instructed that these  funds  should be taken  from the 
Fixed Interest Fund and this will be actioned accordingly.
File note 22 July 2009
[Mr H] phoned [the adviser] to advise  he had received  the form to enable a further settlement to be 
made under his above plan in accordance  with his previous instructions. However, the client now 
confirmed that in addition to monies for a holiday, the clients  wished to do certain  house  
improvements and as a result their requirement  was for a payment of £20,000. Following discussions 
with the client, it was agreed  that this payment will be taken from the remaining tax-free cash 
entitlement within the plan.
The client will therefore return the form as soon as possible and [the adviser] will arrange 
accordingly.
One of our adjudicators  investigated the complaint. He thought the complaint should  succeed.  He 
noted the deadline for applying  for protection was 5 April 2009.  And prior to this date, the adjudicator 
said there were numerous  times when  the adviser  met with Mr H to discuss the lump sum 
withdrawals. The adjudicator felt the adviser had a responsibility to alert Mr H of this issue. He didnt 
find any evidence  that the adviser had told Mr H to apply for protection.
Baker Tilly didnt agree.  It said they were not aware  of all of Mr Hs pension arrangements. It argued 
that the transfer value was well below the LTA limit. And this was also the case  throughout its 
relationship with Mr H. Baker Tilly accepted that Mr H may have  incurred a LTA charge.  However it 
didnt think it was a result  of a mistake on its part. Its said, in summary:
The commission paid to the business was only in relation to the transfer.
It could  find no evidence that it had advised Mr H to make withdrawals  from his SIPP   rather  
Mr H had instructed  Baker  Tilly as and when he required income payments. 
Ref: DRN01906895When the tax free cash sum of £20,000 was withdrawn in July 2009 the LTA applicable  was 
£1,750,000. 
At no time had Baker Tilly been  informed that Mr H's total pension  benefits were at a level 
that could have  breached the LTA.  Mr  H had signed  a declaration to confirm  that a 
withdrawal in February 2008 would  not breach the LTA of £1,600,000. 
The Retail  Client Agreement signed  by Mr H on 12 March 2008  said in the Statement of 
Review section "..if you have  chosen to receive our advice, when  we have arranged  any 
investments, they will not be kept under  review  we will not give you any further advice unless 
you request it.  We will be glad to advise  you further at any time you ask us to do so". Mr H 
did not ask for further advice. 
Mr H had a duty of care to disclose  all of his pension arrangements.  Based on the pension 
that the firm was aware of there was no risk of Mr H exceeding  his LTA.  So there was no duty 
of care or obligation placed on the adviser  to raise the LTA with him. If Mr H had disclosed all 
of his pension entitlement, the position with regard to the LTA would have been clear. 
The pension  provider had confirmed Mr H had an income in payment. So it wouldnt have 
been possible to protect an individual's  LTA after the first benefit crystallisation event. 
Therefore Mr Hs complaint  couldnt succeed  as the firm couldnt  have recommended Mr H 
apply for protection.  
Baker Tilleys advice about the LTA would generally  have been offered to customers  with total 
pension funds  in excess of £1,000,000.  As far as it was aware  Mr Hs pension  provision  was 
substantially below the applicable limits. It said the fund value of Mr Hs pension  was recorded  
as:
11 December 2008 -  £720,841.89  - the LTA was £1,650,000
27 July 2009 - £687,881.90  - the LTA was £1,750,000.
The new pension  provider confirmed that the withdrawals had exceeded Mr Hs LTA.  It said that Mr H 
exceeded 100% of his LTA as a result of the BCE on 27 July 2009.  It said the Declaration  that Mr H 
had signed had no real bearing  on the issue. At that time hed only used 96.86%  of his LTA at that 
time. 
It said the GAD maximum at the first crystallisation date post A-Day on 16/11/2006  was £50,887.35. 
And it provided the following  breakdown of events.
On 29 February 2008 it received £228,789.13 of uncrystallised pension  benefits from the previous 
provider. On 17 March  2008 it received four drawdown transfers from the same provider.  
1. £477,523.80 - Pre A-Day
2. £24,999.34 - Post A-Day  - crystallisation post A-day 16 November 2006
3. £64,057.47 - Post A-Day  - crystallisation post A-day 08 May 2007
4. £51,424.18 - Post A-Day  - crystallisation post A-day 30 July 2007.
1. £50,887.35 x 25 divided by the LTA at the time of 1.5m = 84.81%.
2. 2.67%
3. 6.28%
4. 4.39%.
Total LTA used 98.15%.
Mr H had subsequently crystallised the following  benefits:
2 June 2008  - £28,000.00 with tax free cash of £7,000.00 taken, LTA - 1.69%
Ref: DRN0190689627 July 2009 - £80,000.00  with tax free cash of £20,000.00 taken,  LTA - 4.57%
14 July 2010 - £100,000.00 with tax free cash of £25,000.00 taken, LTA -5.55%
4 April 2011 - £46,546.24 with tax free cash of £11,636.56 taken, LTA - 2.58%
This meant  Mr H had taken  a total of 112.54% of his LTA.
Mr H has said this has resulted in being liable for a tax charge of £22,386.82.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. 
It doesnt  appear to be in dispute that firm advised Mr H to transfer his SIPP  from one provider  to 
another. Although the firm has referred to a suitability letter (from  March  2008)  this appears to have 
been sent part way through the transfers and doesnt explain the rationale  for the transfer itself. I 
havent seen a suitability letter outlining  the reasons for transfer. However,  in my view, in the course  
of advising on the transfer the adviser should have considered Mr Hs position with respect to the 
lifetime allowance.  
Baker Tilly has said Mr H had a duty to disclose all his pension arrangements. However     Mr H has 
confirmed this was the only pension he had. The documentation  shows it was aware that Mr H had 
pre A-Day crystallised benefits and he was in receipt of a significant income. So although  its said the 
actual values transferred werent high enough  for the LTA to be relevant, when considering  the value 
of the income already in payment for lifetime allowance  purposes Im satisfied the adviser ought  to 
have realised it was an issue.
The firm has said itself that advice about the LTA would  generally have  been offered  to customers 
with total pension funds  in excess of £1,000,000.  When  advice about the transfer was being  given the 
value of the pre A-Day  crystallised benefits was well over £1 million.
Clearly the underlying objective behind the transfer advice and any associated advice about the 
underlying investments was to try and maximise benefits at retirement. The fact Mr H could  be subject 
to LTA charges would  clearly be something that should  be considered as a risk when providing  advice 
about how to maximise  benefits  at retirement; I think it was all part and parcel of the advice to 
transfer. So I think  the adviser  should have considered  it as part of his advice. 
I think  its also clear  that the firm werent just merely  acting on Mr Hs instructions when he was 
making the withdrawals  outlined above. It was advising  on how to take the benefits  and from what  
funds. The file notes  dated  27 August 2008, and 13 January/21 January 2009 show it was providing 
regulated investment advice. Again,  I think Mr Hs exposure to a LTA charge should  have been 
considered at that time. And Mr H should have been alerted it was an issue.  This was prior to the 
deadline to apply for protection. And Im satisfied its likely that that Mr H would  have applied for it if 
hed been told about it.
However my understanding is that Mr H had been  contributing to the SIPP with his original provider 
(prior to transfer) but after A-day; 6 April 2006. Mr H recalls that he wasnt paying into it; but the 
providers records indicate  that he was. As a result, he wasnt  eligible to apply for enhanced 
protection. 
But my understanding is the value of his pension at A-day was over £1,500,000.  So Mr H would  have 
been eligible  to apply for primary  protection at the time the firm advised  him to transfer. And at the 
time that the withdrawals  were  arranged  prior to April 2009.
Primary protection provided a personal LTA which was calculated based on a lifetime  allowance 
enhancement factor (LAEF).  Effectively this protected the proportion of benefits  above the lifetime  
allowance at A-Day. 
Ref: DRN01906897So I think if Mr H had been appropriately alerted to the LTA risks he would have applied for primary 
protection. As a result this would have mitigated the tax he subsequently had to pay  to what extent 
will depend on the amount his fund was over the £1.5 million at A-day  and the associated LAEF.
Baker Tilley has said Mr H wasnt eligible to apply  for protection because  it wasnt possible to protect 
an individual's LTA after the first benefit crystallisation. Im not aware this is the case. However  Baker 
Tilley should provide more details  and direct  me to the relevant rules if it maintains Mr H wasnt 
eligible for protection in the particular  circumstances. 
my provisional  decision
My provisional  decision  is to uphold  Mr Hs complaint.  
I intend  to direct Baker Tilly Financial Management Ltd to calculate and pay compensation  to Mr H on 
the following basis.
It should contact  the original  SIPP provider and ask it for confirmation of the value  of Mr Hs SIPP for 
LTA purposes at A-Day.  It should then calculate what tax charge would have applied (if any),  
assuming he had primary protection in place at the time he incurred  the charge for £22,386.82  in July 
2009.
The difference  between the tax charge Mr H is liable  for and what  he would have been liable for (if 
any) with primary protection is the headline loss. 
If Mr H has paid the tax bill then the amount payable, plus any interest he had to pay, should  be paid 
to Mr H. Interest at the rate of 8% simple per annum should be added  from the date it was paid to HM 
Revenue &Customs (HMRC) to the date of settlement. 
If Mr H hasnt yet paid the tax charge  then interest  only needs to be added to reflect any interest 
charged by HMRC up to the date its paid to Mr H. 
Baker Tilly Financial Management Ltd should also pay Mr H £300 for the distress and inconvenience 
Im satisfied the matter has caused him.
