DRN-3633150
The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as D, complains about National Westminster Bank Plc freezing 
its account temporarily.
Mr M, a director of D, brings the complaint on D's behalf.
What happened
Between April 2021 and May 2022, NatWest sent D several letters and emails requesting 
information to confirm Ds business profile. NatWest required this information to comply with 
its regulatory obligations to check periodically the identity of its customers. NatWest warned 
D that, if it did not receive the required information, it would restrict access to Ds account. 
In April 2022, NatWest phoned D to explain how to provide the required information. 
However, the issue was not resolved.
On 10 May 2022, NatWest put a stop on Ds account. On 11 May, Mr M spoke with NatWest 
and managed to access its portal to upload the required information. The stop was then 
removed.
Mr M complained. Amongst other things, he said that NatWests systems were not user 
friendly and that, due to a NatWest system error, it had not been possible to upload the 
information. He added that all the information which had been requested by the bank was 
available on Companies House. Mr M said that having the stop on Ds account for a day and 
a half had caused significant inconvenience to Ds trade.
NatWest said that it had done nothing wrong. It explained that it was obliged to conduct the 
review and had sent many letters and emails to D to explain the process. It said it had also 
sought to explain by phone how to log in to its portal to provide the required information. 
While NatWest acknowledged that having the account restricted would have been 
frustrating, it said that too much time had passed without this information, so the restriction 
was necessary to get the attention of the business. 
Not content with this response, Mr M brought Ds complaint to our service. 
Our investigator looked into things and considered Mr Ms submissions about how he had 
sought to provide the information requested by the bank. However, overall, he found that 
NatWests actions had been reasonable. 
Mr M didnt agree with this view so asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
While I have read carefully the full correspondence between D and NatWest and considered 
all the evidence submitted, I have focussed my decision on the matters which I consider 
central to this complaint.
First, I have considered whether NatWest acted reasonably in the information it requested 
from D. Having looked at its information request and considered NatWests regulatory 
obligations, I think the request was reasonable. Banks have to conduct business profile 
reviews to satisfy a regulatory requirement to hold up to date and accurate information about 
their customers  so I dont think NatWest did anything wrong in seeking this information. I 
acknowledge that NatWest might have been able to obtain this information from other 
sources, such as Companies House, but I think it was reasonable for the bank to seek it 
directly from D. NatWest may then have compared the information provided against that held 
on Companies House. 
Having looked at the letters and emails sent by NatWest, it appears to me that the bank set 
out its requirements clearly, and explained the action it would take should the required 
information not be provided. 
Therefore, Ive then considered whether NatWest provided D with a reasonable opportunity 
to provide the required information before placing a restriction on its account. 
Mr M has given several reasons why NatWests action to restrict Ds account was unfair in 
the circumstances, including:
He never received the letters and emails, or thought they were fake
He gave answers over the phone on numerous occasions
He responded on the back of the letters received
He sought to upload the required information but there was a flaw in NatWests 
system, which was confirmed by NatWest
As a director of a company, he shouldnt be required to download a template for the 
information
I have checked the postal and email addresses to which NatWest sent its communication 
and they are consistent with those held on file by NatWest, and consistent with those 
provided to us by Mr M. I have also checked NatWests file notes. On the basis of this 
evidence, while I cannot be sure whether the letters and emails sent by the bank were all 
received by D, I think it more likely than not that they were sent, and sent to the right 
addresses. Moreover, it is apparent from Mr Ms responses that he did receive some letters 
from NatWest notifying him of the information required well before the deadline. It is also 
clear from his engagement in seeking to comply with those requests that he knew by this 
time that they were not fake.
I have considered Mr Ms submission that on two occasions he phoned NatWest to provide 
the required information, and on two occasions used NatWests reply envelope to return the 
required information. However, there is nothing in NatWests customer file to record these 
calls or responses. Mr M has provided a photo of a diary entry on 15 April 2022 showing that 
he tried to upload the information and, as that proved ineffective, he then wrote the 
information on the back of NatWests letter before sending it back. I have no reason to doubt 
that he did this, but it is not clear that the information was received by NatWest, or that it 
would have been sufficient to satisfy NatWests requirements.
Mr M has also said that on two occasions he tried to upload the required information but, due 
to a fault on NatWests systems, it was not possible. He says that the system defaulted to an 
unknown company, which made it impossible to provide the information requested. He also says that a representative of NatWest confirmed this problem. However, again, there is no 
record of this call.
There is a record that, in April 2022, NatWest spoke with Mr M to advise him how to access 
the portal. During this call, Mr M said that NatWest should be able to access all the 
information required from Companies House. 
When the stop was placed on Ds account on 11 May 2022, Mr M spoke with NatWest again. 
In this call, Mr M initially stated that he didn't want to download the template as he didnt 
believe that, as a director of the company, he should have to do it. But Mr M was then 
assisted to log on to the portal. It was apparent that he hadnt previously identified the edit 
button, which enabled him to access the upload facility. Mr M complained that the system 
wasn't user friendly.
Ive reviewed all the information provided but found no evidence to indicate that there was an 
error with NatWests systems. Rather, it appears to me more likely that Mr M found 
NatWests systems difficult to navigate. In the call in May, after the restrictions were 
imposed, Mr M was guided through the process and the required information was uploaded 
quickly. 
While it may be that NatWests systems could be more user-friendly, it appears to me that 
NatWest did call Mr M in April to try to provide the support needed and, in its letters, it had 
sought to offer alternative means by which the information could be provided  either by post 
in its pre-paid reply envelopes or in branch.
Having considered all the evidence provided, I believe NatWest provided D with ample 
opportunity to provide the required information before placing the restrictions on its account. 
In May 2022, when the process had been going on for over a year, and with plenty of 
warnings provided, I think it was reasonable for NatWest to put a stop on Ds account until 
this matter was resolved. I note that the stop was quickly removed as soon as the required 
information was provided.
I acknowledge that Mr M will be disappointed with this decision. He has expressed his deep 
frustration and lack of respect for NatWest generally, citing many concerns about the bank. 
However, my task is to consider the actions of NatWest in the specific circumstances of this 
complaint. In these circumstances, I do not believe I have seen sufficient evidence to 
demonstrate that the bank did anything wrong.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 June 2023.
