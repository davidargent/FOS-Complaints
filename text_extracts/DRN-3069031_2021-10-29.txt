The complaint
Mrs H complains that TransUnion International UK Limited trading as TransUnion 
Information Group gave private information about her to a third party. 
  
What happened
Mrs H has explained that a third party, with whom she shares a name, contacted her earlier 
this year and advised they had found information about her on their credit file. The entry in 
question related to an active credit commitment. 
Mrs H says she had to contact TransUnion several times and raise a complaint before the 
entry was removed. In its final response, TransUnion upheld Mrs Hs complaint and said 
incorrect data was being corrected as a priority. TransUnion apologised for the error and 
gave some background concerning how credit reference agencies match data. 
An investigator at this service upheld Mrs Hs complaint and asked TransUnion to pay her 
£100 for the distress and inconvenience caused by its actions. Despite follow up requests for 
a response, TransUnion didnt get back to the investigator. As no response was received, 
Mrs Hs complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
All parties agree that Mrs Hs private information was recorded on a third partys credit file. I 
understand TransUnion took steps to remove the incorrectly matched data following Mrs Hs 
complaint. 
Our investigator upheld Mrs Hs complaint and asked TransUnion to pay her £100. Despite 
several follow up requests for a response, TransUnion didnt give any reasons why it thinks 
the proposed settlement isnt a fair way to resolve the complaint. 
Mrs H has explained that she hadnt spoken with the third party in question for many years 
and she was uncomfortable with private information about her finances being shared without 
consent. I agree that £100 fairly reflects the impact of the issues raised on Mrs H. Im going 
to proceed on that basis and uphold Mrs Hs complaint.  
 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this compliant and direct TransUnion International UK Limited 
trading as TransUnion Information Group to pay Mrs H £100. 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 November 2021.
