K821x#15complaint
Mrs D says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny irresponsibly lent to her, 
trapping her in a debt spiral.
background
This complaint is about fourteen loans Sunny provided to Mrs D. Mrs Ds first loan was a 
running account facility  with a credit limit of £350  and given to Mrs D between  16 November 
2014 and 3 March 2015. Mrs D then borrowed thirteen other  instalment  loans  between  
February 2015 and December  2017. Mrs Ds borrowing history is set out in the table below:

There was a gap in lending between repaying  loan 11 and taking out loan 12 of around  nine 
months.
Mrs D says that Sunny ought to have realised  she couldnt afford the loans. She has told us 
that as a result of Sunny continuing to approve  the loans she suffered financial hardship.
In its final response letter  to Mrs D, Sunny told her that it would not uphold her complaint. It 
said it had carried out eligibility, affordability  and creditworthiness checks, before deciding 
whether to give each  loan. The amounts advanced were assessed  as being affordable for 
each loan.
In our adjudicators latest assessment, he said that Sunny shouldnt have given the loans 
from loan 9- 11. But he said that Sunny did enough  checks when it gave Mrs D loans 12-14 
as there  was a long enough gap between loan 11 and loan 12 to start a new chain of 
borrowing. And from the information Mrs D had given Sunny at this time, it was enough to 
suggest that at this time Mrs D could afford the loans. He did not uphold  loans 12-14.

my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs D could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs D could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ds complaint.  Ive decided to agree with our most 
recent adjudicators  view.  Ive decided not to uphold loans 1-8. But I uphold Mrs Ds 
complaint from loan 9 to loan 11. Ive also decided not to uphold loans 12-14. I will explain 
why.
Ref: DRN53144193In the early stages of the relationship Sunny needed to do proportionate checks. Mrs D told 
Sunny her income for loans 1-5 was £1,200 per month. She also told Sunny that her highest  
total expenditure for these  loans  was £701.  So, based on the information  Mrs D gave and 
the repayments Mrs D had to make, I dont think the running credit facility and the first four 
instalment loans would have appeared unaffordable.
As our second adjudicator explained when Mrs D took out loans 6-8, she had been 
borrowing for nearly a year already and so I think on balance Sunny should  have done 
further checks about Mrs Ds financial circumstances. But Ive seen nothing from the 
information which might  suggest Mrs D would be unable to make  the repayments  in a 
sustainable way. So, I cant safely say that these  loans  were unaffordable or unsustainable  
for Mrs D.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs D, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ds case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 9. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs D was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. There were  some gaps early  on between  loans 2 and 3 of about 
three months and some shorter periods when Mrs D hadnt taken out a loan with 
Sunny but overall Mrs D had taken out 1 running  account  credit facility and 8 further 
instalment loans within around  17 months. So Sunny ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mrs D was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  
her previous loan was leaving  in her finances  and that Mrs Ds indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mrs Ds first loan was for £100 and loan 9 was also for £100.  So, it doesnt seem  
likely that Mrs Ds need for cash was reducing which also points to her having a 
longer term need for funds. So, at this point Sunny ought  to have known that Mrs D 
was not likely borrowing  to meet a temporary  shortfall in her income  but to meet  an 
ongoing need. 
There was very little gap between the time Mrs D paid off the previous loan and when 
she took out loan 9. She took out loan 9 just 19 days after repaying loans 7 and 8. 
Mrs D wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  11 was 
taken out twenty months after Mrs Ds first. And although  it was for a smaller  amount 
Mrs D had taken out several loans  for £50 within a short  period. So, Mrs D had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mrs D lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 9- 11 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ds indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
Ref: DRN53144194the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mrs D borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mrs Ds ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him/her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
Turning to loan 12-14 as our adjudicator explained,  loan 12 was taken out around nine 
months after repaying loan 11. I think this started  a new chain  of borrowing and the checks 
Sunny did were proportionate and sufficient. Based on what Mrs D had told Sunny about her 
income and her expenditure for these loans, I dont  think Sunny would likely have been  
alerted to the fact that these loans were unaffordable or unsustainable. So, I dont uphold 
Mrs Ds complaint about loan 12-14.
Taking everything into account,  Im upholding the complaint about  loans  9-11 and Sunny 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mrs D loans 9-11.
refund  all interest and charges Mrs D paid on loans 9-11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loans  9-11 means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  9-11 should  be removed from Mrs Ds credit  
file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs D a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Ds complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 May 2020.
