The complaint
Ms A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wrongly made her account dormant, 
and she said it had deleted transactions from her statements for another account. Ms A said 
shed lost money and her intellectual property as a result. 
What happened
Ms A said that NatWest had wrongly made one of her accounts dormant. She completed the 
dormant accounts form that it told her to fill in, but NatWest never got in touch. And she said 
it had deleted transactions from her statement on another account. Because of these 
missing transactions, she said shed lost money and intellectual property.
NatWest said that it hadnt made the account that Ms A was searching for dormant. It said 
that this account had been closed in 2011, when the balance of £1 was transferred to one of 
her other accounts. NatWest said that it shouldve told Ms A this straight away, when she 
sent it a dormant accounts form, so it said sorry for that.
And NatWest said that it doesnt delete transactions from statements. It cant do that. 
Transactions will sometimes show on an account then not on the resulting statement, if they 
dont actually go through. This can happen with direct debits that are returned on the same 
day, or card transactions which the merchant never claims. But NatWest cant just remove 
transactions from an account. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said that NatWest had sent 
our service statements showing that the account was closed as it said, and the money 
transferred to another of Ms As accounts. So she didnt think NatWest had made this 
account dormant. 
Our investigator also said that she hadnt seen anything to suggest that NatWest had 
removed transactions from Ms As statements. She said she hadnt seen other cases where 
this had happened. And she said Ms A could get in touch directly with the merchant if she 
was expecting transactions to have taken place which didnt then show on her account. 
Ms A wanted our service to tell her who closed her account, and to send her proof of this as 
well as the statement proving the £1 transaction. She wanted to know why NatWest hadnt 
told her this. And she wanted to know who wed contacted to verify NatWests story that it 
hadnt removed transactions from her statement. 
Our investigator said that Ms As account was closed on 22 July 2011. NatWest doesnt 
have records of how the account was closed any more, as this was now ten years ago. She 
explained that banks usually are only required to hold data for six years. 
Our investigator said that she thought it was likely that Ms A had closed the account herself, 
because the final £1 was transferred to another of her accounts. 
Our investigator said that NatWest should have provided Ms A with a response when she 
sent in her dormant account form, and it has accepted this. 
Our investigator said that we had asked NatWest about what happened on Ms As account. 
And she accepted that our service cant prove beyond any doubt at all that NatWest hasnt 
removed transactions from Ms As bank statements  as it is not possible for us to prove a 
negative. But she said that it isnt common for NatWest to do something like this, and she 
had personally never seen that happen. 
Ms A said that what we had sent her wasnt a bank statement, and there was no evidence to 
support our claims about a £1.00 transaction. And wed said that NatWest didnt hold records 
in relation to the closure of the account. She said she couldnt accept our findings. 
Ms A said she had asked NatWest for copy bank statements before the 6year time period, 
and it provided inaccurate statements. She said that NatWest would only cover itself, as she 
was complaining about it. Ms A thought we should contact other businesses, and she said 
she wanted us to prove a negative. 
Ms A said not only should NatWest have contacted her when she raised her dormant 
account complaint, it should have contacted her when it said it closed her account. She 
wanted to know what we meant when we said NatWest had acknowledged that it should 
have got in touch. 
Our investigator didnt change her mind. Because no agreement was reached, this case 
came to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
NatWest wrote to Ms A on 8 January 2021 about her complaint. It said to her then that it 
thought shed closed this account herself, and it was sorry it hadnt got back in touch to tell 
her this when she first sent in her dormant account form. Ive seen this letter, and it was sent 
to the same address that Ms A gave to our service. 
I dont know if this letter arrived or not. If Ms A hasnt yet seen this, our service would be 
happy to share it with her.
Ms A then complained to our service. Shes said shes not happy with the investigation weve 
done, because she thinks that NatWest would just cover itself. 
It would be very serious, if NatWest were to lie to our service. Ive not seen anything at all to 
suggest it has done that. 
What NatWest has shown us, is a printout of the details it holds for the account Ms A says 
was made dormant. Im satisfied that is what NatWest has said it is  the details of the last 
transaction on this account. NatWest has also shown us that the last £1 was transferred to 
another account, and its shown us that this account was held by Ms A too. 
From this, NatWest thinks its most likely that Ms A closed the account herself. 
Our investigator thought the same, and so do I.Our service doesnt have to prove things beyond any doubt at all. Thats often not possible. 
So we look at the evidence, and we decide, from that, what is most likely to have happened. 
Ive considered the evidence here, and I think that its most likely that Ms A closed her 
account ending 3827 in July 2011.
Ms A also said that we hadnt proved that NatWest didnt delete transactions from her 
statement. She wanted us to do a much more detailed investigation, and to contact other 
businesses. She didnt think we should just rely on what NatWest had said to us.
Our service doesnt just rely on what a bank says to us. We also draw on a considerable 
amount of previous experience. From that experience, Im aware that transactions may show 
on an account, then not show up on the statement, for the two reasons that NatWest has 
given. Firstly, a direct debit might be reversed on the same day. Secondly, a card payment 
may be reserved, but then not taken by the merchant. Deposits for hire cars, for example, 
sometimes dont show on a statement, if the money is never actually claimed. 
I havent seen a bank deliberately remove transactions from a persons statement. Again, 
this is an extremely serious allegation. 
Ms A wanted us to prove that NatWest hadnt done this. But, as Ive said, our service doesnt 
have to prove things beyond any doubt at all. We look at the evidence, and we decide, from 
that, what is most likely to have happened. Here, the evidence we have is a statement from 
Ms A just saying that transactions are missing. And we have a statement from NatWest 
saying that it hasnt removed transactions, and it cant do that. 
Ive weighed this evidence, and I dont think its likely that NatWest has removed 
transactions from Ms As statements. 
I understand that Ms A will be disappointed, as shes explained she would like us to do a 
much, much more detailed investigation, involving a number of other businesses. But I dont 
think that NatWest has done anything wrong here. And that means I dont think this 
complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 September 2021.
