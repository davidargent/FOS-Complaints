The complaint
Mr L complains that Chetwood Financial Limited trading as BetterBorrow (BetterBorrow) is 
holding him liable for the debt on a loan which he says he neither applied for nor knew 
about. 
What happened
The background to this complaint is well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything 
here. In brief summary, on 15 March 2022 a loan was taken out with BetterBorrow in Mr Ls 
name for Â£9,000. Mr L subsequently got in touch with BetterBorrow to let it know he hadnt 
applied for the loan. BetterBorrow and Mr L couldnt reach agreement, so Mr L referred his 
complaint about BetterBorrow to us. Our Investigator here couldnt resolve the matter 
informally, so the case has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached materially the same conclusions and for the same reasons as 
our Investigator. 
In this case, my first consideration is: did Mr L enter into this loan agreement, or was it done 
without his knowledge and consent as he alleges?
Having considered this carefully, I think its most likely the loan was taken out in Mr Ls name 
without his knowledge and consent, and he therefore did not enter into the loan agreement. I 
say this because:
BetterBorrow says the loan was taken out in Mr Ls name through ClearScore and 
that there wasnt anything about the application to suggest it hadnt come from Mr L. 
However, as BetterBorrow well knows, ID theft is where someone uses someone 
elses identity to obtain goods or services or funds, leaving the victim to deal with the 
consequences. And I think this is what most likely happened here  fraudsters used 
Mr Ls details to apply for the loan with BetterBorrow and to benefit from the loan 
funds. Ill explain why. 
Mr L says his phone was stolen whilst he was on a night out; and that his phone, 
mobile banking app, and ClearScore app passcodes were the same or similar. So, if 
a third party had seen Mr L enter his passcode into his phone (before it was stolen) 
they could have accessed Mr Ls phone and his mobile banking and ClearScore apps 
on it. I have found what Mr L has said about his phone being stolen plausible and 
persuasive.
BetterBorrow has sought to challenge this. For example, its questioned why, if Mr L 
thought his phone was stolen, he didnt report this to his bank right away. And its 
questioned  if a third party had applied for the loan without Mr Ls knowledge or 
consent  why they would have used Mr Ls genuine email address in the application, 
when they could have instead  I understand BetterBorrows point to be  used a 
different email address that wouldnt have risked alerting Mr L to the fraud. However, 
I havent found BetterBorrows points on this to be persuasive at all. Mr L reported 
the matter to Action Fraud. And hes explained that at first, when he couldnt find his 
phone, he thought he must have lost it; but he nonetheless told his bank this.  But 
that it was only a few days later (on 15 March 2022, when BetterBorrow granted the 
loan), when he got emails about the loan, and when he realised money had been 
taken from his bank account, that he realised his phone had been stolen  and thats 
when he immediately went to his bank. Mr L has provided evidence to show he 
requested a new sim card the day after the night he lost the phone, and that he 
bought a new handset. Furthermore, with regards to the fraudsters using Mr Ls email 
address, as our Investigator explained, fraudsters use increasingly varied methods. 
One possible explanation is that the fraudsters likely had access to Mr Ls emails 
through his phone, and using a different email address, particularly through 
ClearScore, could have alerted BetterBorrow and foiled the fraud. 
The loan funds were paid into Mr Ls bank account, and Mr Ls bank upheld Mr Ls 
fraud claim. Further, there were some funds remaining in Mr Ls current account 
when Mr L reported the fraud (which have been returned to BetterBorrow). If Mr L 
had taken out the loan himself and sought to trick BetterBorrow about this, it seems 
unlikely he would have reported the fraud before all the loan funds had been moved 
on from his account. 
BetterBorrow has questioned how, even if a third party had access to Mr Ls phone 
and his phone passcode, they could have gained access to his ClearScore to apply 
for the loan given ClearScores specific requirements for passwords. However, our 
Investigator has explained how this might have been possible. 
Mr Ls bank has provided us with information indicating new payees and all the loan 
funds were transferred out of Mr Ls account using Mr Ls passcode. And Im satisfied 
in this case its most likely that Mr Ls phone was stolen and the fraudsters somehow 
managed to gain access to the phone, Mr Ls banking and ClearScore apps through 
the phone passcode. 
Since Im satisfied Mr L most likely didnt apply for or agree to this loan, I dont think it would 
be fair for BetterBorrow to hold him to the terms of the loan agreement he never saw or 
agreed to. So, BetterBorrow shouldnt hold Mr L liable for interest and charges, neither 
should there be a record of the loan on Mr Ls credit file  so if there currently is, this should 
be removed. 
However, Im also satisfied in this case that it wouldnt be fair for BetterBorrow to pursue 
Mr L for the outstanding loan funds. I say this because Im satisfied Mr L appears to have 
had no benefit from these at all. And it seems to me as soon as he reasonably knew or 
ought to have known what had happened, he acted quickly and appropriately to try to 
mitigate matters. It wouldnt be fair for him to be pursued for an outstanding loan balance in 
circumstances like this. BetterBorrow has pointed towards Mr Ls conduct and said that hes 
acted with gross negligence and by having a passcode for his phone the same or similar to 
his banking app he enabled the fraud. However, I cant say a third-party witnessing Mr L 
inputting his passcode on his phone amounts to gross negligence on Mr Ls part. And whilst 
Mr L could have been more careful by having a different passcode for his phone compared 
to his mobile banking app, Im not persuaded this meets the threshold for gross or 
contributory negligence here. Mr L didnt have anything to do with this loan. Fraudsters 
tricked BetterBorrow into granting it. And when the money hit Mr Ls account fraudsters 
moved it on from there without any dealings from Mr L. So, whilst Ive considered everything BetterBorrow has said, Im satisfied here it wouldnt be fair for BetterBorrow to pursue Mr L 
for the outstanding funds  Im satisfied BetterBorrow should write off the loan.
My final decision
For the reasons explained, I uphold this complaint and I direct Chetwood Financial Limited 
trading as BetterBorrow to:
write off the loan and not pursue Mr L for any repayment of the loan; and
amend Mr Ls credit file removing any information about the loan and searches.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 November 2023.
