The complaint
Mr H says Hardy Finance Limited, trading as Cash Converters (Cash Converters), 
irresponsibly lent to him. Mr H says Cash Converters should have taken reasonable steps to 
assess whether he was able to make the loan repayments, and without any difficulty. He has 
told us he got into a cycle of payday lending.

 Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Hs complaint and thought the loans from loan 7 onwards 
shouldnt have been given as the borrowing pattern suggested Mr H had become 
persistently reliant on this type of credit. 
Cash Converters didnt reply to the adjudicator so as the complaint remains unresolved it 
has been passed to me for decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Cash Converters needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr H could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Cash Converters should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Cash Converters was required to 
establish whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. Mr H didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to six shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr H had with Cash Converters. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Cash Converters lending history with Mr H, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Cash Converters should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Cash Converters should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Hs case, and like the adjudicator, I think that this 
point was reached by loan seven. I say this because:
At this point Cash Converters ought to have realised Mr H was not managing to 
repay his loans sustainably. Mr H had taken out seven loans within five months. So, 
Cash Converters ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr H was having 
to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mr Hs first loan was for £140 and loan seven was for £195.  At this point Cash 
Converters ought to have known that Mr H was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
 
For all of the lending, and which continued after loan seven, Mr H was provided with 
a new loan on the same day or within a few days of settling a previous one. 
 
Mr H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Cash Converters. Loan 
13 was taken out 11 months after Mr Hs first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr H 
had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Cash Converters 
over an extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because Cash Converters continued to provide borrowing from loan 
seven onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 
the number of loans which Mr H borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans seven to 13 and Cash Converters should 
put things right.
Putting things right  what Cash Converters needs to doA. Cash Converters should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr H 
towards interest, fees and charges on these loans, not including anything Cash 
Converters has already refunded.                                                                                  
   
B. Cash Converters should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments 
made by Mr H which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr H 
originally made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.                                
              
C. Cash Converters  may if it chooses to  use the total of A plus B to repay any 
principal which it has written-off.                                                                                    
             
D. Cash Converters should pay any remaining refund to Mr H. If there is no refund left 
and still a balance outstanding made up of written-off principal, it would not be fair for 
Cash Converters to pursue this further.
 
The overall pattern of Mr Hs borrowing for loans seven to 13 means any information about 
them is adverse, so Cash Converters should remove these loans entirely from Mr Hs credit 
file. If Cash Converters sold the loan it should ask the debt purchaser to do the same. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash Converters to take off tax from this interest. Cash 
Converters must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Hs complaint. Hardy Finance 
Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 August 2020.
