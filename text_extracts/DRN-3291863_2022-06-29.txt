The complaint
A charity, which Ill refer to as C, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc failed to 
update the mandate for its bank account, then failed to make an international payment.
Mr M, who is a trustee of C, brings the complaint on Cs behalf.
What happened
Mr M told us:
In July 2020 he submitted a change of mandate form to NatWest. This form included 
the addition of a new signatory, a Mr H.
In September 2020 he received confirmation that the mandate request form had 
been received for processing. He did not receive any further correspondence, and so 
he assumed his request had indeed been processed.
In April 2021 Mr H submitted an international payment form to pay a grant to a 
beneficiary outside the UK. That payment was not made. On further enquiry, Mr M 
found this was because the change of mandate form had not been processed 
because NatWest needed further information. Mr H had not been added to the 
mandate.
Later in April 2021, he resubmitted the international payment form signed by two 
different people. Although he understood that both signatories were on the mandate, 
NatWest requested that they provide ID in branch  which they did.
In May 2021 he provided NatWest with the evidence it had requested in order to add 
Mr H to the mandate.
By mid July 2021, NatWest had neither processed the mandate change nor made the 
international payment.
NatWest has since paid £250 to apologise, but he and his fellow trustees dont think 
that is enough to compensate C for the inconvenience and reputational damage it 
suffered.
The trustees have now opened an account for C with an alternative bank. That 
means they no longer require NatWest to amend the mandate or make the 
international payment. However, they still think NatWest should increase its 
compensation award.
NatWest told us:
It accepts that it provided very poor service, and it is sorry that C was unable to make 
a payment as a result of the mandate issue. 
It cannot fully explain why the international payment was not made. It has asked the 
staff in the relevant branches for their recollections, but they could not remember 
meeting anyone from C  and simply said that they would have followed NatWests 
standard processes.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but did not uphold it. He thought the 
payment NatWest has already made was fair and reasonable compensation for the mandate 
issues. He didnt think there was sufficient evidence to show that NatWest had done 
anything wrong in respect of the international payment, and so he didnt recommend 
additional compensation.
Mr M did not accept our investigators conclusions, and asked for the matter to be referred to 
an ombudsman. He said the £250 payment related to NatWests delays in processing the 
mandate, and not to the problems with the international payment. He considers that NatWest 
should not be able to deny responsibility for the payment issues by simply saying that it 
doesnt have evidence of events that did in fact take place. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware that C has had previous difficulties with the mandate for its bank account, and that 
Mr M exchanged correspondence with our service in 2015 and 2016 in an attempt to resolve 
those previous difficulties. But Im only looking here at the problems C had after Mr M 
submitted the July 2020 change of mandate form.
NatWest accepts that it did not handle the mandate request well, but it has not been able to 
tell us precisely why the international payments did not go through. 
At one point NatWest appeared to link payment issues with the mandate issues. I can see 
that its final response, issued in September 2021, said:
I am sorry that we provided a poor level of service and that we did not action your 
mandate request in 2015 and due to this it delayed you making a payment  I have 
credited your account with £250 for the upset. 
Our investigator was not able to establish why NatWest twice failed make the international 
payment as instructed, but he thought that at least the first failed attempt to make the 
payment was probably related to the mandate issue. 
Mr M and his fellow trustees have provided detailed recollections of their visits to specific 
NatWest branches. I understand that NatWest has no records of those visits, and the staff 
dont remember them. But I dont think NatWests lack of records implies that the visits did 
not take place. I consider it likely that the visits would be significantly more memorable for 
Cs trustees (who didnt visit the bank often) than for the bank staff (for whom customer visits 
are routine). 
It is deeply unsatisfactory that NatWest cannot say exactly what went wrong with the 
international payments. However, I agree with our investigator that the problem is likely to be 
related in some way to NatWests longstanding failure to properly resolve all of the mandate 
issues. Even if I am wrong about that  and if in fact the problems surrounding the international 
payment were entirely unrelated to the mandate issue  then I still think it is likely that 
NatWest is responsible for the delays in making the international payment. I say that 
because I accept the trustees evidence about the bank visits they made, and I think its 
much more likely than not that the trustees did provide NatWest with the identity evidence 
the bank asked for. (That may not have been the identity evidence the bank needed in order 
to make the payment, but if that were the case it would not be the trustees fault.)
On balance, I am therefore satisfied that both failures to make the international payment 
were caused by NatWest. I cant say precisely how NatWest caused the problem, but 
regardless of whether it was a continuation of the mandate issue or a brand new problem, I 
think NatWest rather than the trustees was responsible for it. I have therefore gone on to 
consider the issue of compensation.
I know that the trustees have since chosen to move to another bank, which would inevitably 
have caused some inconvenience. I think their decision was entirely understandable in the 
circumstances, but I cant say that NatWests errors caused the move  and so I dont think it 
would be fair for me to award compensation for the hassle involved in changing banks. 
NatWests errors did cause delays of several months to the international payment, and 
meant that the trustees had to make bank visits that would otherwise have been 
unnecessary. I know the trustees disagree with me, but overall I do think a payment of £250 
represents fair compensation here. Given that NatWest has already made the payment, I do 
not require it to do anything more.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about National Westminster Bank Plc. 
I consider that the compensation payment NatWest has already made is sufficient in the 
circumstances.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask C to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2022.
