K821x#15complaint
Miss H complains that Harvey & Thompson Limited (H&T) lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I attach my provisional decision dated 2 October  2019, which  forms part of this final decision 
and should be read with it. In it I explained why I intended to uphold  Miss Hs complaint in 
part. Both parties had time to provide any further  comments they may have by 
2 November 2019 before I reached a further decision.
H&T has said that it has nothing further  to add. Miss H asked for some clarification on a 
couple of points which have been given to her by email. And she does not agree with my 
provisional findings for the last loan.  Miss H points out that she applied  on line after being  
prompted by H&T to do so. She has said that the loan was approved instantly and so she 
does not think  that proper  checks  were  carried out. 
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
The last loan approved in November 2016 was after a significant  gap in the lending 
relationship and so I think  that H&T was in a position  to consider that circumstances may 
have changed  for Miss H. It was entitled  to rely on the information she provided at the time. 
And looking at the amounts declared to H&T and the loan amount including  the instalment 
repayment amounts,  I do not think that H&T needed  to do more.  
Miss H said that she earned £1,800 net each month  and that her expenses were £860.The 
first instalment was going to be just over £65 followed by a further 14 of the same amount.  
I consider these to have  been proportionate  checks and my view remains the same  for this 
last loan.
So having  reconsidered  the complaint, I see no reason to alter the conclusions I reached  in 
my provisional decision on 2 October  2019 and which  is attached. 
Ref: DRN37686882putting things right  what I am asking H&T to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss H paid on loans approved 8 August 2007 to 
January 2008  and for the loans from 1 November  2008  to March 2014;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year* on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative payment information about the loans approved  between  
8 August 2007 and January 2008 and between  1 November  2008  and 3 March 2009  
from Miss Hs credit  file if they were reported to the credit agencies;
the number  of loans taken from 3 March 2009 to March  2014 means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about these loans (if they were 
reported) from 3 March 2009 to March 2014 should  be removed from Miss Hs credit 
file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires H&T to take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss H 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Hs complaint in part and direct  that 
Harvey & Thompson Limited do as I have  set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 December  2019.

background
Different types of credit advances were extended to Miss H. Some were cash offered to her (less a 
charge) secured  by a cheque which was banked when Miss H was able to repay it. An extension 
meant that a charge was applied and the cheque was banked later.  Others were  personal loans  and 
some were called Sentinel instalment loans. 
A fresh spreadsheet detailing all the credit advances made to Miss H has been sent to us recently  by 
H&T. This relates to the cheque loans.  I have not formulated these  into a table as to accurately  
summarise it would lead me to create a very detailed table. Rather, I have used the dates  of the loans 
and of the lending decisions rather than any individual loan numbers.  
H&T made an offer to cover  the lending period from November 2008 to December 2009.
After that a series of instalment loans  were advanced to Miss H and I have created a brief table for 
these. Not all the details are available. 
There was no gap between  the last cheque loan closed  on 16 December 2009 and the first instalment  
loan taken on the same  day.

* obtained payslip £1,953 net, and obtained bank statements 
H&T has not been  able to provide us details  of many of the loans due to its record retention  and the 
passage of time. H&T has explained to us that it did look at Miss Hs payslip for October  2013 and 
part of its submissions to us show that H&T did obtain copies of her bank statements. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  at the complaint  and his opinion is summarised here:
there are cheque loans advanced before this service had jurisdiction to consider them  pre-
April 2007  and so he commenced reviewing the complaint in relation to the cheque  loans 
from 20 April 2007;
for the loans from 20 April 2007 to 1 January  2008 he did not think  that H&T was wrong to 
lend to Miss H;
there was a 7 month  gap from 21 February 2008 to 23 September  2008 which  would have 
broken the chain of lending and so from 23 September 2008  H&T was able to approach Miss 
Hs applications  as if she were a new customer. And as that application  as for a small amount 
of about £50 for one day then our adjudicator  did not think that loan ought to be upheld either;
Ref: DRN37686884H&Ts offer was for the loans advanced from 1 November 2008 to 16 December  2009, the 
cheque for which was banked  in early January 2010. So our adjudicator did not look into 
those;
from 16 December 2009 Miss H was approved for instalment loans which  varied in length but 
ranged from £600 to £750. At this stage  our adjudicator looked at the pattern of lending and 
whether it was sustainable. He did not think it was and so for the instalment  loans from 16 
December 2009 to 25 November 2013 he thought that H&T should  put things right for Miss H 
for each  of those; 
there was a significant gap from repaying one loan on 18 March 2014 and taking  the last 
instalment loan on 24 November  2016. So our adjudicator thought that the gap in lending  
would have  led to it being reasonable for H&T to treat Miss Hs application as a fresh  
customer. And he did not think that H&Ts approval  in November 2016 was wrong and so 
H&T need  not to put things right for that one.
H&T did not agree  and so the complaint remains  unresolved. It has been passed to me for a decision.
my provisional  findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  I consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general  approach to 
complaints about high cost and short-term lending  - including all of the relevant  rules, guidance and 
good industry practice - on our website. 
From April 2007 onwards H&T was regulated by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and was required  to 
lend responsibly. The OFT provided some  clarity on what that meant in 
January 2008 in its General guidance for licensees and applicants on fitness and requirements  
document  which made it clear it considered irresponsible lending  to be contrary  to the provisions  of 
section 25(2B) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
The document  also said that, lenders  should always take reasonable  care in making  loans or 
advancing lines of credit and should take full account of the interests  of consumers  in doing so. They  
should undertake proper and appropriate checks on the potential borrower's creditworthiness  and 
ability to repay  the loan and to meet  the terms of the agreement. The checks  should  be proportionate,  
taking account of the type of agreement, the amounts involved,  the nature  of the lender's relationship 
with the consumer, and the degree of risk to the consumer.
Ive kept in mind  that this document  was published some nine months after H&T became regulated by 
the OFT.  But at the same  time, I consider that it broadly set out what  was already expected of a 
licensed consumer credit  provider. So in deciding whats fair and reasonable  in the circumstances of 
this complaint, Ive taken  into account whether H&T took reasonable care when advancing credit to 
Miss H and whether or not it took full account  of her interests in doing  so.
And it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower 
will not be able to make their repayments comfortably if they need to borrow further in order to do that.
H&T needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it did not lend irresponsibly.  In practice this 
means that it should have carried out reasonable checks to make sure Miss H could repay the loans 
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that H&T should fairly and reasonably have  done more to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
Ref: DRN37686885the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
In its submissions to us, H&T highlights  its approach when looking to see whether  a consumer could 
afford or repay the loans.  H&T said: 
We therefore believe the checks completed were proportionate to the risk posed by the customer.  
Whereas I think that the correct approach  was to carry out checks designed  to identify the risk to the 
consumer of having the loan. And in my view this sentence  above demonstrates to me that H&T 
approached its pre-lending checks from the risk to the lender perspective which I think  was limited,  
not the right approach and likely led to inappropriate  and potentially irresponsible lending decisions. 
cheque loans  followed by instalment loans
For the same reason given by our adjudicator, I am not able to consider that part of Miss Hs 
complaint which relate to loans taken before April 2007. 
So I have looked at the cheque loans from 20 April 2007 to January 2008. Then I do think  that the 7 
month gap in lending did break the lending relationship and so a fresh loan chain  commenced  from 
23 September 2008 and was continuous  until March 2014. 
From 16 December  2009 the type of loan offered differed,  in that it changed  from cheque loans to 
instalment loans. But the significance of the repetitive nature of the approvals has an impact on the 
way that we approach  such long periods of lending.  
H&T has conceded  in relation to a large  number of these cheque loans in the middle of that lending 
chain and the dates are: 1 November 2008  to 16 December 2009.  So these are incorporated into the 
decision I have made in relation to this period of lending.  
cheque loans  for the period  20 April 2007 to January 2008. 
During this period almost  all the loans were  for £100 and about half of them were extended. I can see 
from the H&T records that in July 2007 Miss H took several loans,  many of which were  extended to be 
repaid on 7, 8 and 16 August 2007.  Then on those  dates  7, 8 and 16 August 2007  Miss H took 
more cheque loans for similar amounts. And the pattern  continued. So I think that around 1 August 
2007 by which time Miss H had taken the equivalent of 6 loans during April, May,  June and July 2007, 
H&T ought  to have been  alerted to the fact that she had been taking lots of loans many  of which  had 
been extended. It ought  to have checked on Miss Hs ability to deal with the continuous debt.  
I do not think  H&T did that and so I have looked at Miss Hs bank statements  to see what  H&T would 
have seen if it had carried out the more  comprehensive  checks. I think  it would have seen that Miss H 
was permanently overdrawn, had a personal loan for which she was repaying over £200 each month,  
had other  credit to repay and was not managing her money at this stage such  that she continued to 
need the cheque loans.  
So I am planning to uphold these loans from 8 August 2007  to January 2008. 
Ref: DRN37686886loans (both  kinds) from 23 September  2008 to March  2014
The loan taken on 23 September  2008 was for £50 and followed a significant gap in lending. So I 
think that H&T would have been able to rely on Miss Hs declared information. And I think that the 
information Miss H gave  to H&T would have been sufficient  information on which to make a lending 
decision. And I can see that this particular  cheque loan was repaid the next day and so I am not 
planning to uphold that loan.
Following this loan, the cheque  loans  taken from 1 November 2008 to 16 December 2009 have been 
conceded by H&T and an offer made and so I do not plan to review these. They form part of the 
overall picture which I have considered for this provisional decision.  
I have also looked at the overall pattern of H&Ts lending  history with Miss H, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which H&T should reasonably  have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, 
or otherwise  harmful. And so Miss H should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further 
loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Hs case, I think that this point was reached by 3 March 
2009 and I say this because:
up to 3 March 2009 Miss H was provided with a new loan within days  of settling a previous 
one. So H&T ought to have realised  it was more  likely than not Miss H was having  to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss 
Hs indebtedness was increasing in such a way that it was likely she was borrowing to repay 
the borrowing. 
Miss H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed H&T.  The loan taken  on 23 
November 2013 was five years after the first. And it was for a larger amount. Miss H had paid 
large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to H&T over an extended period.
I think  that Miss H lost out because  H&T continued  to provide borrowing from the loan taken  on 3 
March 2009 onwards  because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Miss Hs indebtedness by allowing her to take 
high-cost credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time;
the sheer number of loans  and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications on Miss 
Hs ability  to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the market  for these  high-cost 
loans;
it is very noticeable that after a series of extended cheque loans up to 16 December  2009,  
H&T then settled 7 of those loans on 16 December 2009 (total of £700) and Miss Hs first 
instalment loan was for £600. My view is that this first instalment loan likely was to cover the 
settled debts  of the earlier cheque loans. And as such I think  it was an example  of borrowing 
to repay earlier borrowing. Or it could have been viewed  as a bulk refinancing of those 
outstanding cheque loans. So Miss H was clearly not able to repay  the earlier  loans and the 
instalment loan extended her indebtedness when  I think that it was inappropriate to approve 
her application;
 
additional instalment loans followed and I appreciate that H&T says that the relatively low 
instalment repayments  made them  affordable.  But my view is that by the time these  loans 
were approved for Miss H, she had been  indebted to H&T for several  years and the effect  of 
the instalment loans  was to extend that indebtedness  further. 
So I am planning to uphold the complaint about the loans taken from 3 March  2009 which  falls within  
the concession already given from and H&T (from 1 November 2008)  and H& T should put things 
right on all of them up to March 2014.
Ref: DRN37686887the final loan approved 24 November 2016 
The last loan approved in November 2016 was after a significant gap in the lending relationship and 
so I think  that H&T was in a position to consider that circumstances may have changed  for Miss H. It 
was entitled to rely on the information she gave to it when applying. And looking at the amounts  
declared to H&T and the amount applied  for including  the instalment repayment amounts then I am 
not planning to uphold Miss Hs complaint for that last loan.
