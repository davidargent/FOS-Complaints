The complaint
Mr D complains that NewDay Ltd trading as on his credit file when he was on a payment 
holiday due to COVID.
What happened
Mr D had an Aqua credit card. In March 2020, the balance was £4,600. He was in financial 
difficulty and in December 2019, Aqua agreed a payment plan. They suspended interest 
and agreed to monthly payments of £245 until June 2020. On 14 April 2020, Mr D called 
Aqua to say his income was affected by the COVID pandemic. Aqua agreed a three-month 
payment holiday until 8 August 2020. On 9 August 2020, Aqua sent Mr D a statement 
which showed arrears of £245  to be paid immediately, plus the contractual payment of 
£245 for that month. On 10 August 2020, Mr D called Aqua again and a further payment 
holiday was agreed until 8 October 2020. His statement dated 8 October 2020 then 
showed he had arrears of £490 (two payments of £245)  to be paid immediately - plus a 
contractual payment of £245. On 9 October 2020, Mr D paid in £245 and on 24 October 
2020, he paid in £490  so the account was then paid to date.
Mr D complained that on the call on 14 April 2020, he was not told he would have to make 
a double payment at the end of the payment holiday. He now had a missed payment 
marker on his credit file, which he said was unfair.
Aqua said theyd acted fairly. They couldnt find the call on 14 April 2020, but their letter 
dated the same day  said that if there were any payments due at the time the holiday 
was started, these must be paid as soon as it ends. They also sent Mr D a letter on 29 
July 2020  just before the holiday was due to end  and this said the same thing. And so, 
when Mr D got his statement dated 8 August 2020, it showed that the payment of £245 
(originally due in April 2020) was to be paid, as well as the instalment for that month. But  
because theyd not been able to find the call in question and because there had been a 
delay in logging Mr Ds complaint, they paid compensation of £105. But Aqua didnt agree 
that the marker on Mr Ds credit file should be removed.
Mr D brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said that the letters dated 14 April 2020 
and 29 July 2020 showed that the missed payment of £245 in April 2020 was to be paid in 
August 2020. But, when Mr D called Aqua on 10 August 2020 and it was agreed that he 
could extend his payment holiday - it wouldve been reasonable to backdate this to 8 
August 2020. Our investigator said if that had been done, then the April 2020 payment 
wouldve been covered by the payment holiday and wouldve become due in the statement 
issued on 8 October 2020. And because Mr D paid in £735 in October 2020  the account 
was then paid up to date. She said Aqua should remove any late payment markers from Mr 
Ds credit file - between April 2020 and October 2020. She said the compensation of £105 
paid was reasonable.
Aqua didnt agree, they said their letters were clear  the letters said the April 2020 
payment was due to be made in August 2020. They said their systems didnt allow them to 
backdate payment holidays. They asked that an ombudsman look at the complaint.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
The crux of Mr Ds complaint is that he wasnt told he would have to pay two amounts of
£245 when the payment holiday came to an end. And so  when he didnt make the 
payments in August 2020  his credit file was marked with a missed payment. We havent 
seen his credit file, but we (and Aqua) assume the marker was in respect of the April 2020 
payment.
Its important to understand that  looking at Aquas documents  that they had two types of 
support for customers in financial difficulty at the time.
Firstly, Aqua offered a hardship plan for customers in financial difficulty - whereby they 
agreed reduced monthly payments, with no interest or fees being charged. Payments were 
not marked as missed on a customers credit file, and the account was shown as being up 
to date. But - a payment arrangement was shown on the credit file. Aquas scheme had 
been in place well before the pandemic.
Secondly, in March 2020, The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced guidance to 
lenders in response to the effects on customers of the COVID-19 pandemic. All lenders, 
including Aqua, agreed to put in place payment holidays on many credit agreements, 
including credit cards  to help customers who were affected. Customers could ask for a 
total of two payment holidays, each of up to three months  whereby payments could be 
suspended. Missed payments would not be reported to credit reference agencies, 
although interest would still be debited to the accounts. This support was provided by 
firms up to the end of October 2020. The FCA support scheme wasnt available to 
customers who were already in financial difficulty when the pandemic started.
To be clear  the FCA scheme referred to payment holidays or payment deferrals  and 
its unfortunate that Aqua called their hardship plan a payment holiday  but it was in fact 
a hardship plan (as Ive described). I will refer to the two plans as a hardship plan  
which is what Mr D got; and payment holiday  which was the FCA scheme.
In Mr Ds case  he was already in some financial difficulty when the pandemic started. Aqua 
were already helping him  theyd not been charging interest since December 2019. Aqua 
had agreed to lower monthly payments of £245. I can see that in Mr Ds notes with Aqua that 
he advised Aqua in December 2019 that he was in financial difficulty. He said he then owed 
£13,231 to four creditors, and his income was £2,200 and outgoings were £1,590. So - Aqua 
agreed to a hardship plan of £245 a month until 27 June 2020.
Mr D then called Aqua on 14 April 2020 and I can see that Aqua wrote to him  following 
his call. The letter said Until 8th August 2020your monthly payments are £0. This 
means that you do not need to make any monthly payments until thenIf there were any 
amounts due at the time the payment holiday started, you will have to pay these 
immediately when the payment holiday ends. Its unfortunate that the call isnt available 
to listen to. But the letter says that on 8 August 2020, Mr D would have to make the 
payment that was due in April 2020. And the statement dated 8 April 2020 showed the 
payment of £245 was due to be paid by 27 April 2020.
This was also set out by Aqua in their letter dated 29 July 2020 which said Were writing 
to you to let you know that your payment holiday will end on 8th August 2020 Any 
payments that were already due before your payment holiday began will become 
immediately payable on 8th August 2020.Mr D was then sent the August 2020 statement  dated 9 August 2020. It said that the 
contractual minimum payment of £245 was due, plus arrears of £245 (this being the April 
2020 payment). Mr D then called Aqua  on 10 August 2020 - and requested an 
extension. Aqua agreed to this and confirmed it in a letter dated 11 August 2020. This said 
Until 8th October 2020 your monthly payments are £0. This means that you do not 
need to make any monthly payments until then. The letter went on to say that amounts 
due when the hardship plan started would need to be paid at its end. But  I think that Mr 
D was entitled to think that the letter said that no payments were due to be paid in August 
2020  in other words, the two payments of £245 werent required.
But I think the main point here is that Mr D called Aqua on 10 August 2020  just two days 
after the end of the first hardship plan. The notes of the call on Aquas system say he 
asked to extend the hardship plan. In other words, Mr D wanted it to carry on from the 
old one. And so  I think it wouldve been reasonable for Aqua to date the new plan from 
the expiry of the old one  8 August 2020.
If that had been done, the payment due in April 2020 wouldnt have been due until the end 
of the extended plan  8 October 2020. I dont think the contractual payment of £245 
wouldve been due in August 2020 either  as it wouldve been covered by the extended 
plan. That wouldve meant that in October 2020  the April 2020 payment wouldve been 
due, plus the contractual minimum payment of £245. As it was, Mr D paid a further £735 in 
October 2020.
What this means is that Mr D shouldnt have any missed payment markers on his credit 
file for the period between April 2020 and October 2020. And so  Aqua should delete 
these if theyve been marked.
Ive considered whether Aqua should have agreed that Mr D was given support under the 
FCAs payment holiday scheme, rather than a hardship plan. But the FCAs scheme was 
clear  that if customers were already in difficulty in March 2020, then the scheme didnt 
apply to them. And  because Mr D was on a previous hardship plan, he didnt qualify for 
it. But also  if Mr D had gone onto the FCA scheme  this would have mean that interest 
would have been charged. Mr Ds debt with Aqua was £4,611 in March 2020  the interest 
rate at the time was 37.67% per annum  i.e. about £145 per month. And given that Mr D 
was in financial difficulty  it probably wouldnt have been in his best interest to put him 
onto the FCA scheme.
Ive then gone on to consider Aquas communications to Mr D. Their letters dated 14 April 
2020 and 11 August 2020 both refer to your payment holiday  which I think was confusing 
 as it was generally accepted at the time that such a term referred to the FCA scheme. But 
also  neither letter said that the hardship plan (which is what Mr D got) would be noted on 
his credit file. So  while Aqua were correct to note the hardship plan on Mr Ds credit file, I 
dont think the letters were clear and not misleading. I think they led to some confusion and 
so I think its fair and reasonable for Aqua to pay some compensation for that.
Aqua previously paid compensation of £105  for a delay in dealing with Mr Ds complaint 
(which wasnt part of his complaint to us) and for not being able to trace the call which took 
place in April 2020. And in addition, I think Aqua should pay compensation of £100 for the 
way their letters about the hardship plan were written.
We have had some conflicting information from Aqua  about which support scheme Mr D 
was given, so if I have misinterpreted the information, no doubt they will advise us when
responding to this provisional decision.Responses to the provisional decision
Mr D didnt have any comments. Aqua agreed with the provisional decision and agreed to 
pay additional compensation of £100. So  I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mr D didnt make any comments, and Aqua agreed with the provisional decision, I wont 
be departing from it.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua must:
Remove any missed payment markers between April 2020 to October 2020 from 
Mr Ds credit file.
Pay additional compensation of £100 for the misleading communications in 
the letters sent to Mr D.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2022.
