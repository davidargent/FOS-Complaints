The complaint
Mr H complains about TransferWise Ltds decision to refer his funds to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control (OFAC).
What happened
Mr H opened an account with TransferWise in September 2019. Mr H is a US Citizen whom 
currently resides in another country and regularly visits his mother who lives in Iran.
Mr Hs mother has some health issues and therefore decided to purchase a property in the 
country where Mr H currently resides. Mr Hs mother agreed to use some of her savings 
towards the purchase of the property, and Mr H agreed to pay the rest.
In November 2019, Mr H transferred around â‚¬13,000 in three separate transactions from a 
third-party bank to his account with TransferWise. Mr Hs intention was then to transfer the 
money to an account in the country where Mr H currently resides, and where he and his 
mother planned to purchase the property. 
The day after, TransferWise got in touch with Mr H and asked him for some information 
relating to the payments made. This was mainly due to the word Iran being included in the 
reference. Mr H responded on the same day to explain what the payments were for.
A couple of days later, TransferWise explained that they were carrying out a review on the 
money and Mr Hs account. TransferWise explained to Mr H that the review was linked to Mr 
Hs US nationality and the involvement of transferring money from a country subject to 
sanctions  Iran. 
Mr H wasnt happy with TransferWises actions  so he made a complaint. TransferWise 
responded and included notification of deactivation for Mr Hs TransferWise account. They 
deactivated it on 14 November 2019.
TransferWise issued their final response to Mr Hs complaint on 25 November 2019. The 
letter explained that due to Mr Hs nationality, TransferWise had referred the transfers to 
OFAC. And Mr H would need to apply for an OFAC licence to retrieve his money.
Mr H was unhappy. He doesnt believe TransferWise are in OFACs jurisdiction and 
therefore doesnt agree his money should have been referred to them. He referred his 
complaint to our service and complained specifically about TransferWises actions when 
reviewing and blocking his account and referring the transfers to OFAC. Mr H also said he 
felt TransferWise were discriminating against him.
The investigator who considered Mr Hs complaint didnt uphold it. In summary she was 
satisfied that TransferWise were entitled to refer the transfers to OFAC and didnt think 
theyd done anything wrong. She further explained that TransferWise were entitled to block 
Mr Hs account under the Terms and Conditions of the account  and said that TransferWise 
werent obliged to explain their reasons for reviewing an account at any time. The 
investigator also concluded that she hadnt seen any evidence of discrimination and 
signposted Mr H to the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioners 
website as he felt his rights had been violated.
Mr H didnt agree and included a number of submissions as a response to the investigators 
view. Mr H asked for an ombudsman to review things  so it has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive noted that Mr H has made a number of quite detailed submissions and also sought 
answers to his questions about the nature of TransferWises investigations and jurisdiction. 
Like the investigator, Ive considered all of these, but I dont believe its necessary to address 
each and every point that Mr H has made in order to meet my statutory duty to determine his 
complaint. Im required to do that with minimum formality, and so Ill address the issues that I 
consider to be the most important. I do stress however that Ive considered everything that 
Mr H and TransferWise have said before reaching my decision.
I would add too that our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat 
evidence from banks as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it contains 
information about other customers, security information or commercially sensitive 
information. Some of the information TransferWise has provided is information that we 
considered should be kept confidential.
Were TransferWise entitled to review, block and deactivate Mr Hs account?
TransferWise are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal 
and regulatory obligations. Based on what Ive seen, Im satisfied TransferWise were acting 
in line with these obligations when reviewing, blocking and subsequently deactivating, Mr Hs 
account.
TransferWise are required to regularly review the relationships they hold with their 
customers and its often appropriate for certain transactions to be reviewed. In Mr Hs case, 
a payment he made was flagged due to the links with a sanctioned country. And therefore, it 
would have been necessary for TransferWise to review the transactions linked to this 
sanction further. So, Im pleased to see they decided to carry out a review on Mr Hs 
account. 
The investigator helpfully referred Mr H to the relevant Terms and Conditions TransferWise 
relied on when blocking the account during their review. 
The Terms state;
25.2 We may suspend or close your TransferWise Account without notice in certain 
circumstances. We may at any time suspend or close your TransferWise Account 
and/or end this Agreement without notice if:
(a) you breach any provision of this Agreement or documents referred to in this 
Agreement;
(b) we are requested or directed to do so by any competent court of 
law, government authority, public agency, or law enforcement agency;(c) we have reason to believe you are in breach of any applicable law or regulation; 
or
(d) we have reason to believe you are involved in any fraudulent activity, money
laundering, terrorism financing or other criminal or illegal activity.
I appreciate Mr H doesnt agree that the Terms allow TransferWise to take the action they 
did. But I disagree. I think TransferWise were entitled to block Mr Hs account due to the 
links with a sanctioned country based on the Terms above. And therefore, Im not going to 
ask them to do anything to put things right.
Mr H hasnt complained specifically about TransferWise deactivating his account  just their 
actions surrounding it and what led to the deactivation. However, I feel it important to 
comment that TransferWise can choose who they do business with. The same way if Mr H 
decided to move his account elsewhere, he wouldnt need to tell TransferWise the reasons 
why. Therefore, Im satisfied with TransferWises actions when deactivating Mr Hs account.
The referral to OFAC
Mr H has made large reference to the reasons why he doesnt believe TransferWise are 
entitled to refer the transactions in question to OFAC. In essence, Mr H doesnt believe 
TransferWise are in OFACs jurisdiction. He believes the European Union (EU) sanctions 
hold no relevance to the US sanctions  and therefore TransferWise have acted 
inappropriately as theyre based in the EU rather than the US. I recognise how strongly Mr H 
feels about this  but I cant fairly agree with him.
Ive considered OFACs jurisdiction and while I recognise that TransferWise and the third-
party bank where the money was initially transferred from are in the EU, that doesnt 
automatically remove them from any sanctions which are relevant to OFAC. Mr H is a US 
Citizen and therefore, regardless of where Mr H resides, or what banks he uses to make 
transfers, he is subject to US Sanctions based on his nationality.
Taking this into account, alongside the full circumstances of the complaint, I find that 
TransferWise have been reasonable and appropriate in their actions. I say this due to the 
conditions of the account, the constraints that are in place by OFAC and the obligations of 
TransferWise as a regulated business.
Discrimination
Mr H has referred to discrimination  but I havent seen any evidence that TransferWise 
have discriminated against him. I note the actions of TransferWise are due to Mr Hs 
nationality, so Ive thought very carefully about this point. However, Im satisfied that the 
actions of TransferWise were to comply with their regulatory obligations when handling 
money transfers. So, while I recognise Mr H is being held accountable due to his nationality, 
I dont consider it to be for reasons of a discriminatory nature. And therefore, I cant agree 
with him on this point.
Retrieving the money  OFAC licence
TransferWise making a report to OFAC would mean that Mr Hs money isnt accessible 
without applying for a licence with OFAC directly. TransferWise, or anybody else, wouldnt 
be required to do this on Mr Hs behalf. Mr H has to apply for the licence directly. 
Ive considered Mr Hs comments regarding the difficulty he faced in trying to obtain a 
licence. Mr H has explained that he needs to obtain a licence from the EU before he can contact OFAC. Mr H has applied for a particular licence which he believes will take a couple 
of years to come through. There are certain hurdles to get over when a US citizen, like Mr H, 
is trying to send or receive funds to certain countries and I dont doubt this is a difficult time 
for him. Mr H has explained that the money being held is for the purchase of a property so 
his mother can be closer to him, and to be able to help with his mothers medical situation. 
Im really sorry I cant help Mr H in the way hed like me to  especially due to the 
circumstances surrounding why Mr H needs the money being held. But for me to hold 
TransferWise responsible, Id need to be satisfied theyve acted inappropriately. And for the 
reasons Ive explained, I dont think they have.  
Overall
In summary, Mr H is a US citizen and made transfers which involve a country subject to 
sanctions. As Mr H is a US citizen, TransferWise were correct in referring the transfers to 
OFAC for review. As the referral has been made, Mr H is required to apply for an OFAC 
licence to retrieve his funds. I recognise the added pressure and inconvenience this puts on 
Mr H, but its not the fault of TransferWise. And because of that, Im not going to ask them to 
do anything.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 June 2021.
