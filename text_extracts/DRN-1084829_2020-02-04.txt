The complaint
Miss P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) gave her misleading 
information on a number of occasions, which meant she was unable to access her mobile 
banking app over a period of several days. 
What happened
Miss P holds a bank account with NatWest which she accesses online via her mobile phone.
In June 2019 Miss P updated the mobile number she held with NatWest. NatWests security 
process states that when a mobile phone number is updated, full access to the mobile 
banking app is suspended for 72 hours. 
NatWest said that as a result Miss P wouldnt have full access to her account for 72 hours. 
But she would still be able to check her balance and register travel plans. After 72 hours 
Miss P says she was still unable to access the full account features through her mobile. 
Miss P spoke to NatWest and says that she was given conflicting information about the 
activation code needed to unlock the full account features. 
NatWest say that Miss P failed the online banking re-enrolment 8 times after the 72-hour 
cooling off period. Miss P says she went into branch the next day and was advised to 
uninstall and reinstall the mobile banking app. This meant she was unable to access the full 
account features for another 72-hours. 
Miss P says she was unable to make payments for bills and rent during this period  
although she has said she didnt incur additional charges for making these payments at a 
later date.
Miss P complained to NatWest about the service received. Miss P says she was offered 
compensation of £25 to cover a parking fine and £45 for the trouble and upset caused. But 
she is looking for more compensation for the mis-information, time delays and the stress it 
caused. NatWest say they have no records of the offer Miss P refers to and didnt uphold her 
complaint. 
Miss P didnt accept NatWests response and referred the complaint to our service.
Our investigator looked at everything and didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. She 
said that she couldnt find that NatWest had provided misleading information. And she found 
that Miss P had failed the 2-stage verification after the 72-hour period - which is why she 
couldnt log back into the mobile banking app. 
Miss P disagreed with our investigator. She said that if NatWest had provided the correct 
information in the first place, she wouldnt have reset her mobile banking app again and 
incurred a further 72 hour wait. Miss P asked for the case to be referred to an ombudsman, so the complaint has been 
passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I require NatWest to do 
more to put things right. Ill explain why. 
After looking at everything, I wrote to both parties and said that I thought NatWest had 
caused Miss P some inconvenience. I said that in order to resolve things, NatWest should 
pay Miss P £50 for the inconvenience caused. I asked both parties to respond with any 
comments. Neither party responded so I will set out my findings below.
After Miss P updated her mobile phone number, NatWests internal process document says 
Miss P should have been able to regain full access to her mobile banking app after 72 hours. 
NatWest has provided evidence of Miss Ps failed log in attempts which happened more than 
72 hours after she updated her phone number. I can see from the screenshots provided that 
Miss P wasnt able to pass the 2-stage verification process. 
Ive also seen NatWests internal guidance which states that consumers should receive a 6-
digit access code which they can input after the 72 hours has passed. NatWests contact 
notes from this time show Miss P called NatWest and spoke to one of its advisors about the 
activation code. The notes say she was advised the activation code was 10 digits and not 6.
NatWest havent been able to provide a copy of this call, so I am unable to hear what was 
discussed directly with Miss P. But the notes indicate that she was given some conflicting 
information about the access code needed to unlock the full features of the mobile banking 
app.
It seems that a further conversation was had in branch the following day based on what Miss 
P has said. NatWest has confirmed that her mobile banking app was uninstalled and 
reinstalled on this date, and this triggered the 72-hours cooling off period again. 
Based on the evidence I have NatWests advisor didnt follow its own internal process 
regarding the 6-digit activation code. This likely led to further confusion for Miss P, and in 
part led to her making the decision to uninstall and reinstall her mobile banking app, leading 
to a further 72 hours without full access.  
While I appreciate any possible mis-information and the inability of Miss P to access her 
mobile banking app would have been frustrating for her, she has confirmed that she didnt 
lose out financially over this period and was able to make payments once access had been 
regained. 
As such I think an award should be made in recognition of the mis-information and the 
added frustrations that this caused Miss P. Based on what Ive seen and the impact to    
Miss P here, I think that NatWest should pay £50 compensation for the inconvenience 
caused.
 
 
 My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and require National Westminster Bank Plc to 
pay Miss P £50 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 March 2020.
