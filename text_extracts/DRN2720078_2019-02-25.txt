K820x#14complaint
Mrs J has complained about a lifetime  mortgage with Aviva  Equity  Release UK Limited.  In 
particular, Mrs J is unhappy  that, now she wants to move to another home, she will have to 
pay an early repayment  charge (ERC). Mrs J says that this wasnt made clear at the time the 
mortgage was taken out in 2007, and that the amount of the ERC  is excessive.
The complaint has been brought on Mrs Js behalf  by her son, Mr J.
background
On 1 September 2008 Mrs J and her husband (who I am sorry to note passed away  in 2012) 
took out an equity release mortgage with Aviva. They borrowed £235,000, but there  was an 
agreed reserve for of £365,000, which would be available until 1 September 2018. 
If the mortgage was redeemed  for any reason other than the borrower needing  full-time  
nursing care or the death of the last surviving borrower,  an ERC would be payable. The 
mortgage offer showed how this would be calculated, against Gilt yields.  The mortgage 
terms and conditions allowed the mortgage  to be transferred onto a new property, subject to 
meeting Avivas criteria.
Prior to taking out the mortgage Mrs J and her husband were given independent legal advice 
about it by their own solicitor. Before  the money was released,  the solicitor  was required to 
confirm to Aviva that the way the mortgage operated,  its terms and conditions  (including the 
ERC) had been  fully explained.
There were several further  drawdowns,  as follows:
1 October 2008 £20,000
4 December 2008 £30,000
26 February 2009 £30,000
21 April 2009 £35,000
14 July 2009 £25,000
27 October 2009 £25,000
22 December 2009 £25,000
1 April 2010 £25,000
23 June 2010 £25,000
17 December 2010 £25,000
23 February 2011 £25,000
27 May 2011 £50,000
In April 2017 Mr J wrote to Aviva. He explained that Mrs J wanted to move.  Mr J anticipated 
that the property  was worth in excess of £3 million.  He was aware of the mortgage to Aviva  
but said he didnt  understand  how it worked. He thought his parents wouldnt have 
understood this either. Mr J expressed surprised at the ERC, which he described as an 
exorbitant amount!
Mr J asked Aviva to provide details  of how much would be owed if there  was no rollover  of 
the mortgage onto a new property, if a new property was purchased  for £2 million with a full 
rollover of the mortgage or if a new property was purchased for £1.5 million and the 
mortgage reduced to a residual balance of £250,000.
Ref: DRN27200782Aviva replied, with examples of the amount of loan it would agree to, details of the ERC on 
full redemption (as at 19 April 2017) and a moving home guide which  contained more 
detailed information  about moving  the mortgage  to a new property.  On the first page of the 
moving home guide, in bold type,  it says: Please remember  the purchase of your  new 
property and the sale of your current property  must take place  on the same day. 
Otherwise there will be no property for us to secure your  mortgage against .
On 2 August  2017 Mr J explained to Aviva  that his mother had received an offer on her 
property from buyers  who wanted  to complete  on 1 September 2017. Mr J said that it was 
unlikely Mrs J would be able to complete  on her new purchased  by that date, as she still 
hadnt found a property  to buy. He asked about  a partial  redemption  with the balance of the 
mortgage being rolled over onto the new property when  Mrs J completed on it. 
On 8 August  2017 Mr J explained to Aviva  that Mrs J would  be completing her purchase  on 
1 October 2017.  Aviva  responded  immediately to explain that if sale and purchase were  not 
simultaneous, the mortgage would have to be redeemed in full.
Mr J complained to Aviva.  He said he had multiple concerns:
mis-sale of the mortgage in 2008 with insufficient independent  advice;
inadequate reminders of the terms of the loan;
failure to highlight the restrictive condition about  simultaneous completion of sale and 
purchase;
Mr J said his mother now had to decide whether to withdraw from the sale of her house, or 
proceed with the sale, which would result  in full repayment of the mortgage, including the 
ERC. Mr J wanted Aviva  to bridge the rollover of the existing mortgage for two months. If 
that wasnt possible, Mrs J would be satisfied with a waiver  of the ERC.
Aviva didnt uphold  the complaint. It also didnt agree to bridge the rollover  or waive  the 
ERC, so Mrs J asked Mr J to complain to us. An investigator considered the complaint, but 
he didnt think Aviva had done anything wrong.
Mr J asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint. He thought  the investigators 
conclusions were one-sided. He said that Aviva had suggested in its original documentation  
and later correspondence that the mortgage  was flexible  and could be transferred onto 
another property.  But in reality this wasnt the case when  Mrs J needed to sell her home.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im afraid I have 
disappointing news for Mrs J. Im not upholding her complaint.
Equity release  mortgages are designed for elderly customers. When they were first launched 
to the market lenders recognised the potential for family members to complain, years  later,  
that the mortgage was mis-sold.  That is why the industry trade  association  for equity release 
mortgages (known as Safe Home Income Plans  (SHIP) in 2008, but known since 2012 as 
the Equity Release Council) made  sure that businesses offering equity release mortgages  
complied with stringent  selling standards. 
Ref: DRN27200783Mrs J and her late husband were given advice not only by Aviva but by their own 
independent solicitor too before they took out the mortgage. The documentation from Aviva 
at the time explained the nature and effect  of this type of mortgage,  and provides  a worked 
example of the potential ERC.  Mrs J and her husband also confirmed theyd discussed the 
mortgage with family  members. All of this was in line with SHIP selling standards.
Im also satisfied that Aviva provided  sufficient information with each cash  drawdown  of the 
estimated impact of this on the overall borrowing. Mrs J will also have received annual 
statements for the account.
In the circumstances, Im satisfied the mortgage  wasnt mis-sold, and that Aviva provided  
adequate information about  the account   from the initial  drawdown  of the original mortgage 
in September  2008 and with each  subsequent  drawdown.
I disagree with Mr J that the mortgage is inflexible. Although its intended  to run until the last 
remaining borrower has died or gone  into nursing care, the mortgage can be transferred, in 
whole or in part, onto a new property  outside of those circumstances  subject to meeting 
Avivas criteria. 
In April 2019 Mrs J was provided with details of those  criteria, including  the requirement that 
sale and purchase  had to be simultaneous. As I said above, it was in bold type on the first 
page of the moving home guide. Given this, I am at a loss to see why Mr J considers Aviva 
failed to draw this to Mrs Js attention.
 
So Im satisfied that Mrs J was told by Aviva  four months before  she accepted an offer on 
her property that shed  need to complete on her sale and purchase simultaneously  in order 
to avoid paying the full ERC. In the circumstances, Aviva is entitled to ask for full repayment 
of the mortgage,  including the ERC, as per its terms and conditions.
my final decision
I know Mrs J will be disappointed,  but my decision is that Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 March  2019.
