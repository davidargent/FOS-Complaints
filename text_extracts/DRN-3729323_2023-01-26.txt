The complaint
Ms G and Mr M complain that First Holiday Finance Limited has rejected the claims that 
theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Ms G and Mr M entered into a trial membership agreement in February 2009 for the right to 
reserve some holiday club weeks. The price of the trial membership was £3,595, they made 
a payment of £350 and entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with First Holiday Finance 
to pay the remaining £3,245. First Holiday Finance says that the loan was repaid in 
November 2011. 
Ms G and Mr M contacted First Holiday Finance in January 2021 and asked for information 
about the credit intermediary. First Holiday Finance said that all sales companies within the 
holiday companys group held the relevant Office of Fair Trading licences when brokering 
finance. 
Ms G and Mr Ms representative then made a complaint to this service in May 2021 about a 
number of issues, including that the holiday company wasnt authorised to arrange the loan, 
the membership had been misrepresented to Ms G and Mr M, no credit checks were carried 
out and the interest rate was high. It also referred to an overseas court judgment which 
commented on the unlawful structure of the group of companies which included the holiday 
company and the administration of one of those companies. This service forwarded the 
complaint to First Holiday Finance and it issued a detailed response to that complaint in 
which it set out the reasons that it considered that it shouldnt be upheld.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Ms G and Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. She 
considered their claims under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act but thought 
that First Holiday Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of the claims to turn them down. 
She also said that she hadnt seen any persuasive evidence to show that the loan was 
unaffordable for Ms G and Mr M.
Ms G and Mr Ms representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It has responded in detail and has provided further 
comments about the authorisation of the credit broker and the assessment of Ms G and 
Mr Ms credit worthiness and it says that the time limit for their claim is postponed under 
section 32 of the Limitation Act 1980.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Ms G and Mr Ms complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Ms G and Mr Ms complaint is that First Holiday Finance turned down the claims that 
theyd made to it and I accept that they referred their complaint to our service within 
six years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies 
to their claims;
Ms G and Mr Ms claims are made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not 
determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be 
able to do that - Im considering whether or not First Holiday Finances response to 
those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Ms G and Mr Ms claim under section 75 is that the trial membership was 
misrepresented to them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to them - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, First 
Holiday Finance would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was 
brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would 
be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Ms G and Mr M could have made a claim to the holiday company or 
First Holiday Finance about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into 
buying the trial membership in February 2009 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been incurred 
as that was when they also entered into the loan agreement with First Holiday 
Finance;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or First Holiday Finance  but a claim wasnt made under section 75 until 
May 2021, more than twelve years later which was outside of the time limits set out in 
the Limitation Act so I consider that their claim under section 75 is now time-barred;
Ms G and Mr Ms representative says that Ms G and Mr M only became aware that 
they could make a misrepresentation claim to First Holiday Finance after they took 
advice from it in 2019  but when they had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt 
assist them for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under 
some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at 
the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections 
are applicable to Ms G and Mr Ms claims;
Ms G and Mr Ms representative says that the time limits are postponed under 
section 32 - section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of 
action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt 
begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable 
diligence have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time 
amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
I dont consider that Ms G and Mr M have set out what the false statements of fact 
were that they say could amount to deliberate concealment and Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a deliberate concealment of 
any relevant information in these circumstances - I consider that many of the things 
that Ms G and Mr M say werent right ought reasonably to have been known to them 
at the time of the sale - so I dont consider that section 32 is applicable in these 
circumstances; 
Ms G and Mr Ms representative says that there was an unfair relationship between 
Ms G and Mr M and First Holiday Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, 
amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under 
a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the 
debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Ive not seen a copy of the loan agreement but First Holiday Finance says that the 
loan ended in November 2011 so Ms G and Mr M would have had six years from 
then to bring a claim against either the holiday company or First Holiday Finance  
but a claim under section 140A wasnt made until May 2021, more than nine years 
later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider 
that their claim under section 140A is now also time-barred; 
Ms G and Mr Ms representative has raised issues about the holiday companys 
authorisation to act as a credit broker  but First Holiday Finance has identified the 
credit intermediary and has provided information about its Office of Fair Trading 
licence  and Im not persuaded that Ms G and Mr Ms representative has provided 
enough evidence to show that the holiday company acted as an unauthorised broker 
in arranging the loan to Ms G and Mr M;
Ms G and Mr Ms representative has referred to an overseas court judgment which 
commented on the unlawful structure of a group of companies which included the 
holiday company  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
the structure of those companies was unlawful and I consider that any such claim 
would now also be time-barred;
Ms G and Mr Ms representative says that the credit intermediary has gone into 
administration  but Ive seen no evidence to show that that has impacted the holiday 
companys ability to fulfil the terms of the trial membership agreement and First 
Holiday Finance says that Ms G and Mr M traded in their trial membership on their 
first holiday when they upgraded to a full holiday club membership at a cost of 
£18,800 that they funded themselves;
Ms G and Mr Ms representative says that no credit checks were carried out by First 
Holiday Finance before the loan was made to Ms G and Mr M  but First Holiday 
Finance says that it carried out standard underwriting procedures based on the 
information supplied by them in order to ensure that the loan was affordable  it says 
that information about a joint annual income of £88,000, with annual outgoings of 
£8,700, was provided which satisfied its criteria for monthly repayments of £105.22;
First Holiday Finance also says that Ms G and Mr M were protected by the statutory 
14 day withdrawal period in which to cancel the loan;it also says that the loan was repaid in November 2011 and that Ms G and Mr M 
have purchased other club memberships that they funded themselves and Ive seen 
no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for them at the time that it was 
made to them or that theyve experienced any financial difficulties since then;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms G and Mr M asked First Holiday Finance for 
any information about its credit checks before May 2021  as the loan was made 
available to them in February 2009 I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
them to have raised any concerns about the credit checks before then and I consider 
it to be more likely than not that any complaint about the credit checks or the 
affordability of the loan would now be time-barred;
Ms G and Mr Ms representative says that the high interest rate that Ms G and Mr M 
were expected to pay is also an indication of an unfair relationship  but Ms G and Mr 
M signed the loan agreement which would have set out the rate of interest and other 
information about the loan and they accepted the loan and repaid it two and a half 
years later  so Im not persuaded that the interest rate that was payable indicates 
that there was an unfair relationship between Ms G and Mr M and First Holiday 
Finance;
Ms G and Mr Ms representative has referred to a decision made by this service 
concerning the marketing practices of the holiday company but this service considers 
each complaint on its individual merits and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that Ms G and Mr M were unduly pressured into buying the trial 
membership or entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company used 
unacceptable commercial practices against them  they didnt complain to First 
Holiday Finance about those issues until after May 2021 and I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect them to have complained to First Holiday Finance about any 
such issues before then;
First Holiday Finance says that the holiday company has confirmed that Ms G and 
Mr M have stopped paying the management fees due under their holiday club 
membership agreement so their membership has been suspended - but between 
February 2009 (when they entered into the trial membership agreement) and the 
suspension of their membership it says that they took 61 separate holidays;
First Holiday Finance issued a substantive response to Ms G and Mr Ms claims in 
July 2021 and I dont consider that the outcome that it reached was unfair or 
unreasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
First Holiday Finance to refund to Ms G and Mr M any of the money that they paid 
under the loan agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action 
in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms G and Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G and Mr M to 
accept or reject my decision before 23 February 2023.
