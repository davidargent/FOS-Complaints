K821x#15complaint
Mrs S complains that Tesco Personal Finance  PLC rejected her claim under Section 75 of 
the Consumer  Credit Act 1974.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy  of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I proposed to uphold Mrs Ds complaint and to 
require Tesco to refund  Mrs D 25 % of the total cost of the holiday.  I invited Mrs D and Tesco 
to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wanted to make  before I finally  
determined the matter.
Mrs D has said she accepts my provisional decision.  Tesco hasnt responded.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs D has indicated that she accepts  my provisional  decision and Tesco  hasnt said 
anything at all. So I see no reason  to reach  different conclusions to those set out in my 
provisional decision. 
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is to uphold  the complaint. Tesco Personal Finance PLC must  refund Mrs D 
25% of the total cost of the holiday.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 June 2020.
