The complaint
Mr S complains about the way that some replacement doors, that he paid for using a fixed 
sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank Limited, were sold to him. Hes being 
represented in his complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr S used a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank that he electronically signed in 
May 2016 to pay for a replacement front door, side panel and garage door. The loan 
agreement said that the order price was £6,535 and Mr S had made an advance payment of 
£2,940 so the amount of credit was £3,595 which he agreed to repay by 120 monthly 
instalments of £65.47. He also signed the suppliers purchase order.
The loan was repaid later in 2016 but Mr Ss representative complained to Shawbrook Bank 
in April 2020 about the way that the replacement doors and the loan agreement were sold to 
Mr S. Shawbrook Bank set out in detail its reasons for rejecting his complaint but Mr S 
wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She considered 
Shawbrook Banks response to Mr Ss claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. She didnt agree that Shawbrook Bank had acted unfairly. Nor did she agree that 
Shawbrook Bank should refund the money paid by Mr S.
Mr Ss representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. His representative says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
there is incorrect information on the credit agreement and the sales contract, Mr S 
wasnt told the truth and had his freedom of choice taken away;
the documentation used by Shawbrook Bank breaches section 61(1) of the 
Consumer Credit Act because its not accurate or in line with the sales contract 
signed by the Mr S;
the supplier was taken to court in June 2016, and convicted in June 2017 of using 
high-pressure sales tactics, and if it had told Mr S the correct information and acted 
honestly he wouldnt have placed the order; and
Shawbrook Bank didnt treat Mr S fairly.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr S used credit provider by Shawbrook Bank to pay for the replacement windows 
and, in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim 
against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ss complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the 
replacement doors and that Shawbrook Banks response to his claim under section 
75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ss claim 
under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr S signed the suppliers purchase order form which showed an order price of 
£7,540 for some replacement doors and an account subsidy of £1,104 which reduced 
the account option price to £6,435 (after a deposit of £100 had been paid);
Mr S also signed a portfolio agreement and subsidy analysis in which he agreed to 
participate in a portfolio promotion and which showed that the final agreed price for 
the replacement doors was £6,625 (and Mr S had signed by that amount)  although 
that amount is different to the amount shown on the purchase order - I consider it to 
be clear from the order form and the loan agreement that a price of £6,535 had been 
agreed for the replacement doors;
Mr S electronically signed the fixed sum loan agreement in May 2016 and it set out 
the total cash price of the replacement doors as £6,535 and Mr S made an advance 
payment of £2,940 which reduced the amount of credit to £3,595  it also set out the 
other required information including the interest rate, the total amount payable and 
the number and the amount of the monthly repayments;
Mr Ss representative says that the loan agreement isnt accurate so doesnt comply 
with section 61(1) of the Consumer Credit Act  but Mr S had agreed to pay £6,535 
for the replacement doors, which was the amount included in the loan agreement, 
and Im not persuaded that any errors in the other documents would be enough to 
cause the loan agreement not to comply with section 61(1) or not to have been 
properly executed (but that would be for a court to decide);
the order form said that the supplier would accept a cancellation of the contract if it 
received notice in writing within 7 days and the loan agreement said that Mr S could 
withdraw from the loan agreement within 14 days  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mr S tried to cancel the order or withdraw from the loan within those 
periods and I consider it to be reasonable to expect that he would have tried to do so 
if we wasnt happy with the way that the replacement doors had been sold to him;
Mr Ss representative has provided a report about some legal proceedings against 
the supplier and it says that the supplier was taken to court in June 2016, and 
convicted in June 2017 of using high-pressure sales tactics - but it hasnt provided a 
copy of the court judgment so Ive not been able to fully consider those proceedings 
 but those legal proceedings arent enough to show that the supplier used those 
high-pressure sales tactics when selling the replacement doors to Mr S and the 
purchase was made in May 2016  before the date that it says the supplier was 
taken to court;
the purchase order included a ten year guarantee from the supplier  but the supplier 
has since stopped trading so Mr S says that he wont have the full benefit of the 
guarantee  but Ive not seen any evidence to show that Mr S has tried to make a 
claim under the guarantee so I dont consider that hes suffered a loss and, if he does 
need to make a claim under the guarantee, he should contact Shawbrook Bank 
under section 75 (and if hes not satisfied with its response he may then be able to 
make a complaint to this service);
Mr Ss representative says that Mr S has had a number of issues with the front door 
and he says that its cracked and isnt fit for purpose  and hes provided a photo showing a crack  but that wasnt included in his complaint to Shawbrook Bank so 
Im unable to consider it as part of this complaint;
Mr S repaid the loan a few months after the replacement doors were installed and Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they were unaffordable for 
him at the time that he entered into the loan agreement;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances  Mr Ss representative has made many detailed 
points in support of Mr Ss complaint  Ive considered all of those points but if I 
havent specifically referred to one of those points its because Ive referred to the 
issues that I feel I need to refer to for me to be able to reach a decision on his 
complaint;
I sympathise with Mr S for the way that he clearly feels about his dealings with the 
supplier, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier; and
I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to his section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for 
me to require it to refund to Mr S any of the money that he paid for the replacement 
doors, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2022.
