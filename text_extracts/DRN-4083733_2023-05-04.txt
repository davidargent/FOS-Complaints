The complaint
Mr J complains that NewDay Lyd trading as Aqua lent to him irresponsibly. 
What happened
Mr J applied for a credit card with Aqua in July 2021. It was approved with an initial credit 
limit of £450. The credit limit was later increased to £1200.
Mr J complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly. NewDay upheld Mr Js complaint in 
relation to the credit limit increase (but not the account opening).
Mr J remained unhappy and complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He said that NewDay had carried out 
reasonable and proportionate checks before opening the account and that the information 
gathered showed that the agreement was likely to be affordable for Mr J.
Mr J didnt agree. He said he understood that NewDay had upheld the part of his complaint 
which related to the credit limit increase but said it wasnt fair that he was having to pay back 
all of the outstanding balance plus interest. Mr J said that NewDay had closed the account 
and that he was paying the minimum amount each month which wasnt reducing the capital 
balance.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay has acknowledged that the credit limit increase wasnt suitable for Mr J. So in this 
decision Ive focussed on whether NewDay acted fairly when the account was opened. 
Our approach to complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set out on our 
website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering Mr Js complaint.
NewDay needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice, this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr J 
could repay the credit in a sustainable manner. Theres no set list of checks that a lender 
has to carry out, but they could include things such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amount, and Mr Js income and expenditure and credit history.
Account opening
NewDay carried out checks before opening the account. It obtained details of Mr Js income 
and outgoings and carried out a credit check. The credit check showed no adverse 
information.
Based on what Ive seen, I think NewDay carried out reasonable and proportionate checks. I 
havent seen anything to suggest that further checks shouldve been carried out.
Ive gone on to consider whether the decision to lend was fair, taking into account the 
information gathered as a result of the checks.
Based on what Ive seen, Im satisfied that the inspection showed that the lending was likely 
to be affordable for Mr J. Mr J had sufficient disposable income each month to make the 
minimum repayments on the credit card based on full utilisation of the credit limit of £450. 
There was nothing in the information obtained to suggest that Mr J was struggling financially 
at the time he applied for the credit card.
Im therefore satisfied that the decision to open the credit card account was fair. I wont be 
asking NewDay to do anything further.
Mr J has said that hes being charged interest on the outstanding balance of £1200. This 
service asked NewDay to clarify whether it was charging interest on balances over £450 but 
didnt receive a response.
For the avoidance of doubt, and because NewDay has upheld the complaint about the credit 
limit increase, NewDay shouldnt be charging interest on any balances over £450.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 June 2023.
