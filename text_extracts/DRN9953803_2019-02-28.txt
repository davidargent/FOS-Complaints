K820x#14complaint
Mrs W says Lloyds Bank Plc (Lloyds) mis-sold her a Silver  packaged  bank account. Shes 
used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to make her complaint.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  into Mrs Ws complaint and didnt think  Lloyds had
mis-sold the account.  The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mrs Ws complaint. 
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Mrs Ws complaint.  Id like 
to explain the reasons  for my decision.  I think Mrs W chose to take the account. She 
appears to have had identifiable needs  for the main  benefits on the Silver account  and she 
couldve used some of them such as the travel  insurance and mobile phone insurance  too. 
So overall I dont  think that clearer information wouldve changed Mrs Ws decision to accept 
what looks to have  been a fair recommendation made by Lloyds. And, in these 
circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mrs Ws complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs W to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 March 2019.
