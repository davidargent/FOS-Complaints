The complaint
Mr and Mrs C are unhappy with the delays caused by Bank of Scotland (trading as Halifax)
in processing their Clearing House Payments System (CHAPS) payment.
What happened
On 11 November 2020, Mr and Mrs C asked Halifax to make a CHAPS payment of
£650,000 for a house purchase. They payment was to be made to their foreign exchange
broker, who would then process an international transfer to Mr and Mrs Cs notary abroad.
Unfortunately, Halifax didnt process the payment on the same day. Mr and Mrs C said they
spent the day checking their account and making numerous calls to their foreign exchange
broker. The next morning, they saw that the funds hadnt yet left their account.
Mr and Mrs C spent several hours on 12 November 2020, unsuccessfully trying to contact
the branch with long waiting times. They explained Halifaxs customer service department
werent able to help them with processing the CHAPS payment, nor could they get in touch
with the branch.
After close of business on 12 November 2020, Halifax processed the payment and the funds
left Mr and Mrs Cs account. But they say Halifax didnt update them and they only
discovered this by checking their account the following day.
Mr and Mrs C explained it was important for the payment to be made on 11 November 2020
as they needed to get the funds to their notary in time, but also due to the exchange rate.
And the delays with Halifax processing the payment caused them a financial loss as the
exchange rate had dropped significantly when the funds were available to complete the
international transfer on 13 November 2020.
Halifax initially said that they couldnt see why the payment wasnt processed and asked Mr
and Mrs C to contact the receiving bank in case the error was at their end. After further
discussion with Mr and Mrs C, they apologised and said they hadnt followed the correct
process to make the CHAPS payment before the cut off. They offered to pay £500
compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused to Mr and Mrs C.
Unhappy with how Halifax handled their CHAPS payment and complaint, Mr and Mrs C
referred the matter to our service. Our investigator said that Halifax had made an error in
failing to process the payment on time. She said that Halifax couldnt reasonably have
foreseen that Mr and Mrs C wouldve been affected by changes to the exchange rates. She
felt £500 compensation was a fair amount.
Mr and Mrs C disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint.
My provisional decision 
I issued a provisional decision on 18 July 2022. My findings were as follows:
CHAPS is a system that allows large transfers between bank accounts on the same 
day. The terms and conditions say that the CHAPS payment will be processed on the 
day its requested, providing Halifax receives the request by 4:25pm. Mr and Mrs Cs 
CHAPS request was processed at around 10:35am on 11 November 2020. So, I 
think Mr and Mrs C had a reasonable expectation that the funds wouldve been in 
their foreign exchange brokers account the same day.
Halifax have already admitted that they failed to follow the correct process to 
complete the CHAPS payment before the cut off. I can see they rectified their error 
by processing the payment again on the next working day on 12 November 2020. 
The payment was successful, and the bank statement shows the funds left Mr and 
Mrs Cs account.
Mr and Mrs C say that they lost a significant amount of money due to the changes in 
the exchange rate as a result of Halifaxs delay in processing the CHAPS payment. 
They explained the payment wasnt credited in the foreign exchange brokers account 
until after close of business on 12 November 2020, which meant they couldnt make 
the international transfer to their notary abroad until 13 November 2020.
Halifax can be held responsible for financial losses if they were incurred as a direct 
result of their action or inaction, and if the losses were foreseeable.
Although the payment wasnt an international transfer, its arguable that the 
fluctuations in exchange rates were foreseeable by Halifax. I say this because the 
beneficiary of the CHAPS payment was a foreign exchange broker. Also, Halifax 
have a duty to protect Mr and Mrs Cs account. As part of this, Id have expected 
them to ask questions around the purpose of the payment. I think its likely that 
during these discussions, Halifax would reasonably have become aware that Mrs and 
Mrs C were transferring the funds to their foreign exchange broker to send to their 
notary for a property purchase abroad.
So, Halifax shouldve foreseen that any delays in actioning Mr and Mrs Cs payment 
could potentially result in a financial loss due to the changes in exchange rates.
While I agree Halifax can be held responsible, I need to be satisfied that there was a
financial loss.
Mr and Mrs C have provided us with a foreign exchange chart. However, this doesnt 
show the date it relates to. Its also not specific to the exchange rates Mr and Mrs C 
wouldve got through their foreign exchange broker, which is usually slightly less.
The transaction details provided to us by Mr and Mrs C show that the payment was 
sent by their foreign exchange broker on 16 November 2020 rather than 13 
November 2020. This shows that there was no certainty that the payment wouldve 
been processed by the foreign exchange broker at the earliest available opportunity. 
So, I dont think I can fairly hold Halifax responsible for the changes to the exchange 
rate.
In any event, Im not satisfied Mr and Mrs C have suffered a financial loss. I say this
because, if there were no issues with the CHAPS payment being processed, the 
payment wasnt guaranteed to be in the foreign exchange brokers account by close 
of business on 11 November 2020, simply that it would be the same day.This means the funds couldve credited the foreign exchange brokers account at any 
time, including after 5pm on 11 November 2020 and Mr and Mrs C were unlikely to 
receive the favourable exchange rate on this date.
Instead, the funds wouldve been available for the foreign exchange broker to 
transfer abroad on 12 November 2020 at the earliest. And the international transfer 
wouldve been processed the next working day which was 13 November 2020.
Ive said that the foreign exchange broker wouldve processed the exchange rate on 
the next working day, based on the fact that they didnt make the international 
transfer on 13 November 2020 even though the funds were available in their account. 
The actual transfer took place the next working day which was 16 November 2020.
This means that the loss Mr and Mrs C suffered would be the difference in exchange 
rates between 13 November 2020 and 16 November 2020. The date the international 
transfer wouldve taken place against when it actually took place.
In the absence of evidence to show the exchange rates Mr and Mrs C wouldve got 
through their foreign exchange broker on 13 November 2020, Ive looked online to 
find the historic exchange rates for Euros. Ive shared the link to the website Ive 
used with all parties to this
complaint.
To ensure fairness, Ive used the average rate for both dates to calculate if Mr and 
Mrs C suffered a financial loss. The average rate on 13 November 2020 was 1.1131 
amounting to €723,515 and the average rate on 16 November 2020 was 1.1142 
amounting to €724,198.
This means there was no financial loss as the rate on 16 November 2020 was more
favourable by around €683, in comparison to the exchange rate Mr and Mrs C 
wouldve received if there was no error on Halifaxs part.
And even if I took the exchange rate Mr and Mrs C told us they wouldve received on 
13 November 2020 which is 1.1084 to calculate if they suffered a financial loss as 
opposed to the average rate, then they still havent lost out. I say this because the 
transaction details show the actual rate Mr and Mrs C received for their international 
transfer on 16 November 2020 was the same at 1.1084.
Since there is no financial loss, Halifax dont need to reimburse Mr and Mrs C. 
However, the delays in processing the CHAPS payment undoubtedly had an impact 
on them. Ive carefully thought about this to decide a fair amount of compensation.
Mr and Mrs C have explained they spent numerous hours on the phone trying to get 
hold of the branch. I can understand the frustration and annoyance they were caused 
as they say they couldnt reach the branch and the customer services department 
werent able to help them. They were also not kept informed about the payment and 
had to keep checking their online banking to see if there had been any progress. 
Buying a house is an already stressful experience and I dont doubt Mr and Mrs C 
when they say they were caused untold worry.
Halifax couldve dealt with Mr and Mrs Cs complaint better. They initially told Mr and 
Mrs C there was probably an issue at the receiving bank which wasnt the case. This 
wouldve added to the distress and inconvenience Mr and Mrs C were caused. 
Halifax also quoted incorrect information in their final response letter. This wouldve 
made Mr and Mrs C feel like their concerns werent taken seriously.Ive taken into account that Halifax rectified their mistake the next working day, so the 
impact on Mr and Mrs C wasnt prolonged. I also consider that Mr and Mrs C couldve 
mitigated the impact on them by planning ahead and making the payment earlier so 
that the funds were with the foreign exchange broker in advance, particularly if the 
exchange rates were so important to them.
Also, the foreign exchange broker didnt make the international transfer as quickly as 
Mr and Mrs C indicated to us. They completed it the working day after the funds were 
available, suggesting that the payment wasnt as urgent.
All things considered, Mr and Mrs C were caused significant inconvenience, distress, 
worry and upset. It has required a lot of effort on their part to sort out. Having taken 
everything into account, I think Halifax did the right thing by apologising to Mr and 
Mrs C. Also, the compensation offered of £500 is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances to recognise the distress and inconvenience they were caused. So, I 
wont be asking them to do anything else to resolve this complaint.
Responses to my provisional decision
Mr and Mrs C responded providing evidence to show that they agreed the exchange rate 
with their foreign exchange broker on 13 November 2020  when the funds were available to 
complete the international transfer. 
Based on this new information, I sent an email to both parties to explain my decision had 
changed. The email setting out my new provisional decision said:
In my provisional decision, I explained that I wasnt satisfied Mr and Mrs C has 
suffered a financial loss. 
Mr and Mrs C have provided evidence to show that they agreed the exchange rate 
with their foreign exchange broker on 13 November 2020  when the funds were 
available to complete the international transfer. 
Although it appears the international transfer was completed on 16 November 2020, 
Mr and Mrs C had already agreed the exchange rate and for the international transfer 
to be completed on 13 November 2020, so any changes to the exchange rate after 
this wouldnt impact their transaction.
In light of this, if there were no issues with the CHAPS payment being processed, 
then the funds wouldve been in the foreign exchange brokers account the same day 
 11 November 2020. The earliest opportunity for Mr and Mrs C to instruct their 
foreign exchange broker to complete the international transfer wouldve have been 
12 November 2020.
I appreciate Mr and Mrs C feel they should be reimbursed for the change in 
exchange rate from 11 November 2020 to 13 November 2020. But as I explained in 
my provisional decision, the CHAPS payment wasnt guaranteed to be in their foreign 
exchange brokers account by close of business on 11 November 2020  simply that 
it would be the same day of the request.
And we cant know for sure when the funds wouldve credited the foreign exchange 
brokers account on 11 November 2020  as it couldve been at any time, including after 5pm. So, I cant say with complete certainty that Mr and Mrs C were likely to 
receive the favourable exchange rate on this date. 
Its more likely, as Ive mentioned above, if the CHAPS payment was processed 
correctly as expected, then earliest opportunity that Mr and Mrs C couldve agreed 
the exchange rate and instructed their foreign exchange broker to complete the 
international transfer was 12 November 2020. 
Based on this, Im satisfied Mr and Mrs C suffered a financial loss as there was a 
fluctuation in exchange rates between 12 November 2020 and 13 November 2020.
As a result, the financial loss suffered by Mr and Mrs C would be the difference in 
exchange rates between 12 November 2020 and 13 November 2020. The date when 
Mr and Mrs C wouldve finalised the international transfer with their foreign exchange 
broker against when they were able to do so.
We havent got evidence of the exchange rate Mr and Mrs C wouldve received on 12 
November 2020. Ive used the same website as I did when issuing my provisional 
decision to look at the historic exchange rates for Euros. All parties to the complaint 
already have been given a link to this website.
Again, to ensure fairness, Ive used the average rate for both dates to calculate Mr 
and Mrs Cs financial loss. The receipt provided by Mr and Mrs C shows that the 
amount they transferred was £580,386.13. 
The average rate on 12 November 2020 was 1.1167 amounting to €648,117.19 and 
the average rate on 13 November 2020 was 1.1131 amounting to €646,027.80. This 
means Mr and Mrs C lost out on €2,089.39 due to the delays in Halifax processing 
their CHAPS payment.
Therefore, to put things right, Halifax should refund Mr and Mrs C £2,333.22. Ive 
arrived at the figure by converting €2,089.39 into Pounds using the average 
exchange rate Ive set out above for 12 November 2020.
Halifax should also add 8% simple interest on this amount from 12 November 2020 
to the date of settlement. 
My findings on the compensation amount of £500 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused to Mr and Mrs C still remain the same. So, Halifax should pay this, if they 
havent done so already.
Following this, Mr and Mrs C responded to explain their international transfer was completed 
in two different transactions. The receipt we had been given previously showed a transfer 
amount of £580,386.13 which is the figure I used to calculate the redress. They provided us 
with the second receipt which showed the transfer amount of £69,613.86 which totalled 
£649,999.99  which is the same amount as the CHAPS payment, less a penny.
Mr and Mrs C also felt that their financial loss should be considered on the actual rate they 
received on 13 November 2020 of 1.1.084. They accepted that the average rate for 12 
November 2020 of 1.1167 should be used which they say results in a loss of €5,395.
I sent a further provisional decision to both parties to make changes to the redress I 
proposed. My email said:In my email of 28 July 2022, I said the receipt provided by Mr and Mrs C showed 
that the amount they transferred was £580,386.13. They have responded to me 
explaining that their international transfer was made in two different transactions. 
One for £580,386.13 and the second for £69,613.86 totalling to £649,999.99  which 
is the same amount as the CHAPS payment, less a penny. They have now provided 
us with the second receipt.
Based on this, the financial loss Mr and Mrs C have suffered needs to be on the 
figure of £649,999.99 rather than £580,386.13.
Mr and Mrs C have accepted the average exchange rate Ive used for 12 November 
2020, but they feel the exchange rate used for the 13 November 2020 should be the 
actual rate they received as shown on their receipt of 1.1084  meaning theyve lost 
€5,395.
Im afraid I disagree. It wouldnt be fair and reasonable to use the average exchange 
rate of 12 November 2020 against the actual exchange rate on 13 November 2020. 
This is because it wouldnt be a balanced way to calculate the financial loss. By using 
the average exchange rate for both dates of 12 November 2020 and 13 November 
2020, it ensures fairness to all parties involved.
And to make the calculations simpler, Ive used the amount of the CHAPS payment 
of £650,000. The average rate on 12 November 2020 was 1.1167 amounting to 
€725,855 and the average rate on 13 November 2020 was 1.1131 amounting to 
€723,515. This means Mr and Mrs C lost out on €2,340 due to the delays in Halifax 
processing their CHAPS payment.
Therefore, to put things right, Halifax should refund Mr and Mrs C £2,613.08. Ive 
arrived at the figure by converting €2,340 into Pounds using the average exchange 
rate Ive set out above for 12 November 2020.
Halifax should also add 8% simple interest on this amount from 12 November 2020 
to the date of settlement. 
My findings on the compensation amount of £500 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused to Mr and Mrs C still remain the same. So, Halifax should pay this, if they 
havent done so already.
Mr and Mrs C responded to say they were disappointed that the actual final rate they 
received wasnt used to determine their full loss. But they were happy to accept my decision.
Halifax said they were happy to accept my recommendations to bring the complaint to a 
close.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Since both parties have accepted my provisional decision, there is nothing further for me to 
consider. Im satisfied with the findings I reached in my provisional decision.
To put things right, Halifax should:Refund Mr and Mrs C £2,613.08
Add 8% simple interest* per annum from 12 November 2020 to the date of settlement
Pay £500 compensation, if they havent already done so
*HM Revenue & Custom requires Halifax to deduct tax from this interest. Halifax must give 
Mr and Mrs C a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off, if they ask for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that Bank of Scotland (trading as Halifax) 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C and Mr C to 
accept or reject my decision before 9 September 2022.
