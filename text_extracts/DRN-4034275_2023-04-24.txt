The complaint
Mrs H complains about the way National Westminster Bank Plc has carried out its business 
profile review of a trust, which I will call M.
Mrs H complains in her capacity as a trustee of M.
What happened
Mrs H told us:
NatWest wrote to her in late February 2022 asking her to update information on the 
business profile for M. She has done her best to provide everything NatWest asked 
for, but the goalposts keep moving. NatWest should have listed all the documents it 
needed at the start, but instead the process continued for many months. NatWest 
continued to ask for documents even after she had provided them. 
Whilst many of the NatWest staff she spoke with were kind, they had little 
understanding of the way a trust like M works. The process would have been easier if 
shed had a single point of contact. 
NatWests letters were threatening, caused her significant stress, and led to a decline 
in her mental health  to the point that she now takes medication. She believes 
NatWests actions amount to harassment and bullying.
She has personally incurred expenses in trying to resolve matters. As an example, 
she has had to drive around collecting various documents and taking those 
documents to professionals to be verified.
NatWest told us:
It has a regulatory duty to ensure that it holds information on people connected to M 
 including people who do not have any control of the day to day running of the trust.
Where possible, it will attempt to verify peoples identity without requiring them to do 
anything. But that is not always possible, particularly (but not exclusively) for people 
who live overseas. In this case it has needed to request documentation in respect of 
both the trust itself and people associated with the trust.
It accepts that it did cause confusion, in that it initially told Mrs H that there was no 
need to worry about providing identity verification evidence for some people that in 
fact it did need to verify.
In addition, it received the trust deed for M in July 2022, but it continued to request 
that same document for some weeks. It has already paid £200 into Ms account to 
apologise for that error.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. She said it was clear NatWests actions 
had caused Mrs H significant stress, but she didnt think it had done anything wrong in 
asking for information. She also thought the letters NatWest had sent used a standard 
format, were sent to all customers in Mrs Hs position, and were not intended to threaten 
Mrs H. 
However, our investigator noted that NatWest had received further information about M in 
November 2022 but had been unable to do anything with it due to IT issues.  Our 
investigator thought NatWest should pay a further £150 for the inconvenience and stress 
caused by its delay in processing that information. 
NatWest accepted our investigators opinion, but Mrs H did not. Briefly, she said:
NatWest continued to bully and harass her right up until March 2023, when she 
finally received an email confirming that the Business Profile was complete.
NatWest should have asked for all the information it needed at once, and should also 
have allowed her to deal with a single person. 
She understands that the Financial Ombudsman Service is unable to interfere with 
NatWests operational processes, but she considers we should still advise it to review 
the way it handles trust accounts.
The offer of a further payment of £150 in compensation is an insult. She has spent 
over 40 hours dealing with this issue, it has impacted her health, and she believes 
further compensation of around £1,500 would be fair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to further disappoint Mrs H, but there is very little I can add to what our investigator 
has already said. NatWest did not handle this matter as well as it should have done, but I 
think the compensation it has offered (of £150 in addition to the £200 it has already paid) 
does represent a fair outcome.
I acknowledge that Mrs H wants NatWests processes to be upgraded so that nobody else 
has to suffer the stress she has been through, but as an ombudsman I do not have the 
power to require NatWest to change its processes more generally. I do not have the powers 
of the regulator, and I can only consider the individual complaint in front of me. Where I think 
a complainant has been treated unfairly, I can order the business to put the matter right for 
that individual complaint only.
Here, I do not criticise any of NatWests requests for information. All banks have 
considerable commercial discretion in the way they choose to comply with their regulatory 
responsibilities, and I see no reason here for me to interfere with NatWests exercise of that 
discretion. I know Mrs H has questioned whether NatWest needs information from her 
parents (who, as settlors of the trust, are not now allowed to have any involvement in it) as 
well as from other family members who have no control over the trusts assets. But I 
consider that NatWest was entitled to ask for the information it did. That means I dont think 
it would be fair for me to award compensation for the difficulties Mrs H experienced in 
obtaining that information.Similarly, I do not criticise NatWest for the tone of its letters. Banks in the UK are strictly 
regulated, and there are situations where a bank like NatWest might be legally required to 
place restrictions on an account. I am sorry that Mrs H found NatWests letters distressing, 
but I consider that it was reasonable for the bank to tell her what the consequences would be 
if it did not receive the information it needed.
I acknowledge that Mrs H would have strongly preferred NatWest to have made all of its 
information requests upfront. But I also acknowledge that NatWest may need to review 
documentation before it can say what else it needs. I dont think it would be realistically 
possible for NatWest to always produce a complete list of necessary documentation before 
beginning its review.
In the main I think NatWest has treated Ms trustees fairly. However, there were some 
unnecessary delays  in particular when it failed to properly process the trust document, and 
when its IT problems prevented it from processing the information it received in November 
2022. NatWest should compensate Ms trustees for those issues.
Putting things right
Having considered all the circumstances, I think a total payment of £350 does represent fair 
compensation for the unnecessary delays NatWest caused. NatWest has already paid £200, 
so it should pay another £150 to put the matter right.
Mrs H is complaining in her capacity as a trustee of M, so payment should be made to Ms 
account. It will then be for the trustees of M to decide how to distribute the payment. 
I know Mrs H will be very unhappy with the outcome of this complaint, but I want to stress 
that my award is only intended to compensate for the consequences of the errors NatWest 
has made. It is not intended to compensate for the inconvenience of having to provide the 
information the bank requested, because I dont think NatWest did anything wrong in asking 
for that information.
My final decision
My final decision is that I order National Westminster Bank Plc to pay the trustees of M an 
additional £150.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask M to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 May 2023.
