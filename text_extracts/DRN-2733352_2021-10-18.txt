The complaint
Mr E complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement with 
PCF Bank Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr E under a conditional sale agreement with PCF Bank that he 
signed in February 2020. He complained to PCF Bank about some issues with the car which 
had started in May 2020  but it said that the fault occurred after the point of sale so it wasnt 
responsible for the repairs. Mr E then paid for the car to be inspected by an independent 
expert in July 2020. The inspection report concluded that there was damage to the wiring 
loom, which was unrelated to rodents, and was mechanical damage caused by the wiring 
loom rubbing against the inlet manifold. The car was repaired under warranty and Mr E 
made a claim to PCF Bank that the car hadnt been of satisfactory quality when it was 
supplied to him. He also made a complaint to this service.
Our investigator thought that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to 
Mr E which was a breach of contract for which PCF, as the supplier of the car, was 
responsible. He said that the car had been repaired which had resolved the issues but he 
thought that compensation was also due to Mr E for the breach of contract. He 
recommended that PCF Bank should: refund monthly repayments of £11,798 for Mr Es loss 
of use of the car; pay him compensation of £300 for the distress and inconvenience caused, 
£394.52 for insurance premiums and £108.49 for road tax while the car was off the road; and 
pay him £2,013.36, plus interest, for the independent inspection.
PCF Bank said that Mr E had paid £195,082.99 in March 2021 to settle the conditional sale 
agreement and that our investigators recommendations would lead to him receiving more 
compensation than the net amount that it had received from him for the car. Our investigator 
considered the settlement and said that it wasnt fair for Mr E to be refunded £11,798 of his 
monthly payments as hed paid less than that under the agreement. He recommended that 
PCF Bank should: refund monthly repayments of £1,951 for Mr Es loss of use of the car; 
pay him compensation of £300 for the distress and inconvenience caused, £394.52 for 
insurance premiums and £108.49 for road tax while the car was off the road; and pay him 
£2,013.36, plus interest, for the independent inspection.
Mr E has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He has responded in 
detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
compensation should be based on the prejudice and financial damage caused to him 
by PCF Banks breach of contract and not a function of whether or not he decided to 
settle the agreement early;
between March and May 2020 he drove a car that had a mechanical issue to the high 
pressure fuel pump which rendered it unsafe and unroadworthy;
between May and August 2020 the car was at a dealership being repaired;
he didnt use the car after that as he was waiting for PCF Bank to respond to his 
claim;
hes suffered inconvenience caused by PCFs breach of contract, has incurred losses 
and legal costs, has spent nearly £50,000 on the car and has spent time dealing with 
his claim; and
PCF Bank (and our investigator) were aware of his intention to sell the car and PCF 
Bank provided a settlement figure so no new information has become available to 
justify a revision in the compensation payable for his loss of use.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
PCF Bank, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr E - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr E was about sixteen months old, had been driven for 
2,500 miles and had a price of £267,500;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the conditional sale agreement and invoice for the car show that Mr E made an 
advance payment of £32,500 for the car and the amount of credit provided to him 
was £235,000 which he agreed to repay by 60 monthly payments of £4,515.53;
I consider it to be clear from the independent experts report and the repair that was 
made under the cars warranty that there was a fault with the car and that its more 
likely than not that the fault was present when the car was supplied to Mr E, so it 
wasnt of satisfactory quality at that time;
I understand that the repair has remedied that fault so I consider that the warranty 
repair was a fair and reasonable response to the issues that Mr E had with the car  
but I consider that it would also be fair and reasonable for PCF Bank to compensate 
him for some of the other losses that hes incurred;
Mr E was able to use the car after it was supplied to him until May 2020  he says 
that the car was unsafe and unroadworthy because of the issues with it  but Im not 
persuaded that hes provided enough evidence to show that his use and enjoyment 
of the car was significantly impacted by the issues with it during that period so Im not 
persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require PCF Bank to pay him 
any compensation for his loss of use and enjoyment of the car for that period;
the car was with a dealer from May 2020 until after it had been repaired so Mr E 
wasnt able to use the car during that time  which I understand to be about 80 days;
Mr E was able to use the car after it had been repaired until he settled the agreement 
in March 2021 and sold the car  he says that he didnt use the car during that period 
as he was waiting for PCF Bank to respond to his claim  but the car had been 
repaired and was available for him to use so I consider that it was his choice not to 
use it and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require PCF 
Bank to pay him any compensation for his loss of use and enjoyment of the car for 
that period; Mr E made an advance payment of £32,500 for the car, he then made eleven 
monthly payments of £4,515.53 to PCF Bank under the agreement and then paid it 
£195,082.99 in March 2021 to settle the agreement early  so hed paid a total of 
£277,253.82 for the car which had a cash price of £267,500;
Mr E had only paid a net amount of £9,753.82 for the 13 months that hed had the car 
and, of that period, I consider that his use and enjoyment of the car had only been 
significantly impacted for about 80 days;
our investigator recommended that PCF Bank should refund £1,951 to Mr E for his of 
loss of use of the car  which is 20% of the net amount of £9,753.82 that hed paid 
for the car  and I consider that to be fair and reasonable in these circumstances;
I can understand Mr Es disappointment that hes not receiving the compensation for 
his loss of use of £11,798 that was initially recommended by our investigator  but I 
have to consider all the facts of a complaint and Im unable to disregard in these 
circumstances the amount of the early settlement that Mr E paid for the car  and, for 
the reasons set out above, a payment of compensation of £11,798 to him would 
mean that he had, in effect, free use of the car for 13 months (other than the 80 days 
that it was with the dealer) and that he would also be receiving £2,062.18 
compensation from PCF Bank for his loss of use of the car  I dont consider that that 
would be fair or reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr E has claimed a refund of his insurance and car tax payments for the time that he 
was unable to use the car  and I find that it would be fair and reasonable for PCF 
Bank to pay him £394.52 and £108.49 to reimburse him for those costs;
Mr E paid £2,013.36 for the independent experts report and our investigator has 
explained why he considers that it was appropriate in these circumstances for Mr E 
to pay that much for a report  I find that it would be fair and reasonable for PCF 
Bank to pay £2,013.36 to Mr E to reimburse him for the cost of that report and I also 
find that it should pay interest on that amount;
Mr E instructed solicitors to make a claim to PCF Bank on his behalf  PCF Bank had 
already said that he could refer his complaint to this service and Im not persuaded 
that it was necessary for him to instruct solicitors to make a claim to PCF Bank or in 
connection with a complaint to this service  so I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable for me to require PCF Bank to reimburse him for any of the solicitors 
costs that hes incurred;
these events have clearly caused Mr E distress and in convenience and hes claimed 
£2,000 compensation  but I consider that the £300 compensation that was 
recommended by our investigator is fair and reasonable compensation in these 
circumstances for the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused and Im not 
persuaded that a higher award of compensation is justified; and
other than the payments described above, I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable 
for me to require PCF Bank to reimburse Mr E for any other costs or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for PCF Bank to pay to 
Mr E the amounts described above and as set out below.  
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Es complaint and I order PCF Bank Limited to:
1. Pay £1,951 to Mr E as compensation for his loss of use and enjoyment of the car.
2. Pay £394.52 and £108.49 to Mr E to reimburse him for the insurance and car tax 
payments that he incurred for the time that he was unable to use the car.
3. Pay £2,013.36 to Mr E to reimburse him for the cost of the independent experts 
report.
4. Pay interest on the amount at 3 above at an annual rate of 8% simple from the 
date of payment to the date of settlement.
5. Pay £300 to Mr E to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes 
been caused.
HM Revenue & Customs requires PCF Bank to deduct tax from the interest payment 
referred to at 4 above. PCF Bank must give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its 
deducted if he asks it for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2021.
