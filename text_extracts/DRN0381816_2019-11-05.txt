In our adjudicators most recent findings  she thought Lending  Stream had treated 
Mr A fairly when it provided the first four loans. Although the checks for these loans may not 
have gone far enough, the adjudicator didnt think that further  more  in-depth checks  wouldve 
made a difference to the decision to lend. 
However, the adjudicator didnt think the fifth loan, and any subsequent loans, shouldve 
been provided. The adjudicator felt that by that by this point  a pattern of lending  had been 
established which shouldve  indicated to Lending  Stream that Mr A wasnt able to 
sustainably repay  his loans.  
Mr A hasnt said whether  he disagrees with the adjudicators most recent findings. 
Lending Stream didnt  accept the adjudicators findings because it believed  the information  it 
provided to us showed that these loans  were suitable for Mr A and because  Mr A repaid  the 
majority of the loans  early. It said this showed  that Mr A was able to manage his finances.   
As no agreement could be reached, the case has been passed to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
Ref: DRN03818162complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to figure 
out whether Mr A could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So Lending  Stream was required  to establish whether Mr A could sustainably repay his 
loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence 
calculation. The loan payments being affordable  on this basis might  be an indication Mr A 
could sustainably make  his repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the 
case. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr As complaint. 
There doesnt appear to be any outstanding dispute about whether the first four loans were 
suitable for Mr A, so I dont intend to make a finding about these loans in this decision. 
Instead Ill be focusing on Lending  Streams  decision  to provide loans 5  15. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Lending  Streams lending history  with Mr A, and I think  
that Lending Stream should  reasonably have seen  that Mr A was unlikely to have been able 
to make his loan repayments in a sustainable manner by the time it provided loan 5. I say 
this because:
by this stage, Mr A was into his sixth month of owing Lending Stream money and he 
now had three loans running concurrently.  In my view, Mr As loan history up until this 
point was in itself a clear demonstration  of Mr A not using  these loans as 
Lending Stream had intended. 
Ref: DRN03818163Mr A continued to be provided  with new loans quickly after he had repaid previous 
ones and at times had as many as six loans  running  concurrently.  And the amounts 
Mr A was borrowing  were not significantly decreasing. So Lending  Stream ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr A was having  to borrow further  to cover 
the hole the repayment of his previous loans left in his finances  and that Mr As 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
Mr A wasnt reducing the amounts he owed to Lending Stream.  For example,  loan 15 
was taken out over 16 months  after Mr As first loan was approved, and the value of 
this loan was for more  than three  times the sum of his first loan. 
I think that Mr A lost out because Lending  Stream provided loans 5 - 15 because:
the loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time;  
and
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr As ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im partly upholding Mr As complaint and Lending Stream  should put things right as set 
out below.
putting things right  what Lending Stream needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr A paid on loans 5 to 15;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove all entries about  loans 5 - 15 from Mr As credit file. The period of time Mr A 
owed Lending  Stream money means  that any information still recorded about  loan 
these loans is adverse. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest.  
Lending Stream must give Mr A a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
Ref: DRN03818164my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr As complaint. 
Gain Credit LLC should  put things right for Mr A as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 December 2019.
