The complaint
Mrs A and Mr H complain that they paid an early repayment charge (ERC) on the
redemption of their mortgage with Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays).
What happened
Mrs A and Mr H had a mortgage of £260,743 with Barclays - £222,923 was on a fixed rate of 
2.44% - fixed to 30 April 2023; £37,818 was on a fixed rate of 2.05% - fixed until 30 April 
2022. They wanted to move to a new house and found a new property which cost £467,500. 
Mrs A and Mr H applied for a new mortgage with Barclays through their broker. Their 
mortgage application dated 4 August 2020 showed they needed to borrow £397,618. They 
wanted to borrow the money from Barclays and port their mortgage to the new property  
and avoid an early repayment charge (ERC). Then, on 20 August 2020, the new house was 
valued at £425,000. Barclays wrote to the broker on 2 September 2020 to say the loan 
amount needed to be reduced to meet the loan-to-value (LTV) margin of 85%. This mean 
they could only borrow £361,250 from Barclays. As a result, Mrs A and Mr H had to go to 
another lender to borrow the money they needed. This meant that they couldnt port their 
existing Barclays mortgage and they paid an ERC of £7,714 when the mortgage was 
redeemed in December 2020.
Mrs A and Mr H complained. They said they had a decision in principle (DIP) from Barclays 
to borrow up to £445,000 towards the property costing £467,500. That sale fell through and 
they found a different property costing £492,000  meaning they needed to borrow 
£418,200. They said that Barclays lending policy had changed between the time of their DIP 
and their mortgage application. This meant they could only borrow £399,681 from Barclays 
and therefore they had to go to another lender. This meant they had to pay an ERC. They 
said this wasnt fair - it wasnt their fault that Barclays changed their lending policy. They 
shouldnt therefore have to pay the ERC  which they said was £7,771.57. They offered to 
pay £5,000 towards the ERC, which they thought was a fair offer.
Barclays said they couldnt waive or reduce the ERC. This was part of the terms and 
conditions of Mrs A and Mr Hs mortgage.
Mrs A and Mr H brought their complaint to us. Our investigator said Barclays hadnt made a 
mortgage offer  and so hadnt committed to the porting of their mortgage. Barclays were 
entitled to make their own lending decisions and apply their lending criteria in line with their 
commercial judgement. The ERC was payable in line with the terms and conditions of the 
existing mortgage.
Mrs A and Mr H asked that an ombudsman look into their complaint.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
Our investigator said that he couldnt uphold Mrs A and Mr Hs complaint, and I agree with 
that outcome. But I want to set out more fully the reasoning for our decision  in order that all 
parties can comment. I do that also because the version of events as set out in Mrs A and 
Mr Hs complaint differ from that Barclays have given us from their records.
Mrs A and Mr H dont dispute that Barclays could charge an ERC if their mortgage was 
redeemed early. But I will set out the terms which were in their original mortgages with 
Barclays. In the mortgage offer dated April 2018 (for £243,999), it was stated that if the 
mortgage was repaid before 30 April 2023  the ERC would be 3% of the amount repaid. 
They then took a further advance of £39,834 in May 2019 and the offer said the ERC 
would be 3% of the amount repaid if before 30 April 2022. So  when the mortgages were 
redeemed in December 2020, the ERC was payable. The redemption quotation Ive seen 
said it would be £7,714 in December 2020  Mrs A and Mr H told us it was £7,771  I 
assume this was due the change in balance of the mortgage at redemption.
It was possible to avoid paying the ERC if the existing mortgages were ported to a new 
loan. The mortgage offers say If you buy another property to move to, you can transfer 
(port) the mortgage interest rate to a new mortgage for the purchased propertyprovided 
that you meet the lending criteria in force at the time.
Mrs A and Mr H complain they wanted to port their mortgage and therefore not pay the 
ERC. But  they say - because Barclays changed their lending policy, they couldnt borrow 
the money from Barclays and had to go to another lender in order to buy their new house  
this meant that they had to redeem their Barclays mortgages and pay the ERC.
Mrs A and Mr Hs version of events differs to that of Barclays, and so I should set out 
what Barclays have told us. Mrs A and Mrs H made their mortgage application through a 
broker and the communications were therefore between the broker and Barclays  so we 
cant be sure what the broker told Mrs A and Mr H and how things were explained to 
them.
Barclays have told us that they didnt give a DIP of £445,000 in connection with the 
purchase for £467,500. And  Barclays also dont have any record of the purchase of an 
alternative property for £492,000. Weve also confirmed these facts in Barclays records.
But this is what Barclays have told us  and weve seen this in their files. Barclays 
produced a mortgage illustration on 30 July 2020  for a mortgage of £397,375 to help 
buy the property costing £467,500. I think this is the decision in principle that Mrs A and 
Mr H are referring to. But  this was only a DIP, not a mortgage offer. The mortgage 
illustration says, This document does not constitute an obligation for Barclays to grant you 
a loan.
Mrs A and Mr H then applied for a mortgage of £397,618 on 4 August 2020  towards the 
purchase of £467,500. There was then an adjustment to the purchase price down to
£465,000 - and a further application was made by the broker on 18 August 2020 for
£395,250. So  I can see that both applications were for a mortgage with an LTV of 85%. 
Barclays underwriters then assessed the applications and instructed a valuation of the 
property  as would be normal. Ive seen this was instructed on 7 August 2020 and was 
booked for the valuer to visit the new house on 20 August 2020. But  the valuation then 
came back with a value of only £425,000  this was obviously a large reduction compared 
to the purchase price. Based on Barclays LTV criteria, they would only lend up to 85% - 
Ive seen that Barclays then emailed the broker on 2 September 2020, 17 September 
2020, 26 September 2020, 12 October 2020, and 21 October 2020, to say applicants 
need to reduce the loan amount to meet the LTV margin of 85%. This wouldve meant that 
Barclays would only lend £361,250, meaning Mrs A and Mr H would have to find the 
balance of £103,750 (if the purchase price stayed at £465,000). There isnt any reply from 
the broker in Barclays records. The next entry is on 21 October 2020 - saying that the 
property purchase had fallen through, and they took no further action - other than later 
cancelling the case.It is the case that Barclays changed their lending criteria on 4 September 2020  Ive 
looked at this. The policy changes concerned income multiples  not LTVs. I dont think 
this change was relevant to Mrs A and Mr Hs complaint because its now clear that 
Barclays said that they could only lend £361,250 because of its LTV policy  and it looks 
like Mrs A and Mr H then decided to go with another lender because of that. But as Ive 
said  I dont know what Mrs A and Mr Hs broker told them about Barclays decision, or 
the reasons for it.
And so  in summary, what happened here is that Barclays gave a mortgage illustration 
for a mortgage of £397,375 on 30 July 2020  towards a purchase of £467,500. But  this 
wasnt a formal mortgage offer and didnt commit Barclays to lend the money. Mrs A and 
Mr H then applied for that mortgage. The price of the property then reduced to £465,000 
and the loan amount requested fell to £395,250. But then the valuation of the new property 
came out much lower than the purchase price  at £425,000. And  it was for that reason 
that Barclays then said they could only lend up to 85% of that. And it appears that it was 
because of that that Mrs A and Mr H went to another lender.
When Barclays gave their mortgage illustration  this was only a quotation, and not a 
commitment to lend. That only happens when a formal mortgage offer is made by a lender - 
and Barclays didnt issue an offer. And then  following Mrs A and Mr Hs application for the 
mortgage  Barclays underwriters applied their LTV criteria, which meant that the mortgage 
wasnt enough to enable them to buy the property. This wasnt due to a change of lending 
policy  it was just Barclays applying their existing lending policies. The main reason for the 
problems that arose was because the valuation of the house that Mrs A and Mr H wanted to 
buy was significantly reduced  not as a result of any change in Barclays lending policies.
Mrs A and Mr H have referred to other cases theyve seen at our service where the ERC 
has been refunded or reduced. I cant comment on those  but I will say that each 
complaint we see is looked at on its own merits and in its own circumstances  which is 
what Ive done here.
And so  while I accept that Mrs A and Mr H will be disappointed  my provisional decision 
is to not uphold their complaint. But  because of the differing versions of events - we do 
invite comments (if they wish) from both Mrs A and Mr H, and Barclays.
 
Responses to the provisional decision:
Barclays didnt have any comments, and neither did Mrs A and Mr H.
So  I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Barclays, and Mrs A and Mr H didnt have any comments, I wont be departing from my 
provisional decision and for the reasons I gave in it.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A and Mr H to 
accept or reject my decision before 31 December 2021.
