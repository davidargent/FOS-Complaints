K821x#15complaint
Mrs F complains that the loans approved  for her by CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as 
QuickQuid) were lent irresponsibly.
background
Using the information provided by QuickQuid I have created a brief summary table of the 
loans and FlexCredit account Mrs F took.  Loan 4 has been upheld  by QuickQuid and so I do 
not need to review that lending decision, but I will place  it in the context of the other  loans.

Loan 6 was repaid by a partial repayment of £310  on the due date of 21 May 2014. Then  the 
emails and account are unclear as to when Loan 6 was repaid. 
Mrs F complained on 19 October 2017 to QuickQuid and it asked her for more information 
such as bank statements  and copy payslips for the lending period.  Mrs F has shown to us 
her reply  at the time which was that she did not send anything  to QuickQuid. 
QuickQuids response  in its final response letter  (FRL) was:
I note that you self reported  your maximum monthly  income as £1000 per month.  
However, when I compared your stated income to your total repayment amount  for 
[Loan 4], your average monthly repayment amount was £760 with a monthly  income 
at the time of £1000,  which given  an estimate of your monthly  expenses  is more than 
80% of your total reported income.
It upheld the complaint in relation to that loan and the brief history surrounding Loan 4 is that 
QuickQuid said it would  refund those sums. Mrs Fs complaint about the other five payday 
loans and the FlexCredit account  was brought to us. 
Ref: DRN69288352One of our adjudicators considered it and thought that QuickQuid should put things right in 
relation to Loans 2 and 3 (as Loan 4 had been  upheld) and Loans  5 and 6. Our adjudicator 
did not uphold  Loan 1 and the FlexCredit account.  QuickQuid  did not agree. 
Mrs F did not disagree with our adjudicators opinion and so from that I plan to review this 
complaint on the basis that Mrs F is content  with the non-upholds  in relation to Loan  1 and 
the FlexCredit account. So I will be looking at Loans 2, 3, 5 and 6. Loan  4 has been upheld 
by QuickQuid.
Some of this complaint  remains unresolved so it has been  passed to me for a decision. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
The rules  and regulations were  not as extensive in 2013 to 2014 when QuickQuid was 
lending to Mrs F. But the concepts  outlined in the Office of Fair Trading Guide to 
Irresponsible Lending for businesses to take notice of were well known and relevant.  
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. 
QuickQuid says it asked  Mrs F for some application details which  included  her net monthly  
income of £1,000. It carried out many credit  bureau checks but the results of those have not 
been forwarded to me so I am not able to know what QuickQuid had. 
QuickQuid did not ask Mrs F about her likely expenditure until June 2014 and at that time 
Mrs F said £450. Before that it had no declared  figures for expenditure from Mrs F. 
QuickQuids investigation  into the complaint led to an uphold  in relation to Loan 4. QuickQuid 
did not having any declared  expenditure figures at the time of lending, and although it asked 
Mrs F in October 2017 for some additional paperwork before coming to any conclusion on 
the complaint,  it did not receive anything  from her. 
The paragraph from QuickQuids FRL is set out above and from that I can see that it 
estimated her expenditure. It may have used its credit search  results   I do not know. But in 
any event it concluded  that Mrs F was not able to afford Loan  4. Her income being £1,000 
plus the estimated  expenses (figure  unknown)  plus the repayment sum for the payday loan 
(around £750) led it to recognise that this would have amounted to more  than 80% of her 
declared income and so it was unaffordable. It refunded  her. 
Using QuickQuids logic outlined above  and applying it to Loans  2, 3, 5 and 6 leads me to 
the conclusion  that Mrs F was not able to afford  these loans. And as the application amounts 
were a very high proportion of her declared income then I think  that additional checks before 
approving the loans  ought to have been carried out. I do not think it would have been 
disproportionate to have carried out full reviews of Mrs Fs financial position  before 
approving these loans. And there  would  have been a number of ways  to do this. 
Ref: DRN69288353I demonstrate here that relatively simple  calculations with the bare minimum of information 
would, I think, have led QuickQuid to make  a different lending decision  in 2013 and 2014.  
Using Mrs Fs personal credit file sent to us by her and dated January 2017,  I can see that 
her mortgage repayment was £689  a month.  And relatively soon after Mrs F started to apply 
for loans  with QuickQuid  her credit file was marked  with late payments and in arrears  with 
her mortgage repayments. The QuickQuid loans  I am considering were sequential ones for 
£650 which is a similar figure to the amount needed  to cover her mortgage. And I do think  
that the credit checks QuickQuid carried out very likely would have shown  her mortgage 
repayments when  she applied for Loan  2 (and the loans after that).  And later I think  its likely 
that these credit searches would have shown  the late payments and mortgage arrears  from 
December 2013.  
Even allowing for the fact that Mrs Fs mortgage  commitment was shared with another 
(which I do not know) then that commitment would have been around £340 each month at 
least. So with Mrs Fs declared  income of £1,000 plus this likely mortgage commitment  of 
£340 and each of the loan repayment  figures of around £760 then I think  that had   
QuickQuid carried out the checks it ought  to have done at any stage of the lending it would 
have come to the conclusion Mrs F was not able to repay each of these high value (£650) 
payday loans.  
So I do not think that QuickQuid did carry out the checks  it ought  to have done at each  stage 
of the lending relationship  for each  loan application and whether on its own logic or using the 
information available as outlined above I think  that those lending decisions were  wrong.  And 
Mrs F lost out by having to pay the interest  and charges  on them.
point to note from the statements of accounts  sent to us
Although QuickQuid said that it was upholding the loan with a reference  ending *2780 (which  
translates to being  Loan 4 in my table), the statements of accounts  sent to us show that the 
refund was set against the loan with a reference  ending *1738 in December 2017 which  is in 
effect Loan 6. I point  this out to ensure  that when redress is being calculated  for the loans  as 
set out below, that the Loan  4 and Loan 6 mix up is addressed and does not detract from the 
sums due to Mrs F.
putting things right
Because QuickQuid,  should not have  given Mrs F the loans she took,  its not right that she 
should have to pay interest  or charges on these, or have them affect her credit file in a 
negative way. Then I think it should do as follows:
refund  any interest and charges  already  paid by Mrs F in respect of each of 
Loans 2, 3, 5 and 6; and      
apply 8% simple interest  per year to any interest  and charges refunded from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse payment information  about  the loans from Mrs Fs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest and it must  
give Mrs F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN69288354my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Fs complaint in part and direct that CashEuroNet UK 
LLC, trading as QuickQuid, put things right in the way I have said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs F to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 June 2019.
