The complaint
Ms H complains that MotoNovo Finance Limited is asking her to pay more than she owes 
after she terminated a hire purchase agreement. She also says they didnt communicate with 
her fairly.
What happened
In February 2018, Ms H acquired a used car using a hire purchase agreement from 
MotoNovo. Ms H paid a deposit of £3,700 and the remainder of the purchase price was to be 
repaid over 60 months. There were 59 monthly repayments of around £300, followed by a 
final optional payment of around £700 if Ms H wanted to own the car at the end of the 
agreement. 
Ms H began missing payments and/or paying late on the agreement by the end of 2018. 
Various payment plans were agreed between Ms H and MotoNovo over the course of the 
next year. Ms H continued making most of the required payments until September 2019 at 
which point, she stopped paying.
Ms H enquired about her options to exit the agreement at this stage through voluntary 
termination but chose not to proceed with it at that time. She also had a number of 
discussions with MotoNovo by email to discuss the arrears on the agreement and a potential 
repayment plan. 
In May 2020, Ms H applied for a three month payment holiday due to her income being 
affected by the global coronavirus pandemic. MotoNovo accepted her request for the 
payment holiday. 
In August 2020, Ms H agreed to a six month repayment plan whereby she would pay her 
normal contractual payment plus around £100 more in order to begin paying back some of 
the arrears. Ms H made the agreed payment in September 2020 but failed to make the 
remaining five agreed repayments. 
Ms H contacted MotoNovo in January 2021 to say she wanted to voluntarily terminate the 
agreement. She then changed her mind and said she would like to keep the car, so 
MotoNovo asked her to complete some income and expenditure information in order to 
assess whether the agreement remained affordable to her. 
By the end of February 2021, MotoNovo still hadnt received responses to all the questions it 
had asked of Ms H regarding her circumstances. It said it would prefer to discuss her 
personal details over the phone. However, it said that as Ms H was hearing impaired, would 
she consider a family member or friend to call them on her behalf. Ms H initially said she 
didnt want anyone to assist her and wanted to continue discussing matters over email. 
On 1 March 2021, Ms H emailed to say she wanted to voluntarily terminate the agreement. 
MotoNovo responded by email the same day to say that in order to reach the halfway point 
in the agreement she would still need to pay an amount of £1,824.25 plus the current arrears 
balance of £5,013.39. 
Ms H then asked for her now ex-partner to be added as an authorised third party to the 
account so that MotoNovo could speak to him on the phone. On 3 March 2021, MotoNovo 
spoke to Ms Hs ex-partner about the voluntary termination process and it was agreed this 
would go ahead. MotoNovo emailed Ms H shortly after the call to confirm the voluntary 
termination would be going ahead and explained what this involved, including telling her that 
she would be required to pay arrears that had built up on her agreement to date. 
MotoNovo followed this up in a letter the next day. The letter set out in detail the amount of 
the liability Ms H still had on voluntary termination, which included the arrears amount of 
£5,013.39.
Ms H raised a complaint with MotoNovo. She said that she wasnt required to pay the 
arrears on voluntary termination. She said the hire purchase agreement set out she only 
needed to pay half of the total agreement in order to voluntarily terminate. She said she 
therefore only needed to pay £1,824. She said there had been six months of agreed 
payment holidays and these should therefore not be considered arrears. Further, she said 
that MotoNovo failed to respond to her request to return the car for three months, meaning it 
wasnt fair for her to be charged during that time. 
MotoNovo didnt uphold her complaint. It said that under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, it 
was entitled to repayment of the arrears on voluntary termination. Ms H referred her 
complaint to our service. She said that MotoNovo ignored her requests to return the car 
earlier and it repeatedly asked her to call them to discuss the account despite them knowing 
she was hearing impaired. She said it ignored her requests to communicate by email or to 
provide an interpreter. Ms H said that when she eventually agreed for her ex-partner to 
speak to MotoNovo on her behalf, he agreed to things she wasnt told about, and key bits of 
information werent communicated back to her by MotoNovo. 
Our investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. He was satisfied that MotoNovo 
had offered alternative contact methods for Ms H to use and had continued to correspond 
with her by email as she had requested. He said MotoNovos suggestion to speak to a third 
party on the phone on her behalf was an isolated incident and seemed to be a genuine 
attempt to try to reach a quicker resolution to the concerns regarding the arrears. He said 
that MotoNovo had been clear throughout that the arrears would need to be paid on 
voluntary termination and that it hadnt acted unfairly in seeking repayment of these 
amounts. 
Ms H didnt accept that outcome. In summary, she said that she received three default 
letters at the same time after the lockdown had ended and these were dated from several 
months earlier. She says she was told any missed payments would be spread out amongst 
the rest of the agreement and not classed as arrears and therefore not warrant a default 
letter. Had MotoNovo sent the three default letters at the correct time she would have been 
alerted sooner to a problem. Her ex-partner who spoke with MotoNovo on her behalf told her 
that when MotoNovo sold the car the sales proceeds would be used to reduce the amount 
owed but this didnt happen. MotoNovo should have had to confirm everything it had 
discussed with the third party in writing to her. She said its failure to do this is a breach of the 
Equality Act 2010. 
The complaint has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.In deciding whats fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account the law, regulators 
rules and guidance and what I consider to have been good industry practice at the time. In 
the circumstances of this complaint, the relevant law would include the Consumer Credit Act 
1974 (CCA) and the Equality Act 2010.
Ms Hs complaint is essentially that MotoNovo is asking her to repay too much towards an 
agreement she voluntarily terminated and that it treated her unfairly and discriminated 
against her in its communications with her. Ill deal with the latter issues first. 
Ms H says MotoNovo failed to make reasonable adjustments for her communication needs, 
which she says is a breach of the Equality Act 2010. My role isnt to decide whether 
MotoNovo is in breach of that act, that would be a matter for a Court to decide. Instead, my 
role is to decide whether MotoNovo acted in a fair and reasonable way towards Ms H, taking 
into account what the Equality Act 2010 says. 
Ive reviewed MotoNovos contact notes as well as copies of emails and messages Ms H has 
supplied. There was a significant amount of contact between the two parties over a 
prolonged period of time. Having reviewed it all, Im not persuaded that MotoNovo acted 
unfairly or unreasonably towards Ms H in the way that it communicated with her. Ill explain 
why. 
MotoNovo was aware that Ms H was hearing impaired and because of that it communicated 
with her primarily in writing throughout. It also repeatedly offered her the option of 
communication through text-relay services, which she declined to take up. I note that Ms H 
did enquire about MotoNovo arranging an interpreter. However, MotoNovo said this wasnt a 
service they provided. I dont think this was unreasonable, as MotoNovo had offered other 
suitable alternatives to communicating with Ms H, such as in writing and using a text-relay 
service. 
Ms H says that MotoNovo repeatedly asked her to call despite them being aware of her 
hearing impairment. While I accept there have been limited instances of MotoNovo 
suggesting Ms H calls them or nominates someone to call on her behalf, I can see that in 
each instance MotoNovo wasnt insisting on this and they also offered her the option to 
continue communicating by email. So, I dont think theyve prevented her from 
communicating effectively in relation to the account.
I note Ms H did authorise her ex-partner to speak on her behalf on the account. She says 
MotoNovo withheld information from her following this call. However, Ive not seen anything 
to persuade me thats the case. As Ive set out in the background to this decision, MotoNovo 
did follow up in writing with Ms H both by email and letter to explain what had been agreed 
on the phone and on what terms. 
Ms H is also unhappy about receiving three notifications of arrears at the same time. 
However, even if I accept this did happen, Im not persuaded this has made any material 
difference to the position shes in now. This is because Ms H was in arrears on her 
agreement for a significant period of time and its clear from the email communications she 
had with MotoNovo since the end of 2019 that she was aware of this. The letters wouldnt 
have alerted her to anything new she wasnt already aware of. 
For all these reasons, I dont think MotoNovo acted unfairly in its communications with Ms H. 
Ill now address the outstanding balance on the agreement.  
Ms H also says the amount MotoNovo are seeking to recover when she voluntarily terminated the agreement is wrong. She says the arrears shouldnt be included in the 
amount owed. Im sorry to disappoint Ms H, but Im satisfied that MotoNovo is entitled to ask 
her to pay that amount. 
S.99 and S.100 CCA sets out the right for consumers to terminate a hire purchase 
agreement and what liabilities a consumer has on termination. In summary, it says on 
termination a consumer is liable to pay at least half the total price of the agreement. In this 
case that was £11,123.50. S.99 also says that any liabilities which had accrued prior to the 
termination are not affected by the termination. What this means is that Ms H is liable to pay 
any arrears that had built up before the termination. 
I note Ms Hs hire purchase agreement also makes this clear in the section titled 
Termination: Your Rights, which says that on termination Ms H would need to pay any 
overdue instalments in addition to paying half due under the agreement.
Ms H says that these amounts shouldnt be treated as arrears as they were part of agreed 
payment plans or due to periods of time where MotoNovo didnt respond to her about her 
request to terminate the agreement. However, I dont agree. The approval of a payment 
holiday didnt mean that Ms H didnt owe those amounts, instead, it meant MotoNovo werent 
going to seek repayment of those payments until the end of the agreement. As Ms H chose 
to terminate the agreement, it brought the agreement to an end and the deferred payments 
were therefore due. Further, Ive not seen anything to demonstrate that MotoNovo failed to 
respond to her requests to terminate the agreement within a reasonable period of time. 
Ive seen that Ms H enquired about termination on a number of occasions, prior to March 
2021. However, she never actually went through with that request when MotoNovo asked 
her to confirm this is what she wanted to do. Overall, Ive seen no reason to say that it would 
be unfair or unreasonable for MotoNovo to seek recovery of the amount it is pursuing Ms H 
for.  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 August 2022.
