The complaint
 Miss B is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) will not refund the return 
postage costs of £11.00 that she incurred when returning goods that were not as described.
What happened
 In early March 2020, Miss B bought goods online and paid £43.89 to the seller using her 
PayPal account. The goods were not as described when they arrived, and she complained 
to the seller through PayPals dispute resolution process.
PayPal told her to post the goods back to the seller  which she did at a cost of £11.00. She 
then received a refund of £43.89, which covered the cost of the goods, but not the return 
postage costs. Miss B thought PayPal should refund this too, but PayPal referred Miss B to 
the terms of its online dispute resolution process which say that it can require the buyer to 
pay these costs.
Miss B was unhappy with this and said that PayPal was acting on behalf of the seller, and so 
it had to refund the return postage costs under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (the CRA.) 
PayPal disagreed but offered Miss B £50 as a gesture of goodwill. She rejected this offer 
and brought her case to our service.
Our investigator thought that PayPal had acted correctly in line with its terms and conditions, 
which said that it could require the buyer to pay the return postage costs. He said that 
PayPals buyer protection programme was subject to its own terms, which did not require 
PayPal to cover return postage. He said PayPal was not acting on behalf of the seller and 
didnt think that the CRA applied to require PayPal to cover the costs of return postage.
PayPal has offered Miss B £50 as a gesture of goodwill, but she has rejected this offer. 
 
Miss B has asked for the case to be referred to an Ombudsman, so the case has come to 
me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss B received a refund for the unsatisfactory goods she bought using her PayPal account 
in March 2020. This was dealt with through PayPals buyer protection programme but Miss B 
is unhappy that the costs of £11.00 that she incurred in returning the goods were not also 
refunded by PayPal.
PayPals online dispute resolution process for its buyer protection programme is set out in its 
terms and conditions and includes the following:
IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify 
as part of the settlement of your claim. PayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to 
reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.
and 
Step 4: Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner, if you're filing a 
Significantly Not as Described claim. PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the 
item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to 
provide proof of delivery.
When PayPal contacted Miss B about her refund claim, it made it clear that she was 
responsible for any return postage costs.
PayPals terms make it clear that the buyer will have to pay the return costs and these terms 
form the contract between Miss B and PayPal, so I think its fair and reasonable for PayPal 
to decline to refund the return costs in line with these terms.
Miss B says that PayPal is liable to refund these costs under the CRA and that its terms are 
unfair because they exclude her consumer rights. She has referred to the definition of 
trader in the CRA, which reads as follows: 
Trader means a person acting for purposes relating to that person's trade, business, craft 
or profession, whether acting personally or through another person acting in the trader's 
name or on the trader's behalf.  
and the following section
s.20(8) Whether or not the consumer has a duty to return the rejected goods, the trader 
must bear any reasonable costs of returning them, other than any costs incurred by the 
consumer in returning the goods in person to the place where the consumer took physical 
possession of them.
Miss B says PayPal is responsible for the return costs in this case because its managing the 
return of the goods on the sellers behalf, and that this makes it responsible as the trader. 
But I dont think this is what these sections mean. The definition of trader simply means 
that the seller falls within the definition, even if he acts through a third party. Because of this, 
it is the seller who is the trader, not PayPal, and it remains open to Miss B to take this up 
with the seller.  As such, I cant fairly agree that PayPals terms exclude Miss Bs consumer 
rights in respect of her return shipping costs.
 
In any event, I dont think that PayPal acts on behalf of the seller in the way that Miss B 
suggests, it simply provides a dispute resolution service.
In the light of what Ive said, it would not be fair or reasonable to require PayPal to bear the 
costs of Miss Bs return postage. 
  
I note that PayPal offered to pay Miss B £50 as a gesture of goodwill and remains willing to 
do so. If she wishes to accept that offer, she can still do so by contacting PayPal directly.
In summary, I think PayPal has acted fairly and reasonably so I will not be asking it to do 
anything more. I realise that this will be disappointing for Miss B, but I hope she will 
understand my reasons.
My final decision My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 March 2021.
