The complaint
N, a limited company, says National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) blocked its business 
account and subsequently mis-handled its administration, meaning N couldnt access the 
account balance worth over Â£300,000.
What happened
N held a business bank account with NatWest. In early 2022, NatWest placed restrictions on 
the account after failing to establish with N, among other things, its trading address. 
Difficulties continued through 2022 and, in March 2023, NatWest issued its final response on 
the matter.
In summary, NatWest said it could have provided clearer information to N as to who to 
contact to assist further. NatWest sent N a link to a form to close the account and provided a 
phone number in case of any problems completing the form. NatWest apologised for the 
poor service N had received for a time and arranged for a hamper to be sent to one of Ns 
representatives.
N ultimately brought a complaint to this service. Our investigator felt that NatWest had valid 
concerns including around Ns trading address. As a way forward, the investigator said 
theyd arrange for details of a contact point at NatWest to be forwarded to N so that the 
situation might be resolved between the parties amicably  possibly with the account 
remaining open.
N didnt accept the investigators findings. It said NatWest had restricted access to its 
account and had, for over a year, failed to advise it how to properly regain access to the 
account and the funds held in it. N said Of course one phone call to someone of stature at 
NW could avoid all this.
As such, the complaint was passed to me to review afresh and reach a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont uphold the complaint. Ill explain why.
I recognise the inconvenience that must have been caused to N in discovering that access to 
its account had been restricted. And that this would have been compounded by the 
difficulties it encountered in trying to remove these restrictions. Although NatWest accepts it 
could have provided clearer information at times, I note its apologised and offered 
compensation for that. 
While the difficulties N had in accessing the account ran for a considerable period of time  
and I gather are ongoing  I cant see enough evidence to show NatWest was at fault 
beyond the aspects its already accepted responsibility for.
N considers the issue leading to restrictions being placed on the account as being minor in 
nature and that NatWest was merely prevented from ticking one of their compliance boxes. 
But UK banks are required by law to undertake Know Your Customer (KYC) checks  such 
as those that gave rise to the issues in this case  to prevent fraud. These are important 
checks for financial businesses to carry out with potentially serious consequences for them, 
and their customers, if they dont.
That being the case, I dont consider that NatWest treated N unfairly in acting as it did 
despite recognising the impact this has had on N.
Going forward, Im glad to see that the investigators arranged for N to have the contact 
details of a representative of NatWest in a position to assist further, and that Ns reached out 
to them.
My final decision
For the reasons given, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask N to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 December 2023.
