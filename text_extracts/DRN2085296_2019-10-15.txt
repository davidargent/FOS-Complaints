K820x#14complaint
Mrs S complains that LeasePlan UK Limited  wont tell her why it declined her credit 
agreement application  for a car. This complaint has been brought on Mrs Ss behalf by her 
husband but for ease of reference I shall only refer to Mrs S in my decision.
background
In July 2018 Mrs S applied for a credit  agreement in order  to lease a car. The agreement 
was arranged via a broker for an agreement with LeasePlan. A short  time after the 
application Mrs S was informed her application had been declined.
Mrs S complained to LeasePlan but it didnt overturn its decision.  LeasePlan said her 
application hadnt met its set internal score which meant the application couldnt proceed. 
LeasePlan said it took lots of different factors into account and allocated  points based on the 
information provided which included information  from a credit agency.  But LeasePlan said it 
didnt use the scores given by credit agencies as these were too generic. It also said that a 
lender wasnt obliged to accept an application.
Mrs S was unhappy at LeasePlans  response  and complained to this service. She said she 
was in employment with a regular  salary and very little debt. She said LeasePlan should 
provide full reasons for its decision  to decline her application. Mrs S was concerned the 
decision had been made because of her nationality.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend Mrs S complaint should be upheld.  He said that financial  
organisations used credit  scoring as part of their assessments for lending facilities and this 
was used in conjunction with other information. Lending or providing credit was a business 
decision based on commercial considerations.
Our adjudicator said that LeasePlan had advised that a lot of information had been taken 
into account when  considering Mrs Ss application. This wouldve included  things  such as 
her date of birth, her length  of time at addresses, how long shed been  on the electoral roll, 
as well as her income and outgoings.  As this had been a sole name application Mrs Ss 
husbands income wouldnt have been  a factor.
Our adjudicator said that LeasePlan followed its processes correctly  in dealing with her 
application and that this service couldnt  intervene  with those as this was part of a business  
decision. He said other  credit providers may reach a different decision.  Our adjudicator  said 
he didnt think LeasePlan had done anything wrong.
Mrs S was unhappy at our adjudicators  view.  She said that her score with a credit agency  
was excellent  and taking that together with her other personal circumstances she believed 
LeasePlans decision was unacceptable  and wanted to know  the exact reasons for the 
declining of her application. She said she was left with the impression it had been  due to her 
nationality.
As the parties were unable to agree  the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN20852962I appreciate that Mrs S is anxious  to understand fully why her application to LeasePlan was 
turned down. But Im aware that the exact lending criteria for lenders like LeasePlan is 
considered commercially  sensitive and full reasons arent provided when an application is 
declined. I wouldnt expect a business to give out its lending criteria in these  circumstances. 
LeasePlan has explained to Mrs S that it uses a point based system when assessing  an 
application and that it uses this system consistently  for a fair approach. It has also said that it 
doesnt rely on the credit agencies scores because  these are too general and it factors in a 
number of other things  as well. So an excellent  score with a credit agency wont necessarily 
mean a credit application will be approved by a credit provider. 
LeasePlan has said that it based its decision on information Mrs S had provided, information 
held by a named credit agency  and any information LeasePlan already had. I think  that 
LeasePlan provided Mrs S with as much  detail as it could about its decision.  Im satisfied  
that LeasePlan doesnt have to give detailed reasons as this would mean providing 
commercially sensitive  information.
LeasePlan has explained that it uses a points system and Mrs Ss application  didnt reach 
the required number.  I dont have any evidence that the decision was reached due to her 
nationality. Mrs S may have scored too few points due to a number  of factors such  as time 
shed lived at addresses, whether shed  had credit in the past and had built up a sufficient 
repayment history etc.
So looking  at the evidence Im not upholding Mrs Ss complaint. Im satisfied LeasePlan 
gave a reasonable explanation as to why Mrs Ss application didnt proceed and Im not 
requesting it take any further action to resolve  this complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above Im not upholding this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 November  2019.
