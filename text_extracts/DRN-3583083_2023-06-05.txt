The complaint
Mrs G complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland plc wont refund to her the money that she 
paid for some holiday club membership points. Shes being represented in her complaint by 
a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs G and her husband entered into a purchase agreement in March 2016 to buy 5,000 
holiday club membership points. The total price payable under the agreement was £4,700 
and Mrs G paid £1,175 using her RBS credit card in April 2016 and the balance of £3,525, 
also using her RBS credit card, later that month.
Mrs Gs representative made a claim to RBS in September 2017 under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the membership had been misrepresented to Mrs G 
and her husband and that the holiday company had breached the contract. RBS said that 
the payments were made to a third party which processes payments for retailers, such as 
the holiday company, so it had been unable to establish the debtor-creditor-supplier 
relationship required for a claim under section 75. It also said that Mrs G hadnt provided any 
tangible evidence to prove her claim of misrepresentations made at the point of sale or a 
breach of contract. Mrs G wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this 
service that the holiday company was in breach of the contract by misrepresenting the 
contract to Mrs G and her husband and breaching the EU Timeshare Directive.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Gs complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that RBSs decision to turn down her claim was unfair or unreasonable. She wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract agreed between it and Mrs G and her husband. 
She said that, because there wasnt enough evidence to uphold Mrs Gs complaint, she 
hadnt made a finding on the debtor-creditor-supplier relationship. 
Mrs Gs representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says that our investigators recommendation is manifestly wrong and none of 
the relevant clauses have been reviewed. It says that there have been breaches of the 
Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010, the Unfair 
Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 and the Consumer Protection from Unfair 
Trading Regulations 2008 and it has provided an indicative and non-exhaustive list of 
terms which it says may be regarded as unfair. It has also provided a generic submission 
from counsel about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses and a further 
document in which it describes what it says has been a fundamental breach of contract by 
the holiday company. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Gs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mrs Gs claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
Mrs Gs claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the 
holiday company and that the membership points were misrepresented to her and 
her husband and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not RBSs response to Mrs Gs 
claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mrs Gs complaint form says that the holiday company was in breach of the contract 
by misrepresenting the contract to Mrs G and her husband, and her representatives 
letter to RBS in September 2017 describes the misrepresentations that it says were 
made to Mrs G and her husband, including that:
they would receive a guaranteed yearly rental income which would cover the 
maintenance fees and provide a profit;
they were advised that they would receive priority when booking;
they were informed that the selection of destinations would continue to 
broaden; and
they were assured that with their membership they were guaranteed to stay in 
a refurbished apartment with free wi-fi and a free daily English newspaper;
and it says that those promises were untrue;
Ive been provided with a copy of the purchase agreement that Mrs G and her 
husband signed in March 2016 and the terms and conditions and a separate 
standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given that they also signed;
Mrs G and her husband confirmed that theyd also received a key information 
document, the inventory schedule, the annual global reservations directory, the resort 
disclosure booklet, a legal and governing documents booklet, and the rules and 
regulations of the club;
the terms and conditions say: You should not purchase your points as an investment 
 except of course in your holidays .; and Ive seen no reference in the documents 
that have been provided to me to a guaranteed rental income and I dont consider 
that Mrs G has provided enough evidence to show that the holiday company said that 
she and her husband would receive a guaranteed yearly rental income which would 
cover the maintenance fees and provide a profit;
Mrs Gs representative says that Mrs G and her husband have attempted to reserve 
holidays on several occasions only to find that theres no availability but the same 
weeks are available to the general public through third party booking agencies  but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that they were advised that they would receive priority 
when booking or that the resorts were exclusive to club members;
Mrs G and her husband confirmed that theyd received the inventory schedule and 
the global reservations directory and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that they were informed that the selection of destinations would continue to 
broaden;
Im also not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs G and her husband were assured that they were guaranteed to stay in a refurbished apartment 
with free wi-fi or that they would receive a free daily English newspaper;
if the holiday company had made such promises to Mrs G and her husband but the 
promises werent contained in the documents that they were then signing, I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect them to have asked for the promises to be set 
out in writing  particularly as the terms and conditions that they signed say: The 
terms of this agreement and the documents incorporated in it form the entire 
agreement between us. We intend to rely on these written terms. If you require any 
changes or have relied on verbal promises please ask for these to be put in writing;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
were misrepresented to Mrs G and her husband by the holiday company or that they 
were induced into entering into the purchase agreement to buy the membership 
points by any such misrepresentations;
Mrs Gs representative says that holiday company is in breach of contract by 
including manifestly unfair terms and that Mrs G and her husband are entitled to 
receive notice of, and attend and speak at, all general meetings of the holiday 
company but theyve been members since 2013 and havent been provided with 
notices of the general meetings;
Mrs G and her husband entered into the purchase agreement in March 2016 so RBS 
would have no liability under section 75 for any breach of contract before then and 
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs G and her husband contacted the holiday 
company to tell it that they hadnt received notices of the general meetings - I dont 
consider that any failure by the holiday company to send Mrs G and her husband any 
notices of meetings in these circumstances would be a breach of contract for which 
RBS would be liable under section 75;
Ive carefully considered what Mrs Gs representative has said about the unfairness 
of the terms of the agreements that Mrs G and her husband entered into with the 
holiday company and the breaches of regulations and the EU Timeshare Directive 
that it has described (including the various submissions that it has provided since our 
investigators recommendations);
Ive not been provided with all of the documents that Mrs G and her husband would 
have signed with the holiday company in March 2016 but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in those documents was unfair;
Mrs G and her husband signed the purchase agreement and other documents and 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence in these circumstances to show that 
theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company for which RBS would be 
liable under section 75;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that there must be a debtor-creditor-
supplier agreement but, as Mrs Gs credit card statements show that the payments of 
£1,175 and £3,525 were made to a trustee, and not to the holiday company (even 
though the holiday company is also referred to on the statements), its now possible 
that there was no such agreement in place following the High Courts judgment last 
year in the case of Steiner v National Westminster Bank plc;
but as Im not persuaded that theres been a misrepresentation or breach of contract 
for which RBS would be liable under section 75, I consider that theres no need for 
me to make any finding as to whether or not there was a debtor-creditor-supplier 
agreement in these arrangements;
I sympathise with Mrs G and her husband for the issues that theyve had with their 
holiday club membership points but I consider that RBSs response to Mrs Gs section 75 claim was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
RBS to refund to Mrs G any of the money that she paid for the membership points, to 
pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 July 2023.
