The complaint
Mr H complains that PayrNet Limited blocked his Pockit account and returned the money to 
the original source rather than to him.
What happened
In July 2021, PayrNet blocked Mr Hs account and held the money in it. 
PayrNet asked Mr H for some documentation relating to Mr Hs identity, and the source of 
funds. PayrNet, say they received the identification from Mr H but not the evidence of source 
of funds. Mr H told our service that he used his account to receive payments for work  
mainly removals and selling furniture. He said he didnt have any paperwork to show his 
entitlement to the funds paid into his account, but hed done nothing wrong, and the money 
belonged to him. So, he wanted the money, which amounted to just under £5,000 returned 
to him directly.
Mr H sent PayrNet several emails over the following months trying to find out how he could 
access the balance of his account. He explained to them that he had received the payments 
into his account from providing third parties with removal services and sales of items 
including furniture, and that he doesnt take pictures and that people just visit his work unit to 
view and buy items. Because of this in August 2021 PayrNet decided to return to money in 
Mr Hs account back to source. However, PayrNet didnt do this. 
Mr H received an email from PayrNet in October 2021, informing him that it was closing his 
account and asking him for bank details to return the remaining balance to him. Mr H sent 
PayrNet When Mr H didnt receive the money, he continuously chased PayrNet and 
confirmed not having access to the money was causing him distress. PayrNet then sent 
Mr H a further email letting him know that it was still completing its review of Mr Hs account, 
and it wasnt able to provide him with further information. This contradicted the earlier email 
which said PayrNet were closing Mr Hs account and returning the funds in it back to him 
once hed provided details of a bank account to make payment.
Following this email, Mr H continued to chase PayrNet for an update on when his funds 
would be released during October, November and December 2021. PayrNet didnt respond.
In March 2022, PayrNet decided that due to Mr H not being able to provide proof of his 
entitlement to the money in his account it was going to return all the payments back to 
source. PayrNet say they returned the money left in the account to the original sources in 
May 2022 and closed Mr Hs account. But it didnt let Mr H know it had done this.
Mr H brought his complaint to our service where one of our investigators looked into things. 
He asked PayrNet what it had done with Mr Hs balance and asked it to provide evidence of 
when and to where the money had been returned. In response, PayrNet provided the 
investigator with details of where each payment made into Mr Hs account had been 
returned. The investigator then shared this information with Mr H so that he could trace his 
funds.
The investigator said that PayrNet didnt do anything wrong when it reviewed Mr Hs account 
and sent the funds back to source. However, he said PayrNet should have provided Mr H 
with better service  namely it should have told him that it wasnt releasing his balance back 
to him and what it had done with the money in his account. He therefore asked them to pay 
Mr H £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience this had caused. 
PayrNet agreed with the investigators recommendation. Mr H didnt. He said PayrNet hadnt 
told him what it was doing with his money, and it had taken months to find out that it had now 
returned the funds back to source. He says if he had he been told at the time he wouldve 
had a better chance of tracing his funds  now months later he has to rely on the contact 
information for his customers being accurate and their goodwill to give him back his money. 
He says it is unreasonable that he now has to search for his payers and seek the return of 
his money.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered the fact that PayrNet are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in 
order to meet its legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of new and existing relationships. That sometimes means they need to restrict 
customers accounts  either in full or partially while they carry out the review. 
Having looked at the information PayrNet relied upon to conduct its review, Im satisfied that 
they were complying with their legal and regulatory obligations when they blocked Mr Hs 
account and asked him for information and himself and how he was using his account. The 
terms and conditions of Mr Hs account also permit PayrNet to block an account and Im 
satisfied PayrNet acted in line with them. So, I cant say PayrNet did anything wrong when it 
decided to review Mr Hs account. 
While PayrNet are entitled to carry out a review, wed expect them to do so in a timely 
manner and without undue delay. PayrNet initially blocked Mr Hs account in July 2021. Mr H 
provided them with information regarding his address and identification. And he told PayrNet 
hed provided all he could regarding the funds in his account  all of which he did within a 
day of his account being blocked. But it wasnt until May 2022 that PayrNet returned the 
money in Mr Hs account back to source  which is 10 months after it had first blocked 
Mr Hs account. And it didnt let Mr H know it had taken the decision to do this. PayrNet 
havent offered any explanation about what (if anything) it was doing during this time. 
I note too that PayrNet didnt update Mr H. So, this meant he was left in the dark, chasing 
PayrNet via email trying to find out what was happening with his account for months. I also 
think PayrNet confused matters by asking Mr H for relevant bank details to return the money 
informing Mr H he would receive the money in October 2021. While I recognise that PayrNet 
is entitled to carry out a review, I dont consider the account being blocked for 10 months 
with little contact acceptable. 
PayrNet has said they no longer hold the funds and have acted in accordance with the 
regulations by returning the funds to source. Ive had to consider whether it was fair to return 
the money to source. Ive looked at the evidence both Mr H and PayrNet has provided. 
Based on this, and the full circumstances of the complaint, Im not satisfied PayrNets 
actions were unfair. Ultimately, PayrNet would have to be satisfied that Mr H wasnt entitled to the money himself to justify returning it back to the original senders. Having considered 
the lack of evidence from Mr H that hes entitled to the money in his account, I agree that this 
was the right action in the circumstances. This ensures the funds are sent back to the 
correct person. So, I cant say PayrNet has treated Mr H unfairly in doing so. 
The problem is, PayrNet have taken 10 months to do this. And have only recently ,after 
being prompted by the investigator, provided Mr H with any meaningful information he could 
use to trace the money which was paid into his account. This means Mr H is now having 
trouble locating the money he says belongs to him. So, Im satisfied Mr H was caused 
trouble and upset by PayrNets delays and lack of communication. I agree with the 
investigator that £100 compensation is appropriate in the circumstances to recognise the 
distress this situation has continued to cause Mr H.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Mr Hs complaint. PayrNet Limited should do the 
following to put things right:
Pay Mr H £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 April 2023.
