The complaint
Mr P complains that TransUnion International UK Limited, trading as TransUnion was
wrongly reporting his address information and this led to him being chased for a debt he was
not responsible for.
What happened
On 23 August 2023 I issued my provisional findings to both parties setting out why I thought 
Mr Ps complaint should be upheld, and I invited both parties to provide me with any further 
submissions or evidence to consider. 
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision together with my 
provisional findings which are included below and now form part of this final decision. 
Background 
In February 2022 a water company (Company S) requested TransUnion carry out a trace to
find a debtor for them. The debt related to services provided for Property A.
TransUnions trace returned Mr P as the likely debtor linked to Property A.
Company S and their agents then pursued Mr P for the outstanding debt.
Following contact with Mr P, in July 2022 Company S accepted Mr P was not responsible for
the debt, and corrected their records.
Mr P complained to TransUnion in July 2022. On 10 August 2022 TransUnion updated their
records with Mr Ps correct address  Property B. However, TransUnion said they had done
nothing wrong and so Mr P brought his complaint to our service.
Our Investigator concluded TransUnion should have been aware the information they were
holding about Mr Ps address was not correct, and they said TransUnion should pay Mr P
£200 to reflect the upset caused to him by the matter.
TransUnion disagreed. They said that it was not their failing that Mr P had been pursued for
the debt because TransUnion did not own the data on credit reports. TransUnion said they
reported only the information their data suppliers gave them. TransUnion said it was
therefore the data suppliers responsibility to ensure the data being provided was correct and
up to date. And TransUnion had not received a notification of Mr Ps Property B address.
TransUnion therefore requested that an Ombudsman review the case.
Mr P also told this service that TransUnion had told him during a call on 10 August 2022 that
they had identified the problem with his addresses, rectified it and admitted theyd got things
wrong.
The case was then passed to me to decide. Before doing so I asked TransUnion for several
pieces of information to better understand what had happened to bring about these events 
including the call recording Mr P had referred to.
Disappointingly TransUnion did not provide any of the information requested. They believed
a new complaint was being raised and the information requested was not relevant to the
original complaint so they did not feel it should be taken into account.
I would take this opportunity to respond to TransUnion to highlight that it is for this service to
decide what is and is not relevant to the determination of a complaint. The information
requested was relevant to better understanding how TransUnion had been reporting
information relating to Mr Ps financial standing, and why it came to pass that Mr P was
pursued for repayment of a debt that was not his. There was no new complaint.
I would also remind TransUnion of DISP 3.5 in the regulators handbook of rules and
guidance which, amongst other matters, sets out that it is for the ombudsman to direct what
evidence is required and explains the ombudsman has the power to require a party to
provide evidence, as well as that the ombudsman can reach a decision on the basis of what
has been supplied and take account of the failure by a party to provide information
requested.
To move this case forward, I have set out my provisional findings below. Both parties will
now have the opportunity to provide me with any further evidence or clarifications in
response to my findings.
My provisional findings 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I am minded to uphold Mr Ps complaint and ask TransUnion to increase
the compensation award to £300. Ill explain why.
It is not in dispute that Mr P was pursued for a debt that was not his, nor that this has now
been corrected by the parties involved so he is no longer being chased for that outstanding
sum, and that his TransUnion credit file has been updated.
It also does not appear to be in dispute that the request from Company S to locate the
debtor was made to TransUnion in February 2022.
What is disputed is who is responsible for Mr P being approached for repayment of the debt
in question.
Company S have said they relied primarily on the trace findings provided to them by
TransUnion. And in summary, TransUnion have said the information they were reporting was
that given to them by their data providers, so it was not their fault if something in that
information was wrong.
Im unable to look at Company Ss actions in this matter, so my findings relate only to
TransUnion.
So what were TransUnions responsibilities here?
As a credit reference agency (CRA), TransUnion is a controller of the credit reference data
that it holds. This means it has responsibilities under data protection law to make sure that
the data is used fairly and lawfully.CRAs use credit reference data to carry out certain processing activities to support their
business operations. One of the things they do is data linking  so when a CRA compiles
data into their databases they create links between different pieces of data. This can mean a
person can be linked with their previous and current addresses.
The Information Commissioners Office (ICO)  the independent body set up to uphold
information rights, and regulate data privacy  sets out that as a general rule, if a particular
entry on a credit file has a company name on it, its likely to be that company responsible for
that entry. And the CRAs cant amend that data without the permission of that company.
However, the ICO does note that they expect CRAs to take reasonable measures to ensure
the information that is reported by lenders via their credit files is accurate. And that the
information generated by CRAs for which they are responsible includes financial links, linked
addresses and alias information.
Under UK GDPR Article 5 sets out that personal data shall be, amongst other principles,
accurate and kept up to date. And that any data which is inaccurate is erased or rectified
without delay.
In view of the above, it follows to ask did TransUnion act fairly and reasonably when
processing Mr Ps personal data, and take reasonable measures to ensure information being
reported to them was accurate, and that they were maintaining accurate and up to date
address links for Mr P?
It is right to say that TransUnion would process the credit reference data based on what
information various data providers would give them. So TransUnion could reasonably only
know if a new address link should be created if it was reported to them by one of their data
providers or if Mr P told them himself.
So what did TransUnion know and when?
There is very limited information and evidence available to me to be able to answer this
question  notably as TransUnion did not provide the information I requested from them. So I
have considered, on the balance of probability  that is what I think more likely than not was
the case based on the submissions and evidence I do have  whether TransUnion was
knowingly holding inaccurate address details for Mr P in February 2022.
On balance, I am minded to say they were more likely than not in possession of data that
would have created an address link for Mr P to Property B prior to the trace being carried
out. I say this for the following reasons.
Mr P moved home in or around 2016. This is supported by the credit reports provided by the
other two CRAs  Company E and Company F. Ive noted that Company E records Mr P on
the electoral roll at Property B from April 2016  corroborated by Bank H linking Mr P at
Property B from 6 March 2016 for their card services. Company Fs electoral roll information
also goes some way to supporting Mr Ps move in 2016 given Company F no longer report
Mr P at Property A from 2016. Company F have him registered on the electoral roll at
Property B from 2019.
TransUnions credit report (produced on 19 August 2022) does not provide any electoral roll
information for Mr P. TransUnion say they never received any information from the council,
but I find it strange that they received nothing for several years when the other CRAs did 
and TransUnion have not provided any evidence to support what theyve said.I note on TransUnions credit report that they also appear to be reporting a credit card for
Bank H. Its possible Bank H did not send TransUnion the updated information, but equally
its possible that Bank H did send TransUnion updated data. And given the length of time
that has passed I find it strange that this would not have filtered through to TransUnion
during the years since 2016 as TransUnion are reporting the details of Bank Hs card for
several years.
Mr P has also remained consistent in saying that during a call with TransUnion they admitted
there had been an error on their part. The call Mr P has referred to took place on 10 August
2022. This is the same day that TransUnion updated their records for Mr Ps address  as
supported by the date showing the link to Property B being last confirmed on 10 August
2022 by TransUnion. That Mr Ps details were corrected on the same day as the call hes
described, and in the absence of anything else to suggest otherwise, lead me to say his
version of events is more likely than not what happened.
I recognise that TransUnion relies on information from their data providers, and in this case
Mr P did not tell TransUnion directly that he had moved in 2016 - so TransUnion would only
have been able to create the Property B address link if they had been given credit reference
data that would have prompted them to do so.
I also recognise that while TransUnion provided trace results to Company S, this information
was for Company S to use and decide for themselves if they were satisfied they had the
correct debtor. It would therefore be unfair to hold TransUnion fully responsible for Company
Ss actions.
That said, given the lack of forthcoming evidence, based on the limited submissions and
evidence I do have available to me, I am minded to say TransUnion more likely than not did
not maintain accurate and up to date details for Mr P. And I think TransUnion more likely
than not had a part to play in what went wrong here for Mr P.
In the circumstances, I think that being chased for a debt that is not yours is no doubt
upsetting, worrying and an inconvenience for an individual to put right. The matter took
several months to resolve and so I am minded to say that £300 is fair to reflect this. I
consider compensation of this amount fair where the impact of a mistake (or mistakes) has
caused considerable upset and worry and/ or significant inconvenience and disruption. I
think this describes Mr Ps experience.
Responses to my provisional decision 
Mr P replied to my provisional decision. While Mr P continued to express his wider concerns 
about TransUnion, he provided no further evidence or submissions for me to consider in 
relation to this case. 
TransUnion also responded to my provisional decision and said they had nothing further to 
add. 
As both parties responded to my provisional decision before the deadline given, I am now in 
a position to set out my final findings on this matter.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Because neither Mr P nor TransUnion have offered me any further submissions or evidence 
to consider, I see no reason to alter my conclusions from those set out in my provisional 
decision and the provisional findings above. That is, for the reasons above I find that 
TransUnion most likely did not keep accurate and up to date records for Mr P on their credit 
file, therefore TransUnion more likely than not had a part to play in Mr P being chased for a 
debt that was not his.
In the circumstances, I think £300 is a fair and reasonable sum for TransUnion to pay Mr P 
to recognise the impact their involvement in these events have had on him. 
Putting things right
TransUnion International UK Limited, trading as TransUnion must pay Mr P £300. 
My final decision
For the reasons above, my final decision is that I uphold Mr Ps complaint. TransUnion 
International UK Limited, trading as TransUnion should put things right as Ive set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 October 2023.
