K821x#15Complaint
Mrs W complains that National Westminster Bank  Plc (NatWest) told her an account  was 
closed in January  2017. Mrs W complains  the information was wrong and shes 
subsequently incurred account  fees and interest  which have substantially increased  the 
amount she owes. 
Background
The background to this complaint an my initial conclusions  were set out in my provisional 
decision dated 15 February 2021. In my provisional decision I explained why I intended to 
uphold this complaint and how I thought NatWest should  resolve  it. I said:  
Background
Mrs W had a student account with NatWest  that had an overdraft. Mrs W says in 2015 or 
2016 and agreed to make repayments  to the account to reduce the outstanding balance, 
under a forbearance agreement. By 30 January 2017 the outstanding balance had reduced 
to £731.90.
Mrs W says she visited  a branch of NatWest around this time and asked about  her account. 
Mrs W says she was told the account was closed, so she didnt make any further payments. 
In 2019 Mrs W contacted NatWest about the account and it came to light it remained open 
and had been incurring monthly  account charges and interest. As a result, the outstanding  
balance had increased. Mrs W complained that the information given in branch was wrong 
and NatWest responded on 22 January  2019.  NatWest accepted Mrs W had been 
incorrectly told her account had been repaid but didnt  offer to reduce the outstanding 
balance or compensate her. 
Mrs W referred her complaint to our service and it was passed to an adjudicator.  In 
NatWests file submission to our service,  the complaint  handler  said the final response  was 
wrong and didnt agree Mrs W had been told by the branch her account had been closed. 
The adjudicator didnt uphold Mrs Ws complaint  and she asked to appeal.  
Mrs Ws case was passed to me and I took the step of issuing a provisional decision. I was 
satisfied Mrs W had been incorrectly told her account was closed, which meant  she stopped 
making repayments to the outstanding balance. I was also satisfied  that Mrs W hadnt  looked 
at her statements because reminders were  being  sent to an email address  she no longer 
used. I said that, as Mrs W thought  the account  was closed,  she had no cause  to check her 
statements. 
I asked NatWest to reduce the outstanding balance to £731.90, what  Mrs W owed after her 
last repayment  was made, take steps to arrange an affordable repayment plan and stop 
applying interest. I also said NatWest should take steps to amend Mrs Ws credit file to 
reflect the outstanding balance in January  2017  and remove any adverse  information 
reported after that date. 
I asked Mrs W and NatWest to respond with any additional information they wanted me to 
consider. Mrs W responded  to say she didnt have anything further  to add. 
Ref: DRN74611002NatWest didnt accept  my provisional decision.  It responded  to say that the forbearance  plan 
was agreed in December 2015 and ran for three months. NatWest advised  that following 
payments and refunds, Mrs Ws account  was within its overdraft limit from May 2016.  
NatWest said the timing of Mrs Ws branch visit had changed and that she didnt initially say 
it was in January  2017. NatWests response  didnt agree that Mrs W had been incorrectly 
advised by its branch  that her account was closed. NatWest also didnt agree that refunding  
interest and charges to bring  the balance down to what was owed in January 2017  was the 
right way to resolve  the complaint. NatWest said the overdraft debt should remain liable for 
interest in line with the overdraft arrangements in place. In addition, it confirmed the account 
remains open on its systems. NatWests response explained that due to the way its systems 
work, it cant  make the requested changes to Mrs Ws credit  file. 
My provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Id like to thank Mrs W and NatWest for 
their patience whilst the complaint has been  with us. Ive taken  the step of issuing a follow  up 
provisional decision as NatWest has made some points in its response that have changed  
my view of how to fairly resolve Mrs Ws complaint. I still think  Mrs Ws case  should be 
upheld, but I think  NatWest has made some points that have an impact on how to fairly 
approach the settlement. 
I understand there isnt direct record of Mrs W being informed by NatWests branch staff that 
her account  was closed.  Ive considered  what Mrs W has told us when bringing the 
complaint, as well as the supporting information  and account  statements. Mrs W has told us 
she previously agreed  a payment plan with NatWest  and it has subsequently provided 
contact notes that show a three-month plan was set up in December 2015.  Mrs W made  
various payments  and refunds were also applied by NatWest, around May 2016, that 
brought the account balance under the agreed overdraft limit. Thats  in line with what  Mrs W 
has told us. 
After the refunds were applied, Mrs W went on to make repayments of around  £730 in the 
period leading up to 30 January 2017, which  brought  the outstanding balance  down  to 
£731.90. It was around this time that Mrs W says she was told by NatWests branch that her 
account had been closed.  
Where information is disputed or incomplete,  Ill make my decision based on the balance  of 
probabilities. That is, what I consider most  likely to have occurred based on all the available 
evidence and information. In this case, whilst I understand there is no record of Mrs Ws 
branch visit, I think its more likely than not that she was told her account had been  closed.  
The reason  I say that is because Im satisfied Mrs W was making reasonably large  and 
regular repayments  to try and reduce  her outstanding overdraft balance. Her intention  
appears to have been to repay  the outstanding balance on an account she didnt use. The 
payments stopped in January 2017  as Mrs W says she was told the account was closed. 
Overall, I think its more  likely than not that Mrs W stopped making  payments because  she 
was told by branch  staff that her account was closed. Im not persuaded that it is more  likely 
that, after making a clear  effort  to reduce and repay  the overdraft balance, Mrs W simply  
stopped making  further payments. Whilst I note NatWests response,  I still think Mrs W was 
told her account had been closed. 
Ref: DRN74611003I previously said that NatWest should  refund  interest  and charges applied  after 30 January 
2017 as I think  that is close  to the point she was most likely  told her account  had been 
closed. The balance  was £731.90. Whilst I understand Mrs W feels NatWests error should  
mean there is nothing  further to pay, I have to take into account that the outstanding balance 
at this point did represent money she owed to NatWest. So, I think its fair for NatWest to ask 
Mrs W to repay £731.90. 
NatWests response to my previous decision said that it isnt fair to ask it to administer the 
debt interest free going forward as the overdraft has interest payable.  Ive considered this 
point, and I agree that NatWests overdraft has interest associated with it. Had Mrs W not 
been given misleading information  in branch, the remaining £731.90 wouldve still been 
subject to interest. So once the balance is reduced to that level, I think  it would be fair for 
NatWest to start applying  interest again.  
NatWest has explained  that, if it puts a payment plan in place it will reflect  on Mrs Ws credit 
file. But, it also said that refunding interest and charges to £731.90 would bring the account  
balance back within the agreed overdraft limit. As a result, NatWest  has pointed out Mrs W 
could then make repayments  to reduce  the amount owed  over time without the need for a 
formal repayment  plan. Again, I think NatWest makes a reasonable point and that bringing 
the account balance within the overdraft limit will mean Mrs W can make repayments to the 
remaining balance without  the necessity of a formal arrangement.  
The account  wasnt closed and remains open on NatWests systems so there is no need for 
it to reopen the account. 
I also asked NatWest to amend Mrs Ws credit file to reflect  the outstanding balance from 
30 January 2017  of £731.90 and remove any adverse information reported  from that date 
onwards. NatWest responded to say that, due to the nature of its systems, it cant make that 
sort of amendment.  I understand that systems limitations may make my original settlement 
difficult to put in place. But I still dont think the information NatWest has reported accurately 
reflects how Mrs W has handled her account or the information she was given. 
In a situation like this, it can be difficult for credit reference information to reflect the 
individual circumstances  around an account.  But whats  important here is that the 
information thats recorded  about  this account is as accurate as it can be, so Mrs W isnt 
disadvantaged by this. Continuing to report the account as it is would mean that, in my view,  
whats recorded isnt accurate  and so that would be unfair to Mrs W. So, if NatWest  cant 
amend the information reported  as set out above, I think  the fairest approach  is for it to 
remove its entry from Mrs Ws credit  file entirely.  
I understand NatWest  is required  to report accurate  information to the credit reference 
agencies, but for the reasons Ive given above,  Im not persuaded that the details currently 
reported do that. And I think  that between continuing  to record what it is and removing any 
record of the account   the latter is fairer and more  reasonable in the individual 
circumstances here.
I still think the incorrect information that was most  likely  given by NatWests branch has 
caused Mrs W distress  and inconvenience. It was clearly distressing for Mrs W to find out 
she owes a substantial sum, despite  being  told her account was closed. So, I remain  of the 
view that NatWest should pay Mrs W £200  for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Ref: DRN74611004Taking all the available information  into account, I still think Mrs Ws complaint should be 
upheld. As the basis for my decision has changed, Ive taken  the step of issuing a 
provisional decision to allow  both parties to respond. 
In asked Mrs W and NatWest  to respond  with any new information or comments  they wanted  
me to consider before I made my final decision. 
Mrs W responded to say she would like to resolve  the situation  as soon as possible and will 
attempt to repay the outstanding overdraft balance over the next few months. 
NatWest responded  and said it agreed to the actions I set out in the provisional decision.  But 
NatWest said that, after it completes  the refund, it cant  backdate  the balance on Mrs Ws 
credit file. NatWests response  confirms  it hasnt recorded any adverse information  on Mrs 
Ws credit file. NatWest  adds that as Mrs Ws account is showing on as satisfactory on her 
credit file and lenders  only consider  the current balance, not what  was outstanding 
previously. 
NatWest also responded  to say that once  the refund has been applied, Mrs W can make 
repayments directly to the account to reduce the outstanding balance  of the overdraft, which  
has a limit of £1,250.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I said in my provisional decision,  the correct outstanding balance should be £731.90 and 
if Mrs W chooses to apply  the £200 award  for distress and inconvenience to the debt that will 
reduce it to £531.90.  
Mrs W has asked  about arrangements for reducing the balance going forward.  Mrs W can 
deposit money into the account to reduce how much she owes. And NatWest  has confirmed 
the overdraft limit is £1,250. Once Mrs W has made  payments  to repay  the outstanding 
balance, she can ask NatWest to close the account if she wishes. 
NatWest has told us it hasnt reported and adverse information and it isnt possible to 
backdate the outstanding balance on Mrs Ws credit file to show £731.90 from 30 January 
2017. I take NatWests  point, but in my provisional  decision I said that Im not persuaded the 
balances it has reported since  30 January  2017  accurately reflects  what happened with Mrs 
Ws account. I remain  of that view. 
I said that NatWest should either amend Mrs Ws credit file to reflect she owed £731.90 from 
30 January 2017  or remove the relevant entry from her credit  file. Ive thought about 
NatWests comments on how other lenders may look at Mrs Ws credit file, but I remain  of 
the view that the two options I gave in my provisional decision are the fairest way to resolve  
Mrs Ws case  for the same reasons. So, if NatWest cant amend the balance reported 
since 30 January 2017  to £731.90, as set out in my provisional decision,  it should remove 
the relevant entry from Mrs Ws credit file. 
Ref: DRN74611005Neither party has provided new information that has persuaded me to change the 
conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.  As a result,  Im going  to proceed in line 
with the settlement I previously set out and uphold Mrs Ws complaint. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I uphold Mrs Ws complaint  and direct  National Westminster Bank Plc to 
settle as follows:  
-Refund all fees and interest  applied to Mrs Ws account after 30 January 2017, 
bringing the outstanding balance to £731.90
-Amend Mrs Ws credit file to show she owed £731.90 from 30 January 2017  
onwards. Remove any adverse  information  that may have  been  reported from that 
date. If this approach  isnt possible,  NatWest should remove  the relevant entry from 
Mrs Ws credit file 
-Pay Mrs W £200 for the distress and inconvenience  caused
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2021.
