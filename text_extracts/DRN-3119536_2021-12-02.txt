The complaint
Mrs R has complained MoneyGram International Limited, trading as MoneyGram, didnt 
refund money she was unable to send in February 2020.
What happened
In February 2020 Mrs R went to a local MoneyGram outlet to send money abroad for her 
grandchildrens education. This wasnt delivered successfully and Mrs R complained to 
MoneyGram. They wrote to her within a few days giving her the relevant code to enable her 
to pick up the refund from a MoneyGram outlet.
Mrs R  with the help of a close friend  believes she failed to pick up the refund. As this was 
only available for 90 days she feels she never got the money back. Mrs R brought her 
complaint to the ombudsman service.
Our investigator got hold of screenshots of MoneyGrams internal system. Along with copies 
of a completed Send Money form he believed this showed Mrs R had picked up the refund in 
March 2020. Shed then successfully sent money overseas again.
Mrs R didnt believe this fitted her recollection of what happened. She was still trying a few 
months later to get hold of her money and found MoneyGram outlets unwilling to help.
Mrs Rs complaint has been referred to an ombudsman for decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator. Ill explain why.
Like Mrs R, I can see MoneyGram responded to her complaint in February 2020. Ive also 
seen evidence of Send Money forms  as well as MoneyGrams internal system 
screenshots. As our investigator explained, these confirm Mrs R picked up the refund on 
6 March 2020 and then arranged to re-send the money abroad to her grandchildren. The 
internal screenshot confirms both the refund and the further transaction.
I absolutely appreciate that Mrs R may not recall this in the same way. However Ive seen no 
other evidence to contradict MoneyGrams records. So for example Mrs R doesnt dispute 
making another transaction on 6 March 2020 and this is coincidentally a month after her 
initial rejected attempt at payment. So I think this sounds quite feasible.
I also appreciate that this happened just before the first period of national lockdown. Im sure 
this may have impacted Mrs R. As she, along with so many of us, may have had other 
serious issues around this period, this could have effected how she remembers this period.
Overall I dont think its fair and reasonable to ask MoneyGram to do anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is not to uphold Mrs Rs complaint against 
MoneyGram International Limited, trading as MoneyGram.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 December 2021.
