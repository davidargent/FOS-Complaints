K821x#15complaint
Mr T says Elevate  Credit  International Limited  trading as Sunny  irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 38 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr T between  October  2016 
and July 2018. Mr Ts borrowing history is summarised at the end of this decision. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ts complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because he had a few loans with Sunny as well as other short-
term lenders. Sunny  disagreed but offered to uphold Mr Ts complaint about loan 16 
onwards. Mr T declined Sunnys offer. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr T could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN48463352Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.  Having  done so, Im partially  upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 3. Mr T 
didnt respond  to the view. As there is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about  these 
loans, I wont be making  any findings  on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 4 to Mr T and the results  of these checks  
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Ts fourth loan in just two weeks,  I think Sunny 
should have been looking to build  a clearer picture  about Mr Ts finances before lending  him 
this loan. 
In the space of 14 days  Mr T had borrowed £700. I think  the fact Mr T was borrowing in 
quick succession should have caused some concern to Sunny. As that might be the sort of 
behaviour that would indicate someone  was facing problems managing their money and 
needing to fill a gap in their finances.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think that this point was reached by loan 10. I say 
this because at this point Sunny ought  to have realised Mr T was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr T had taken out 10 loans in six months. So Sunny ought  to have 
realised it was more likely that Mr Ts indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. He also 
wasnt really making any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Mr T had paid large 
amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
Also, Mr Ts first loan was for £350  and loan 10 was for £250.  At this point Sunny shouldve  
known that it was unlikely Mr T was borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall  in his income 
and instead the borrowing had become an ongoing need.  
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny provided  borrowing for loan 6 because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
Ref: DRN48463353putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr T paid on loans 4 to 38;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative  information about  loans 4 to 9 from Mr Ts credit file;
the number of loans  taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded about  
them is adverse.  So, all entries  about loans  10 to 38 should be removed from Mr Ts 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr T a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ts complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 February  2020.
