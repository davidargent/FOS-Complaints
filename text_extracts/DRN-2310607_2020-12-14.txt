The complaint
Mr M says Mutual Clothing and Supply Company Limited (Mutual) lent to him irresponsibly. 
He says that Mutual didnt make proper affordability checks before lending. If it had done this 
it wouldve seen that he had other loans and not lent to him. He says the interest was very 
high and he was forever paying it off. 
What happened
This complaint is about 16 home collected loans Mutual provided to Mr M between January

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He said that Mutual shouldnt have approved 
any lending after loan 4 as the lending pattern itself was harmful.
Mutual disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. Ive read what Mutual have said and a brief 
summary is below:
our adjudicator hasnt fully understood the product, its not the same as a payday 
loan
the loans are not high interest or expensive
the adjudicator didnt properly consider Mr Ms circumstances or consider what 
proportionate checks were needed. The checks Mutual did were proportionate for 
each loan and the loans were affordable
its not appropriate to use an arbitrary loan number to uphold the complaint from. And 
there is no evidence to support the adjudicators conclusions that the length of time 
over which the consumer borrowed makes the loans unsustainable
repeat lending, and long-term use of home credit, is not necessarily harmful to 
consumers
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Mutual has had other decisions from this Service which detail our approach to complaints 
and what we think about the rules and regulations that surround the sale of this type of 
credit. So Mutual should be aware of our approach to these issues and I dont intend to 
go into detail on that here. But a brief summary of this is below.
Mutual needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mutual should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and have explained why below.Mutuals response concerns how it defines the cost of the credit and the risk of it to Mr 
M. It also talks about our approach to repeat lending. This Service has responded to 
Mutual on these issues in detail through other final decisions and the published 
decisions on our website. So Im not going deal with these points at length here.
I will say briefly that I consider it reasonable to describe this lending as high cost credit. And 
while I note it has a longer term than, for example, a payday loan that does not make it a 
low risk, or inexpensive, option for a consumer. And, as such, long-term use of these 
products can be harmful to a consumer. The FCA has not said anything to the contrary on 
this point. I have considered these issues alongside everything else in making my decision.
Mr M accepted our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 3. Because of this I dont think 
there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans  although, for the avoidance of 
doubt, from what Ive seen I agree that it wasnt unfair of Mutual to have provided these 
loans. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr M had with Mutual. So, they are 
something I will take into account when considering the other loans he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 4 to 16 because I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Mutuals lending 
history with Mr M, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Mutual should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Mutual should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ms case, I think that this point was reached 
by loan 4. And this isnt an arbitrary number but is based on the individual 
circumstances of this case, including the consumers lending pattern. This is because:
At this point Mutual ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr M had been indebted to Mutual for over two years. So Mutual ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Mr Ms indebtedness was unsustainable.
Mr Ms first loan was for £3,144 and loan 4 was also for a high amount at £1,350. 
And this was the latest in a line of loans of reasonably high amounts. 
Right from the start Mr M was provided with a new loan when he had either just 
settled a previous loan or when he still had other loans outstanding. Mr M hadnt 
repaid loans 2 and 3 when he took loan 4. 
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Mutual. Loan 16 was 
taken out over ten years after Mr Ms first. And it was for a much larger amount. Mr M 
had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Mutual over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Mutual continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 4 to 16 and Mutual should put things right.
Putting things rightIn deciding what redress Mutual should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Mr M from loan 4, as Im satisfied it ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mr M may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Mr M in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mr M would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Mutuals liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
Mutual shouldnt have given Mr M loans 4 to 16.
A) Mutual should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B) Mutual should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr M 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr M originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Mutual should pay Mr M the total of A plus B.
D) The overall pattern of Mr Ms borrowing for loans 4 to 16 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Mr Ms credit file. If 
Mutual has sold any of the loans Mutual should ask the debt purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mutual to deduct tax from this interest. Mutual should 
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax Mutual has deducted, if they ask for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Mutual Clothing and Supply Company Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 January 2021.
