K821x#15complaint
Mr D says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly lent 
to him.
background
This complaint is about 18 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr D between  April and 
September 2018. There is a table at the end of this decision which shows some  of the 
information Sunny has provided about  the lending.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ds complaint in part and thought loans 6 to 18 should  not have  
been given. Sunny didnt  agree in full  it made an offer for loans 11 to 15 only. Mr D didnt 
accept this offer so the complaint has now been  passed to me to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr D could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
Ref: DRN76338012the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.
Mr D hasnt disagreed  with our adjudicators opinion on loans 1 to 5 so I wont  be looking at 
these any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Mr Ds other  lending.  
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr D, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ds case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr D was not managing  to repay  their 
loans sustainably. Mr Ds overall  pattern of borrowing suggested that he had become 
persistently reliant on short-term loans. Mr D had borrowed on six occasions in two 
months and whilst the amounts fluctuated, they didnt significantly decrease over this 
period and for the rest of the borrowing relationship with Sunny. Mr D had also had 
several applications declined by Sunny  so he had approached  Sunny nine times for 
loans in two months. Mr D was also borrowing from other lenders at the same time 
which a proportionate check would have shown. Therefore by the time loan 6 was 
taken, Sunny ought to have realised  it was more likely than not Mr D was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ds indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ds first loan was for £500 and loan 6 was for £450. The amount hadnt 
significantly decreased.  At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mr D was not 
likely borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall in their income  but to meet an ongoing 
need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr D was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one or sometimes  when already paying for a previous  Sunny loan. 
Mr D wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  18 was 
taken out five months after Mr Ds first. Mr D had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr D lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
Ref: DRN76338013these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans which Mr D borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 18 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 6 to 18;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 18 should be removed from   
Mr Ds credit file.
If Mr D still owes  Sunny any of the principal  balance he borrowed on his final loan
Sunny should  remove all the interest  and charges applied to the outstanding balance.
Sunny should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Mr D went to towards
the principal. But importantly, Sunny needs  to make sure that Mr D doesnt repay more
than the principal amount borrowed.
If after doing this Mr D hasnt repaid  the principal he borrowed Sunny can deduct this
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr D has already paid enough to repay the
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple interest from the
date of payment  to the date of settlement.
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr D.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr D a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ds complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 May 2020 .
