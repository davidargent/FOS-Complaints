The complaint
Mr M complains about the delays by Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as 
Audi Finance, in collecting a car when he ended his hire purchase agreement. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr M wanted to return his car in September 2019 because his hire purchase 
agreement was ending at the end of that month but Audi Financial Services told him 
that it could take up to four weeks for the car to be collected;
Mr M says that he was advised that he could voluntarily terminate the agreement and 
chose to do so  but was then told that there would still be a delay in the car being 
collected;
because of that he says that he had to pay for the car to have an MOT test and 
incurred additional road tax costs - and that Audi Finance should have arranged for 
the car to be collected before the end of September 2019;
I can understand the frustration that Mr M clearly feels because the car couldnt be 
collected before the end of September 2019, but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that Volkswagen Finance has breached the terms of its 
agreement with Mr M or that its acted incorrectly in its dealings with him;
nor am I persuaded that Audi Finance was required to provide Mr M with more 
information about the collection process or that it should have collected the car 
before the end of September 2019; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Audi Finance to reimburse any costs to Mr M, to pay him any other compensation or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 November 2020.
