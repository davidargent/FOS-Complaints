The complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) declined to apply their 
seller protection policy for his transaction following a chargeback claim made by a buyer. 
What happened
Mr P sold an item through an online platform for £444.99 and used PayPal as the method for 
receiving payment. Mr P says the item was sent to the buyer and was received by him on 19 
April 2021. The buyer then raised a chargeback claim through their own card issuer on 10 
June claiming the transaction was unauthorised and the payment was reversed. 
Mr P says he provided PayPal with proof of delivery but they decided not to apply their seller 
protection policy and reimburse Mr P, and they also applied a chargeback fee. So, Mr P 
complained. PayPal responded and didnt uphold Mr Ps complaint. 
Our investigator looked into things for Mr P. He thought PayPal hadnt acted unfairly. Mr P 
disagreed so the matter has come to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. I understand Mr P will be 
disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have made this decision. 
I understand disputes will often arise in online platforms designed for buying and selling 
goods. Its therefore important for PayPal, being a payment platform, to have policies in 
place to help resolve those disputes. PayPal does have such policies, but what Ive 
considered here is whether PayPal have applied their policy fairly when dealing with the 
dispute. 
PayPal say Mr P is unhappy with the outcome of an external chargeback in which he was 
the seller. PayPal have provided information, including screenshots from their systems, 
which show that on 18 April 2021 Mr P received a payment of £444.99. On 10 June, PayPal 
were notified that the card holder of the card, used to make the purchase, had filed a 
chargeback with their card issuer.
PayPals User Agreement says a reversal can happen when they compensate the payer or 
the payers funding source provider because they receive a claim from the payer or their 
funding source provider for the payment amount under the reversal process used by that 
funding source provider. It then gives an example, if the payer used a card to fund the 
payment to a seller, the payer could pursue a chargeback with the card issuer. The User 
Agreement says the card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether the payer is successful 
when they pursue a chargeback.    
PayPal say, when a buyer files a chargeback, PayPal check to see whether the seller is 
covered by their Seller Protection Policy. This policy protects sellers from claims, 
chargebacks or reversals that are as a result of unauthorised purchases or items their 
buyers didnt receive. PayPal say Mr Ps transaction wasnt eligible for cover as they were 
unable to verify the tracking number provided by Mr P as proof of delivery. 
Ive looked at the PayPal Seller Protection policy, and this says, if a buyer has bought an 
item and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under reversals, claims or 
chargebacks, then a seller may be eligible for reimbursement under this policy. And, the 
PayPal Seller Protection entitles a seller to retain the full purchase amount. The policy goes 
further to say that the Seller Protection may also apply when a transaction is reversed 
because of a successful chargeback by a buyer. The policy then sets out the Basic 
requirements and says, to be eligible a number of requirements must be met. One of the 
requirements is Provide proof of shipment or delivery.  
I can see Mr P provided PayPal with a tracking number. PayPal have provided evidence 
which shows they used this tracking number but a message appears saying The tracking 
number you entered is not valid. The tracking number didnt return any results online. 
Taking into account the Paypal Seller Protection policy, I cant say PayPal have acted 
unfairly as the tracking number provided doesnt allow them to verify the item has been 
delivered so I cant say this meets PayPals requirement for Mr P to provide proof of 
shipment or delivery.  
I note Mr P says PayPals User Agreement doesnt require a seller to provide tracking 
information. The Seller Protection policy sets out what PayPal require as proof of delivery. 
This says PayPal require online or physical documentation from a shipping company that 
includes: an online and verifiable tracking number, date of delivery and delivered status, an 
address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the "Transaction Details" 
page and an address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or 
zip/postal code (or international equivalent). The policy does require a seller to provide an 
online and verifiable tracking number so I cant say PayPal have acted unfairly in requesting 
this. I understand Mr P says the item was heavy and can only be delivered using special 
delivery or pallet delivery service  and online tracking isnt normally available for this 
service. I do acknowledge this and I can see PayPals Seller Protection says Your choice of 
carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet 
the proof of delivery requirements. But, I think the policy does make it clear what PayPal will 
require as part of a Seller Protection claim.  
Although theres no tracking number, I have considered whether other information proves 
the item was delivered. I can see Mr P has provided a document headed Proof of delivery 
which contains the buyers name and address, the item and date and time the item was 
delivered. But, this document isnt on official letter headed paper for a shipping company. 
Ive also tried searching the company name but this hasnt produced details of a delivery 
company. 
Mr P has also provided photos which includes a photo of a parcel in a hallway which he says 
was taken by the delivery company. Mr P says this is proof the item was delivered. Mr P has 
also provided evidence of communication he had with the buyer. This shows a message 
from Mr P to the buyer to say the courier is on the buyers street but cant find their house. 
The buyer responds with their address details. I have carefully considered the information 
provided but Im not persuaded this proves the item was delivered. The photo of the parcel in 
a hallway doesnt show the buyers door number and communication between Mr P and the 
buyer doesnt indicate the item has been delivered.    I am sorry to disappoint Mr P but PayPals Seller Protection does require the seller to 
provide a tracking number. The tracking number provided by Mr P appears on the Proof of 
delivery document but its noted as an order number, not a tracking number. So, I 
understand why this hasnt produced any result when PayPal tried to track the item online. I 
do acknowledge Mr Ps reasons for why he doesnt have a tracking number but Ive looked 
at the other information provided by Mr P but cant say Im persuaded this proves the item 
was delivered.  
My final decision
For the reasons I have given, it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 March 2022.
