The complaint
Mr S complains that Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax will not refund him the money he 
lost due to him falling victim to an investment scam.
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to all parties, so I wont repeat what 
happened in detail.
In summary, Mr S was contacted by a binary options broker called Ivory Options (X) in 
August 2016. X persuaded Mr S to start investing with it and Mr S started making payments 
to X on 15 August 2016.
Mr S continued to make payments into the investment, making a final payment to X in 
February 2017. While Mr S was investing with X he was able to see what appeared to be a 
legitimate trading platform and he was also able to make substantial withdrawals.
Mr S made the following payments to X via his debit card:

Other than the withdrawals listed above Mr S has been unable to recover any of the money 
he paid into the investment.
Our Investigator considered Mr Ss complaint and thought it should be upheld in part. Halifax 
disagreed so this complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear from the information available that Mr S has fallen victim to a cruel scam. The 
evidence provided by both Mr S and Halifax sets out what happened. What is in dispute is 
whether Halifax should refund the funds Mr S lost due to the scam.
Recovering the payments Mr S made
Mr S made the payments into the scam via his debit card. When payments are made by card 
the only recovery option available to Halifax is to request a chargeback.
Chargeback is a voluntary scheme run by Visa whereby it will ultimately arbitrate on a
dispute between the merchant and customer if it cannot be resolved between them after two
presentments. Such arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme  so there are limited
grounds on which a chargeback can succeed. Our role in such cases is not to second-guess 
Visas arbitration decision or scheme rules, but to determine whether the regulated card 
issuer (i.e. Halifax) acted fairly and reasonably when presenting (or choosing not to
present) a chargeback on behalf of its cardholder (Mr S).
Halifax has told us that by the time Mr S contacted it about the payments, he was outside the 
required time limits (120 days) for Halifax to have attempted chargeback claims. Mr S told us 
he spoke to Halifax about the scam before this time limit had passed but neither Halifax nor 
Mr S have been able to show evidence this communication took place. 
Without evidence to support Mr Ss claim that he contacted Halifax within the allowed 
timescales, I dont have enough to say Halifax could have attempted chargeback claims on 
his behalf.
Should Halifax have reasonably prevented the payments Mr S made?
The payments Mr S was making into the scam were substantial. The third and fourth 
payments were made on the same day (21 September 2016) for the value of £10,000 each, 
a total of £20,000 on the same day to a relatively new payee. With this information alone I 
would have expected Halifaxs fraud prevention systems to have been triggered and for 
Halifax to have had a conversation with Mr S about what the payments were for.
In addition to the above, at the time Mr S made the payments to X alerts had been published 
on the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Investor alert portal, 
and this had been available for several months. The IOSCO is a well-recognised source, and we would expect firms like Halifax to have 
updated its internal watchlist within one month of the publication of the alert. And because of 
this, I think Halifax should have intervened when Mr S attempted the first payment to X.
Had Halifax updated its internal watchlists it would have seen that X was providing services 
in a region without the correct permissions, something you would not expect to see a 
legitimate business do and therefore it ought to reasonably have suspected it as a fraudster.
I think if Halifax had made this clear to Mr S, he would have at least carried out some 
research on X before continuing with his investment. For example, Halifax could have
directed Mr S to check whether X was regulated by the UK Gambling Commission which 
was a requirement at the time, and Mr S would have found X was not, and likely operating 
illegally.
So, I think Halifax should have stepped in and had a meaningful conversation with Mr S from 
the first payment he made, and if it had I think its unlikely Mr S would have made any 
payments to X. So, Halifax is responsible for Mr Ss loss.
Halifax has argued that the IOSCO warning is not detailed enough and does not carry as 
much weight as I have placed on it. It has also said that the FCA did not distribute a notice 
about X until after Mr S stopped making payments to it. But its our long-established 
approach that banks in the UK ought to have updated their watch lists based on international 
warning lists, such as the IOSCO, so I'm unsure why Halifax feels it only needs to focus on 
UK warnings from the FCA given our past lead final decisions on this subject that have 
always mentioned international warning lists too. So, these comments dont change my 
decision.
Halifax has also argued that the payment journey does not match that seen in scams that it 
sees usually, with multiple credits. Again, I dont think this makes a difference as scammers 
often allow withdrawals from scam investments as a way of gaining trust with their victims 
and to encourage them to invest more. I dont think this would be considered unusual in 
relation to an investment scam, or that it should have prevented Halifax from stepping in 
when Mr S made the first payment.
None of the arguments Halifax has raised change my decision that Halifax should have 
stepped in and warned Mr S about the potential scam that was taking place.
Did Mr S contribute to his loss?
Despite regulatory safeguards, there is a general principle that consumers must still take
responsibility for their decisions (see s.1C(d) of our enabling statute, the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000).
In the circumstances, I do think it would be fair to reduce compensation on the basis that Mr
S should share blame for what happened. Mr S funded the investment with X in part by 
taking out two separate loans totalling £50,000. Mr S has told us that he likely gave 
misleading information when he took the loans as directed by X. I think this is likely as loans 
are not usually granted for investment purposes.
Although Mr S was under pressure to take the loans to fund the investment, I think the 
request by X to take out two separate loans to fund the investment should have raised red 
flags for him as I dont think it was reasonable for Mr S to assume this would be a request 
made from a legitimate broker, especially when Mr S was told to be dishonest in the application. I think this should have prompted Mr S to do more research on X, which in turn 
could have uncovered the scam. 
I think it would be fair to reduce compensation by 50% on the basis that Mr S should share
some blame for what happened.
Putting things right
I have explained above why I think Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax is responsible for 
some of the loss Mr S incurred because of this scam.
Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax should refund all the payments Mr S made into the 
scam less the refunds he received. It can also make a 50% reduction from this amount.
Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax should add 8% simple interest per year to the 
amount it pays Mr S from the time Mr S made the payments to the time Bank of Scotland plc 
trading as Halifax provides the refund (less any lawfully deductible tax).
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax to put things right 
as Ive outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2023.
