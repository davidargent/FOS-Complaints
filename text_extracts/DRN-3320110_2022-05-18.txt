The complaint
Mr M complains about irresponsible credit card lending made to him by NewDay Ltd trading 
as Aqua. He says he couldnt afford either the initial lending to him of £300 in July 2017, or 
the increase to £500 later in that year, and NewDay should have realised that. 
What happened
Mr M is supported by professional representatives in this complaint. But this remains his 
complaint, so Ill refer to him throughout. 
Mr M said he was already having financial difficulties when he made this application. He 
thought that NewDay should have realised this. By lending to him, Mr M said that NewDay 
had made a bad situation worse. 
Mr M sent us a copy of his credit report and bank statements, showing his financial position 
at the time. He wanted NewDay to refund all the interest and charges it had applied to 
lending on this card, to pay 8% statutory interest, and to remove any adverse marks from his 
credit file.
NewDay said it had done appropriate checks when it agreed the initial lending to Mr M, and 
when it later increased his credit limit. It sent us the information it had at the time, including 
Mr Ms declared income, his overall indebtedness, his previous credit problems, and a score 
provided by a credit reference agency, saying whether there was any cause for concern with 
Mr Ms finances. NewDay also showed us how Mr M used the card at the relevant times.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. He considered the checks that 
NewDay did when Mr M first applied for this lending, and looked at Mr Ms financial position 
at the time. 
Our investigator has provided considerable detail on why he thought NewDay should not 
have made this lending to Mr M. To summarise what I consider to be the key points - he 
noted that Mr M had a low income. Mr M also already had a history of defaults, and two 
publicly recorded debts, which were likely to be county court judgments. And the results from 
the credit reference agency indicated there was already cause for concern on Mr Ms credit 
file from his existing lending, before this new lending was made. 
Our investigator also obtained information from Mr M which showed a series of gaming 
transactions, each for small amounts but repeated to an extent which would have amounted 
to significant spending overall. He noted that Mr Ms overall indebtedness had increased 
markedly not long before he applied for this card.
Our investigator didnt think NewDay should have lent to Mr M in 2017. 
Our investigator also said there was no evidence Mr Ms overall financial position had 
improved by November 2017, when NewDay increased Mr Ms credit limit. He said Mr Ms 
overall debts had had nearly doubled in value in that time.
NewDay didnt change its mind. It said sufficient checks were done, and it was adamant that 
there were no indications of any financial strain. NewDay repeated that Mr M did not have 
any active payday loans, and no arrears at the time of the application. NewDay didnt 
address the specific points that our investigator had raised, and our investigator didnt 
change his mind. Because no agreement was reached, this case was passed to me for a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
When NewDay checked Mr Ms financial position in July 2017, it was aware of four previous 
defaults and two public debts. I agree with our investigator that it is most likely that these 
were county court judgments. Mr M hadnt cleared these historic debts at the time. He also 
had other outstanding credit, and what NewDay noted to be a low income. 
NewDay obtained a score from a credit reference agency, summarising Mr Ms overall 
indebtedness. NewDay has told us it doesnt have permission from the relevant agency to 
explain what lies behind the score of 50 that Mr M received at that time. But there is some 
publicly available information on this, and that says that a score this high shows clear cause 
for concern about Mr Ms existing financial position, before any additional lending was made.
So I think NewDay should have realised that there was cause for concern over Mr Ms ability 
to sustainably repay any additional lending, from the data it received in July 2017. And it also 
seems the rating NewDay received from the credit reference agency at the time provided a 
clear warning about this. I agree with our investigator that this suggested there was 
significant risk to Mr M in borrowing further. With that in mind, I think that NewDay should 
have investigated Mr Ms financial position more closely, before taking a decision to lend. 
If NewDay had investigated Mr Ms financial position more closely, then it seems likely that 
NewDay would have found that the annual income Mr M had declared, of £23,000, wasnt 
supported by his bank statements. I think it is very unlikely that, if NewDay had investigated 
further in July 2017, it would have decided that it could responsibly offer lending to Mr M.
Later in 2017, NewDay made a decision to extend Mr Ms available credit, from £300 to 
£500. NewDay has shown us that it was aware that Mr Ms overall indebtedness had almost 
doubled between August and September 2017. But at the start of October 2017, NewDay 
wrote to Mr M to offer additional credit. I dont think NewDay should have done this without 
investigating the reasons behind Mr Ms greatly increased overall lending. It doesnt appear 
to have done so. Although I appreciate that Mr M was managing his debt on this card, I think 
if NewDay had investigated the overall position of Mr M at this time, then again, it is very 
unlikely NewDay would have decided that it could responsibly offer him additional lending.
For these reasons, I also think this complaint should be upheld. And I have reached the 
same overall conclusion on the appropriate redress as our investigator.
NewDay must refund all the interest and charges Mr M has paid on this lending to date.If Mr M hasnt yet paid off this debt, NewDay must reduce the outstanding capital balance by 
the amount of this refund. If that doesnt clear the debt, then NewDay must make sure that 
the remaining debt isnt subject to any historic or future interest or charges. If it does clear 
the debt, then any surplus should be given back to Mr M and 8% simple interest should be 
added to the surplus. 
NewDay must also remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ms credit file as a result
of this lending.
My final decision
My decision is that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua must refund all the interest and charges Mr 
M has paid on this lending to date.
If Mr M hasnt yet paid off this debt, NewDay Ltd must reduce the outstanding capital 
balance by the amount of this refund. If that doesnt clear the debt, then NewDay Ltd must 
make sure that the remaining debt isnt subject to any historic or future interest or charges. If 
it does clear the debt, then any surplus should be given back to Mr M and 8% simple interest 
should be added to the surplus. (HM Revenue & Customs may require a business to take off 
tax from this interest. If it does, NewDay Ltd must give Mr M a certificate showing how much 
tax its taken off if he asks for one.)
NewDay Ltd must also remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ms credit file as a 
result of this lending.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 June 2022.
