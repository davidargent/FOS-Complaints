The complaint
Miss R complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA misled her about the ways she could 
pay her debt to it, is still reporting adverse information to her credit file about that debt, and 
gave her poor customer service.
What happened
When Miss R was 15 her parents opened a PayPal Credit account in her name. This was 
contrary to the accounts terms and conditions, which require account holders to be 18. This 
only came to light several years later, during a routine review of the account, and PayPal 
blocked the account, with Miss R owing PayPal a four-figure sum.
PayPal told Miss R that she could open a new account, but she could not continue to use the 
original one. There was then a protracted period of correspondence and phone calls, during 
which Miss R says that she was given conflicting information about how to make payments 
towards the account, and other topics. She says she was told in a phone call that it would 
not be possible to make a payment over the phone; PayPal disputes that she was told this. 
She also says that there were long periods when PayPal did not reply to her messages, and 
appeared to forget about her.
Meanwhile interest and charges were accruing on the account, and after about three months 
the account was defaulted. Some time later the debt was sent to a debt collection agency 
(although it was later taken back). Miss R complained to our Service about these matters, 
and she also said that PayPals staff had been rude to her on the phone. We referred that 
complaint to PayPal. At first, PayPal did not uphold Miss Rs complaint, since it maintained 
that it had done nothing wrong. But a few days later, PayPal changed its stance and agreed 
as a gesture of good will to reinstate her account and refund all of the interest and charges, 
which came to over Â£300. Miss R was prepared to accept that offer, provided that PayPal 
also agreed to remove the default and missed payments from her credit file. But PayPal was 
not willing to do that, because it said the data it had reported was accurate. So Miss R asked 
our Service to consider this complaint, having received PayPals final response to this 
matter. She wanted PayPal to amend her credit file and also to write off her whole debt.
Our investigator did not uphold this complaint. She said that PayPal had been entitled to 
close the account, and that she had seen no evidence that PayPals staff had been rude 
(albeit that PayPal had not agreed to share the call recordings due to data protection laws). 
She accepted that PayPal probably had been given conflicting information, but she thought 
that PayPals offer of refunds was fair compensation for that. She did not agree with Miss R 
that PayPal should have to amend her credit file, because she thought that Miss R had 
known that she could make payments to her account over the phone, even if someone had 
told her she couldnt, but she had not made any payments (except for one small payment). 
She thought Miss R had known this because of a message Miss R had sent to PayPal in 
which she had mentioned that one of her options was to call every month to make a 
payment. She also noted that this payment method was explained on PayPals website, 
which gave the phone number to call.1 So she concluded that Miss R had probably known 
how to make payments, but had either chosen not to or been unable to.
Miss R asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I do not uphold this complaint, for broadly the same reasons as our investigator. I will explain 
why.
I have read the terms and conditions for the account. It is not in dispute that the account 
should not have been opened for a 15 year-old, but the terms also say that payments can be 
made over the phone. I have also seen the online chat message, dated 27 June 2019, in 
which Miss R complained about the prospect of having to call PayPal every month to make a 
payment. So I think she knew that this was possible. There is no evidence that anyone told 
her she couldnt, but even if someone did tell her that (after she sent that message), 
PayPals website and the account terms and conditions say that she could. I therefore think 
that PayPal has been reporting accurate information to the credit reference agencies, and 
I will not order PayPal to remove it.
I dont know if PayPals staff were rude to Miss R on the phone, but I agree that they failed to 
respond to some of her messages, and that they sometimes gave her contradictory 
information about matters other than the ability to make payments over the phone. However, 
I think that the refunds PayPal has offered  and its offer is still open  are fair compensation 
for the poor customer service issues. (I note that PayPal intended its offer to cover the whole 
complaint, and not just the issues it accepts it could have dealt with better.)
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 January 2021.
