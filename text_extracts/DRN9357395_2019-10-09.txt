K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that Advanced Payment Solutions  Limited (trading as CashPlus) has 
repeatedly refused to help him recover two mistaken  transfers  hed made from his accounts  
held with it. 
background
Mr M told us hed made two mistaken transfers  from his CashPlus accounts. One was from 
his personal account,  which he operates as a sole trader, and the other was from his 
business account, held for a limited company he owned at the time. Our service has 
explained to Mr M that were not able to consider  the complaint  about his business account,  
because that company  no longer  exists.  This complaint  is about  his personal account.  
Mr M called CashPlus after he paid two lots of £14,000 in error to an account held by a 
business associate. He hadnt intended to make  the payments.  But CashPlus said there  was 
nothing it could do, and suggested  he should  contact the person or company directly.  
Mr M says hes contacted the receiving bank a number of times, and its holding  the money 
for him. Hes sent us the statements of the associate he paid the money to, which show  the 
receiving bank has taken  the money  out of that account. But it wont  pay it directly  to him, it 
wants to pay it back to the sending bank. Notes on Mr Ms file from CashPlus show that it 
has been contacted a number of times by the receiving bank about this refund. 
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. Mr M had told CashPlus that the 
payment was made in error, so she said it shouldve taken  reasonable steps to try to recover 
that money at the time, including contacting  the receiving bank. She thought that CashPlus 
should contact  the receiving bank now, to get Mr Ms money  back, and pay it to him. 
CashPlus didnt agree. It said it hadnt been told that Mr M had sent the payments to the 
wrong place. It had been told that Mr M hadnt  meant to send the payments at all. And 
CashPlus said it couldnt  retrieve  a payment under the relevant rules for that reason.
CashPlus said that the only other  option  was an indemnity claim if the payments were  
fraudulent, but they werent fraudulent either. If the recipient wouldnt return  the payments 
then that was a civil matter for Mr M to pursue.  
But our investigator said that the money had actually been recovered by the receiving bank, 
and was being held by that bank, which had been trying to contact CashPlus to give it back.  
So she asked why CashPlus couldnt  try to recover the money on behalf  of Mr M. 
CashPlus just said the same thing again. It wanted  an ombudsmans  decision on this case, 
so it was passed to me. 
my provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I proposed  to uphold it. 
This is what  I said then: 
-When this complaint came to me, I wrote  to CashPlus to say I thought it had made a 
mistake about what Mr M was complaining about. It thought  both mistaken payments 
were made from his company account,  but I said that two payments were made, one 
Ref: DRN93573952from each of Mr M's accounts. And I asked  for technical details, such  as the relevant 
industry guide, to show me that CashPlus couldnt recall the payments.  
-CashPlus refused to substantiate its argument  that it couldnt make a recall  request. It 
did not feel it relevant to pass on any guides  or documents at this time. It thought that if 
the payment had been made to a business  associate, he could just pay the money back.  
-Mr Ms shown  us evidence  that this money has been taken into safekeeping by the 
receiving bank.  Mr Ms associate  cant just pay it back. He no longer  has it. 
-CashPlus also said Mr M did have two accounts,  but it repeated that the initial complaint 
hed raised was for payments  made  from his limited  company account. And hed then 
waited five months to raise this again.  It responded  to his complaint on 10 December, 
and said two payments were  made  out of one of his accounts  on 11 June, one for 
£14,900 and one for £14,000. It thought that Mr M had changed his mind  about which  
payments were a mistake.
-CashPlus also sent us call recordings, which Ive detailed above.  Those  dont support 
what CashPlus says about Mr Ms initial complaint. CashPlus  also appears to have 
overlooked a complaint email Mr M sent in September. Ill set out what I think  happened.
-Ive listened  to the first call Mr M made,  just after the transfers were  done. He said then 
hed made two transfers for £14,000  by mistake. He may not have been clear that these 
payments came  out of two different accounts, but he didnt complain about a payment for 
£14,900. When CashPlus mentioned  that payment to him, he didnt remember it, 
although hed made it that morning. 
-CashPlus says Mr M wrongly  identified the payments on this call, but it seems to me that 
he was clear from the start that it was two payments of £14,000 that were made in error. 
Only one of those was made from his personal account, and thats the subject of this 
complaint.
-Mr M was very clearly  told on that call that there was nothing CashPlus  could  do, and 
hed have to pursue  this himself. 
-He rang again  the next day, and said again that he wanted  to cancel these two 
payments. He was clear then that one payment had come  out of his business  account, 
and the other had come out of his sole trader account. He repeated  that it was a mistake,  
and he needed  to cancel. He was told again there  was nothing that CashPlus could do. 
-CashPlus asks why, despite making numerous calls to it, Mr M didnt mention the 
mistaken payments  again until the end of the year. But Mr M said hed written  to 
CashPlus about this. He showed  us an email he sent on 15 September 2018,  to say that 
the receiving bank had his money,  and it wanted  CashPlus  to contact it to give the 
money back. 
-I know Mr M didnt  also raise  this problem on many of the calls he had during  this time, 
but I think thats partly because Mr Ms account  had been  blocked. He was trying to 
resolve that. 
-Mr M rang again towards the end of the year to say again that the other  bank had his 
money, and was waiting for CashPlus to recall the payment. CashPlus then said this 
Ref: DRN93573953bank needed to contact it. That doesnt  seem to fit with the Faster  Payments guidance 
on misdirected payments, which requires CashPlus to ask for the money  back. And 
CashPluss internal notes  say that the receiving bank had contacted it, a number of 
times, but Mr M still didnt  get his money back.
-CashPlus has said since that it couldnt  take action to recover the payments because of 
the particular sort of mistake that Mr M made.  It said the Faster Payments process for 
misdirected payments would only allow it to recall  payments that Mr M wanted to send, 
but which ended up in the wrong place. It said that process didnt apply to payments 
Mr M didnt intend  to send, so it couldnt  recall payments like this one under that process. 
-Ive checked  the available information about  the Faster Payments recall  process,  and 
thats just not clear  that the sort of mistake Mr M made isnt covered. So I asked 
CashPlus for evidence  this is how the relevant agreements work, but it hasnt sent that. 
-It isnt clear to me that CashPlus made  its decision  not to recall the payments Mr M 
made, for the reasons  its now giving. There was no discussion, on any of the calls Ive 
listened to, of the rules for recovering  money transferred by mistake, or any explanation 
of why Mr M fell outside those.  The call handlers  Mr M has spoken to, in a series of calls, 
didnt seem to know that a business  that sends a mistaken  payment would usually be 
responsible for recalling  it. Rather,  CashPlus has just kept saying that this was 
something Mr M had to sort out, and it wouldnt help.  It has, at some points, explained to 
him in some detail  that it doesnt have  any responsibility to help him, even when call 
handlers broke off to take advice then returned  to the call. That doesnt  seem to me to be 
consistent with the usual approach  to mistaken payments. 
-The limited information available to me about  the Faster  Payments recall  process,  and 
the content of the calls I can hear between CashPlus and Mr M, make  me think 
CashPlus may have  just overlooked the possibility that it could  recall  this money. If 
CashPlus thinks thats wrong, then it can send me the technical  information about the 
recall process, to show it just isnt possible for this payment to be recalled using that 
process.
-But without that further evidence, my current view is that its more likely that CashPlus 
could have attempted to recall this payment, and that it shouldve done  so. That makes 
me think that Mr M has received  extremely poor service indeed from CashPlus,  over a 
prolonged period of time. I currently think that CashPlus  should  pay Mr M £350 for that 
poor service. 
-Without the requested evidence, to show that CashPlus is prevented from acting in this 
case, I would expect it to implement a recall of Mr Ms wrongly sent payment, made from 
his sole trader account on 11 June 2018 for £14,000. 
-CashPlus says this account is now closed. Mr M says its still open,  and it was his limited  
company account that was closed. It is possible that CashPlus is just confused  about 
this. But if Mr Ms sole trader account  has been  closed, and if CashPlus considers that 
this recall cant be attempted without reopening the account, it should reopen  it, for this 
purpose only. CashPlus doesnt have to allow any other use of the account, or leave it 
open once the funds  are successfully recalled and paid to Mr M.
-It will take some time for a recall to be attempted, and I dont know  if it will be successful 
or not. If its not, then Mr M may wish to complain about that, in due course.  
Ref: DRN93573954-If CashPlus continues to believe that its not permitted to make this recall,  it may now 
wish to evidence that in detail, before I reach my final decision. 
I invited the parties  to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Mr M contacted us to say he accepted  the decision.  CashPlus  contacted us to ask for further 
time to provide  a reply. We agreed  to this, but this extended deadline has now passed, and 
no further information has been  received. In the interests of fairness  to both sides,  I think  this 
complaint should  now be finalised.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I havent changed my mind.
my final decision
My decision  is that Advanced Payment Solutions  Limited (trading as CashPlus) must pay 
Mr M £350 in compensation. 
Advanced Payment Solutions  Limited  (trading as CashPlus)  must also attempt to recall the 
payment Mr M made from his sole trader account on 11 June 2018 for £14,000. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 November 2019.
