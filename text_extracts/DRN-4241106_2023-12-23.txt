The complaint
G a limited company complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly 
closed its bank accounts which led to loss of business and inconvenience.
Gs complaint has been brought to our service by its director, Mr K.
What happened
The detailed background of this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide 
a brief overview of some of the key events here.
G had two business current accounts with NatWest. G also had a two loan accounts, 
including a bounce back loan (BBL). In November 2022, NatWest reviewed Gs accounts 
and wrote to Mr K asking him to provide information about how hed used the BBL hed been 
granted and for some information about transactions that had taken place in 2020. NatWest 
told Mr K that hed have until 12 January 2023 to provide the information.
On 14 December 2022, NatWest sent Mr K a chaser for the information it had asked him to 
provide. The bank said that if Mr K didnt provide the information Gs accounts might be 
restricted. On 23 December 2022, NatWest wrote to Mr K to let him know that following a 
review it had decided to close Gs accounts, giving him 60 days notice that hed need to 
make other banking arrangements for his business. 
Mr K says he was shocked and confused when he received the closure letter as he believed 
he still had a couple of more weeks to provide the information NatWest wanted. So, he 
contacted NatWest to try and find out what was happening. He told the bank that he was 
unhappy Gs accounts were going to be closed because he hadnt yet provided the 
information. He explained that he had a number of businesses which carried out thousands 
of transactions so finding specific information relating to historical transactions wasnt easy. 
In response, NatWest said it had decided to close Gs accounts following a review, so it 
wasnt anything to do with information Mr K hadnt provided. 
Mr K complained to NatWest. In response NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong and 
was complying with its legal and regulatory obligations when it had reviewed Gs accounts. 
NatWest also said that the accounts had been closed in line with the account terms and 
conditions.
Unhappy with this response, Mr K brought Gs complaint to our service where an investigator 
considered it. Mr K said that the closure of the accounts had led to loss of business, and he 
had to go to the trouble of opening new banks accounts, setting up direct debits and 
reorganising Gs financial commitments, all of which was stressful and inconvenient. 
The investigator asked NatWest to provide more information about why it had decided to 
close Gs accounts. But NatWest said it couldnt provide anything more than it had already 
provided to us. The bank maintained that it hadnt treated G unfairly when it had closed its 
accounts. 
After looking at everything, the investigator said based on the limited information the bank 
had provided, he couldnt say the bank had treated G fairly when it had closed the accounts. 
So, he said NatWest should pay G Â£100 compensation, for the inconvenience the closures 
had caused. Mr K said hed accept the outcome if the accounts were also reopened.
In response to the investigators view NatWest provided more information about the reasons 
it closed Gs accounts. The investigator looked at everything again and said that NatWest 
hadnt treated G unfairly. Mr K disagreed. He wants to know why NatWest closed Gs 
accounts and wants the bank to reopen them. 
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would add too that our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat 
evidence from banks as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it contains 
security information, or commercially sensitive information. Some of the information NatWest 
has provided is information that we considered should be kept confidential. This means I 
havent been able to share a lot of detail with Mr K, but Id like to reassure him that I have 
considered everything.
Ill start by setting out some context for why NatWest reviewed Gs accounts. NatWest are 
strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and regulatory 
obligations. They can broadly be summarised as a responsibility to protect persons from 
financial harm, and to prevent and detect financial crime. Theyre also required to carry out 
ongoing monitoring of new and existing relationships. they may need to review activity taking 
place on accounts and ask customers for information, for example about payments, and 
information about the individuals operating the accounts  its entitled and obliged to carry 
out such checks. 
Following a review, banks and financial businesses sometimes decide to close an account. 
Each financial institution has its own criteria and risk assessment for deciding whether to 
continue providing accounts and providing an account to a customer is a commercial 
decision that a financial institution is entitled to take. Thats because it has the commercial 
freedom to decide who it wants as a customer. 
Banks are entitled to end their business relationship with a customer, as long as this is done 
fairly, doesnt breach law or regulations and is in keeping with the terms and conditions. And 
unless theres a good reason to do so, this service wont usually say that a bank must keep a 
customer. But they shouldnt decline to continue to provide an account without proper 
reason, for instance of unfair bias or unlawful discrimination. And they must treat new and 
existing customers fairly.
The terms and conditions of Gs accounts say that in certain instances NatWest can close 
accounts with immediate notice and by providing 60 days notice. NatWest wrote to Mr K in 
December 2022, giving G the full notice period that it was closing its accounts and that hed 
need to make alternative banking arrangements. This can be due to a number of reasons 
and a bank isnt obliged to give a reason to the customer. Just the same as if G decided to 
stop banking with NatWest, Mr K wouldnt have to explain why. Based on what NatWest has 
shared with this service, Im satisfied their actions were reasonable in the circumstances. And the banks decision to stop providing G with banking facilities was reached legitimately 
and fairly. So, I wont be asking NatWest to reopen Gs accounts.
I understand of course why Mr K wants to know the exact reasons behind NatWests 
decision to close Gs accounts. And I can see that Mr K has asked NatWest to explain itself 
on several occasions. But NatWest doesnt disclose to its customers what triggers a review 
of their accounts. And its under no obligation to tell Mr K the reasons behind the account 
review and closure, as much as hed like to know. So, I cant say its done anything wrong by 
not giving Mr K this information. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it to do so. 
Finally, Mr K says he was confused and shocked when he received NatWests letter about 
closing Gs accounts, because when he got it, he was still under the impression he had at 
least a few weeks to submit the information NatWest had requested. So, he says its unfair 
the bank closed Gs accounts because he didnt provide the information. 
I can understand why Mr K was confused and shocked by NatWests decision - one letter 
asked him to send information and then he received another that said the bank was closing 
the accounts. But I can see that the letter NatWest sent to him about closing Gs accounts 
clearly stated that the bank had decided to close Gs accounts following a review  it didnt 
mention anything to do with a failure to provide any information on Mr Ks part as the reason 
it didnt want G as a customer. Ive also seen an email dated 10 January 2023, that NatWest 
sent to Mr K which clarified this further. So, Im satisfied that the reason NatWest closed Gs 
accounts wasnt because of something Mr K hadnt done. And that this was clearly 
communicated to Mr K in the correspondence NatWest sent to him.
In summary, based on the evidence Ive seen, I cant say NatWest has acted unreasonably 
and treated G unfairly when it closed its accounts. So, I wont be asking NatWest to do 
anything more to resolve Gs complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask G to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 January 2024.
