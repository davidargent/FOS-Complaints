K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain  that the preferential period of a fixed  rate mortgage product they 
agreed to in September 2016  has been  shortened. 
The mortgage was arranged by an appointed representative of Connells Limited, so any 
reference I make to Connells in this decision  should be taken  to mean the individual broker  
where appropriate.
background
In September  2016 Mr and Mrs B applied for a mortgage through  Connells. Whilst they 
exchanged contracts  in October 2016 they didnt complete until February 2017 as it was a 
new-build property.  The mortgage completed on 24 February 2017 and was on a fixed rate 
of 1.85%,  running  until 31 October 2018.
Mr and Mrs B complained to Connells in September 2018 saying theyd been told their 
mortgage rate was coming to an end, but it shouldnt be ending  until February 2019 (two 
years after completion).
Our adjudicator didnt  think Connells  had done  anything wrong, and explained the rate had a 
set end date. Mr and Mrs B didnt agree and so the complaint  has been passed  to me to 
decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The fixed  rate Mr and Mrs B applied for was always due to end on 31 October  2018.  That 
was explained  in the contractual  mortgage offer of 29 September 2016 and the illustration of 
15 September 2016. It didnt matter whether the mortgage completed in October 2016 or 
February 2017, the fixed rate would  always only run until 31 October 2018.
Some lenders offer their fixed rates for a set time period (such as 24 months), others  offer 
their fixed  rates until a set date in time (such as until 31 October 2018).  Neither  is right or 
wrong, and both are completely acceptable  ways to set up a fixed  rate, provided the 
documentation sets out the details clearly.
Its apparent from the mortgage offer and illustration in this case that the fixed  rate would 
end on a set date regardless of it started and Mr and Mrs B accepted that offer.  Ive listened 
to the phone calls and looked at everything  thats been provided  by both sides  and none  of 
the evidence  points to Connells telling Mr and Mrs B anything different, so I cant say 
Connells has done anything wrong.
Mr and Mrs B have  said theyve got a legal team ready to deal with this if we dont find in 
their favour. Subject to any time limits or other  restrictions  a court  might  impose,  their right to 
take legal  action against Connells over the subject matter of this complaint wont have been  
prejudiced by our consideration  of the complaint.
