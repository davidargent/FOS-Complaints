K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains Stagemount Limited (trading as QuidMarket) lent to him irresponsibly.
background
The background to this complaint, and my initial findings on it, can be found  in my 
provisional decision which is attached to and forms a part of this final decision.
However, in brief summary  I concluded  that, of the ten loans it had given Mr S, QuidMarket 
shouldnt have lent him loans 3 to 10. I then invited both parties to comment: Mr S said he 
agreed with my provisional  findings, but QuidMarket did not respond.
The case  has now been passed back to me to review as the deadline for further submissions 
has expired.
my findings
Ive considered once  again all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general  approach  
to complaints about short-term lending - including  all of the relevant rules, guidance and 
good industry practice - on our website.
Neither party to the complaint has put forward any new arguments  or evidence for me to 
consider. In light of this I see no reason  to depart from the findings and conclusions  I 
reached in my provisional decision. This means I remain of the view that QuidMarket 
shouldnt have given  Mr S loans 3 to 10.
putting things right
QuidMarket shouldnt have given Mr S any of loans  3 to 10, so its not right that he should 
have had to pay interest,  fees or charges in relation  to these, or have them affect  his credit 
file in a negative way. So to put things right I direct QuidMarket to:
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr S towards interest,  fees and 
charges on loans 3 to 10.
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr S which were 
considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mr S originally  made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C.Pay Mr S the total of A plus B.
D.Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Ss credit  file in relation to loans 3 
to 10.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuidMarket  to deduct tax from this interest. QuidMarket 
should give Mr S a certificate  showing how much tax its deducted, if Mr S asks for one.
Ref: DRN08800452my final decision
I uphold Mr Ss complaint  in part, for the reasons explained above and in my attached 
provisional decision. I direct Stagemount  Limited  (trading as QuidMarket)  to take the actions 
outlined in the putting things right section of this final decision.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 June 2019.

background
Mr S took ten loans with QuidMarket between November  2013 and May 2015. Ive included  some of 
the information weve  received about these loans in the table below:

Mr S later complained about  his loans. Our adjudicator upheld his complaint and said loans 5 to 8 
shouldnt have been given to Mr S. QuidMarket  disagreed  so the complaint has been passed to me to 
review.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide provisionally whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints 
about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry  practice - on 
our website.
QuidMarket had to assess Mr Ss applications  for borrowing to check if he could afford  to pay back  
the amounts hed borrowed  without undue difficulty. It needed  to do this in a way which  was 
proportionate to the circumstances. QuidMarkets checks could have taken into account  a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being lent, the size of the repayments and Mr Ss income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough 
checks might have been proportionate.
Ref: DRN08800454But certain factors might  suggest QuidMarket  should  have done more  to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Mr S. These  factors include:
Mr S having  a low income (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid  being especially  high (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to 
meet a higher repayment  from a particular level of income); 
Mr S having  a large number of loans and/or having these  loans over a long period of time 
(reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, 
or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr S coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable  for Mr S.
QuidMarket was required to establish whether Mr S could sustainably  repay his loans  not just 
whether he technically had enough money to make his repayments. Having enough money  to make 
the repayments could of course  be an indicator  that Mr S was able to repay his loans sustainably. But 
it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case. The FCAs  Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  
states payments are sustainable if they are made without undue  difficulties and in particular, made on 
time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments  and without having  to borrow to make them. If a 
lender realises, or ought  reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments without borrowing further,  then it follows that it should conclude those  repayments are 
unsustainable.
Ive considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context, and thought  
about what this means for Mr Ss complaint.
Our adjudicator thought QuidMarket should have realised by the time he applied for loan 5, that Mr S 
was having problems managing his money. He was in repayment plans with another short-term 
lender and he was coming back for loans rapidly, with only five days  between  loans 4 and 5. But I 
think QuidMarket should have had concerns about Mr Ss ability to repay  short-term credit in a 
sustainable way rather earlier than this. Ill explain why.
When Mr S applied  for his first loan, QuidMarket carried  out a credit check  which revealed  he was 
behind on three other loans with an outstanding balance of £898.  While I do think this should have 
concerned QuidMarket, I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for this first loan as Mr S could 
have been experiencing  a temporary problem  and was about to bring his other loans up to date. So I 
dont think it was wrong of it to approve Mr Ss first loan application.
When Mr S applied  for loan 2 just five days after repaying  loan 1, the credit check results  showed the 
same three  loans were  outstanding, with the same (late)  outstanding balance. However,  loan 1 had 
been a three  day loan so there were in fact only eight days between the loan 1 and loan 2 
applications. Its possible therefore that any repayments Mr S had made  towards his other 
outstanding loans hadnt shown up on his credit file yet. With this in mind, Im again inclined to give 
QuidMarket the benefit of the doubt and say it was not unreasonable of it to agree  loan 2.
My view changes for loan 3, which Mr S applied  for more  than a month after his loan 1 application. 
Again, the credit check for loan 3 showed the same loans outstanding with the same overall  balance.  
So despite  having had two loans with QuidMarket by this point, it should have  been apparent  that Mr 
S had not made  any repayments towards three overdue loans he had outstanding  with other lenders. 
This suggested Mr S was having problems  repaying  credit and, even though he had successfully 
repaid his loans to QuidMarket  up to this point, he was missing  payments elsewhere. 
Ref: DRN08800455As I outlined  above, one of the key elements of sustainability is being  able to make repayments while 
also meeting  other  reasonable commitments. I think there was enough evidence in QuidMarkets 
possession by Mr Ss loan 3 application, that he was missing repayments to other lenders and 
therefore not making  his repayments sustainably. So I dont  think it was right of QuidMarket to 
continue lending to Mr S from this point on, until he took a significant  break  in his borrowing  (which 
could be an indication that his circumstances had improved). 
Such a break did take place  between loans 8 and 9, but when Mr S applied for loan 9 QuidMarkets  
credit check results revealed a similar  picture to before  this time there were  four late loans with an 
overall balance of £1,380. It appears likely some  of these loans were the same ones which had 
appeared during  earlier applications. In light of this I dont  think it would  have been reasonable of 
QuidMarket to assume Mr Ss circumstances had improved, and therefore I dont think  it should have 
given him loans 9 or 10 either.
putting things  right
QuidMarket shouldnt  have  given Mr S any of loans  3 to 10, so its not right that he should have  had to 
pay interest, fees or charges in relation  to these,  or have them affect his credit file in a negative way. 
So to put things right Im intending to direct QuidMarket to:
E.Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr S towards  interest,  fees and charges  on 
loans 3 to 10.
F.Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr S which were  
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr S originally made  the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled.
G.Pay Mr S the total of A plus B.
H.Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ss credit file in relation to loans 3 to 10.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuidMarket to deduct tax from this interest.  QuidMarket should 
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if Mr S asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  explained above I intend to uphold  Mr Ss complaint in part and direct Stagemount 
Limited (trading as QuidMarket)  to take the actions outlined in the putting things right  section of this 
provisional decision.
I now invite  both parties to reply to my provisional decision by 29 April 2019.  I will then review the 
case again.
