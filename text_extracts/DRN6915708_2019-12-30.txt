K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that MoneyGram  International Limited wouldnt process a transaction he 
wanted to make to third parties abroad. 
background
On the 2 May 2019 Mr M visited a MoneyGram store  and asked to transfer  Â£150  to a third 
party in Ghana.  
MoneyGram rejected  the payment and said to Mr M this was because of a code that was 
generated. But they wouldnt  explain to him the meaning of the code. 
Mr M wasnt happy with MoneyGrams  response  and said they should tell him what the code 
was as hed use their service to send money before. 
Mr M complained to our service and said he wants MoneyGram to always  explain what a 
code means and for them to be more helpful.  He thinks they should  be penalised for their 
poor service.
MoneyGram said they apologise for any difficulties Mr M may have encountered in using  
their service   but they hadnt done anything wrong here. 
Mr M wasnt happy with their response so referred his complaint to our service.  He said the 
money was being  sent to a third party who needs  medication, and he had to complete the 
transfer via his bank which took seven days.
One of our investigators  looked into Mr Ms complaint. MoneyGram provided more 
information and said that it retains the right to process or decline any transaction sent 
through its system at any given time if it doesnt feel comfortable with the purpose of the 
transaction of the sending or receiving activities of the customer.  And when it doesnt feel 
comfortable with a senders activity then it will deny the service. In Mr Ms case they regret 
that they cant give him a specific reason for why the service was denied. 
Our investigator said that MoneyGram hadnt  done anything wrong and acted in accordance 
with their terms and conditions. They said that MoneyGram didnt have to provide Mr M with 
an explanation  and had the right to choose who it decided to do business with. Mr M 
disagreed. In summary he said that hed used  MoneyGram services  before and that they 
should be transparent as to why they dont  allow customers to use their service.  
As Mr M didnt agree its been passed to me for a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that Mr M is very frustrated  by what happened here. Thats clear from what hes 
told MoneyGram and our service. Whilst I understand  Mr Ms strength of feeling its 
Ref: DRN69157082important for me to point out the only thing I can consider here is did MoneyGram do what it 
should of in this case.  And I think it has. Ill explain why below. 
Mr M says that MoneyGram hasnt fully explained  why it wouldnt process  his payment. And I 
appreciate why hes frustrated by this. But MoneyGram doesnt  have to provide this 
information to him. So I cant say it did anything wrong by not giving this to him. 
Mr M says hes used  MoneyGram services previously without a problem  but just because 
his previous transactions hadnt been  blocked  doesnt mean it was wrong for MoneyGram to 
reject the May payment.  Its for MoneyGram to decide what  factors their system should  look 
at when reviewing  transactions.  And I havent  seen anything which  suggests  it acted  unfairly 
or incorrectly here. So I cant say MoneyGram  did anything wrong when it declined to 
process Mr Ms payment  in May 2019.  
I realise this will be disappointing  to Mr M but I dont think MoneyGram  have done anything  
wrong here.  It follows I wont be asking them to do anymore. 
my final decision
My final decision is I dont  uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 January 2020.
