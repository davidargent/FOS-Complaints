The complaint
Mr J complains about Mercedes-Benz Retail Group UK Limiteds delay in refunding a 
deposit to him.
What happened
Mr J ordered a used car from Mercedes-Benz in September 2021 and he paid it a deposit of 
£500 by credit card. The order didnt go ahead so Mercedes-Benz agreed to refund the 
deposit to Mr J but he didnt want to provide it with his credit card details by e-mail because 
he felt it wasnt secure which delayed the refund. 
Mr J complained to Mercedes-Benz and then, in November 2021, to this service. Mercedes-
Benz then obtained the card details from the payment processing service and refunded the 
deposit to Mr J. Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She 
was persuaded that the negotiations had reached a stage where a prospective credit 
agreement was in place so this service could consider Mr Js complaint. She wasnt 
persuaded that Mercedes-Benz needed to do anything further as she was satisfied that it 
acted fairly and reasonably in trying to get the refund processed at the earliest opportunity. 
Mr J has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that:
his bank confirmed that he shouldnt be sending his card details to Mercedes-Benz 
and that Mercedes-Benz didnt offer him the opportunity to provide those details over 
the phone or any other alternative;
the money was only returned when he informed Mercedes-Benz that hed contacted 
this service; 
he doesnt need to prove that he was at a loss financially as that would be disclosing 
more personal information; and
theres been a clear breach of the process by Mercedes-Benz; 
and he asks what evidence Mercedes-Benz provided to show that it wasnt reasonable to 
expect it to be able to provide the refund in a similar timescale to its usual process when it 
had to find an alternative method of obtaining the information required to issue the refund.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
the order form for the car shows that part of the price of the car was to be financed so 
I consider that Mercedes-Benz was providing credit broking services to Mr J and that 
this service has jurisdiction to consider his complaint;
theres no dispute that Mr J paid a deposit of £500 to Mercedes-Benz in September 
2021 for a car that had been ordered or that the order didnt go ahead so Mr J was 
entitled to a refund of that deposit;
Mercedes-Benz asked him to provide it with his credit card details by e-mail so that it 
could use those details to refund the deposit to him by the same means as it was 
paid;
Mr J didnt want to provide his credit cards details by e-mail due to security concerns 
which delayed the refund so Mr J complained to this service in November 2021 about 
the delay  Mercedes-Benz says that it obtained the card details from the payment 
processing service and refunded the deposit to Mr J later that month;
Mr J said that hed not received an explanation from Mercedes-Benz about why his 
money was held or any form of apology and he would like compensation of at least 
£2,000 as he had to borrow money for two months at a very high interest rate;
Mercedes-Benz says that it must return the deposit to the same place that it came 
from and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it acted 
incorrectly in these circumstances;
I dont consider that it was unreasonable that Mr J didnt want to provide his credit 
card details by e-mail but, if he didnt want to do so, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have provided Mercedes-Benz with those details in an 
alternative way that was acceptable to him, such as by phone or by visiting the 
showroom, but Ive seen no evidence to show that he did so;
the deposit was refunded to Mr J in November 2021 and Im not persuaded that there 
was an unreasonable delay in the refund being made or that Mercedes-Benz acted 
incorrectly in these circumstances;
Mr J says that he doesnt need to prove that he was at a loss financially as that would 
be disclosing more personal information  but (if I was going to be upholding his 
complaint  which Im not) I would require evidence of any financial loss to be able to 
require Mercedes-Benz to compensate him for it;
Mr J hasnt provided any evidence to show that he suffered a financial loss as a 
result of the delay in the refund being made to him and I see no basis on which its 
likely that he would have suffered a financial loss that would justify compensation of 
£2,000; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Mercedes-Benz to pay 
any compensation to Mr J or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Js complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 May 2022.
