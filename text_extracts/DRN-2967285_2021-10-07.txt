The complaint
Mr V complains about Aviva Insurance Limiteds handling of a claim he made under his
home emergency policy.
What happened
Aviva determined that the boiler was beyond economical repair (BER). Mr V queried why this
fault was not identified during earlier repairs. Aviva said the previous issues were identified
as leaks and were unrelated to this issue.
Mr V raised concerns that his policy had been cancelled. To which Aviva responded to say it
had acted in line with the policy terms.
Mr V also complained that the quote provided by Aviva to install a new boiler was excessive.
He thinks the quote should be much lower given the new boiler is supplied free under the
policy.
Our investigator decided not to uphold Mr Vs complaint. He found no evidence that the heat
engine fault should have been identified during the previous repairs. He also found that the
terms of the policy say it will cancel in the event the boiler is determined to be BER.
When considering the installation quote, our investigator looked at some comparisons
online. He felt these were comparable with Avivas quote. And that as the company had
followed the terms of the policy, it had been fair in its treatment of Mr V.
