The complaint
Mr C complains National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly stopped him withdrawing funds and 
unfairly closed his account. He wants compensation for the distress and inconvenience he 
experienced. 
What happened
NatWest refused a payment instruction from Mr C. It wanted to review his account.
During the review, NatWest blocked Mr Cs access to the account, so no withdrawals 
could be made.
NatWest completed its review and unblocked Mr Cs account. It decided to end its 
relationship and gave 60 days notice before the account would close. Mr C withdrew 
his funds several months later.
Mr C contacted NatWest on several occasions. He asked for the reasons behind 
NatWests actions, which it refused to give.
Mr C complained to NatWest. He complained about:
- Not being able to access his funds and the account closure
- Not being able to withdraw £100 for food while his account was blocked 
- Not being told why NatWest made these decisions
- NatWests refusal to deal with a representative of a charity who contacted 
NatWest on his behalf
- And NatWests actions were illegal and in breach of his rights
NatWest upheld Mr Cs complaint in part. It said it didnt need to give Mr C its 
reasons. But it could have done more when Mr C asked to withdraw £100. It offered 
Mr C £100. Mr C wanted much more in compensation, so brought his complaint to 
our service.
An investigator considered the complaint and upheld it in part. They found:
- NatWest had the commercial discretion to close the account.
- NatWest has important legal and regulatory obligations, which mean it may monitor 
and review accounts. On this occasion, NatWest blocked Mr Cs account in line with 
those obligations. NatWest didnt need to give its reasons to Mr C.
- NatWest ought to have contacted Mr C when his account was unblocked. Had it 
done so, Mr C would have withdrawn his funds earlier. So, NatWest could have 
prevented Mr C experiencing further inconvenience and worry. NatWest should offer 
a further £100, bringing the total amount it should pay to £200.
NatWest agreed to offer Mr C £200 in total. But Mr C disagreed. He wants a much larger 
sum. As no resolution was agreed, the complaint was referred to me to decide in my 
capacity as an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided to uphold Mr Cs complaint. But I am not awarding any more compensation that 
the £200 NatWest has already offered. Ill explain why:
NatWest has important legal and regulatory obligations. One of its responsibilities is 
to, where possible, protect customers from falling victim to financial harm, especially 
fraud and scams. So, to these ends, NatWest needs to monitor accounts and 
occasionally review transactions.
NatWest may need to ask questions to be satisfied about the source of funds held in 
an account, the purpose of a payment, or the nature of the relationship between a 
payer and payee. And it may need to freeze an account or refuse a customers 
mandate until its satisfied by the information it receives. This is not uncommon in the 
retail banking industry, although Mr C may not have experienced it before.
Considering all the information I have seen, Im satisfied NatWest actions were 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C referenced the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) and the Fraud Act 2006. He said 
NatWest acted criminally. NatWest are not a public body under the HRA, and it didnt 
perform a public function. But, even so, I dont find NatWest treated Mr C any 
differently to someone who doesnt have a protected characteristic, such as a 
disability.
NatWests decision to block Mr Cs account was a proportionate response to meet its 
legal and regulatory responsibilities. I disagree it acted criminally for its own gain. So, 
I dont find it likely committed fraud by failing to disclose information. NatWest would 
risk serious sanction if it didnt sometimes act as it did.
NatWest needed to perform its review without causing unreasonable delay. Im 
satisfied the review completed without unnecessary delay. But NatWest ought to 
have considered further Mr Cs request to withdraw £100 for food. And it should have 
contacted Mr C once the restriction on the funds was lifted.
Im satisfied £200 is a fair sum to compensate Mr C for the additional inconvenience 
and worry caused by NatWests failure. My role is not to award compensation in order to punish or fine NatWest. And Mr C hasnt provided evidence to warrant a 
higher award.
NatWest can decide to end its relationship with a customer if it wants. And while I 
understand Mr Cs concern, NatWest wasnt obliged to disclose the reason(s) for 
blocking or closing the account. I have, however, considered the basis for NatWests 
decision and Im satisfied its valid.
NatWest gave the correct notice under the terms of the account which Mr C agreed 
when the account opened. Im satisfied this was enough time for Mr C to find an 
alternative account provider if he didnt already have one.
Putting things right
For the reasons above, Im upholding Mr Cs complaint.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Cs complaint, and I direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay him £200, 
unless it has already been paid.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 May 2021.
