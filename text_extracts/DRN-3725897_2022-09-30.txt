The complaint
Mr F complains Citibank UK Limited has charged overdraft interest fees incorrectly. And
theyve failed to reassure him that the error has been rectified.
What happened
In 2020 Mr F said hed incurred overdraft interest charges even though his account had been
in credit. He complained to Citibank.
Citibank agreed hed been incorrectly charged and refunded £148.72 for all overdraft interest
charged to his account from April 2020 to October 2020. And offered to pay Mr F £75 for the
distress and inconvenience this had caused. But in January 2021 Mr F again saw hed been
charged interest when his account hadnt been overdrawn. In July 2021 Citibank refunded
Mr F £35.75. Mr F said hed lost confidence in how Citibank were applying the interest
charges to his account. He asked for Citibank to review his account for the previous five
years to show his account had been correctly charged. Mr F said Citibank havent shown
how theyd calculated the interest on his account, so he referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator said Citibank had given some information about the interest applied to
Mr Fs account. She said theyd refunded some interest charged to Mr F but said they hadnt
shown or given adequate reassurance that the interest had been correctly calculated for
Mr Fs account. She said this had caused Mr F distress and inconvenience as hed lost
confidence in Citibank and hes had to spend time trying to get the matter put right. To reflect
this, she said Citibank should pay Mr F £200.
Mr F said Citibank still havent provided the details hed asked for. He asked for his
complaint to be referred to an ombudsman to decide.
I issued a provisional decision in August 2022 that said:
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so Im currently minded to
uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
The main crux of Mr F's complaint is that hes said hes incurred overdraft interest charges
when his account had been in a positive balance. Hes received a refund for some interest
charges but has lost confidence in Citbank's ability to correctly calculate the interest being
applied to his account. I can understand Mr Fs frustration as he is now unsure as to whether
these charges should have been applied or not. And I dont think its unreasonable for him to
seek reassurance that the interest is being calculated correctly.
I have reviewed the case and can see that Citiback accepted theyd incorrectly calculated
overdraft interest for Mr Fs account and had refunded charges of £148.72 and £35.76. And
Citibank has said that no additional fees were charged over the preceding five years. I can
also see that Citibank identified the cause of the mis-calculated interest and the steps that
needed to be taken to prevent reoccurrence.
Citibank has shown us the monthly overdraft interest theyve charged to Mr Fs account
since January 2017. After Mr F queried the charges for times when his account was in credit,
I can see Citibank refunded all the overdraft interest charged to his account from April 2020
to October 2020 - £148.72.
Since then Mr Fs account has been charged interest on his account being overdrawn as
detailed below:
In January 2021 Mr F again said his account had been in credit and didnt understand why
hed been charged £22.62 interest for that month. And I can see Citibank made a partial
refund of interest in July 2021 for £35.75.
I can understand Mr F wanting a clear picture of what has happened on his account.
Citibank said theyd identified why the miscalculation was happening, but Im concerned that
these steps arent adequately in place as Mr F has again been refunded for incorrectly
applied interest. So, I asked Citibank to show how the partial refund had been calculated.
And what steps theyre taking to make sure Mr F hasnt been financially impacted, showing
how the interest charges have been calculated, what if any of this amount was incorrectly
charged and any overcharge that is due or has been refunded with dates.
But Citibank havent provided these details. While theyve said there havent been any
additional fees added in the previous five years, I dont think theyve been clear as to what
constitutes additional fees and whether this differs from overdraft interest charges. And Im
not satisfied that the measures Citibank identified to prevent the interest being incorrectly
calculated and added to Mr Fs account have been put in place or are being actioned.
As Citibank havent shown the interest charged is being calculated correctly, Im not satisfied
Mr F should have been charged any of the overdraft interest on his account.
As Mr F isnt sure his account is being correctly charged must be very worrying for him. And
I dont think Citibank have given him adequate reassurance that is account is now correct.
So, I agree with our investigator that this has caused Mr F distress and inconvenience.
Responses to my provisional decision
Mr F said he was pleased his complaint had been upheld, but that his primary goal was for 
Citibank to comply with their obligations as a UK bank.
Cittibank havent made any further representations for me to consider or provided any 
calculations to show that Mr F has been correctly charged interest on his account.
I can understand Mr Fs frustration as Citibank havent provided the reassurance about the 
interest, theyve charged to the account he has with them. But this service was set up to 18/11/2019/12/2019/01/2116/02/2119/03/2118/04/2119/05/21

regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to do. Our service is impartial, we look at 
the evidence given by both parties. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. And ask Citibank UK limited to:
refund all overdraft interest charges added to Mr Fs account from November 2020 to 
date less £35.75 unless they can show an accurate and detailed breakdown of how 
the interest has been calculated; 
confirm the measures, theyd identified are in place to prevent reoccurrence of 
incorrectly calculated overdraft interest; and
pay Mr F £200 for the distress and inconvenience this has caused.
Id expect Citbank UK Limited to pay the above compensation within 28 days of the date of 
us notifying them that Mr F has accepted the decision.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2022.
