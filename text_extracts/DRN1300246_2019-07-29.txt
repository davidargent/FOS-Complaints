K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
QuickQuid says it gave  Mr S 12 loans between June  2015 and October  2018.  Mr S topped  
up five of the loans by taking additional borrowing on six separate occasions. I actually think  
that it would  be more correct to treat at least one of those top ups as a refinance of the 
original loan  but doing  so would make no difference to my findings and so for simplicity 
I will use the same loan numbering as QuickQuid and our adjudicator.
A summary  of Mr Ss borrowing from QuickQuid is as follows;

Mr Ss complaint has been  assessed by one of our adjudicators.  He didnt think QuickQuid 
had been wrong  to give the initial loan, loan 10, or the initial borrowing on loan 11 to Mr S. 
But he didnt  think the remaining loans  should  have been agreed. So he asked QuickQuid to 
pay Mr S some  compensation.
QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mr S accepts  my decision it is legally binding  on both parties.
Ref: DRN13002462my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr S could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
Ref: DRN13002463QuickQuid structured most of Mr Ss loans so that he wouldnt repay  the capital hed 
borrowed until two or three  months  later. In the initial months  hed just need to pay some 
interest to QuickQuid. Ive taken  this payment structure into account when considering the 
loans that QuickQuid gave to Mr S.
The repayments on Mr Ss first loan were  relatively modest compared to the income that he 
declared to QuickQuid. So given Mr Ss repayment amounts, what  was apparent about his 
circumstances at the time, and his history with the lender, I dont think  it wouldve been  
proportionate for QuickQuid to ask him for the amount of information  that would be needed 
to show the lending was unsustainable.   
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr S provided or the information QuickQuid 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying.  So I dont  think QuickQuid was wrong to give this first loan to Mr S.
Mr S successfully paid the first two interest only repayments on his first loan. But shortly 
before he was due to make the final, larger, repayment he asked QuickQuid to refinance his 
loan. So QuickQuid  lent him some additional funds and offered a new repayment schedule  
meaning he wouldnt need to repay both the original capital  and his new borrowing for a 
further two months.
The amount  Mr S needed to repay  on his final instalment was just under £500. That was a 
significant portion  of the income hed declared  to QuickQuid.  QuickQuid  has said that Mr S 
couldve saved some  disposable  income  in the first two months  to put towards his final 
repayment. So it is effectively saying that I should  consider the average  repayment Mr S 
needed to make each  month on his loan.
But I dont agree that would be a reasonable conclusion here. Mr S had already shown that he 
was most likely facing problems managing his money by not being  able to make the larger  
repayment on the initial loan when it was due. He clearly hadnt been able to save for a 
repayment of half the size of the commitment  he was now taking on. So I dont think 
QuickQuid should  have agreed  to give this additional loan to Mr S.
It had taken Mr S over five months to repay his initial loan. And on the same day that loan was 
repaid he asked to borrow  again.  So given the problems that Ive noted above I think  it should 
have been clear to QuickQuid that Mr S was having problems managing  his money and was 
most likely needing  to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances. So I dont think QuickQuid should have given this loan to Mr S either.
Looking at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history with Mr S I think that by loan 3 
the lender should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful. And so QuickQuid should  have realised that it shouldnt  provide any further loans. 
I say this because:
By the time Mr S asked for loan 3 hed been  borrowing  from QuickQuid for a lengthy 
period and he wasnt making  any inroads  to the amount  he owed the lender. By then 
Mr S had paid a considerable amount of interest to QuickQuid to effectively service a 
debt over an extended period.
From  loan 4 to loan 9 Mr S was provided with a new loan typically  shortly after 
settling a previous  one. So QuickQuid  ought to have realised it was more  likely than 
Ref: DRN13002464not Mr S was continuing to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous 
loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Ss indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
I think that Mr S lost out because QuickQuid provided loans 3 to loan 9 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and top ups was likely to have had negative  implications 
on Mr Ss ability  to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these  
high-cost loans.
After repaying loan 9 there was a gap of almost ten months before Mr S asked to borrow 
again. I think that gap was long enough  for QuickQuid  to reasonably  conclude  that Mr Ss 
finances had moved  on from whatever situation  had required his previous loans. So I think it 
would be reasonable here for QuickQuid  to perform a similar level of checks  as it would for a 
loan application  from a new customer.
The repayments on loans  10 and 11 (before it was topped up) were  again relatively modest  
compared to the income that Mr S declared to QuickQuid. So given Mr Ss repayment  
amounts, what was now apparent about  his circumstances,  and his history with the lender, 
I dont think it wouldve been  proportionate for QuickQuid to ask him for the amount of 
information that would be needed to show the lending was unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr S provided or the information QuickQuid 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying.  So I dont  think QuickQuid was wrong to give these  loans to Mr S.
But around a month  after taking loan 11, Mr S asked to take some additional borrowing. The 
amount Mr S now needed to repay on his final instalment was just over £560. That was a 
significant portion  of the income hed declared  to QuickQuid.  And given what  had gone before 
I dont think it would  be reasonable here for QuickQuid  to think  Mr S was in a position  to 
successfully save for that final repayment. So I dont think  QuickQuid should have agreed the 
additional borrowing  on this loan.
Around three weeks after repaying  loan 11 Mr S asked to borrow  again.  I think  it should have 
been clear to QuickQuid  that it was more likely than not that the pressures  on Mr Ss finances 
hadnt gone away in the time he hadnt been  borrowing,  and that it was unlikely he could afford  
to repay  any borrowing in a sustainable manner. Mr S topped  up his final loan on two 
occasions further underlining the problems he was facing. So I dont think it was reasonable 
for QuickQuid to conclude  that it was responsible to give this lending to Mr S either.
In summary  I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed to give Mr S the additional  borrowing 
on loan 1, loans  2 to 9, the additional  borrowing on loan 11, or loan 12 and the two further 
top ups. So QuickQuid needs to pay Mr S some  compensation.
Ref: DRN13002465putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to give Mr S the loans noted above. So for each 
of those loans  QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Ss credit  file in relation to loan 1, 
loan 2, loan 11 and loan 12.
The number of loans  taken from loan 3 to loan 9 means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  3 to 9 should be removed from Mr Ss credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold most of Mr Ss complaint and direct CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 August 2019.
