The complaint
Mr S says Arnold Clark Automobiles Limited mis-sold him a payment protection insurance 
(PPI) policy.
What happened
Mr S took out an PPI policy with a hire-purchase agreement in 2008. He paid a monthly 
amount for the policy.  
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mr S disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Ss case. 
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ss complaint for the following reasons.
Mr S completed a separate application form for the PPI, and this made it clear the policy was 
optional. So, I think Arnold Clark made Mr S aware that he had a choice about buying the 
PPI, and that he chose to take it. 
Arnold Clark didnt recommend the PPI to Mr S so it didnt have to check if it was right for 
him. 
I think Arnold Clark couldve explained the cost of the policy better than it did. But even if it 
had, I think Mr S would still have bought it. It doesn't appear to have been too expensive and 
I don't think he'd have considered it poor value given its cost and benefits. 
Its possible Arnold Clark didnt point out the main things the policy didnt cover. But Mr S 
doesnt appear to have been affected by any of those things. 
Ive taken into account Mr Ss comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 June 2020.
