The complaint
Mr R is unhappy that National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) were unable to provide 
him with a copy of his signed loan agreement.
What happened
Mr R took out a loan with NatWest in July 2019. After receiving this, Mr R contacted NatWest 
to request a copy of the loan agreement, which he had not yet received.
NatWest were unable to provide a copy of the original loan agreement as they were unable 
to locate it, but they confirmed to Mr R that the terms of the loan remained valid and that the 
scheduled repayments should continue to be made.
Mr R complained to NatWest as he was worried that his not having a copy of the loan 
agreement might jeopardise his mortgage renegotiation. NatWest provided a response 
which included the relevant loan information to satisfy the mortgage provider and also 
offered a quote for the early settlement of the loan.  
The quote provided by NatWest included an early settlement fee of £322.18. NatWest 
offered to refund £322.18 to Mr Rs account to effectively waive that fee should Mr R choose 
to settle the loan early within 30 days of that offer. Mr R rejected that offer, stating in his 
December 2019 counter-response that this was because as he had never received a loan 
agreement, he was not aware of any terms and conditions of the loan.   
NatWests response also included an offer of £16.20 to reimburse Mr R for the costs of the 
calls he had made to NatWest pursuing this matter, and a further offer of £50.00 as 
compensation for Mr Rs loss of time. Mr R rejected these offers also, again in his December 
2019 counter-response, as he felt that these offers of compensation didnt go far enough.
Additionally, Mr R also said that as NatWest had been unable to provide a copy of the loan 
agreement, it couldnt enforce the repayment of this loan. Mr R also stated that he would not 
make any repayments toward the loan whilst his complaint remained unresolved.
NatWest responded and said that a copy of the loan agreement had been made available to 
Mr R at the time he applied for the loan online, and that a copy was also sent to him after the 
loan was agreed (which Mr R did not receive). NatWest also confirmed again that the 
scheduled repayments to the loan needed to be made and that failure to meet these 
payments would cause the loan to default and be recorded as such on Mr Rs credit file.
Mr R remained unhappy and so referred the matter to our service. Our investigator looked at 
this case and didnt uphold Mr R complaint. Our investigator felt that NatWest had provided 
Mr R with the necessary loan information and that they had made an appropriate offer of 
compensation for the poor service Mr R had received.  
Mr R didnt agree with our investigators assessment and requested that this case be 
considered by an Ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have reviewed everything Mr R and NatWest have provided us in reaching my decision 
here. Mr R has taken the time to go into some detail in his correspondence with our service.  
My decision here wont go into the same level of detail, in line with our role as a quick and 
informal service. Instead Ill focus on what I feel the crux of this complaint to be.
There are two points which I consider to be key. The first is whether Mr R was provided with 
a copy of the loan agreement. The second is whether it is appropriate that Mr R should be 
able to decline to make the scheduled loan repayments whilst his complaint with NatWest is 
ongoing.
Mr R doesnt dispute having borrowed money from NatWest here. The loan was applied for 
using the mobile banking app and, in accepting the loan and receiving the money, NatWest 
says that Mr R was accepting the terms and conditions of the loan, which were provided as 
part of the application process.
NatWest also says that an opportunity to save a copy of the loan agreement would have 
been presented to Mr R as a part of the process of accepting the loan, and I am aware that 
such an opportunity is presented as a part of online loan applications in general. Given that 
Mr Rs application seems to have been subject to NatWests normal process here, I feel on 
balance that its most likely an opportunity to save a copy of the loan agreement would have 
been provided during the application process.
Additionally, I note the loan information provided by NatWest in their initial complaint 
response letter. Taken in consideration with the above, I am satisfied that NatWest has done 
enough to show the terms of what Mr R agreed to when he borrowed the money.
I realise that Mr R will remain disappointed, as he is concerned that NatWest cant provide a 
copy of the original loan agreement itself. I also realise that Mr R doesnt feel that he should 
make payments to the loan, because the original loan agreement cant be provided. 
However, where a customer has borrowed from a business, its nearly always going to be 
the case that its fair that they pay this back  in line with the terms that were agreed. I think 
thats the case here. NatWest has done enough to satisfy me that Mr R agreed to the loan, 
and Mr R accepts that he borrowed the money. So, I think its fair that NatWest asks him to 
repay what hes borrowed.
In Mr Rs December 2019 letter to NatWest, Mr R said that because NatWest were unable to 
provide him with a copy of the loan agreement then the agreement was not enforceable. I 
must point out that only a court can decide whether a loan is legally enforceable in the way 
Mr R says here. This service doesnt have the same power or role as a court. Instead, we 
consider what the law says and reach a decision on whats fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances. Here, I think its fair that NatWest is asking Mr R to repay the loan he took 
out for the reasons Ive already given.
NatWest advised Mr R on several occasions that loan repayments needed to continue, and 
advised clearly of the consequences of non-payment, including that there would be an 
impact on Mr Rs credit file. So, where NatWest has recorded information about missed or late payments and that is accurate, it wouldnt be fair for me to tell NatWest to remove that 
information.
NatWest accepts that their service in dealing with Mr Rs queries and questions could have 
been better. For that theyve offered him £16.20 for the cost of his calls and £50 for the 
inconvenience this caused. I think thats fair in the circumstances 
But other than that, I cant fairly say that NatWest have done anything wrong in pursuing this 
matter in the way that they have, and so I will not be asking them to take any action beyond 
that which they proposed in their initial complaint response letter. I know that NatWest has 
also offered to refund the settlement fee applicable to the loan should Mr R settle it early. 
Thats a helpful gesture from NatWest, but its not something that I think they have to do. So, 
if Mr R wishes to now take NatWest up on its offer here, then he will have to discuss this with 
them directly.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank PLC should pay Mr R the call costs of 
£16.20 and £50.00 to compensate him for the inconvenience their service caused him. I 
make no further award here.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 December 2020.
