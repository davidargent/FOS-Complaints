The complaint
Miss W complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt update her address 
when she asked it to, which had an adverse effect on her credit file.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well-known to both parties, so I dont intend to repeat 
everything here. But Ill give an overview of whats happened, and then Ill give my decision 
and the reasons for it. 
In November 2019 Miss W says she asked NatWest to change the address on her buy-to-let 
mortgage. This wasnt done so Miss W made a complaint, which NatWest answered in 
January 2020. In its response NatWest asked Miss W to write to it to request the address 
change. 
On 30 March 2020 Miss W says that she again contacted NatWest to update her address 
and she was given the address to write to. Miss W wrote to NatWest the next day and 
NatWest received the letter on 6 April 2020.
On 8 April 2020 NatWest wrote to Miss Ws new address asking her to provide a specimen 
signature, noting that it didnt have one on file. As it didnt receive a response to this letter, it 
wrote to Miss W again on 22 April 2020. Again, after not receiving a response, it tried to call 
Miss W and then sent her a text message on 20 May 2020. 
On 1 October 2020 Miss W contacted NatWest via its webchat facility about another matter 
and whilst doing so she asked whether her address had been updated. At that point Miss W 
discovered that the address hadnt been changed. And then on 4 October 2020 NatWest 
wrote to Miss Ws new address requesting a specimen of her signature. 
NatWest wrote to Miss W again on 19 October 2020 to conform her address had been 
updated. 
Miss W has complained that NatWests procedures made it overly difficult for her to update 
her address. She says NatWest didnt make it clear that the address hadnt been updated 
when it asked for a signature  so she didnt believe the two were linked. Miss W has also 
complained that NatWest has breached her personal data by sending information to her old 
address, despite knowing she no longer lived there.
Since Miss W made her complaint NatWest offered her £100 to put things right. Miss W 
rejected NatWests offer as she didnt feel it fairly reflected the level of distress the matter 
had caused. 
Our investigator thought about everything and thought that NatWests offer of compensation 
was fair. She acknowledged that NatWest couldve provided better service, but she thought 
the £100 it had already offered was fair, so she didnt recommend that NatWest should 
increase it.
 
As Miss W didnt agree with the investigators opinion the complaint has been passed to me 
to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the outcome the investigator reached, so Im not going tell 
NatWest to do anything further to put things right. Ill explain why.
I should start by explaining that Ive considered the way NatWest treated Miss W overall. But 
I havent made a finding on whether NatWests actions led to a breach of Miss Ws personal 
data. Thats a matter for the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) to consider. Miss W 
may refer this aspect of her complaint there if she chooses to. 
I note that NatWest said in its response to Miss Ws complaint: 
I can confirm weve followed the right process. In order for the correspondence address to be 
updated we require a copy of your signature to be updated on the BTL mortgage file. We have sent 
you several letters asking for this.
So Ive looked carefully at the letters that NatWest sent to Miss W on 8 April 2020, 22 April 
2020, and 1 October 2020. The letters say:
As we dont hold a specimen of your signature on file, please arrange to send us a certified copy of 
one of the following, to allow us to update your address:
 A current Passport
 A current Driving Licence
You can do this by visiting your local NatWest branch, whore copies of the documents will be taken
and sent to us. Please make sure these documents are valid and in date.
Whilst I accept this is NatWests process, I agree with Miss Ws point that there wasnt 
anything that linked her request to change her address to these letters. Whilst NatWest did 
indeed ask for Miss W to verify her identity, theres no mention of the address change within 
the three letters, and all three contain the same text. Although theres an argument to say 
that Miss W should still have provided the identification NatWest asked for in those letters, 
that doesnt automatically lead me to think that she knew not doing so would affect the 
address change. And the fact that the letters were sent to Miss Ws new address again 
further persuades me that Miss W could indeed have believed her address had been 
changed.
I note that NatWest says it added a marker to Miss Ws account in October 2021 to prevent 
post inadvertently being sent to her previous address, until her address was changed. I 
agree this was a pragmatic thing to do and I can see why NatWest did it. But I dont think NatWest went far enough to prevent information being sent to the incorrect address when it 
became aware that Miss W no longer lived at the address it held on file. This could, and 
should, have been done around 18 months earlier, when Miss W made her initial request 
November 2019. This in turn wouldve likely saved Miss W the some of the stress and 
anxiety that the situation caused, by avoiding her information being sent to the wrong place.
Ive noted that Miss W has said that NatWests error led to her having adverse information 
on her credit file, and consequently facing difficulties when re-mortgaging. So whilst I accept 
the situation was frustrating, credit applications can be affected by many things other than 
the address held on a bank account. And I havent seen anything to persuade me that this 
event alone led to the difficulties Miss W has faced when applying for credit.  
Id like to reassure Miss W that Ive thought very carefully about everything shes said. And 
whilst I might not have listed all of the points shes made individually, Ive considered 
everything as a whole when reaching my decision. And having done so I think the £100 
NatWest has offered is a fair reflection of the inconvenience this matter caused. So I dont 
require NatWest to do anything further than that. 
Putting things right
NatWest should pay Miss W £100 compensation to recognise the trouble and upset that this 
situation caused her.
My final decision
I uphold Miss Ws complaint and require National Westminster Bank Plc to put things right by 
doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 May 2022.
