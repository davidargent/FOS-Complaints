K821x#15complaint
Ms H complains that Active Securities Limited  (trading as 247Moneybox) didnt carry out 
proper affordability  checks before lending to her.

16 30 Aug 2017 £236 N/A N/A £321.10 outstanding
Ms H says she could not afford to sustainably repay the loans and had multiple other  short-
term loans at the same time. She says if 247Moneybox had done better checks  it would 
have seen this from her bank statements. Ms H adds that she had to borrow  repeatedly 
because of the interest charged and that such a borrowing history should  have  indicated  to 
247Moneybox that it needed to do further checks  and that she was a poor candidate for 
credit.
247Moneybox says it carried out credit and employment checks  as well as assessing 
affordability based on Ms Hs disposable  income.  It says its confident  that its lending 
decisions were based on appropriate checks,  but, as a gesture of goodwill, it was prepared 
to write off Ms Hs outstanding balance of £321.10.
Ms H did not accept the offer.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He found that the results of 
the credit  checks for loans  1 to 3 should have indicated to 247Moneybox that it needed  to 
ask Ms H about her other short-term loans.  He said that had it done so, 247Moneybox was 
likely to have found that Ms H already  had up to almost £1,000 in other short-term 
commitments. As shed  declared her income to be £915, our adjudicator said 247Moneybox  
should have realised it was unlikely Ms H could sustainably repay those loans
By the time Ms H applied  for loan 4, our adjudicator said a proportionate check  should  also 
have included verifying the information Ms H had provided about her income  and outgoings. 
He found that, had it done so, 247Moneybox would have seen that Ms Hs disposable 
income was insufficient  to repay  the loans sustainably.
Ref: DRN91099242From loan 7, our adjudicator said that Ms Hs borrowing pattern suggested she was using 
the loans as a long-term solution,  rather than for the short-term as they were intended. He 
said the borrowing  pattern itself showed the loans  were unsustainable.
Our adjudicator recommended  that 247Moneybox should  refund interest  and charges on all 
the loans (plus 8% statutory interest), remove negative information about loans 1 to 6 from 
Ms Hs credit  file and remove loans 7 onwards  from her credit file entirely.
247Moneybox responded to say, in summary,  that Ms H declared a disposable  income that 
comfortably covered the loan repayments in each of loans 1 to 6. It added  that it specifically  
asked Ms H about other short-term loans before approving her third loan application and she 
didnt provide any further information.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
247Moneybox was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make sure 
Ms H could afford to repay the loans before it lent to her. Those  checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Ms H was borrowing, and her lending history.  But 
there was no set list of checks 247Moneybox had to do.
Loans 1 and 2
When Ms H applied for her first loan from 247Moneybox, it carried out a credit check. The 
results of this check showed Ms H had opened  20 new accounts  in the last 6 months, and 
ten of those were  active. Given the credit  report also showed she had outstanding loans of 
over £7,700 I consider this should  have prompted 247Moneybox to ask Ms H whether  she 
had any other short-term loans. I cant see it did this, so Ive had a look at what  such  a check 
would have shown.
I can see from Ms Hs bank statements  that she was actively using eight other  short-term  
loan companies  around  the times  of loans 1 and 2. She needed to make repayments  of 
around £1,000  in the month following loan 1, and this increased to £1,200  for loan 2. Given  
Ms H had declared an income of about £900, Im satisfied 247 Moneybox wouldnt have 
found loans 1 or 2 affordable had it done better checks.
Loan 3
Ms Hs credit  check showed a worsening  picture at the time of loan 3. By now her credit 
report showed shed  opened 29 accounts in the last six months,  of which  17 were active. Her 
outstanding debt on loans was now over £8,000.  So again, Id have expected 247Moneybox 
to ask Ms H about other short-term loans.
I acknowledge 247Moneybox says it did that and it sent the wording it says it used at the 
time. However, I havent  seen any evidence of how the question was presented to Ms H or 
how her answer was captured, although I accept 247Moneybox says she didnt declare any 
other short-term loans. That said, Im also not satisfied that the wording of the question  was 
such that it made it clear  to Ms H that she was obliged to declare her other short-term loans.
Ref: DRN91099243So, as 247Moneybox had clear evidence  from Ms Hs credit  report  that it was likely  she had 
other short-term loans, I still consider its checks needed to go further. Had it carried out 
better checks, it would  have found  Ms H still owed  over £500 to other lenders at the time of 
loan 3. As Ms H had declared her disposable  income to be £575, I find the scheduled  
repayment of £285.20  on loan 3 was unaffordable to her and the loan should not have been 
approved on that basis.
Loans 4 to 6
By the time Ms H applied  for her fourth loan from 247Moneybox, I consider proportionate 
checks should have  included a full financial review.  I say that because  the amounts  she was 
borrowing were continuing to increase and her scheduled repayments were a large  
proportion of her income. Such a review  should  also have included verifying the information 
Ms H had declared.
Ive looked at Ms Hs bank statements  to see what its likely 247Moneybox would have found 
had it carried out a proportionate  check for loans 4 to 6.
I can see Ms Hs income was roughly the £915 she declared. She also had a monthly loan 
repayment of £156  and spent about £100 on car insurance and tax and her phone bill. Credit 
card payments and bank  charges also totalled about  £100  per month. This left Ms H with 
about £560 before her food and travel was taken into account. But Ms H was also repaying  
other short-term loans at the time and owed at least £400 in the months following loans 4, 5 
and 6. Given Ms H was also spending  a significant amount of money on gambling each 
month, I think  its likely  247Moneybox would have decided it was irresponsible  to continue to 
lend to Ms H had it done proportionate checks.
Loans 7 onwards
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of 247Moneyboxs lending history with Ms H, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which 247Moneybox should reasonably have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 247Moneybox should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Hs case, I think that this point  was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
From  loan 7 onwards  Ms H was provided  with a new loan within  days/weeks  of 
settling a previous  one. So 247Moneybox ought to have realised it was more likely 
than not Ms H was having to borrow further  to cover  the hole repaying her previous 
loan was leaving in her finances  and that Ms Hs indebtedness  was increasing  
unsustainably.
Ms H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed 247Moneybox. Loan 
16 was taken out 16 months  after Ms Hs first. And it was for almost three times the 
amount. Ms H had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to 
247Moneybox over an extended  period.
I think that Ms H lost out because 247Moneybox  continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
The loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Hs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN91099244The sheer number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Ms Hs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loan 7 onwards and 247Moneybox should  put 
things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Active Securities Limited (trading  as 
247Moneybox) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Ms H paid on the loans;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  on loan 16, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Ms H; 
Remove any negative  information about loans 1 to 6 from Ms Hs credit file.
The number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 16 should be removed from Ms 
Hs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 247Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 
247Moneybox must give Ms H a certificate  showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks 
for one. If 247Moneybox intends to apply  the refund to reduce any outstanding  capital  
balance, it must do so after deducting the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 June  2019.
