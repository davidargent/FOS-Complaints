Mr G says PDL Finance Limited trading as Mr Lender irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 7 loans Mr Lender  provided to Mr G between June 2014 and April 
2016. and October. Mr Gs borrowing history is as follows:
LoanDate 
TakenDate 
RepaidInstalments Amount Repayment
1 25/06/2014 28/08/2014 1 £300.00 £390.00
2 29/08/2014 02/10/2014 1 £150.00 £195.00
3 13/10/2014 13/11/2014 1 £110.00 £143.00
4 27/12/2014 27/02/2015 2 £210.00 £162.12
5 04/04/2015 10/04/2015 3 £230.00 £124.50
6 04/12/2015 25/02/2016 3 £180.00 £98.88
7 12/04/2016 29/04/2016 1 £140.00 £159.04
As noted by the adjudicator, there  is a gap of around  8 months between loans 5 and 6 so 
this will be considered as a break in the lending relationship between Mr G and Mr Lender. 
An adjudicator partially upheld Mr Gs complaint and thought that Mr Lender acted fairly in 
providing loans  1-4 and loans  6 and 7. However,  he found that Mr Lender shouldnt have 
given Mr G loan 5 as he had become reliant  on short  term lending.  Mr Lender  disagreed  and 
said the amount  borrowed, alongside  the fact this was an instalment loan meant  it was 
appropriate for Mr G. It also said it carried out adequate checks.
As an agreement couldnt  be reached, the case was passed to me  an ombudsman  for a 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good
industry practice - on our website.
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G 
could
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN06034482the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to 
make any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of 
income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult 
to meet  a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of 
time during  which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that 
repeated refinancing  may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending 
itself clearly demonstrates  that the lending  was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to 
establish whether  Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this 
is the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on 
time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to 
meet the repayments. And it follows  that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and 
reasonably their repayments sustainably if theyre  heir repayments without borrowing 
further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Mr Lender needed to more  when  it approved loans 1 to 4 and 
loans 5 and 6. Mr G didnt disagree  with the adjudicators opinion about  these loans  so I 
wont be making further findings on them.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders  lending history with Mr G, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender  should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Mr Lender should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans.
Given the particular  circumstances at this point  was reached by loan 5. I say this because:
At this point Mr Lender  ought  to have realised  Mr G was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr G had taken  out 5 loans  within 10 month  and Mr G was 
indebted to PDL for 7 of those months. The number of loans Mr G had taken within 
the time period means Mr Lender  ought to have realised it was more  likely than not 
Mr G was becoming reliant on short term lending to cover on-going shortfalls  in his 
finances.
Mr G had settled loans and taken out further  borrowing within  days up until loan 5. Mr 
Lender says the fact Mr G settled  loan 5 early means  that the loan was sustainable. 
Ref: DRN06034483But I dont think early  repayment demonstrates this and often early  settlement of a 
loan can be an indication  of issues with debt management. 
Mr Lender  says it carried  out checks and Mr G had sufficient disposable income to 
afford loan 5. However, the lending pattern by this point shows that Mr G was falling 
into a pattern of dependency on this form of credit.
I think that Mr G lost out because Mr Lender continued to provide borrowing for loan 5 
because:
this loan had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 5 and Mr Lender should  put things right.
putting things right  what PDL Finance Limited needs to do
A.)PDL Finance Limited shouldnt have given Mr G loan 5.
B.)PDL Finance Limited should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Mr 
G towards interest, fees and charges on these loans, including  payments made to 
a third party where applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
C.)PDL Finance Limited should  calculate  8% simple interest* on the individual payments 
made by Mr G which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date he 
originally made  the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
D.)PDL Finance Limited should  pay Mr G the total of A plus B.
E.)The overall pattern of Mr G borrowing for loan 5 means  any information recorded 
about it is adverse,  so you should remove this loan entirely  from hiss credit file. If 
PDL Finance Limited has sold this loan it should ask the debt purchaser to do the 
same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  you to deduct tax from this interest.  PDL Finance Limited should 
give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax youve deducted, if they ask for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. PDL Finance  Limited  
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 March  2020.
