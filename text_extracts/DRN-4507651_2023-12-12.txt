The complaint
Mrs B complains about a decision taken by The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) to
decline a claim she made against it under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974
(section 75).
What happened
On 18 February 2023 Mrs B paid an airline that I will call A for two tickets costing £392.05
(for herself) and £340.05 (for a third party).
On 27 April 2023 Mrs B paid A for two tickets costing £179.15 (for herself) and £179.15 (for
a third party).
On 28 July 2023 Mrs B asked A if that instead of her pursuing a claim against it for delayed
baggage (in respect of two previous booked and taken flights) would it be possible to cancel
the above four flights without penalty with a full refund being issued to her of £1,090.40
(£392.05 plus £340.05 plus £179.15 plus £179.15).
A cancelled all four flights. But instead of refunding Mrs B £1,090.40 it refunded her, on
4 August 2023, £320.40 (£84.15 plus £84.15 plus £76.05 plus £76.05) leaving an
outstanding balance of £770.00.
On 4 August 2023 Mrs B made a section 75 claim against RBS for the sum of £770.00 plus
£16.00 (£336.40 less £320.40).
On 4 August 2023 RBS acknowledged Mrs Bs section 75 claim.
On 8 August 2023 RBS declined Mrs Bs section 75 claim on the grounds it wasnt 
persuaded there had been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by A.
On 8 August 2023 Mrs B contacted RBS to dispute its decision to decline her 
section 75 claim and to raise a complaint about that decision.
On 14 August 2023 RBS contacted Mrs B to acknowledge her complaint.
On 22 August 2023 RBS issued Mrs B with a final response letter (FRL). Under cover of
this FRL RBS said it was satisfied that it had done nothing wrong in declining her
section 75 claim.
On 7 September 2023 Mrs B referred her complaint to our service.
On 5 October 2023 A refunded Mrs B £580.00 (£264.00 and £316.00) leaving an
outstanding balance of £190.00.
On 9 October 2023 A refunded Mrs B £190.00 (£95.00 and £95.00) leaving an outstanding
balance of £nil.
Mrs Bs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that
RBS should pay her £16.00 plus a further sum in interest.
RBS didnt respond. Mrs B responded to say that she believed she should be awarded
something for the distress and inconvenience this whole matter had caused her and the third
party.
The investigator considered Mrs Bs response to his view but wasnt persuaded to change
his mind. And because of this Mrs Bs complaint was passed to me for review and
decision.
In November 2023 I issued a provisional decision. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im very aware that Ive summarised this complaint above in far less detail than it may merit.
No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on what I think are the key issues
here. Our rules allow me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as
a free alternative to the courts. If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive
ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual argument to be
able to reach what I think is the right outcome. I will, however, refer to those crucial aspects
which impact my decision.
Mrs B says she is out of pocket by £16.00 following the refunds she received from A. But I
cant see that this is the case. Its my understanding that Mrs B paid A £1,090.40 and that is
what she has been refunded by it.
Section 75 provides that subject to certain criteria the borrower under a credit agreement
has an equal right to claim against the credit provider if there's either a breach of contract or
misrepresentation by the supplier of goods or services.
Having considered everything that has been said and submitted Im satisfied, for the same
reasons as the investigator, that Mrs B had a section 75 claim against RBS and this could
and should have been met by it. However, Im not persuaded that Mrs B necessarily had a
claim for £770.00. I say this because one of the criteria that needs to be met for a claim
under section 75 is that there must be a debtor, creditor, supplier (DCS) agreement.
In this case Mrs B paid for four flights, two in the name of herself and two in the name of a
third party. So I do wonder whether her claim should have been for less than £770.00.
But I need to make no finding on whether RBS should have to refund Mrs B £770.00
because A has refunded this sum. However, I do need to make a finding on whether RBS
should have to compensate Mrs B for how it handled her claim and subsequent complaint,
Mrs B submitting that that RBS handling of her claim and compliant has caused her and the
third party both distress and inconvenience.
As I say above, I think that RBS could and should have met Mrs Bs section 75 claim, albeit
possibly for a sum less than £770.00. But equally I need to take into account how quickly
RBS dealt with Mrs Bs claim and rejected it (although I dont agree with that rejection), how
quickly it dealt with her complaint, how quickly Mrs B was able to secure a full refund of
£1,090.40 from A and given that I can only make an award for distress and inconvenience
suffered by Mrs B, not any third party.And taking all this into account Im satisfied that RBS should pay Mrs B £50 (inclusive of any
financial loss suffered by Mrs B as a result of receiving a full refund from A when she did,
rather than sooner).
RBS responded to say that it accepted my provisional findings.
Mrs B didnt respond by the date I gave for a response to my provisional findings.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that RBS accepted my provisional findings and Mrs B didnt respond to them, I can 
confirm that I see no reason to depart from them and I now confirm them as final.
My final decision
My final decision is that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc must pay Mrs B £50.00, but it
need do nothing further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2024.
