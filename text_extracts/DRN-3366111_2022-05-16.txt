Miss D complained that 118 118 Money hadnt carried out proper checks before lending to 
her. 118 118 Money didnt uphold her complaint. It also said that she was out of time in 
making a complaint about the first two loans.
Miss D referred her complaint to us. Our adjudicator upheld the complaint. She thought we 
could look at the entire complaint and didnt think 118 118 Money had made a fair lending 
decision in respect of any of the loans. 
As 118 118 Money didnt agree regarding the merits of the complaint, the matter has been 
referred to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Since 118 118 Money hasnt objected to our adjudicators findings regarding the complaint 
about Loans 1 and 2 being within our jurisdiction, I dont need to consider that aspect further.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions 
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Miss Ds complaint. These two 
questions are:
1. Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Miss D would be able to repay the loans without experiencing significant adverse 
consequences?
If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
If not, would those checks have shown that Miss D wouldve been able to do so?
2. Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
The rules and regulations in place required 118 118 Money to carry out a reasonable and 
proportionate assessment of Miss Ds ability to make the repayments under these 
agreements. This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or 
affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower-focused  so 118 118 Money had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would be sustainable. In practice this meant that the business had to 
ensure that making the repayments on the loan wouldnt cause Miss D undue difficulty or 
significant adverse consequences. That means she should have been able to meet 
repayments out of normal income without having to borrow to meet the repayments, without 
failing to make any other payment she had a contractual or statutory obligation to make and 
without the repayments having a significant adverse impact on her financial situation.
In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 Money to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Miss D. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking. Even 
for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ds complaint.
Loan 1
When Miss D applied for the loan, she told 118 118 Money that her monthly income was 
£2,100 and her expenses were £830. She said the purpose of the loan was to buy or repair 
a car. 118 118 Money said it carried out a credit search and verified Miss Ds income using 
industry standard checks. 
The credit search revealed that Miss D owed a total of £10,845 over ten active accounts. 
She was using 87% of her available credit and spending around £450 a month on her credit 
commitments. She had been three months behind on some repayments in the previous 
twelve months. Shed gone over the limit on a mail order account from June to August 2014. 
Shed had an arrangement to pay on some accounts earlier that year, including one 
arrangement that had lasted until the previous month. There had been some searches 
against her name by debt collection agencies.
Overall, I dont think the checks carried out for this loan were reasonable and proportionate. 
I say this because I think the result of its credit search should have led 118 118 Money to 
carry out a complete review of Miss Ds finances before proceeding further. 
Ive looked at Miss Ds payslip and bank statements from around the time she applied for 
this loan. Im not suggesting here that these are the checks that 118 118 Money should 
necessarily have done. But I think looking at these would have given a good indication of the 
extent of Miss Ds financial situation at this time. These show that before she took out the 
loan Miss Ds salary was actually a lot less than shed told 118 118 Money. In the month 
before she took out this loan her salary, child benefit and child tax credit came to £1,374.06. 
Her bank account was in overdraft with more going out than was coming in. A direct debit 
payment had been returned.
I think on balance 118 118 Money ought reasonably to have realised that Miss D was 
struggling financially. Up to very recently Miss D had been finding it difficult to repay her 
existing credit commitments and so it would be unlikely that over the next 24 months she 
would be able to sustainably repay the loan it was proposing to make. I think in these 
circumstances 118 118 Money should reasonably have concluded that it was not 
appropriate to lend to her.
Loan 2
At the time she applied for this loan, Miss D said her income was £2,000 a month and her 
expenses £1,375. 118 118 Money carried out the same checks as for Loan 1.
By this time Miss Ds total borrowing had increased to £15,374 and she was using 96% of 
the credit available to her. She was £350 over her credit limit on a mail order account and 
had missed some repayments on mail order accounts recently. That suggests to me that her 
financial position had become worse rather than better.
Again I think the checks cant be said to be proportionate but in any event 118 118 Money 
ought reasonably to have realised that as Miss D had been finding it difficult to repay her 
existing credit commitments she would be unlikely to be able to sustainably repay this loan. I 
dont think 118 118 Money treated her fairly by lending to her.Loan 3
A year later Miss D paid off Loan 2 with part of the proceeds of Loan 3 and borrowed more 
again. 118 118 Moneys credit search showed shed clearly been having some financial 
difficulties in the past few months. Shed been given a credit extension on a short-term loan 
and taken out several pay day loans. Shed defaulted on her mail order account and she 
had an arrangement to pay on other accounts. Shed gone over the limit on her credit card 
account twice in 2016. I think this information should have concerned 118 118 Money as it 
indicated that Miss D was struggling to meet her existing commitments. 
If 118 118 Money had looked at Miss Ds payslip and bank statements, it would have seen 
more evidence of how she was struggling financially. Her income was still much less than 
shed told 118 118 Money and her credit commitments swallowed up over two thirds of it. 
Again I think 118 118 Money ought reasonably to have realised that Miss D would be 
unlikely to be able to sustainably repay this loan. 
Loan 4
Similarly by December 2017 Miss D was using 100% of her available credit. She was in 
default on her credit card and mail order accounts, both of which had been passed to debt 
collection agencies. Earlier that year shed been in an arrangement to pay on a credit card 
account and three months earlier on a telecommunication account. The previous month 
shed been late repaying a pay day loan. Shed taken out a loan for £8,000 five months 
earlier. 
This seems at odds with the information 118 118 Money had gathered indicating that Miss D 
would have ample disposable income each month. However if 118 118 Money had 
investigated her financial situation further before granting the loan, it would have found out 
that her income from salary and child benefit was much less than the figure it was working 
on and her credit commitments had crept up so that they were taking up over three quarters 
of it. I think 118 118 Money should have realised that with a further loan repayment of 
£116.44 on top, this latest loan was very unlikely to be affordable for Miss D. 
Loan 5
Eleven months later Miss D was still using 100% of her available credit and owed a total of 
£11,058. She was also still in default on her credit card and mail order accounts. Shed gone 
over the limit on her credit card account three months earlier. If 118 118 Money had carried 
out further checks, it should have seen that with this latest loan Miss D would be paying 
around £752 a month on her credit commitments which was over half her income from 
salary and child benefit. Once again this latest loan was very unlikely to be sustainably 
affordable for Miss D.
Ive also thought about whether 118 118 Money acted unfairly in some other way and I 
havent seen any evidence that it did.
Putting things right
As I have concluded 118 118 Money shouldnt have provided Loans 1 to 5, it should:
  refund all interest, fees and charges applied to those loans;
pay interest* of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest, fees and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement; andremove any negative information about these loans from Miss Ds credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Miss D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for 
one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Miss Ds complaint and require Madison CF UK 
Limited trading as 118 118 Money to put things right for Miss D as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 June 2022.
