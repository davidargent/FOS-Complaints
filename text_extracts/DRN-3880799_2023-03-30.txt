The complaint
Mr M complains that Phoenix Life Assurance Limited (Phoenix) gave him incorrect advice 
about purchasing an annuity.
What happened
In 2021, Mr M contacted Phoenix to look at his options for taking benefits from his three 
personal pension policies ending 988, 082 and 271. On 6 May 2021, Phoenix wrote to Mr M 
to say the total value of his three pensions was £261,524.93
In July 2021, Phoenix told Mr Ms independent financial adviser his three policies were worth 
around £258,000. Phoenix spoke to Mr M on 2 August 2021, and its note of the 
conversation say it told Mr M the transfer value of his three policies was £258,177.86.
Between 28 September 2021 and 1 October 2021 Phoenix called and wrote to Mr M several 
times with plan values and annuity quotes as follows:
Call: 28 September 2021: plan 271 gave a value of £77,561.
Call: 28 September 2021: plans 988 & 082 had a combined value £183,612.05. Mr M 
requested to defer taking these plans for one year.
Letter: 29 September 2021: Confirmed plans 988 & 082 must be taken together.
Letter: 30 September 2021: written confirmation plan 271 had a value of £77,561.33.
Letter: 1 October 2021: plans 988 and 082 had a total value £217,598.35
The values of the three plans, if taken together using the values Phoenix had given, in its 
letter of 1 October 2021 combined with its letter of 30 September 2021 wouldve been 
approximately £295,000.
Mr M returned forms to Phoenix that confirmed he wanted to stop contributing to his policies 
ending 988 and 082 and delay taking his benefits until he turned 61, which would happen in 
October 2022. Mr M wanted to use his plan ending 271 to take his Tax-Free Cash and buy 
an annuity.
On 28 October 2021, Phoenix sent Mr M a letter saying all three policies taken together were 
worth £259,093.31 in total and gave an annuity quote on this basis. It said he could take 
£64,733.32 in Tax Free Cash with an annuity of £18,346.32 a year. 
On 2 November 2021, Phoenix told Mr M he had to use all three policies to buy an annuity 
as they couldnt be separated. Mr M complained about being given incorrect information and 
Phoenix agreed it made a mistake and paid him £500 compensation. It confirmed this in its 
final response letter of 5 November 2021.
On 11 November 2021, Phoenix confirmed the total value of Mr Ms three pension plans 
were £260,685.16 and it had used all three to set up his annuity from November 2021 and 
paid him £65,171.29 in Tax Free Cash. Mr M called Phoenix on 12 November 2021 to query 
the value in its letter  he thought the total value of his three pensions should be 
£295,159.33.
On 15 November 2021, Phoenix called Mr M to explain its letter of 1 October 2021 should 
have quoted his plans ending 988 and 271. Phoenix logged a complaint and sent its final 
response on 17 November 2021. Its final response confirmed Phoenixs letter of 1 October 
2021 should have said its quote was for the policies ending 988 and 271. It accepted its 
mistake led Mr M to believe the total value of his pensions was around £295,000 and it sent 
Mr M a cheque for £500 to apologise. Unhappy with this response, and Phoenixs lack of 
professionalism, Mr M referred his complaint to our Service. 
One of our Investigators reviewed Mr Ms complaint. He was satisfied Phoenix had admitted 
its mistakes and thought Phoenixs compensation of £1,000 was fair. Mr M didnt accept our 
Investigators opinion, saying the process was weighted heavily in favour of Phoenix. So, this 
has come to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not in dispute that Phoenix gave Mr M incorrect information about whether all three of his 
policies needed to be used at the same time to buy an annuity. And its not in dispute that 
Phoenix made a mistake in its letter of 1 October 2021. The Financial Ombudsman Services 
role isnt to regulate or punish businesses  that is the role of the regulator (the Financial 
Conduct Authority). Were an informal dispute resolution service. Were independent and 
impartial. And, where something has gone wrong, our role is to say whether the business 
involved has treated their customer fairly. Mr M can read about our approach to 
compensation here:
https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumers/expect/compensation
So, my role here is to try to ensure Mr M is in the position he would have been in, had 
Phoenixs mistakes not been made. I wouldnt ask Phoenix to honour its mistake as it wasnt 
the true value of Mr Ms combined pensions. If Phoenix hadnt made a mistake in its letter of 
1 October 2021, Mr M would have been aware his pensions were worth around £260,000 (I 
note Phoenix had given the correct values in May, July and August 2021).
We have the power to tell Phoenix Life to pay compensation to recognise the impact on 
Mr M caused by its mistakes. It's clear this matter has caused Mr M some distress and 
inconvenience, so Ive considered whether the compensation offered by Phoenix Life is fair. 
Mr M can read about how we award compensation for distress and inconvenience here:
https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumers/expect/compensation-for-distress-or-
inconvenienceHaving considered the matter carefully, I think Phoenixs offer is fair and significantly more 
than I would have recommended had it not already paid this compensation to Mr M. 
Phoenixs offer is in line with awards we would make where were satisfied a business error 
has caused substantial distress, upset and worry. Here, Phoenix has recognised its mistakes 
and acted quickly to correct them. It put Mr M back in the position he would have been in 
had the mistakes not been made by giving him the right information within a relatively short 
timescale. I can see Mr M was frustrated with Phoenix, but Im not satisfied he was caused 
more than substantial distress, upset or worry so I dont think it would be fair to ask Phoenix 
to pay him any more compensation. 
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I dont require Phoenix Life Assurance Limited to do 
anything further.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 April 2023.
