K821x#15complaint
Mr M has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr M says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mr M took out some 17 loans (almost all instalment loans) from Sunny 
between December 2014 and October 2015.  Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Ms borrowing 
with Sunny, based on the information it provided  to us. It can be found in the appendix  at the 
end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  6 onwards. Sunny  made an offer to settle the complaint from 
the point of loan 11 onwards. Mr M doesnt agree  to this so the complaint has come to me 
for an ombudsmans  final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Ms 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr M could  repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN05632882There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay the loans;  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loans  being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr M could  
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr M. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending  history with 
a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which Sunny most likely carried  out appear to have  
been proportionate for loans 1  4. And I think these  loans would  have looked  affordable.  
I do think that by loan 5, I would  have expected  Sunny to carry out more in-depth  financial 
checking, but I still think the lending could have looked affordable,  not least  because of the 
income and expenditure details provided  by Mr M himself and the amount  being borrowed 
up to that point, which to me seems manageable for him. Mr M hasnt provided me with any 
information, such as bank statements, which might tend to show  otherwise. So Im not 
upholding this part of his complaint.
However, I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of loan 6 onwards 
in this case would have looked  different and therefore required a more thorough and 
responsible approach. The overall  pattern of Sunnys lending to Mr M should have caused  it 
to see, in my view,  that it shouldnt have  provided any further loans from this point onwards. 
This is because this was Mr Ms sixth short-term loan application with Sunny in 5 months or 
so and indeed  his third in just 3 days. So loan 6 was also taken out whilst other  debt was still 
outstanding. He was again asking to borrow from Sunny directly after paying off some of his 
previous loans, earlier in the chain. So Sunny ought  to have realised that Mr M wasnt 
merely borrowing to deal with short-term  cash-flow problems; he was borrowing very 
regularly, to address  shortfalls in his income  and to meet  an ongoing need. Mr M was having 
to consistently  take out high interest,  short-term lending over a sustained  period and the 
indebtedness caused by this type of borrowing was harmful, in my view. Sunny should have 
seen this and ought to have realised Mr M was at risk of not managing  to repay  the loans 
sustainably or getting into financial  difficulties. 
So Im upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 6 - 17. Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr M in 
an unsustainable manner  because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
Ref: DRN05632883the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  6 - 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 17 should be completely 
removed from Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr M a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited 
should put things right for Mr M as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 April 2020.
