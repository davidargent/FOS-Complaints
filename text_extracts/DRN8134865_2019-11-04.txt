K820x#14Complaint
Mr and Mrs L complain that ICICI Bank  UK Plc made mistakes when opening their fixed rate 
savings account  which led to a loss of interest.  
Background
Mr and Mrs L applied for a HiSave Fixed Rate Account paying 1.9% interest at the end of 
December 2018.  On 27 December 2018 ICICI emailed Mr and Mrs L and asked them to 
send a cheque  with the funds they wished to pay in. 
Mr and Mrs L say they sent a cheque (number 001885)  for Â£150,000 a few days later. ICICI 
says it didnt receive a cheque  from Mr and Mrs L until 21 January 2019,  after it had sent 
them a reminder.  On receipt  of a cheque (number  001887) ICICI opened a holding  account 
for Mr and Mrs L and paid the cheque in to clear.  The funds cleared on 
28 January 2019  and ICIC opened  the fixed rate savings account, backdating the interest to 
23 January 2019.  
On 30 January 2019 ICICI closed the fixed rate savings account on Mr and Mrs Ls 
instruction. Mr and Mrs L were unhappy  that they had been asked to send  a replacement 
cheque and that ICICI had returned the original one they sent. As the closure request was 
made within the first 14 days ICICI closed  the fixed rate account  down and paid the funds it 
held back into the holding account.  ICICI didnt  pay the fixed  rate of interest on the sums it 
held for Mr and Mrs L because they asked to close the account during  the first 14 days.  
Mr and Mrs L complained  but ICICI didnt  agree  it had made  a mistake.  Mr and Mrs L 
referred their complaint  to our service  and it was passed to an investigator.  The investigator 
didnt find any evidence  that ICICI had made a mistake and said that as the account was 
closed in the first 14 days no interest was due. Mr and Mrs L didnt accept so their 
complaints been  passed to me to make  a decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs L correctly say that ICICI appears to have received  both the cheques  they sent 
in. Mr and Mrs Ls cheque  numbered  001885  is dated 27 December 2018 which is around 
the date they completed the application. So I accept that they sent cheque 001885 first. But 
there appears to have  been a delay  in receiving cheque 001885. ICICIs records  show that 
the first cheque it received from Mr and Mrs L had the reference 001887 and was received  
on 21 January 2019. 
ICICI then used cheque  001887 to open  the holding  account and once the funds cleared 
they were used to open the fixed rate account  on 28 January 2019. 
ICICI says it didnt receive the original 001885  cheque Mr and Mrs L sent until 
31 January 2019.  I have  no reason  to doubt the evidence Ive seen from ICICI and its 
possible there was a delay in the delivery of the first cheque. Im satisfied  from the evidence  
Ive seen that the first cheque ICICI received was numbered 001887 and reached  it 
21 January 2019.  ICICI then used that cheque  to set up Mr and Mrs Ls accounts.  
Ref: DRN81348652Ultimately, Mr and Mrs L decided  to close their fixed rate savings  account  with ICICI. The 
fixed rate savings account was closed during the first 14 days after it was opened. The fixed  
rate account  terms say that if the account is closed and funds withdrawn  during  the first 14 
days no interest will be paid. I understand Mr and Mrs L feel ICICI should pay them  interest 
on the funds they saved.  But as they asked for the account to be closed during the first 14 
days, ICICI acted in line with the terms by not paying interest. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Mr and Mrs L but I havent  been persuaded to uphold their complaint. 
I havent found any evidence of an error by ICICI. I accept that the first cheque Mr and Mrs L 
sent was numbered 001885.  But I also accept  ICICIs claim that cheque 001885 was 
received after the replacement  cheque  001887 was sent. I dont know what  happened to the 
original cheque to cause the delay  but I havent found evidence  to show  ICICI made  
mistakes. 
Ive checked the interest Mr and Mrs L received. ICICI  has paid a lower  interest  because  the 
funds Mr and Mrs L had were in the holding account, not the fixed rate account they asked to 
close. The holding account pays  a much lower interest rate and thats reflected in the return 
Mr and Mrs L received. Im sorry to disappoint  Mr and Mrs L but as I havent found  any 
evidence of a mistake by ICICI and Im satisfied its dealt with their complaint fairly Im not 
telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs L to 
accept or reject my decision  before  4 December 2019.
