K821x#15complaint
Mr R complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited trading as Sunny  was 
irresponsible when  it provided him with seven high-cost short-term instalment  loans  between  
June 2015 and June 2018.
background
Mr R took seven loans  with Sunny between 13 June 2015  and 8 June 2016. All the loans 
were to be repaid  through monthly  instalments. The first was a nine-month term. The 
following six loans were  taken over 14 months.  The amounts of the loans varied between 
£200 and £1,500. I've prepared  this table showing some of the information  Sunny has 
provided about Mr Rs loans.

Loan 7 08/06/18 £1,500 22/07/19 22/07/19 409 days £199.64
*Loan 4 was taken  whilst Loan  3 was still outstanding which meant  that the total monthly  
repayments for both loans  was around £83.
At the point Mr R complained to Sunny there was an outstanding balance  on Loan 7 but I 
understand that this has now been  repaid. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into Mr Rs complaint and recommended  that it be partially 
upheld. He didnt  think that Sunny acted responsibly when it provided Loan  7. 
Sunny doesnt  accept  our adjudicators view about  Loan 7. So, the complaint  has come to 
me  an ombudsman  for a final decision. If Mr R accepts my decision  it will be binding on 
the parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could  
repay his loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Rs 
income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I 
think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN44807352But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr R. These  factors  include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr R could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. Whilst 
that might  be an indication a borrower  could sustainably make their repayments, it doesnt 
automatically follow. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as 
meaning that a borrower could repay the loans over the term of the agreement  without 
undue difficulties, on time, whilst meeting other  reasonable commitments and without having 
to borrow to meet those  repayments. And the regulations said that an assessment should 
take into account more than simply  assessing the customer's ability to repay the credit.
With this in mind Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information 
provided and what  this all means for Mr Rs complaint.  For ease of reference Ive rounded  
the figures involved.
When Mr R took Loan  1, he declared a monthly  income of £1,700 and expenses of £800, 
leaving around £900 disposable  income from which to repay the loan  over 9 months - 
which was due to cost around  £341 per month. In these circumstances I dont think  I can 
safely conclude that Sunny  failed to do enough  when it provided Loan  1 to Mr R.
Mr R repaid Loan 1 early  - after around  three months. He didnt return to Sunny for a loan for 
around 16 months. When he returned  for Loan 2 he declared that his monthly income had 
increased to £1,950 and his outgoings  were  £500. This loan was for a lower amount and the 
repayments were less too - at £139 per month. 
Given these factors and that there  had been  a break between  repaying Loan 1 and applying 
for Loan 2 it seems  that Sunny did proportionate  checks here too.
Loan 2 was repaid early  after about  two months.  Mr R came  back for Loan  3 just over a 
month later. But this time he was seeking  to borrow a much lower sum - £200  with monthly 
repayments of about  £26. Sunny did the same checks as before and again   in the 
circumstances  I'm not persuaded that Sunny  needed to do more  at this stage.  
But about a week  after taking Loan  3, Mr R took Loan 4. This time it was £400.  And it meant 
he had two loans  outstanding. I accept  that the amounts were  lower but a picture was 
developing of someone not managing their money particularly well.  So, even  though, the 
Ref: DRN44807353total amount Mr R was due to repay  was still relatively low at £83 per month,  I think  Sunny 
ought to have been doing more to verify the information it had been provided by Mr R and 
the details it was obtaining through  its own checks.  
And by the time Mr R applied for Loans  5 and 6 - both for £1,500 over 14 months, Sunny 
shouldve been  doing a full review of Mr Rs financial circumstances. He was declaring that 
he had zero credit commitments  but Sunny was aware that he had significant  credit 
balances: so it wasnt likely he was paying  zero towards them.  I accept that Sunny may have 
adjusted its calculations to take into account  some credit repayments,  but I dont think this 
went far enough.  These were loans for high amounts being taken over a 14-month  terms 
with only short breaks between them.
However, I dont have any evidence about  Mr Rs financial  circumstances at that time.  So, 
Im unable to say that, had Sunny done proportionate checks, it wouldve seen that Loans  4, 
5 and 6 were unaffordable  for him. So, Im not upholding his complaint about those.
But I am satisfied that when Mr R took Loan 7 a pattern of borrowing had emerged. Loan 7 
was Mr Rs sixth loan since he took Loan  2  a period of just over 16 months. During  that 
there had only been  relatively short periods when he wasnt indebted  to Sunny: a few weeks 
between Loans  2 and 3 and Loans  3 and 5 and around four months  between  Loan 6 and 7. 
The last three loans had each been  for £1,500   a high sum for this type of loan.  
I think this overall pattern  of Mr Rs lending history with Sunny means that it shouldve  
realised that further  lending  was unsustainable  and potentially harmful for him at the time he 
took Loan 7. These high-cost short-term products were intended for short  term use to plug a 
temporary shortfall in a borrowers cashflow. There was a pattern of loans being  taken not 
long after an earlier one was repaid (loans  3 and 4 had overlapped). The amount being  
borrowed for Loans 5, 6 and 7 was high and wasnt reducing. In these circumstances Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not that Mr R was having to borrow  further to 
cover the hole which was left from repaying  earlier credit. This wasnt  sustainable and 
potentially was harmful in that it was likely to restrict his ability  to access mainstream (and 
cheaper) credit.
In these circumstances Im satisfied that Loan 7 shouldnt  have been  provided to Mr R and I 
uphold his complaint about it.
putting things right
I require Sunny to do the following to put things right:
a)Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr R towards  interest, fees and 
charges on Loan 7 
b)Calculate 8% simple  interest** on the individual payments made  by Mr R which were 
considered as part of a, calculated from the date he originally made the payments, 
to the date the complaint is settled
c)Pay Mr R the total of a plus b.
Ref: DRN44807354d)Remove all information from Mr Rs credit  file about Loan 7. This is because the 
overall pattern  of his borrowing means  any information recorded about  Loan 7 is in 
itself adverse 
**HM Revenue & Customs  requires  Sunny  to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Mr R a certificate 
showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  I uphold Mr Rs complaint in part and require Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things  right in the way Ive explained.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 February  2020.
