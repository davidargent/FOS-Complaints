K820x#14complaint
Ms K complains  about the default that NewDay Limited has recorded on her credit file.
background
Ms K had a credit account with NewDay but she was experiencing financial difficulties so a 
reduced repayment arrangement was agreed  in May 2015  under which  she was to make  
monthly repayments of £1. A default  notice was sent to her in October  2015  and a default 
was recorded  the following month. NewDay also sold her account to a third party. NewDay 
wrote to Ms K in September 2016 to advise that it hadnt issued a notice of intent  to file a 
default to her. Ms K complained to NewDay about the default in March  2018. It offered to 
pay her £25 because  of its error. But Ms K wasnt satisfied  with its response so complained  
to this service.
The investigator didnt  recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She didnt think  that 
NewDays failure to send a notice of intent letter resulted in Ms Ks account being  defaulted  
as it was likely that she wasnt  in a financial position  to pay the amount due so the default  of 
the account wouldve been  inevitable.
Ms K has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman.  She says,  in 
summary, that:
she was treated unfairly  because,  by not receiving the notice of intent to register the 
default, she wasnt given the same  opportunity  as others who were  in the same 
position as her;
NewDay demanded £70 when it sent her the notice of default  but she couldnt afford 
to pay it in such a short  time when she was receiving  benefits, living  on a very small 
budget and didnt have  any extra money left;
If shed been  sent a notice of intent to register  the default shed have had time to 
arrange the payment  and shes provided payslips to show  that she was in 
employment and wouldve  been  able to afford  to pay the required amount; and
she didnt receive the notice  of default  and NewDay hasnt provided any proof that it 
was posted.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
A reduced  repayment  arrangement was agreed on Ms Ks account  in May 2015 under  which  
she was to make monthly repayments of £1. But NewDay says that due to the level of 
arrears and in line with its business policy and agreement  terms it sent Ms K a notice of 
default in October  2015. The credit limit on the account was £250 but the outstanding 
balance was £267.72. The notice said that if she didnt pay £73.50 within  three weeks  it 
would default  the account.
Ms K says that she didnt receive the notice. NewDay  has provided a copy of the notice that 
it sent to Ms K  and it was properly addressed to her. So I consider it to be more likely than 
not that the notice was sent to Ms K  even if she didnt receive it. And by sending the notice 
to Ms K I consider that NewDay  discharged  the requirement to give that notice to her.
Ref: DRN98027242NewDay accepts that it didnt send Ms K a notice  of its intention to register the default. It 
discovered the error and wrote to Ms K in September 2016 to explain its error. And when 
Ms K complained to it in March 2018 it apologised for its error and offered to pay £25 to her. 
Ms K says that she wouldve paid the required amount  if shed received the notice of 
NewDays intention to register a default  because she was working  part-time  then and 
receiving benefits. But if she was able to repay £73.50 to NewDay I consider that she 
couldve afforded to pay more to it each month than the £1 that she was paying  under the 
repayment arrangement. But Ive seen  no evidence to show  that Ms K contacted NewDay  
about her account  until after shed received the letter about its error.  And Ms K had other 
priority debts  so Im not persuaded  that she wouldve been able to pay the required 
amount.  
Ms K didnt make the payment set out in the default  notice by the required  date so NewDay  
recorded a default on the account in November  2015  and it sold her account to a third 
party. I consider that the default  is a true and accurate record of Ms Ks account. And Im not 
persuaded that it would  be fair or reasonable for me to require NewDay to remove  the 
default from Ms Ks credit file.
NewDay has offered to pay £25 compensation to Ms K. If she now wants to accept that offer,  
she should contact  NewDay to see if it remains available to her. But I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable  for me to require NewDay to pay any other compensation to Ms K or to 
take any other action  in response to her complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ks complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 31 August 2019.
