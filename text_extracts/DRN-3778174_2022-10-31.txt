The complaint
Mr K, a sole trader, is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt 
approve his application for a business bank account.
What happened
Mr K wanted to apply to NatWest for a Bounce Back Loan (BBL). One of NatWests 
requirements for a BBL was that a NatWest business bank account must be in place to 
facilitate the servicing of the BBL. Because Mr K used his personal current account to 
administer the finances for his sole trader business, and didnt have a business account with 
NatWest, it meant Mr K would first need to apply for a NatWest business bank account  in 
the form of a loan feeder account (LFA)  before being allowed to then apply for a BBL.
Mr K applied to NatWest for an LFA, but NatWest declined his application. Mr K wasnt 
happy about this, so he raised a complaint. NatWest looked at Mr Ks complaint and 
confirmed that his LFA application had been declined. NatWest also didnt feel that theyd 
acted unfairly towards Mr K in doing so, and so didnt uphold his complaint. Mr K wasnt 
satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They liaised with NatWest, who confirmed 
that Mr Ks application had been declined at an early stage of the application process, but 
that further assessment had shown that this shouldnt have been the case.
After considerable discussion, our investigator asked NatWest to consider a similar LFA 
application for Mr K, on the understanding that it now wouldnt be declined at the early stage 
that the initial LFA application had been. NatWest did consider a similar application for Mr K, 
but while this application did pass the stage at which the prior application had mistakenly 
been declined, the application was then declined by NatWest at a later stage of the 
application process.
Our investigator obtained information from NatWest about why Mr Ks new application had 
been declined at this later stage. Having done so, they felt that NatWests decision to decline 
Mr Ks LFA application at the later stage was reasonable. Our investigator also felt that had it 
been the case that Mr Ks first LFA application hadnt been declined incorrectly at the early 
stage, that it would in all likelihood have been fairly declined by NatWest at the later stage.
As a result, our investigator felt Mr K hadnt incurred any detriment as a result of NatWest 
declining his first LFA application as they did  because it would always have been the case 
that the first application would have been declined. So, they didnt uphold this complaint. Mr 
K remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.      
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I can understand how Mr K might be frustrated at having been told that his 
LFA application, which was incorrectly declined by NatWest at an early stage of the 
application process, would still have been declined by NatWest at a later stage of the 
application process, had the application progressed that far.
In his correspondence with this service, Mr K has referenced BBLs as being guaranteed by 
the UK Government, implying that there wasnt a risk to NatWest and that as such his 
application should have been approved. However, while Mr K is correct in saying that the UK 
Government did guarantee BBLs, lenders such as NatWest were still expected to perform 
appropriate checks on BBL applicants and to decline any applications which didnt satisfy 
those checks. 
Importantly, it wasnt the case that lenders such as NatWest were expected to provide BBLs 
to any applicant who met the eligibility criteria  BBL applications were always subject to 
appropriate checks. In any event, Mr Ks application didnt get as far as a reward for a BBL 
itself  rather it was for the LFA, a distinct product for which the bank was entitled to set its 
own requirements and conduct checks of its own choosing.
In this instance, its clear that NatWest did initially decline Mr Ks LFA application at an early 
stage of the application process for an incorrect reason. But it doesnt follow from this that Mr 
Ks LFA application would necessarily have passed the further checks that would have been 
required before the application could have been approved. 
Indeed, Im satisfied from the information provided to this service by NatWest in regard to the 
more recent LFA application they processed that this more recent application was fairly 
declined following checks undertaken at a later stage of the application process than at 
where Mr Ks first application was originally incorrectly declined. And Im also satisfied that 
Mr Ks first LFA application would, in all likelihood, also have been fairly declined at that later 
stage for the same reasons.
This means that if NatWest hadnt made the mistake that they did here and hadnt declined 
Mr Ks initial LFA application at the early stage, then that application would have been 
reasonably declined at a later stage. Consequently, this means it would never have been the 
case that Mr Ks LFA application would have been successful, meaning that it would also 
never have been the case that Mr K could have obtained a BBL from NatWest.
Im aware that Mr K would like a more detailed explanation from NatWest as to why his more 
recent application was declined at the later stage and why its felt that his initial application 
also would have been declined at that stage. I can appreciate Mr Ks position here, but I 
hope hell understand that information about why loan applications arent successful can be 
commercially sensitive such that I wouldnt expect NatWest to provide the more detailed 
further information about this point to Mr K as he would like. 
One reason for this is because if detailed information about why a loan application has failed 
a specific check is released into the public domain, it increases the risk that this information 
could then be used by future applicants to circumnavigate that check, thus potentially 
reducing its effectiveness.
However, NatWest have provided an explanation of exactly why Mr Ks later LFA application 
wasnt successful to this service, and having reviewed this further information, Im satisfied 
that NatWests position isnt unfair and that it was reasonable for them to have declined Mr 
Ks application at the later stage as they did. And while I appreciate this might not be entirely 
satisfactory for Mr K, I hope that he finds some solace from knowing that someone impartial 
and independent has reviewed NatWests reasoning and finds it to be unproblematic.
All of which means that Im satisfied there hasnt been an unfair outcome here, and this is because, as explained above, Im satisfied that it would always have been the case that Mr 
Ks initial LFA application to NatWest would have been unsuccessful.
Finally, Ive considered whether NatWest should be asked to provide any compensation to 
Mr K for the inconvenience hes incurred here as a result of his application being incorrectly 
declined by NatWest at the earlier stage in the first instance. But taking the circumstances of 
this complaint into account, I feel that Mr K would in all likelihood have raised a complaint 
with NatWest about the declining of his first application even if that first application had been 
declined by NatWest at the later stage. And so, its difficult for me to conclude that Mr K has 
incurred any inconvenience here beyond that which he would have reasonably incurred, had 
his LFA application been declined by NatWest for the correct reason in the first instance. 
I realise this wont be the outcome Mr K was wanting here, but it follows that I wont be 
upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action. I hope that Mr K 
will understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 November 2022.
