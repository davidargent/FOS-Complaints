The complaint
Mr R is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his account without
any notice, leaving him unable to access his funds.
What happened
Mr R had a NatWest account which he used to receive benefit payments which he depended
upon to buy essential living provisions. In April 2021, NatWest sent Mr R a letter advising
they would be closing his account in 60 days time. Mr R didnt receive this letter, and so
wasnt aware that his account would be closed.
When Mr R discovered that he could no longer access his NatWest account or withdraw
funds from it he contacted NatWest to ask why. NatWest couldnt initially explain to Mr R
why his accounts couldnt be accessed, but it was eventually confirmed to Mr R that his
accounts had been closed. Mr R wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mr Rs complaint, but they felt that theyd closed the Mr Rs account in
line with the terms and conditions of the account  which stipulated that the account could be
closed following the provision of 60-days notice to the account holder, which NatWest
maintained theyd provided. Because of this, NatWest didnt uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Mr R wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they also felt that NatWest had closed
Mr Rs account in line with the terms of that account, and while they acknowledged that Mr R
hadnt received the 60-day notification letter that NatWest had sent, they didnt feel that
NatWest could be held accountable for the non-delivery of sent mail.
Mr R remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 23 March 2022 as follows:
Its clear from the terms of the NatWest account that NatWest had the right to close 
the account so long as they provided Mr R with 60 days notice. And while Mr R didnt 
receive the letter sent by NatWest which gave him such notice, Im satisfied from the 
information that NatWest have provided to this service that the letter was in all 
likelihood sent.
It's also the case that this service wouldnt generally look to hold a business 
accountable for the non-delivery of a sent letter. So, it seems that NatWest did 
undertake the steps necessary to fulfil their procedural obligations before closing Mr 
Rs account.
However, it can be the case that a correctly followed process can still lead to an 
unfair outcome, and I think that thats whats happened here.
I say this because of the specific circumstances surrounding this account. As 
explained, Mr R used the account to receive benefits upon which he depended 
financially. This means that the closure of Mr Rs account without his knowledge had 
the consequence of depriving him access to these benefits upon which he was 
reliant.
This is a significant consequence and as such I feel that NatWest had a duty of care 
to Mr R that went beyond sending a single notification letter - which if it wasnt 
received, as it wasnt in this instance, resulted in a major impact for Mr R.
Instead, I feel that NatWest should have understood the impact that having the 
account closed without his knowledge could have had on Mr R, and should have 
taken additional steps to confirm that Mr R was aware of the impending closure of his 
account.
So, while Im satisfied that NatWest could close Mr Rs account if they chose to do 
so, I dont feel that NatWest took the reasonable steps necessary to ensure that Mr R 
wasnt unfairly impacted by the closure of his account without his knowledge. And it 
follows that Ill be provisionally upholding this complaint in Mr Rs favour on that 
limited basis.
As such, my provisional instructions to NatWest will be that they must make a 
payment of £200 to Mr R to compensate him for the trouble and upset this matter has 
caused. Im aware that Mr R feels that significantly higher compensation is merited in 
this instance, but I dont share Mr Rs position here, and feel that £200 is fair in 
consideration of the impact that NatWest not ensuring that Mr R was made aware 
that his account would be closed has had.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr R and NatWest the opportunity to provide 
any comments or new information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a final 
decision. NatWest confirmed that they were happy to accept my provisional decision, 
whereas Mr R did provide some further comments for my review.
In his comments, Mr R confirmed that he feels that a higher amount of compensation above 
and beyond the £200 I provisionally instructed is warranted in this instance, and he 
reiterated his position as to why he feels this is the case. 
However, while Mr R has reiterated his position, I can confirm that I considered all the points 
that Mr R raised in response to my provisional decision when arriving at my provisional 
decision. 
Matters of compensation can be subjective, with an amount considered as being fair and 
reasonable by one person not being considered as being such by someone else. And while I 
can appreciate Mr Rs strength of feeling here, I continue to feel that the £200 compensation 
I provisionally instructed is a fair and reasonable amount in consideration of the 
circumstances of this complaint, and I can confirm that my final decision will be that I am 
upholding this complaint in Mr Rs favour on that basis. 
Putting things right
NatWest must make a payment of £200 to Mr R to compensate him for the trouble and upset this matter has caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc on 
the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 May 2022.
