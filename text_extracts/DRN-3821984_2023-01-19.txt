The complaint
Mr B complains about a delay and poor service by National Westminster Bank Plc when he 
tried to make an international transfer. 
What happened
Mr B visited a NatWest branch in June 2022 and instructed an international transfer. But 
branch staff failed to include the reason for the transfer and the instruction was ultimately 
declined by the receiving bank and sent back to Mr Bs account. Mr Bs told us he received 
less back than he should have. 
Mr B contacted NatWest to chase up the transfer and it was rekeyed and sent around two 
weeks after it was originally instructed. 
Mr B complained to NatWest and it apologised its branch staff had failed to follow the right 
steps when instructing his international transfer. NatWest funded £34.50 of charges and £10 
call costs. NatWest also paid Mr B £80 for the service provided and delays. 
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Bs complaint. They asked NatWest to increase 
the compensation by a further £80, taking the total award for the service provided and 
inconvenience caused to £160  in addition to refunds it made. The investigator also 
confirmed NatWest refunded the £7.90 difference between the transfer amount originally 
made and returned. NatWest agreed but Mr B asked to appeal. Mr B said NatWest had 
acted unlawfully by deducting charges. As Mr B asked to appeal, his complaint has been 
passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Bs told us he thinks NatWest acted unlawfully when deductions from his transfer amount 
were made. I appreciate Mr Ds concerns, but Id like to explain how the Financial 
Ombudsman Service operates and makes decisions. We decide complaints on a fair and 
reasonable basis. That means well take all the available regulations and legislation into 
account, but my decision will be based on whether I think NatWest treated Mr B fairly overall. 
In response to the investigator, Mr B said he was concerned about the deductions made 
from his account. NatWest has told us the receiving bank sent the transfer back to it when it 
couldnt proceed. But the receiving bank deducted a fee and Mr B received £7.90 less back 
into his account when the transfer funds were deposited. I agree it would be unfair for Mr B 
to suffer a loss because NatWest failed to follow the right approach when instructing his 
transfer in branch. But NatWest has provided evidence to show the £7.90 difference was 
refunded to Mr B. So whilst I understand why Mr B was upset to receive less back, Im 
satisfied NatWest has fairly resolved this point by refunding the difference. 
NatWest accepted its branch staff made a mistake and failed to check and include the 
reason for the transfer. Thats why the transfer failed. I agree the service shouldve been 
better and that Mr B shouldve been able to rely on NatWest to carry out his instructions 
without making avoidable mistakes. So I agree it was reasonable for NatWest to uphold Mr 
Bs complaint. 
NatWest refunded £34.50 of charges and £10 of call costs to cover any further losses Mr B 
mayve incurred. And NatWest paid Mr B £80 for the trouble and upset caused. The 
investigator increased the award by a further £80, taking the total settlement to £160. 
NatWest agreed, but Mr B didnt think the settlement was fair. I understand Mr B wants 
NatWest to accept further liability, but Im satisfied its dealt with his complaint fairly overall. 
Mr B hasnt told us about a financial loss over and above the refunds already agreed. And 
Im satisfied the £160 compensation payment NatWest has agreed to pay fairly recognises 
the impact of the way the transfer was handled and distress and inconvenience caused. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr B but as Im satisfied NatWest has agreed to pay to a settlement 
that is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances Im not increasing the award further or 
telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to 
pay him a further £80, in addition to any compensation already agreed. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2023.
