The complaint
Mrs S complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money didnt close her 
credit card account when she asked it to resulting in adverse data being recorded on her 
credit file. 
What happened
Mrs S held a credit card with 118 118 Money which attracted a monthly subscription fee. 
Mrs S says she contacted 118 118 Money on several occasions in early 2022 to close her 
account. But the account wasnt closed. As a result, her credit card account continued to be 
debited with the monthly subscription fee. So, Mrs S complained to 118 118 Money saying it 
hadnt responded to her instructions to close the account.
In the meantime, as Mrs S didnt make a payment to cover the monthly fees, she received 
communications from 118 118 Money about arrears on the account and, ultimately, the 
account was defaulted. This adverse information was recorded on Mrs S credit file. 
In response to the complaint, 118 118 Money said it had replied to Mrs S email about the 
closure of the account asking her to answer some security questions so it could complete 
her request. But Mrs S didnt provide the required information. As such, 118 118 Money 
doesnt think it has done anything wrong. But it wrote off the balance owing - £89.50, and 
closed the account. But it said it wouldnt remove the information from her credit file as this 
reflected what had happened on the account. 
Mrs S was dissatisfied with the response and so one of our investigators looked into it. But 
he thought 118 118 Money had acted fairly. He was satisfied that 118 118 Money had 
responded to Mrs S emails, and it had not received the information it requested. He noted 
that 118 118 Money had written off the outstanding balance. But he didnt think it was 
required to amend the adverse information it had recorded on Mrs S credit file. 
Mrs S didnt accept the investigators outcome. She reiterated that she asked for the account 
to be closed at the start of the year and she wanted the adverse data on her credit file 
removed. 
Mrs S complaint was passed to me, and I issued a provisional decision. 
What I said in my provisional decision dated 24 January 2023
Mrs S says she contacted 118 118 Money in January 2022 asking for her account to be 
closed. But having looked at Mrs S credit card statements, Ive seen that she used the card 
for a transaction on 4 February 2022. So, Im not persuaded Mrs S asked for the account to 
be closed in January 2022. 
Mrs S statement for February 2022 included the monthly fee. As Mrs S used her account in 
February 2022, Im satisfied that the monthly fee for February 2022 was rightfully due. 
118 118 Money has provided the email chain between it and Mrs S. This indicates that the 
first email Mrs S sent requesting the account closure was on 27 February 2022. This was 
after she received an email from 118 118 Money highlighting her account was £17 in 
arrears. And the account status was also confirmed in the February 2022 statement. So, if 
118 118 Money has recorded adverse data because of Mrs S account being overdue at this 
point, Im satisfied it was correct to do so as this is an accurate reflection of the 
management. 
The statements go on to show that Mrs S made some payments to her account in         
March 2022. But as she made no further payments and the fees continued to be added, the 
balance outstanding increased over the subsequent months to £89.50. But Mrs S didnt use 
the account for any further spending after February 2022. 
So, Ive thought carefully about whether 118 118 Money acted fairly when it continued to 
charge Mrs S for the account and when it recorded adverse data on her credit file. And I 
dont think it did, Ill explain why. 
Im satisfied that 118 118 Money didnt ignore Mrs S emails  Ive seen evidence to show it 
responded asking Mrs S to answer some security questions. Im also satisfied that Mrs S 
didnt respond in the manner 118 118 Money requested. 
But I accept that it was Mrs S intention to close the account. She emailed instructions to    
118 118 Money to this effect at the end of February 2022 and she had stopped using the 
card at this point. Mrs S also made payments - in March 2022, to clear the arrears from 
February 2022. And Im not persuaded that 118 118 Money needed Mrs S to answer 
security questions to action an account closure instruction. An account closure in these 
circumstances doesnt present any risk to the lender. At the very least, 118 118 Money could 
have suspended the account  to avoid any further charges or potential spending  while the 
admin around the account closure was completed. 
Overall, I do think Mrs S could have expediated matters sooner had she responded with the 
information 118 118 Money had requested. But equally, Im persuaded that 118 118 Money 
acted unfairly in continuing to apply fees to an account that was no longer being used and 
when it was aware Mrs S had requested the account to be closed. 
I can see that 118 118 Money has since written off the balance that subsequently accrued 
because of the fees. Given the above, I think this was the right thing to do. 
But 118 118 Money has also recorded adverse data on Mrs S credit file which solely relate 
to the fees applied to her account after she had asked for the account to be closed and after 
she last used it. In the circumstances, Im not persuaded that this is fair. I find this action is 
disproportionate to the circumstances. Mrs S credit file would now indicate that she hadnt 
managed her 118 118 Money credit card account correctly, and Im satisfied this isnt a true 
reflection of what happened. 
As mentioned above, Mrs S had instructed her account to be closed and shed stopped 
using it. So, I think it would be fair and reasonable for 118 118 Money to remove all adverse 
information it has recorded on Mrs S credit file  including the default, from March 2022 
onwards. 
I have also considered whether an award for distress and inconvenience is warranted. But 
as mentioned above, Im not persuaded that Mrs S did enough to mitigate the circumstances 
as Ive found she didnt respond to 118 118 Moneys emails when it asked her to. So, I dont 
intend to make any award in this respect.
Responses to my provisional decision118 118 Money accepted my provisional decision. Mrs S didnt respond despite a reminder 
being sent.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As no further evidence or arguments have been put forward for me to consider, I see no 
reason to depart from provisional decision as set out above. 
   
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above and in my provisional decision, I uphold Mrs S complaint. 
And I instruct Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money to take the steps required 
to remove the adverse data it recorded on Mrs S credit file from March 2022 onwards.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 March 2023.
