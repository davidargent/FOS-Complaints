The complaint
Miss B complains that FirstRand Bank Limited trading as Motonovo Finance didnt treat her 
fairly, when she asked for a settlement figure on a hire purchase agreement she has with 
them.
What happened
In early 2015 Miss B bought a used car from a dealer, using a loan under hire purchase 
agreement with FirstRand. A few months before the agreement was due to end, in July 
2019, Miss B wrote to FirstRand to tell them shed changed her address. She also asked 
FirstRand for a settlement figure for the loan. Miss B sent the letter by recorded delivery and 
also enclosed some documents, which included her driving licence and a loan statement.
Miss B didnt receive a response from FirstRand, so in September 2019 she wrote to them 
again by recorded delivery. FirstRand replied with an email a few days later and said Miss B 
needed to pass their customer verification procedure, in order for them to carry out her 
instructions. To do so, FirstRand told Miss B they needed her to confirm her date of birth.
In her following correspondence with FirstRand, Miss B explained shed already given them 
the information they needed, within the documents she had sent. FirstRand didnt agree and 
continued to ask Miss B for confirmation of her date of birth. In the meantime, Miss B had 
changed her mind about settling the loan and was being pursued by FirstRand, as the loan 
had entered into arrears.
By February 2020, Miss B had complained to FirstRand as she wasnt happy about being 
contacted about the arrears of the loan and because she hadnt received her settlement 
figure. Miss B also complained that FirstRand had lost the documents shed sent to them the 
previous year and that they hadnt yet changed her address.
In their response to Miss Bs complaint, FirstRand said that they had tried several times to 
verify Miss Bs identity, but she hadnt given them the necessary information. They also 
disputed receiving the documents Miss B says she sent to them in 2019. Miss B didnt 
accept FirstRands response, and brought her complaint to us. She said shed like the 
remaining balance of the loan to be written off, in light of how FirstRand had treated her.
One of our investigators looked into Miss Bs case and concluded that FirstRand had treated 
her fairly when they tried to verify her identity. The investigator also found that without any 
identity verification, it was unlikely that FirstRand could change Miss Bs address.
Miss B didnt agree and said shed already received letters sent to her new address. More 
recently, the investigator agreed it was likely Miss B sent FirstRand some documents in 
2019. The investigator went on to say he still didnt think FirstRand had changed their 
address records but noted that a settlement figure had now been sent. The investigator 
concluded that Miss B did experience some distress and inconvenience, when FirstRand 
had lost the documents and asked FirstRand to pay Miss B £150. 
FirstRand didnt respond, but Miss B did. She didnt accept the investigators conclusions 
and said the impact of the distress meant that she had lost employment. She also said she 
was left without a driving licence, which stopped her from carrying out day to day tasks. 
Miss B asked the investigator to consider an increased award.
The investigator didnt change his findings and Miss Bs case has now been passed to me to 
make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
FirstRands attempt to verify Miss Bs identity
Both Miss B and FirstRand have sent us their records showing the correspondence between 
them, from July 2019 onwards. Within that correspondence, I can see that Miss B instructed 
FirstRand to send her a settlement figure and to change her address. Miss B has provided 
proof of postage for her initial letters to FirstRand. So, I agree that Miss B was clear in what 
she wanted FirstRand to do.
I can also see that FirstRand wrote to Miss B on seven separate occasions to either ask for 
verification of her date of birth, or to tell he how they could act on her instructions. Ive 
thought about how FirstRand treated Miss B here. Having done so, I dont think it was 
unreasonable for FirstRand to try and verify who had sent them the letter. And I think the 
information FirstRand asked Miss B to provide, wasnt unrealistic or troublesome for her.
FirstRand didnt respond to the letter Miss B sent in July 2019. Instead it appears that they 
responded to her follow up letter, two months later. Although I accept that FirstRand caused 
a delay, I dont think this had an impact on Miss Bs decision to change her mind about 
settling the loan. I say this because Miss B wrote to FirstRand in December 2019, to say that 
shes decided not to pay off her borrowing.
Miss B says she had already provided her date of birth to FirstRand, because she had 
enclosed her driving licence, within her letter of instruction in July 2019. I agree that the 
information Miss B says she sent to FirstRand may have contained details of her date of 
birth. But, I dont think this would have mattered, because it was FirstRands objective to 
verify the sender of the letter, regardless of the content.
Im also aware an advisor from FirstRand incorrectly told Miss B that they had changed her 
address, even though they hadnt had confirmation of her date of birth. FirstRand say the 
address they hold for the loan documents hasnt changed, but Miss B says she already 
received letters to her new address.
Miss B hasnt provided any letters to show any correspondence related to the loan has been 
sent to her new address. And FirstRand has reiterated that Miss Bs address hasnt 
changed. On balance, I think the advisor from FirstRand gave Miss B incorrect information 
and that Miss Bs address for the loan correspondence remains as it was in July 2019.
Overall, I think FirstRand treated Miss B fairly and reasonably when they attempted to verify 
her identity, after they had received the change of address instruction. I can see that 
FirstRand remain open to engaging with Miss B further and have since provided an up to 
date statement and settlement figure. 
So, I think its now for Miss B to provide FirstRand with the details needed to complete her 
change of address on FirstRands records.The lost documents
Throughout Miss Bs complaint, FirstRand have said they didnt receive the documents 
Miss B says she sent to them. On the other hand, Miss B has been very clear that she did 
send a letter containing documents which included her driving licence and a loan statement. 
Miss B has also provided proof that she sent the documents by recorded delivery.
Ive looked at FirstRands contact records and I can see from an internal note, that an 
advisor confirmed they opened a letter from Miss B in October 2019. The note goes on to 
say that within Miss Bs letter, there was proof of her new address and other documentation.
Having considered everything, on balance, I think FirstRand received Miss Bs letter which 
contained her driving licence and a loan statement. I know it wont come as much comfort to 
Miss B to learn that FirstRand has so far been unable to trace her documents. But, I think 
she has long since suspected that.
After considering all the evidence, I think FirstRand made an error when they said they didnt 
receive the documents Miss B says she had sent to them. So, Ive gone on to think about the 
impact of the error on Miss B and what FirstRand should do to put things right.
Distress and inconvenience  
FirstRand sent an email to Miss B on 20 April 2021 and apologised for the wording of some 
of their previous correspondence. They said they cannot locate any letters sent to Miss Bs 
new address and provided a settlement figure for the loan. FirstRand also offered Miss B a 
payment of £60 to reflect the distress shed experienced.
Miss B says she took advice from a legal professional and stopped paying the amounts due 
under the hire purchase agreement, until she had received a settlement figure. I dont doubt 
that Miss B had reason to seek advice elsewhere to help her. 
But, I can see from Miss Bs letters and emails to FirstRand, that she was aware there was 
still a balance owed under the loan agreement. So, I dont think it was unreasonable or unfair 
for FirstRand to pursue Miss B for missing payments. I can also see that FirstRand have 
recently provided a new settlement figure to Miss B, and that she now has the most up to 
date information about how to repay the balance she owes.
I accept Miss B has found being pursued for the repayments distressing. Having considered 
everything though, I think FirstRand have treated her fairly, by attempting to come to a 
repayment arrangement with her. And I remind FirstRand about their ongoing obligation to 
treat Miss Bs financial circumstances fairly, when trying to make future repayment plans.
Miss B also says that being without a driving licence caused problems when trying to prove 
her identification, and the distress caused to her, meant she needed to leave her job.
I acknowledge that being without a key identification document like a driving licence had an 
impact on Miss B and caused her distress. But, I think Miss B was able to tell the DVLA her 
licence was lost at the end of 2019, given FirstRand had told her they couldnt find the 
documents shed sent to them, or hadnt received them.
Additionally, I sympathise that Miss B may have encountered difficulties, which has led to 
her changing or leaving her employment. But, Im not persuaded this was as a result of 
FirstRand misplacing her driving licence. That is not to say though that Miss B hasnt been 
put to any worry because of the error.I accept its likely that Miss B has needed to apply for a new driving licence and this would 
have taken time and effort. And I can see that a replacement would have cost around £20. 
So, Ive considered that, when looking at a fair award to resolve her complaint.
In all the circumstances, I think its fair for FirstRand to increase their award to £150 in total, 
for the distress and inconvenience caused to Miss B.
Putting things right
FirstRand Bank Limited trading as Motonovo Finance must increase their award and pay 
Miss B a total £150 to settle this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct FirstRand Bank Limited trading as 
Motonovo Finance to pay Miss B £150 for the distress and inconvenience shes been 
caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 January 2022.
