The complaint
Ms G complains about the level of interest shes been charged on her mortgage with      
Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax. Shes unhappy that the interest rate on her 
mortgage didnt change in line with the Bank of England (BOE) base rate and she feels shes 
been overcharged interest because the Standard Variable Rate (SVR) has been set unfairly.
What happened
In 1996, Ms G took out a mortgage with Halifax. The loan amount was Â£38,000 and the term 
was 25 years. Ms G was to pay a discounted rate until June 1999. Following this, she would 
pay Halifaxs reversionary variable rate for the remainder of the term.
In 2002, Ms G took out another fixed interest rate product with Halifax. When this ended in 
2005, the mortgage reverted to Halifaxs SVR.
Given the length of time that has passed since Ms G took out the mortgage, Halifax has 
limited information available, and it has only able to provide information about Ms Gs 
mortgage account since 2004 onwards. I dont consider this to be unreasonable in the 
circumstances.
Since 2004, the BOE base rate and Halifaxs SVR operated as follows: 
In 2020, a professional representative complained on Ms Gs behalf to Halifax about the 
interest charged on her mortgage. In summary, it said Ms G had been overcharged because 
the SVR had been set unfairly.
Halifax issued its final response letter in November 2020. In summary, it said: 
The mortgage conditions allowed Halifax to vary the interest rate at any time if certain 
reasons exist, such as to reflect changes in its costs of funding mortgages and for 
other specified reasons.
There was no obligation for Halifax to change the SVR in line with changes to the 
BOE base rate, and it was satisfied the relevant interest rates had been correctly 
applied to Ms Gs mortgage. 
Once the fixed rate period came to an end, there was no ERC applicable. So, Ms G 
was able to repay the mortgage without incurring any charges under the terms of the 
mortgage contract.Date effectiveBase RateHalifax SVRDifference

us:
Ms G has been overcharged interest on her mortgage payments because the SVR 
had been set unfairly, and the mortgage offer was unclear about how changes could 
be made to the SVR.
Ms G was aware of the difference between the SVR and the BOE base rate (the 
margin) when deciding whether the mortgage was suitable for her. But the SVR 
hadnt varied in line with the BOE base rate, and Halifax had used its discretion about 
when and how to vary the SVR unfairly. This has caused an unfair increase in the 
margin.
Ms G was misled to believe the SVR would vary in line with the BOE base rate, so 
the margin between the two would remain the same.
The terms that allowed Halifax to charge and vary the SVR were unfair for the 
purposes of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (UTCCR).
Ms G couldnt dissolve the agreement and switch to a new lender following changes 
to the SVR, as this would incur a cost.
Since referring the complaint to our service, Ms Gs representative has ceased trading and is 
no longer involved in this complaint.
One of our investigators looked into whether we can consider Ms Gs complaint. Having 
considered the relevant time limit rules, he felt we can only consider how interest had been 
applied to Ms Gs mortgage from October 2014, although in considering this, we would need 
to bear in mind earlier rate changes. He went on to consider how interest had been applied 
to Ms Gs mortgage since October 2014, but he didnt think the complaint should be upheld. 
In summary, he said:
He thought the terms of the mortgage were clear and didnt say or imply the SVR 
would track the BOE base rate. 
He was satisfied Halifax had varied its SVR in line with the terms and conditions of 
the mortgage.
Whilst he thought some of the terms allowing Halifax to vary the SVR could be 
considered unfair, he wasnt satisfied the way in which the terms had been applied 
had resulted in unfair treatment for Ms G.
Both parties accepted the investigators view on the jurisdiction matter. However, Ms G didnt 
agree with the investigators view on the merits of the complaint. She asked for this to be 
reviewed by an ombudsman, although she didnt provide any further submissions.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms Gs representative provided detailed submissions to our service. Ive read these 
carefully, but I dont intend to set it all out in my decision. No discourtesy is intended by that, 
it simply reflects the informal nature of the service we provide. Instead, my decision will 
concentrate on the issues I think are central to the outcome of the complaint. But Id like to 
reassure Ms G that Ive carefully considered everything thats been said.
Ms Gs representative told us that Ms G was aware of the difference between the BOE base 
rate and Halifaxs SVR when the mortgage was taken out, and said that she was led to 
believe one of the features of the mortgage was that the interest rate would track the base 
rate over the term, so the margin between them would stay the same.
Theres no general obligation on mortgage lenders for their SVRs to track the BOE base 
rate, and Im satisfied that this isnt the way Halifaxs SVR operated.
Ive reviewed the documentation from the point of sale, including the original Mortgage Offer 
dated May 1996 and the applicable 1995 Mortgage Conditions. Ive also reviewed the 
documentation available from the 2002 product transfer and the applicable 2001 Mortgage 
Conditions. Having done so, I havent seen anything that says Halifax would link the SVR to 
the BOE base rate or that compels it to. Nor is there anything that suggests that the SVR 
would be a particular margin above or below the BOE base rate.
It follows that Im not persuaded that there was any requirement for the SVR to track the 
BOE base rate or maintain any margin between them.
Halifax sets out its entitlement to vary its SVR in its Halifax Group Mortgage Conditions 
2001. This says the following, under 7. The interest we charge:
7.10 We can change the interest rate on any part of the capital at any time unless the offer 
or any extra agreement says we cannot. We can change the interest rate for any of the 
following reasons:
(a) To reflect changes in the cost to us of raising the money we lend to our customers with 
mortgages.
(b) To reflect changes in rates of interest charged by other major lenders (including the 
terms on which mortgages are offered by them).
(c) To reflect: changes to the law or codes of practice, a decision or recommendation made 
by, or a requirement of, a court, ombudsman, regulator or similar body or an undertaking 
given to the Director General of Fair Trading.
(d) To reflect changes to the way we look after the mortgage account or mortgage accounts 
generally (including changes to the technology we use) because of: 
- the steps we have taken to modernise or improve our systems for managing those 
accounts; or
- reasons outside our control.
(e) To reflect changes to the accounting period.(f) Because:
- we are going to take over, take control of or acquire the business of another bank or 
organisation offering similar services;
- we are going to be taken over or our business is acquired by another bank or 
organisation offering similar services; or 
- any of these things has happened, 
and the change will make sure that our customers and the customers of the other bank or 
organisation are treated in a similar way if they are in similar categories.
(g) To reflect changes to the way the property is used or occupied.
(h) Because we must reduce the base rate under condition 7.17(b).
Im satisfied the terms and conditions allow Halifax to vary the SVR independently of the 
BOE base rate. In considering whether Halifax did this fairly and reasonably during the time 
period I can consider, Ive considered the relevant law - specifically the Unfair Terms in 
Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (UTCCR).
Having reviewed this legislation, some important considerations are whether the terms in    
Ms Gs agreement go further than reasonably necessary to protect Halifaxs legitimate 
interests, whether the SVR variation clauses are sufficiently transparent, and whether there 
were significant barriers to Ms G dissolving the contract.
I think the reasons listed in the terms and conditions that Halifax may vary the interest rate 
may be considered broad and open to interpretation. It follows that I think that its possible 
that a court may find some of the terms allowing Halifax to vary the SVR unfair, in relation to 
the unilateral discretion for Halifax to vary the rate and the possible lack of transparency of 
when a particular term would be engaged.
Although, more generally, I dont think the concept of an SVR, or a variable reversion rate is 
an fundamentally unfair one. Its a common feature of the UK mortgage lending market. A 
reversion rate allows a lender to attract new customers with a preferential initial rate, while 
building in the flexibility a variable rate allows to manage its longer-term costs. Many 
borrowers treat the reversion point as an opportunity to shop around for another preferential 
rate  either with their existing lender or moving to another lender.
Ive also considered whether there were any significant barriers to Ms G exiting the 
mortgage. There was no ERC applicable to Ms Gs mortgage after 2005. So, she was free to 
re-mortgage elsewhere without having to pay a charge to end the existing contract with 
Halifax.
Had Ms G re-mortgaged elsewhere, she would likely incur some general fees and possibly 
some legal costs, but Im not persuaded this would be considered a significant barrier to exit, 
as any borrower would incur these costs if they decided to move to a new lender.
But even if the terms were considered to be unfair, that wouldnt necessarily mean that there 
has been unfairness. Under our rules I am required to consider what is fair and reasonable 
in all the circumstances. That includes  but is not limited to  relevant law.
So, Ive also thought more broadly about whether, and the extent to which, the way in which 
the terms have been used has resulted in unfair treatment for Ms G in the interest charged to 
her from 2014 onwards. In doing so, Ive considered the historic context which may have 
contributed to the interest rate charges from 2014 onwards and whether Halifax had 
legitimate reasons for varying the rate in the way it did.I can see that between 2008 and 2009, the difference (or margin) between the BOE base 
rate and Halifaxs SVR increased from 2% to 3%. Whilst Halifaxs SVR did reduce during this 
period, it didnt fall by the same proportion as the reduction in the base rate.
Halifax has told our service that, despite a reduction in the BOE base rate, its funding costs 
increased considerably between 2008 and 2009. 
During this time, there was a significant change in the wider lending market as a result of the 
global financial crisis. This impacted on the funding costs of businesses, which was reflected 
in changes to a number of lenders interest rates charged across the market at that time.
Halifax has provided relevant explanations and reasoning behind the decisions made to vary 
the interest rate during this period. This is supported by evidence that shows the direct 
impact of its increased cost of funding and how this correlated with its decision to vary the 
SVR. Considering this, I dont think Halifax has acted unreasonably by not passing on all of 
the reductions in the BOE base rate to its SVR.  
I can also see that, in May 2012, Halifax increased the SVR from 3.5% to 3.99% when there 
hadnt been any changes to the BOE base rate. Halifax has provided evidence to show that 
its cost of funds had increased and it increased the SVR by 0.49% in order to account for 
those increased costs. Considering this, I dont think Halifax acted unreasonably by doing 
this, in line with 7.10(a) in its Mortgage Conditions.
Since 2012, Halifaxs SVR has remained at 3.49% above the BOE base rate.
Considering all the information and evidence available to me, I have not seen any evidence 
to suggest the changes Halifax made were unfair. Rather, the evidence Ive seen satisfies 
me that Halifax acted in line with its terms and conditions to protect its legitimate interests 
while balancing its obligation to treat Ms G fairly. And Im further satisfied that the evidence 
Halifax has been able to provide for this period is corroborated by evidence of wider market 
conditions at the time.
Considering everything, Im not satisfied that Halifax has acted unfairly or unreasonably in 
the circumstances.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 July 2023.
