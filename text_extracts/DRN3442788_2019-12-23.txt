MYJAR has offered  to put things right and pay compensation  for loans 5 and 6 in line with 
what our service would  consider to be fair and reasonable. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ws complaint in part and thought loans 7 to 9 shouldnt have 
been given. MYJAR  didnt  agree.  So the complaint was passed to me, an ombudsman,  to 
make a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN34427882the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
MYJAR needed to do more when it approved loans 1-4. This was early on in the lending 
relationship between the two parties and the loan repayments for each one of these loans 
seemed affordable based on what Mr W had told MYJAR. So I dont think  MYJAR was 
wrong to give these four loans to Mr W.
MYJAR has offered  to put things right with regards loans 5 and 6. So I have not needed to 
make any findings about  these  loans. I will be asking MYJAR  to honour its offer when it puts 
things right.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MYJARs  lending history with Mr W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached at loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point MYJAR  ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr W had taken out and repaid six loans within  around  4 months. 
So MYJAR ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr W was having  to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loans were  leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ws indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. In fact, the 
amount Mr W had requested had increased significantly by the time he asked for 
loan 7 and he was asking for it to be over a longer repayment period. MYJAR ought  
Ref: DRN34427883to have known  that Mr W was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing need. Mr W had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to MYJAR over an extended  period.
I think this pattern of lending should have alerted MYJAR to the likelihood that Mr W 
was having problems managing his money. I think that MYJAR  shouldve been 
concerned that Mr W might be borrowing elsewhere to repay its loans, again 
increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Mr W lost out because MYJAR continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ws ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 7, 8 and 9 for the reasons given above. It should  
also put things  right with loans  5 and 6 also.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
Refund all interest  and charges Mr W paid on loans  5-6 and 7-9;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
Remove any negative  information with regards  to loans  5 and 6.
The number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse, so all entries about  loans 7, 8 and 9 should  be removed from 
Mr Ws credit file.
Mr W still owes MYJAR some of the principal balance  he borrowed on his final loan (loan  9). 
MYJAR may deduct  this from the compensation that is due to him. But, to be clear,  that 
outstanding balance should be recalculated to remove any interest and charges, whilst 
taking account  of any repayments  Mr W has made on that loan as though they were applied 
against the principal sum borrowed.
If there is an outstanding balance  left over then MYJAR should try to agree an affordable  
repayment plan with Mr W. In doing  so MYJAR should treat Mr W positively and 
sympathetically over repayment of the loan.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give Mr W 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN34427884my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. MYJAR Limited 
(trading as MYJAR) should pay Mr W compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 January 2020.
