Mr A says that he had become dependent on payday loans and stuck  in a cycle of debt. He 
says that had adequate  checks  been carried out Sunny would have realised that lending to 
him wasnt in his interest. 
Sunny says that before the loans were  provided  it carried out eligibility,  credit  worthiness and 
affordability checks. It says that it provided  21 loans  even  though  Mr A applied for 26 which 
shows it carried out checks  as five loan applications  were declined. It says that the 
information gathered  through  its checks resulted in Mr A meeting its lending  criteria in regard 
to the 21 loans and so these were provided. 
Sunny says that Mr A repaid some of his loans early and that Mr A didnt inform it that he 
was in financial difficulty at the time of the loans.
Our adjudicator didnt  think that there was enough evidence to say that loans one to four 
shouldnt have been provided but she thought that loans five to 21 shouldnt have been lent. 
Ref: DRN63159222By the time loan five was provided, our adjudicator thought that proportionate checks  would 
have shown Mr A was having problems managing  his money. She said that Mr A had a 
number of other short term loans outstanding at the time and Sunny should have realised at 
this stage that providing this loan and subsequent loans wasnt  sustainable.
Our adjudicator thought that by loan six, Mr As pattern of borrowing showed that he had 
become persistently reliant of short  term borrowing and she didnt think this or subsequent 
loans should have been provided.
Sunny didnt accept  our adjudicators view.  It said that the repayments due under the loans 
were on average equal to around 4.6% of Mr As monthly income. It said that its product 
allows customers to take out up to four loans  at a time to give them flexibility  regarding  the 
amount they borrow. It said that having multiple  loans outstanding  therefore wasnt  evidence  
of the loans being unsustainable. It didnt accept that the loans provided were unaffordable.  
Sunny said that there was no outstanding balance on Mr As account.
My findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr A could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumer's income  and expenditure.  With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  his loans  - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
Ref: DRN63159223as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr As complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think that there was enough to say that loans one to four shouldnt 
have been provided. Based on what I have seen  I agree with this.
Loan five was for a much  larger amount than the previous loans (£800). The four previous 
loans had been repaid  before  this loan was provided. As the previous loans had been repaid 
early, by the time Mr A was given  loan five he had been borrowing from Sunny for just over 
two months. His monthly income had increased  to £2,600 and the information gathered on 
his expenses suggested he had a disposable income of £1,174.
Given the increased amount and that this was the fifth loan in the lending chain I think  Sunny 
should have carried  out a thorough review  of Mr As financial circumstances to ensure the 
loan was sustainable. Had this happened, Sunny would have seen that Mr A had taken out 
multiple loans with other short  term loan providers in the weeks  before the loan was 
provided. Given he was taking out new loans  while others were still outstanding, I think this 
should have raised concerns that Mr A was struggling to manage  his money. Given  this I 
think that had proportionate checks been carried out Sunny would have realised that this 
loan wasnt sustainably affordable.
Loan six was for £900 and again I think that had proportionate checks been carried out 
before this loan was provided Sunny would have realised that this loan wasnt sustainably  
affordable.
By the time loan seven was provided,  I think that Mr As pattern of borrowing showed that he 
had become persistently dependent on short term loans.  This was his seventh  loan in 
around three  months  and at this time the loan amounts were increasing.  He took out loan 
three shortly after repaying loans  one and two. He then took out loan five shortly after 
repaying loans  three  and four. Loan  six was taken out on the day loan five was repaid. I think 
this suggests  a pattern of new loans being taken out as previous loans are repaid. Loan  
seven was taken  out the day loan six was repaid.
Although the loans  taken out from loan nine onwards were for lower  amounts than had been  
provided in some of the earlier loans, I do not find that this suggests  that Mr A had reduced 
his dependency  on short term loans. He was taking out overlapping loans and so, while the 
individual loan amounts were lower, the total amounts outstanding at any one time were 
much larger.  Mr As pattern  of borrowing continued with new loans being taken out either  
before previous loans were repaid or shortly after.
Therefore I uphold this complaint in regard  to loan five to loan 21.
Ref: DRN63159224My final decision
My final decision is that Elevate Credit International Limited should:
A.add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr A towards interest,  fees and 
charges on all upheld  loans, not including  anything  that has already been refunded.
B.calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr A which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr A originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C.remove any adverse information  you have recorded on Mr As credit  file in relation  to 
loans five and six. The overall  pattern of Mr As borrowing for loans seven to 21 
means any information recorded about them is adverse, so all information about  
these loans should be removed from Mr As credit  file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires tax to be deducted from this interest. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should give Mr A a certificate  showing  how much tax has been 
deducted, if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 December  2019.
