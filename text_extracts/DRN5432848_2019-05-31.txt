K821x#15complaint
Ms N complains about the handling  of a payment  dispute she had with a supplier by 
TSB Bank plc (TSB).
background 
In February 2017  TSB debited Ms Ns credit card account (account) with £2,860  in respect  
of a purchase she had made from a supplier for goods. This brought her account balance to 
£2,860 (debit).
Between April and September 2017 Ms N paid £3,122.31 to her account. The £262.31  paid 
by Ms N in excess of the original debit of £2,860 was made up of £255.31 interest  plus a 
£12 late payment charge less a £5 cashback. This brought  her account balance  to zero.
In January 2018 Ms N complained to TSB that she hadnt received the goods she had paid 
£2,860 for in February 2017. TSB agreed  to raise  a chargeback.
In February 2018  TSB credited Ms Ns account  with £2,860. This brought her account 
balance to £2,860 (credit).
In February 2018  TSB paid Ms N £2,860  (from  her account). This brought  her account 
balance to zero.
In April 2018 (after  the chargeback request had been declined), TSB debited  Ms Ns account  
with £2,860. This brought her account balance to £2,860 (debit). However TSB agreed to 
consider Ms Ns claim for non-receipt of the goods she had ordered  under  Section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974  (section 75).
Between June  and October 2018 Ms N paid nothing to her account. During the same period 
TSB charged Ms N £289.02 interest  plus a £12 late payment charge. This brought her 
account balance  to £3,161.02 (debit).
In October  2018 (having agreed  to uphold the section 75 claim) TSB credited Ms Ns 
account with £2,860.  This brought her account  balance to £301.02 (debit).
Between October and November 2018 Ms N paid nothing to her account. During the same 
period TSB charged Ms N £19.29 interest.  This brought  her account balance to £320.31  
(debit).
Ref: DRN54328482In November 2018, one of our investigators  considered Ms Ns complaint about TSBs 
handling of her payment dispute. In summary  he said that TSB should:
pay Ms N £100 for its handling of her payment  dispute
refund  any charges,  or interest,  debited to Ms Ns account
pay Ms N interest at 8% simple per annum on each and every payment made to the 
account in respect of the February 2017  purchase
remove any adverse information  it might  have recorded with third party  credit 
reference agencies
In December 2018 TSB credited Ms Ns account with £320.31. This brought her account 
balance to zero. It also agreed to pay Ms N £100 for its handling of the payment dispute and 
to remove any adverse information it might have recorded with third party  credit  reference 
agencies.
In February 2019  TSB paid £100  to Ms Ns current account.
In March 2019 TSB agreed to pay Ms N a further £299.39, this being  simple interest at 
0.64% (net) on £2,860 between 28 February 2017  and 18 October 2018. However it said it 
wasnt prepared to pay what  it understood the investigator had recommended it should pay, 
this being interest  at 8% simple per annum  on each  and every payment she made to her 
account from the date payment was made to the date of settlement.
In March 2019 the investigator put TSBs  further  offer to pay £299.39 to Ms N for her 
consideration. However Ms N said she wasnt satisfied with that offer and she would like her 
complaint considered by an ombudsman.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in May 2019. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   
TSB has accepted Ms Ns claim under section 75 should succeed because  of a breach of 
contract by the supplier. And from what Ive seen, Im in agreement with this conclusion. So 
what I need to decide  in this case is what,  if anything, TSB should have to pay Ms N for that 
breach over and beyond  what it has already  paid.
In my view what  TSB should  have  to do (having paid Ms N £100 for its handling of her 
payment dispute,  having removed any adverse information it might  have recorded with third 
party credit reference  agencies in respect  of this matter and having credited the account with 
£320.31  to bring it to zero) is to reconstruct  Ms Ns account, taking into account the various  
refunds and re-credits  already applied to it, as if the February 2017 transaction  for £2,860  
had never  taken place.
Its my understanding that had the February  2017  transaction for £2,860 never taken  place 
Ms N wouldnt have  been required to make any payments  to her account. Yet she paid to 
her account  (between  April and November 2017) £3,122.31. So I think  that that TSB should 
have to pay Ms N £262.31,  this being the difference between  £3,122.31 (the sum paid by 
Ms N to her account) and £2,860 (the February  2017 transaction cost).
Ref: DRN54328483As well as refunding  this sum TSB should  also compensate  Ms N for the time she was 
without the funds she used to make  the payments that she did between  April and 
November 2017.  And this should be in the form of interest at 8% simple a year on each 
payment Ms N made  to her account  from the date each payment was made to the date the 
refund of £2,860 was paid back to her out of it.
Its my understanding that the payments made by Ms N were as follows:
04/04/17 £57.10
08/05/17 £81.00
08/06/17 £60.44
06/07/17 £73.54
07/08/17 £60.00
31/08/17 £2,790.12
15/09/17 11p
And the refund of £2,860 was paid back to Ms N from the account on 27 February 2018.
Im also of the view,  for broadly the same  reasons, that TSB should pay Ms N (by way of 
compensation) 8% simple interest a year on the £262.31 she has, in essence, been without 
from the date the refund  of £2,860 was paid back to her and the date this sum of £262.31 is 
paid to her.
I appreciate TSB might have some reservations  about the above proposed  compensation. 
But taking everything  into account, I think that this proposed compensation constitutes a fair 
and reasonable sum for TSB to have  to pay in the particular  circumstances  of this case.
TSB accepts Ms N has a valid claim  (against  the supplier and therefore it by virtue  of 
section 75) for a breach  of contract. With this in mind, Ms N shouldnt be left unfairly 
disadvantaged as a result of that breach. So TSB should make sure that Ms N gets back  
anything she paid in relation to the transaction including  interest and charges. And that she 
gets interest on any refunds to reflect being  without those refunds  for the periods  she was 
without them. And the rate of interest  that we tend to use where a consumer has been 
deprived of a sum of money (in this case various refunds) is 8% simple  a year in line with the 
rate generally used  by the courts.
Neither party provided anything materially new for my consideration in response  to my 
provisional findings.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that neither  party  has provided  anything materially new for my consideration in 
response to my provisional  findings I see no reason to depart from them and I now confirm  
them as final.
Ref: DRN54328484my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and TSB Bank plc must, having  already paid 
£100 for its handling  of the payment dispute,  having removed any adverse information  it 
might have recorded with third party  credit reference  agencies  in respect of this matter and 
having credited  the account  with £320.31   to bring it to zero, pay Ms N:
1.£262.31, this being the difference between £3,122.31 and £2,860.
2.Interest at 8% simple per annum on each and every payment she made  to her 
account between  April and September 2017  from the date each payment was made 
to the date the refund of £2,860  was paid back to her.
3.Interest at 8% simple per annum on the £262.31  identified in (1) above from the date 
the refund  of £2,860  was paid back to her and the date this sum of £282.31  is paid to 
her.
 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires TSB Bank plc to deduct  basic rate tax from the simple 
interest in (2) and (3) above. But it should give Ms N a certificate  showing how much its 
taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 July 2019.
