K822xcomplaint
A limited company (B) complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt 
update its address when it was asked to.
 
B is represented by Mr H, its director.
background 
B has a business current account with NatWest. Mr H phoned NatWest  and went into branch 
to ask it to change Bs business address, but NatWest didnt do. Mr H didnt realise Bs 
address hadnt  been changed  until he called NatWest again some weeks  later to order  a 
new business debit  card and PIN. On that call he was told that NatWest  had already sent a 
new card and PIN out to his old address.
Mr H feels that NatWest  put his account  at risk when  it did this. He complains that he was 
also left without a business debit card for more  than two weeks.
Mr H says that when he phoned NatWest later to complain, the person he spoke to didnt 
take his complaint seriously. So he asked to speak to a manager. But he was told that a 
manger wasnt available.  Mr H says he was kept waiting for around 15 minutes, and put on 
hold three  times before he was eventually put through. The manager set up a complaint for 
him, but he thought the person he spoke to the complaints  department was condescending 
and argumentative.  
NatWest accepts it didnt  change Bs address  as requested and apologised. But it didnt offer 
Mr H any compensation. So he came to our service.
  
Our investigator looked into what happened, and listened to the relevant  phone calls 
between Mr H and NatWest. He appreciated how worried  Mr H was about what  happened, 
and spoke to NatWest about the complaint. After this it offered Mr H (on behalf  of B) £150 
compensation for what happened. Our investigator  thought that was a fair and reasonable 
amount bearing  in mind the fact that NatWest  cancelled  the new card and PIN once it 
realised it had been sent to the wrong  address, and that no money  was taken from Bs 
account by a third party. Our investigator  also considered  the inconvenience this matter 
caused. 
Mr H disagreed with our investigator. He said the £150 offered didnt reflect the hassle  hed 
had on the phone talking to NatWest  about  this matter, the number of phone  calls he had to 
make, and the impact it had on him personally.  He feels that NatWest has failed him, and 
that £150 compensation doesnt reflect  that.
So Ive been  asked to review this complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN10923792Its clear that Mr H remains very annoyed about  what happened.  He says NatWest  put his 
account at risk by sending  the card and PIN to the wrong address, and that he was failed by 
NatWest. Mr H also points out that he had to make a number of sometimes  difficult phone 
calls to NatWest to report the matter, and to get it to take his complaint seriously. He says he 
the inconvenienced caused  by not having a business debit card for around two weeks.  I 
dont underestimate  Mr Hs strength of feeling about  all this. However,  I think its worth 
pointing out that my role isnt my role to punish NatWest  for what  happened, or to focus on 
what mightve happened.
Im conscious that NatWest has apologised for what happened. I can also see that no money  
was taken from Bs account  using the relevant card and PIN, and that NatWest  cancelled the 
card once it became  aware of its mistake.
Taking the matter  as a whole, and bearing  in mind the nature of NatWests  mistakes,  
including the amount  of time Mr H was affected, I also think  the £150 compensation NatWest 
has offered is enough to put matters right. Im aware that Mr H thinks he should  be offered 
more compensation  given  the impact of what happened on him personally. I understand the 
point hes making. But the current account in this complaint belongs to B, not Mr H. Although 
I appreciate that Mr H has been  the one handling this matter, he did so in his capacity as Bs 
director. That means that Ive considered the inconvenience  NatWest caused B. 
my final decision
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H, on behalf  of 
Big Lux Ltd to accept  or reject my decision before  10 February  2019.
