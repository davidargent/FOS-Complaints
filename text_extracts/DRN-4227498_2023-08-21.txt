Miss B has complained that MML didnt act responsibly when approving these loans, and 
she didnt think that theyd carried out sufficient verification and affordability checks. MML 
didnt think Miss B had complained about Loans 1 to 6 in time, as these were approved more 
than six years before her complaint was made. They also thought theyd carried out 
sufficient checks when Loans 7 to 12 were approved.
However, as a gesture of goodwill, MML offered to write off the outstanding £2,622.84 
balance outstanding on Loan 12 and pay Miss B an additional £750. Miss B wasnt happy 
with this offer, so she brought her complaint to us for investigation.
On 17 August 2023 I issued a decision explaining why we couldnt consider Miss Bs 
complaints about Loans 1 to 6. As such, this decision will deal with Loans 7 to 12 only.
Our investigator said that, by completing a full credit check, verifying Miss Bs income, and 
carrying out detailed conversations with her about her income and expenditure, MML carried 
out reasonable and proportionate checks for each of Loans 7 to 12. He also said that MML 
had provided evidence of all these checks, which showed that Miss B had sufficient income 
to be able to sustainably afford each of the loans.
The investigator also considered repeat lending, and whether it was irresponsible to lend to 
Miss B many times over. And, after doing so, he didnt think that MML had acted unfairly, 
and he wouldnt be asking them to do anything more.
Miss B didnt agree with the investigator. She said that there were no significant gaps in the 
lending, and that this was detrimental to her. And she thinks that we should apply our well 
established approach to repeat lending and consider everything as a whole rather than 
each loan individually.
Because Miss B didnt agree with the investigator, this matter has been passed to me to 
make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When someone complains about irresponsible and/or unaffordable lending, there are two 
overarching questions I need to consider in order to decide whats fair and reasonable in all 
of the circumstances of the complaint. These are:
1. Did MML complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Miss B 
would be able to repay the credit in a sustainable way?
a. if so, did MML make a fair lending decision?
b. if not, would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown that Miss B 
could sustainably repay the borrowing?
2. Did MML act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
And, if I determine that MML didnt act fairly and reasonably when considering Miss Bs 
application, Ill also consider what I think is a fair way to put things right.
Did MML complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Miss B would 
be able to repay the credit in a sustainable way?
Theres no set list for what reasonable and proportionate checks are, but Id expect lenders 
to consider things such as the amount, duration, and payments of the finance being applied 
for, as well as the borrowers personal circumstances at the time of each application. 
MML have said that, as part of every application for credit they receive, they undertake 
eligibility, creditworthiness, and affordability checks. And they do this by reviewing the 
customers credit file and their monthly income and expenditure. Theyve evidenced they 
carried out these checks for Miss B.
So, based on what Ive seen and MMLs comments, Im satisfied that MML were carrying out 
reasonable and proportionate checks.
Did MML make fair lending decisions?
Loan 7
In applying for Loan 7, Miss B repaid Loan 6 and borrowed an additional £500. In doing so, 
her weekly payment reduced by £5 (£21.67 a month).MML havent provided a copy of the credit check they carried out for Miss B when she 
applied for Loan 7, as this is no longer available. However, based on the credit files I have 
seen, Im satisfied that, at the point of application, Miss B had five historic defaults, dated 
between October 2014 and December 2015. There were no County Court Judgements 
(CCJs). I wouldnt expect MML to decline any finance application just because there were 
defaults present. However, I would expect them to consider these as part of any overall 
lending and risk decision. Which, in this instance, is what MML did.
The budget planner MML completed confirmed Miss Bs income as £366.40 a week (£1,575 
a month), of which only 95% was used in any calculations. And MML have provided 
evidence that Miss B proved her income at this level. The notes on the budget planner show 
that an in-depth conversation about her income and expenditure took place with Miss B, and 
this included payments to the credit commitments showing on her credit file, as well as the 
defaults. The budget planner also lists the credit commitments MML found on Miss Bs credit 
file.
As a result, and after taking all Miss Bs discretionary and non-discretionary expenditure into 
consideration, the budget planner showed that Miss B had sufficient income to sustainably 
afford the payments to MML.
Given this, Im satisfied that the lending decision MML made for Loan 7 was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances.

applied for Loan 8, as this is no longer available. However, based on the credit files Ive

between October 2014 and August 2016; and two CCJs, dated between September and 
December 2016. I wouldnt expect MML to decline any finance application just because 
there were defaults and/or CCJs present. However, I would expect them to consider these 
as part of any overall lending and risk decision. Which, in this instance, is what MML did.

consideration, the budget planner showed that Miss B had sufficient income to sustainably 
afford the payments to MML.
Given this, Im satisfied that the lending decision MML made for Loan 8 was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances.

present. However, I would expect them to consider these as part of any overall lending and 
risk decision. Which, in this instance, is what MML did.

only 95% was used in any calculations. The notes on the budget planner show that an in-
depth conversation about her income and expenditure took place with Miss B, and this 
included payments to the credit commitments showing on her credit file, as well as the 
defaults and CCJs.

consideration, the budget planner showed that Miss B had sufficient income to sustainably 
afford the payments to MML.

reasonable in the circumstances.

reasonable in the circumstances.
Loan 12
In applying for Loan 12, Miss B repaid Loan 11 and borrowed an additional £500. In doing

consideration, the budget planner showed that Miss B had sufficient income to sustainably 
afford the payments to MML.Given this, Im satisfied that the lending decision MML made for Loan 12 was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances.
Did MML act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Miss B has raised the issue of repeat lending, which Ive considered as part of my decision. 
However, repeat lending isnt automatically unfair, and Miss B hasnt provided me with any 
evidence to show that it was.
When Miss B took out Loan 7, there was less than one months payment outstanding on 
Loan 6. And she chose to roll this over into Loan 7, rather than waiting a month or more 
before taking out any new lending. Whats more, in taking out Loan 7 (which I note was over 
the same term as Loan 6, and over a lower term than Loans 1 to 5), Miss B reduced her 
payments by £5 a week.
Given this, Im satisfied that with Loan 7 Miss B was, to all intents and purposes, starting a 
fresh set of lending that was entirely separate to Loans 1 to 6.
Loan 7 was approved in August 2016 and, between then and October 2018, Miss B 
refinanced with MML a further five times, borrowing an additional £500 on each occasion. 
So, over a period of just over two years, Miss M borrowed a total of £3,000 from MML, and 
saw her weekly payments increase from £16 to £54.11 over this period. As Ive said above, 
each additional £500 lent was done so fairly, and with Miss B having demonstrated that the 
payment increase was sustainably affordable for her.
But, in situations like this, I need to consider whether MML ought to have gathered that any 
further credit was unsustainable, or even harmful. And, where MML shouldve seen there 
was no reasonable prospect of Miss M repaying what she already owed, let alone any new 
borrowing, then its reasonable for me to conclude that lending was provided unfairly.
When considering all the lending as a whole, it can be seen that Miss B was increasing her 
monthly expenditure, at a time when the number of defaults and CCJs she had was also 
increasing. But her monthly income was also increasing over this period, and affordability 
wasnt in question. And, as Ive said, her particular circumstances were fully discussed with 
her before each loan was approved. As such, in this instance, Im satisfied that MML did take 
everything into consideration, and I dont think that, by approving the loans, MML acted 
unfairly or unreasonably in some other way.
However, notwithstanding this, MML have offered to write-off the outstanding balance on 
Loan 12 and pay Miss B an additional £750. And its for Miss B to decide whether to accept 
this offer or not.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I dont uphold Miss Bs complaint about Mobile Money 
Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 September 2023.
