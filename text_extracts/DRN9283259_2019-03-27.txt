K820x#14complaint
Mr U and his wife Mrs J complain that Inter Partner  Assistance S.A. (IPA) gave poor 
service under a home emergency insurance policy.
background
Mr U and Mrs J say they have small children living with them.  And they say they bought a 
new central heating  boiler  at the end of 2014 for about £1,000.00.  
Mr U and Mrs J had a joint bank account. They paid a monthly fee of about £15.00. The 
benefits included  home emergency  insurance subject to a limit of £250.00.  That cover 
included breakdown of their boiler.
Although the insurance was branded with the name  of the bank, IPA was the insurer  
responsible for dealing  with claims. Where  I refer to IPA or the insurer,  I include engineers  
and others  for whose  actions I hold IPA responsible. 
Mr U and Mrs J called  for help with their boiler  in August 2017 and again in November 2017. 
They complained that  on both occasions  IPAs  engineers tried to sell them unnecessary  
parts. They say IPA quoted about  £450.00  and asked them to pay the balance  of £200.00 
over the £250.00  policy  limit. Instead  they paid a plumber £100.00 on each occasion to 
adjust the boiler  pressure.  That fixed the boiler without  any new parts,  they say.
Our investigator didnt  recommend that the complaint should be upheld. The investigator 
didnt think IPA had misdiagnosed  the problems with the boiler or acted unfairly. 
Mr U and Mrs J disagreed  with the investigators opinion.  They asked for an ombudsman to 
review the complaint. They  say, in summary,  that their plumber fixed the boiler in 
November 2017  without replacing  any parts. Since then, the boiler  has been working 
perfectly and they havent called for help from IPA.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Ombudsman  Service deals with individual consumer complaints against 
insurers or other regulated financial firms. Where we find a firm has done  something wrong 
we try to put it right for the consumer by directing the firm to take certain steps. Such  steps 
are limited  to the individual case. We cannot direct a firm to take steps  to ensure that other  
consumers arent subject to the same wrongdoing.
Ive seen job sheet  dated 22 August 2017 that shows that IPAs engineer said the boiler 
needed a new diverter cartridge. Ive also seen a note as follows:
OL of £199.50
I think that note means that IPA had received a quotation that was almost £200.00 over the 
limit of £250.00. Thats in line with the figure of £450.00 Mr U and Mrs J say they were 
quoted.
Ref: DRN92832592I have no reason to doubt their statement that they engaged their own plumber who fixed  the 
boiler by re-pressurising  it  without replacing  any parts.
But it was only about eleven weeks later when  Mr U and Mrs Js boiler needed  further 
attention and they contacted IPA again.
Ive seen job sheet  dated 6 November  2017  that shows  that IPAs  engineer  said the boiler  
needed a new PCB (printed circuit board). I have no reason to doubt Mr U and Mrs Js 
statement that IPA again quoted about  £450.00.
I havent seen  any evidence that Mr U and Mrs J complained in November or December 
2017. From  later letters, I think Mr U and Mrs J sent a complaint letter  on 21 January 2018.  
I have no reason to doubt Mr U and Mrs Js statement that they followed up that letter and 
chased for a reply.  And as theyd contacted the bank, I dont doubt that their calls had to be 
transferred to IPA. But under the Financial Conduct  Authority rules, IPA had eight weeks to 
provide a final response. On 23 February 2018  IPA sent an acknowledgment. 
In a letter dated 26 February 2018, Mr U and Mrs J referred to a previous letter  and a 
telephone call in which the bank had asked for details of the costs of repairing the boiler. 
Mr U and Mrs Js letter included the following:
Repair charges on 1st time: £ 100.00
Repair charges  for the 2nd occasion: £ 100.00
Charges for carpenter to put back the boiler  Cabinet cover:  £50.00
Total Expenses: £250.00
In response to a letter of complaint dated  21 January 2018, IPA sent a final response  letter  
on 23 March 2018. That was a few days beyond  the eight-week deadline. But I cant  say that 
caused any significant delay for Mr U and Mrs J. They couldve brought  their complaint to us 
in late March 2018 but they didnt do so at that time.
In its final response,  IPA apologised  that Mr U and Mrs J had felt the need  to complain. But it 
didnt uphold  their complaint.  It said IPA would review the complaint if they sent information 
from their plumber. I think it was appropriate for IPA to indicate that it would review its 
conclusion in the light of any such evidence.
From its file, I see Mr U and Mrs J were  still chasing  IPA in late April 2018. It was late June 
2018 when Mr U and Mrs J brought  their complaint to us.
They didnt provide any written information  from their plumber until 16 November 2018 when 
they sent us two documents.  I note that the name of the plumber and other  details are 
handwritten on pages  from a printed  invoice  pad. The invoice numbers are consecutive  
(49 and 50) although they are dated  24 August 2017  and 8 November 2017. And it appears 
that the entries showing the amount of money charged may have been  covered over.
But Mr U and Mrs J have explained  that the documents  are not back-dated invoices but a 
written explanation about the nature of works carried out by their plumber. And I accept that 
Ref: DRN92832593the documents say that their plumber had adjusted the boiler  pressure and found no need 
for replacement parts.
But I dont think thats enough evidence to show  that IPA was responsible for an 
inappropriate diagnosis in August  or November 2017  let alone an unreasonable attempt to 
overcharge Mr U and Mrs J.  
Overall I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct IPA to pay Mr U and Mrs J any money or to 
do anything further  in response  to their complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Inter Partner Assistance S.A. to do anything further in response  to Mr U and Mrs Js 
complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr U and Mrs J to 
accept or reject my decision  before  27 April 2019.
