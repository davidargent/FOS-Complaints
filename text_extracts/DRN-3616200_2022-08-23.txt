The complaint
Mr A has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) acted irresponsibly by 
increasing his overdraft limit and acted unfairly by continuing to apply charges to his account 
when he was in financial difficulty. 
What happened
Mr A complained to NatWest. NatWest said based on the income declared by Mr A it had no 
concerns about the affordability of the overdraft and that all charges were applied correctly in 
line with the terms and conditions of the account.  
Mr As complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators. They thought that NatWest 
ought to have realised that Mr A was experiencing financial difficulty by June 2016 and so 
shouldnt have added any more interest, fees and charges from this point onwards. 
NatWest as a gesture of goodwill agreed to settle Mr As complaint by:
Refunding all interest and charges applied since June 2016.
It would reduce the overdraft facility by the amount of the refund leaving Mr A with an 
overdraft facility of Â£1,051.
It says that once the refund has been applied there will be a balance owing above the 
agreed overdraft facility and that Mr A would need to speak to its collections centre to 
discuss a suitable repayment plan for the excess on the account.
Going forward charges and interest will apply to the account in accordance with the 
terms and conditions.
Mr A did not wish to accept NatWests offer as NatWest said it would charge interest on the 
overdraft left and has asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at whether a bank treated a customer fairly and reasonably when applying 
overdraft charges. So I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, Im intending to find that NatWest acted 
unfairly when it continued charging overdraft interest and associated fees from June 2016. 
By this point, it ought to have been clear that Mr A was in no position to sustainably repay 
what he owed within a reasonable period of time. 
By this point, Mr A was hardcore borrowing. In other, words he hadnt seen or maintained a 
credit balance for an extended period of time. NatWests own literature suggests that 
overdrafts are for unforeseen emergency borrowing not prolonged day-to-day expenditure. 
So I think that Mr As overdraft usage should have prompted NatWest to have realised that 
Mr A wasnt using his overdraft as intended and shouldnt have continued offering it on the 
same terms. Mr As statements also show he was constantly at the top of his overdraft and 
was using payday loans to fund his overdraft. 
As NatWest didnt react to Mr As overdraft usage and instead continued charging in the 
same way, I think it failed to act fairly and reasonably.
Mr A ended up paying additional interest, fees and charges on his overdraft and this ended 
up exacerbating difficulties he already had in trying to clear it. So I think that NatWest didnt 
treat Mr A fairly and he lost out because of what NatWest did wrong. And this means that it 
should put things right.
Putting things right
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Mr As complaint for NatWest to put things right by:
Reworking Mr As current overdraft balance so that all interest, fees and charges 
applied to it from June 2016 are removed.
AND
If an outstanding balance remains on the overdraft once these adjustments have 
been made NatWest should contact Mr A to arrange a suitable repayment plan, 
Mr A is encouraged to get in contact with and cooperate with NatWest to reach a 
suitable agreement. If it considers it appropriate to record negative information on 
Mr As credit file, NatWest should reflect what would have been recorded had it 
started the process of taking corrective action on the overdraft in June 2016. 
NatWest can also reduce overdraft limit by the amount of refund if it considers it 
appropriate to do so, as long as doing so wouldnt leave Mr A over their limit.
OR
If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer 
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments 
and returned to Mr A along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from 
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement. If no 
outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, then 
NatWest should remove any adverse information from Mr As credit file. NatWest 
can also reduce Mr As overdraft limit by the amount of refund if it considers it 
appropriate to do so.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to take off tax from this interest. NatWest must 
give Mr A a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if they ask for one.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr As complaint. National Westminster Bank 
Plc should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 September 2022.
