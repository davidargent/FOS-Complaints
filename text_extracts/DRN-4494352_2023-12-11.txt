The complaint
Mr K has complained about a mortgage he held with The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc 
(RBS). Hes unhappy about the rate of interest he was charged.
What happened
This mortgage was taken out in August 2007. The mortgage offer dated 6 July 2007 
indicates Mr K was borrowing just under Â£80,000 (including fees) over a term of 25 years on 
a capital repayment basis. The product was a fixed rate of 5.95% until 30 June 2009, after 
which the mortgage would revert to RBSs standard variable rate (SVR) which was 7.69% 
at the time of the mortgage offer.
On 1 July 2009 the mortgage reverted to the SVR in line with the July 2007 mortgage offer, 
and it remained on the SVR until the property was sold in possession in 2017.
In June 2020 Mr K complained to RBS about the interest rate hed been charged. He said, in 
summary, the SVR wasnt clearly explained in the mortgage offer, he believed the interest 
rate would vary in line with Bank of England base rate (base rate) and he was treated 
unfairly as he was charged an unreasonably high interest rate.
One of my Ombudsman colleagues issued a decision about our jurisdiction in April 2022, in 
which she said:
Considering everything, for the reasons Ive explained, I decide that we can consider this 
complaint  but only in respect of interest charged from 29 June 2014 until The Royal Bank 
of Scotland Plc stopped charging interest in February 2017.
One of our Investigators then set out his thoughts on that part of the complaint. He said, in 
summary:
He didnt think the terms of Mr Ks mortgage contract said it would track base rate.
In 2009 the SVR decreased, but not by as much as base rate, meaning the difference 
between the rates went from 2.19 percentage points to 3.50 percentage points. But 
between March 2009 and February 2017 the SVR changed by the same amount as 
base rate.
During the financial crisis there was significant change in the wider market, and this 
impacted on RBSs funding costs.
The terms didnt say RBS was obliged to mirror base rate changes.
He was satisfied the SVR varied in line with the terms of the account.
Overall he didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr K didnt agree with our Investigators findings and so the case was passed to me to 
decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When considering what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this case, Im 
required by DISP 3.6.4R of the Financial Conduct Authoritys Handbook to take into account 
the relevant law, regulations, and good industry practice, when reaching my decision.
Ive given careful consideration to all the submissions made by both parties, but I wont 
address each and every point that has been raised. Ill focus on the matters that I consider 
most relevant to how Ive reached a fair outcome in keeping with the informal nature of our 
service.
Having done all that, I dont think this complaint should be upheld. I realise this will be 
disappointing for Mr K. But I hope the reasons I have set out below will help him to 
understand why I have come to this conclusion.
Since Mr K took out his mortgage, base rate and the SVR have operated as follows:
Effective date Base rate SVR Difference
01/07/2007 5.50% 7.69% 2.19%
05/07/2007 5.75%

04/08/2016 0.25%
01/10/2016 3.75% 3.5%
The mortgage terms and conditions set out the circumstances in which RBS can vary the 
SVR.
Condition 9.1 says:
9.1 The Interest Rate may be varied at any time by the Bank (whether before or after 
Release of Loan) except during a period in which the Offer of Loan states that the rate of 
interest is fixed, or tracks a base rate, or during a period when interest on a capped rate 
loan is being charged at the maximum rate of interest permitted as shown in the Offer of 
Loan, for one or more of the following reasons:-
(a) to reflect a change which has occurred, or which the Bank reasonably expects to occur, 
in bank base rates or interest rates generally;
(b) to reflect a change which has occurred, or which the Bank reasonably expects to occur, 
in the cost of funds the Bank uses for the Loan;
(c) to reflect a change which has occurred, or which the Bank reasonably expects to occur, 
in the interest rates charged by other lenders;
(d) to reflect a change in the law or decision by a court;
(e) to reflect a decision or recommendation by an ombudsman, regulator or similar body. 
The 2007 mortgage offer sets out that after the fixed rate expired in 2009, the mortgage 
would revert to the SVR, and the terms and conditions set out that the SVR could be varied 
in line with the terms of the mortgage. I havent seen any evidence that persuades me that 
RBS was obligated, contractually or otherwise, to have its SVR track the base rate. 
There was also no obligation on RBS to offer a new preferential rate when an old one 
expires  or at any other time  in the rules of mortgage regulation. And nothing in Mr Ks 
mortgage offer says that RBS would move him onto a new rate either. To that extent, the 
mortgage has operated as it should. If any existing customer  including Mr K - had wanted 
a new preferential interest rate they needed to contact RBS to request that.
Taking all that into account, I dont think it was unfair that Mr K was on RBSs SVR. 
That said, our service is required to consider what is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances. That includes, thinking more broadly about whether the way, and the extent 
to which, the terms have been used has resulted in unfair treatment for Mr K. I think that is 
the ultimate question I need to answer in deciding whether to uphold this case.
In answering this question, I have explained that although Im only able to consider the 
fairness of interest charged to Mr Ks mortgage between 29 June 2014 and 8 February 2017, 
its necessary for me to consider historic changes to RBSs SVR.
Ive considered all the available evidence and all of the changes RBS made to the SVR since Mr K took his mortgage. Having done so, I am not persuaded that anything RBS has 
done in varying the rate has led to Mr K being treated unfairly. I have set out why below.
For reasons of commercial confidentiality, I havent set out in detail the evidence RBS has 
provided in full. Nor has our service provided copies of it to Mr K.
Our rules allow me to accept information in confidence, so that only a description of it is 
disclosed, where I consider it appropriate to do so. In this case, I do consider it appropriate 
to accept the information and evidence RBS has provided in confidence, subject to the 
summary of it I have set out in this decision.
The 2007 mortgage offer makes clear the SVR is a variable rate. Theres no suggestion in 
either the offer or the terms and conditions that its directly linked to or tracks base rate.
When Mr K took out his fixed rate in 2007, the SVR was 7.94% (it had increased from the 
7.69% shown in the mortgage offer). Whilst he was on his fixed rate, RBS had reduced its 
SVR so that by the time he began to pay the SVR it was 4.00%. The SVR then decreased to 
3.75% in October 2016 and then didnt change again before RBS stopped charging interest 
when the property was sold in possession with a shortfall.
As I say, theres nothing that links the SVR to base rate, or says that the SVR must be 
changed when base rate changes. Nor is there anything in the terms and conditions that 
obliges RBS to change the SVR at any time  the terms allow RBS to make changes in 
certain limited circumstances, but dont require it to do so. 
Between August 2007 (when Mr K took out his mortgage) and February 2017 when RBS 
stopped charging interest on the debt, RBSs SVR had mirrored all changes to base rate bar 
two. And while the SVR still reduced during this time, it didnt reduce by the same proportion 
as the reduction in the base rate. Therefore, the difference between base rate and the SVR 
increased from 2.19% to 3.5%. 
Despite this increase in margin, the SVR Mr K was paying when his mortgage reverted in 
2009 was still lower than what it was when he agreed to the mortgage in 2007 and it was in 
line, if not lower, than the market average for the time. 
Ive already set out that this wasnt a tracker mortgage, so RBS was not contractually 
obligated to track base rate. Nor is it the case that Mr Ks mortgage had a cap preventing 
RBSs SVR from increasing beyond a certain margin above base rate. So, there was 
nothing in the contract that expressly prohibited RBS from setting the SVR at a level 
whereby the margin between the SVR and base rate would change. But that doesnt mean 
that RBS could set the SVR at whatever level it chose. The term enabling RBS to vary the 
SVR itself has to be fair (to prevent businesses taking advantage of customers), and RBS 
had to ensure that in varying the SVR it only did so for one of the reasons set out in the 
contract.
To evidence its decisions at the time and reliance on the above terms, RBS has told us that 
despite a reduction in base rate, its total group funding costs increased considerably over 
the years 2008-2009. As such, it has said it was not able to pass on the full reductions in 
base rate to its SVR customers. 
At this time, the mortgage market was going through a period of significant change as a 
result of the global financial crisis. This impacted the funding costs of businesses, including 
RBS, and was reflected in changes to a number of lenders interest rates charged across the 
market at the time. This was clear at the time and has been the subject of analysis by both 
the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority since. Whilst base rate did reduce significantly during this period, the cost to lenders of funding their businesses changed, as 
did their prudential requirements. These were made up of several factors that are not directly 
linked to base rate. With this in mind, and in conjunction with the information RBS has been 
able to provide, I am satisfied it had legitimate reasons to vary its SVR in the way that it did. 
Whilst the evidence provided is limited due to the passage of time, I have not seen any 
evidence to suggest the changes RBS made were arbitrary, excessive, or unfair. Rather, the 
evidence Ive seen satisfies me that RBS acted in line with its terms and conditions to protect 
its legitimate interests while balancing its obligation to treat Mr K fairly. And Im further 
satisfied that, albeit limited, the information RBS has been able to provide for this period is 
corroborated by evidence of wider market conditions at the time.
Overall, Im satisfied that RBS has shown that it was entitled to rely on the terms and 
conditions to make the changes to the SVR it did make, and that there was no obligation on 
it to make changes to the SVR at other times. Taking that into account, I dont think theres 
evidence either that RBS relied on changes it was not entitled to make in setting the SVR 
charged at the start of the period I can consider, or that it acted unfairly in making further 
changes to the SVR during that period. 
That being the case, I dont think there is any basis to say Mr K was charged an unfairly high 
rate of interest on his mortgage during the period I can consider, and Ive seen no evidence 
to say that the interest he was charged during that period was unfair for any other reason.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 January 2024.
