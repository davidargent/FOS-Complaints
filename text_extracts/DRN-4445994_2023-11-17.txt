The complaint
Mr R is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) wrote to him saying it would 
close his account if he didnt stop using it for business transactions.
What happened
In January, NatWest wrote to Mr R asking that he stops using his personal account for 
business related activity. The bank advised him to either move his transactions to an existing 
business account or, if he doesnt have one, then to open a new business account. NatWest 
provided Mr R with a deadline and explained that it would close his account should he 
continue using it for business activities. 
After Mr R made a complaint, NatWest said that it had acted fairly and in line with its terms. 
Mr R asked this service for an independent review as he remained unhappy. Our 
investigator decided NatWest had acted fairly. 
Remaining unhappy, Mr R asked for a final decision  so the complaint has been passed to 
me to decide.
Mr R recently raised a concern about NatWest rejecting his application for a business 
account. This issue is being considered by this service under a separate complaint, so I 
wont be commenting on that complaint in my decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I share the opinion that NatWest has acted fairly  Ill explain why.
The banks terms set out that Mr Rs account must not be used for business purposes. The 
terms also explain that NatWest can close Mr Rs account if it is used for business purposes. 
NatWest says that it discovered Mr Rs account was being used for business transactions, 
so it wrote to him to ask that he stops doing so. I think it was reasonable of the bank to have 
done this, given Mr Rs account was being used in a way that breached the terms he agreed 
to. 
NatWests letter provided Mr R with several months to move his business transactions 
elsewhere and explained the bank would close his account if he failed to do so by the 
deadline. It also allowed Mr R to continue using his account as usual in the meantime. I dont 
find this to be unfair. Its up to NatWest to decide the parameters of how its customers can 
operate their accounts. And such parameters seem to be clear in its terms and conditions. 
NatWest noticed Mr R was operating his account in breach of its terms. In such 
circumstances, Id expect the bank to contact Mr R, explain the issue and give him a 
reasonable opportunity to resolve the matter  which is what the bank did. So I dont agree 
that the bank did something wrong.
I can see that by August, this matter was resolved and NatWest wrote to Mr R to explain no 
further action would be taken. So his account remained open, despite NatWests original 
intimation that it would be closed if Mr R continued making business transactions via his 
personal account after the deadline. Im satisfied things were resolved before the deadline 
and Mr R didnt suffer any detriment because of the potential account closure.
Mr R says his account was opened as a business account in 1989, so NatWests stance is 
incorrect. Mr R also challenges the fact that the bank didnt offer him an alternative option. 
However, I dont agree that NatWest shouldve offered Mr R any alternative options as I think 
thats a decision for Mr R alone. I can see NatWests letter sets out what Mr R could do  
including moving his business activity to an existing business bank account or opening a 
business bank account with NatWest or another bank. I think these were appropriate options 
to set out to Mr R and I think it was reasonable to place the onus on Mr R to decide what he 
wanted to do next. 
Moreover, NatWest has sent records that show Mr Rs account was opened in 1992 as a 
current account. So NatWest acted fairly when it pointed out to Mr R that he couldnt use this 
account for business transactions. 
In summary, I think NatWest has applied its terms fairly here, so I wont be asking it to take 
any further action regarding this complaint.  
My final decision
Im not upholding this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2023.
