The complaint
Mrs C complains that MYJAR Limited lent to her in an irresponsible manner.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in February 2020 that I summarise below.
Mrs C was given eight loans by MYJAR between September 2015 and May 2016. The 
loans were due to be repaid over periods ranging from one to six months as shown below. 
Mrs C successfully repaid her first seven loans but a balance remained outstanding on the 
last loan when she made her complaint. A summary of Mrs C's borrowing from MYJAR is as 
follows;

4 31/12/2015 29/01/2016 £  350 6
5 23/01/2016 29/02/2016 £  375 3
6 29/02/2016 31/03/2016 £  275 3
7 31/03/2016 28/04/2016 £  100 1
8 01/05/2016 - £  450 6
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, and in particular that the checks 
MYJAR needed to do would need to take into account things such as how much was being 
lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages of a lending relationship, I thought less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
I thought that the checks MYJAR did before agreeing the first two loans were proportionate. 
So I didn't think it had been wrong for MYJAR to agree to give these loans to Mrs C.
I thought that MYJAR should have done more checks before agreeing loans 3 to 5. But 
Mrs C hadn't given us enough information for me to determine what better checks would 
have shown to the lender. So I wasn't able to say that MYJAR had been wrong to agree 
these loans.
But I thought that, by the time of loan 6, MYJAR should have realised that the overall pattern 
of Mrs C's borrowing should have suggested that any further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it shouldn't provide further 
loans. I asked MYJAR to pay Mrs C some compensation in relation to the last three loans.Mrs C hasn't responded to my provisional decision. MYJAR has said that it accepts my 
provisional decision and has offered to pay Mrs C the compensation I proposed.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Given that Mrs C hasn't provided me 
with any new evidence or further comments, and that MYJAR has accepted my provisional 
findings, I see no reason to alter the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.
So I don't think MYJAR should have agreed to give loans 6, 7 or 8 to Mrs C. MYJAR needs 
to pay her some compensation.
Putting things right
I dont think MYJAR should have agreed to lend to Mrs C after, and including, the loan that
she took on 29 February 2016 (loan 6). So MYJAR should;
refund all the interest and charges Mrs C paid on loans 6 and 7
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loan 8 and treat any payments 
Mrs C made towards this loan as payments towards the capital
if reworking Mrs Cs loan 8 account as Ive directed results in Mrs C effectively having 
made payments above the original capital borrowed, then MYJAR should refund 
these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from 
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement.
If reworking Mrs Cs loan 8 account leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, then 
MYJAR can use the total refund for loans 6 and 7 (after the deduction of tax) to offset 
this. And if there is still an outstanding capital balance then I remind MYJAR that it 
should take a sympathetic view when seeking to agree an affordable repayment plan 
with Mrs C.
remove all information about loans 6 and 7 from Mrs Cs credit file, and about loan 8 
when it is fully repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must
give Mrs C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mrs Cs complaint and direct MYJAR Limited to put 
things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 May 2020.
