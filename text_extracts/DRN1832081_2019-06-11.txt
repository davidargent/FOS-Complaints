K820x#14complaint
Mr M has complained that NewDay Ltd acted irresponsibly when  it allowed him to take out a 
credit card.
background
Mr M took out a credit card with NewDay in August  2017. He says it shouldnt  have given  
him a credit card because  of his poor credit history  and he complained because he was 
struggling to make the payments  on the card.
NewDay didnt uphold  Mr Ms complaint. It said its credit card is aimed  at customers  who 
have a poor credit history and has been  designed to help them improve their credit rating. It 
says Mr M met its acceptance criteria  and he was given  a card with a credit limit of Â£450 
which it thought  was appropriate  to his circumstances.
Mr M wasnt happy with NewDays response  to his complaint and referred it to this service.
our initial conclusions
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend the complaint should be upheld.  He didnt think  there  was 
any evidence NewDay had acted  irresponsibly  and it had dealt fairly with his complaint.
Mr M didnt  accept our adjudicators recommendation.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think NewDay makes  it clear to potential customers that its product is designed to help 
people who have poor credit histories  improve their credit score.  Its reasonably entitled to 
set its own criteria regarding who it is willing to offer credit cards to and how much credit  it 
will offer. Im satisfied that Mr M should  have known  when he applied for the card, that it 
could be given to him notwithstanding his credit history.
Mr Ms credit file shows he has had problems and a number  of defaults are recorded against 
him. But the defaults were recorded  some  time before he applied  for the credit card. Im 
satisfied that Mr Ms application was approved  in line with NewDays lending criteria. I think  
the decision to proceed was reasonable based on what Mr M said in his application as well 
as what NewDay found out when it completed  a credit search. Im not persuaded that on the 
basis of the information NewDay had at the time of the application  it was irresponsible for it 
to have given  Mr M the credit card.
