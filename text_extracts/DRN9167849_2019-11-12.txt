K820x#14complaint
Ms S is unhappy National Westminster Bank  Plc (NatWest) have been unable  to locate her 
deposit account.
background
Ms S says she opened  a deposit  account  in the 1970s and that its been dormant since.  
When she contacted  NatWest to locate this account, they said they were unable  to trace the 
account. Ms S found a deposit slip from 1977  as proof of the account and gave this to 
NatWest to help them  find the account.
NatWest say they have  done a search  of their systems and are unable to find any trace  of 
Ms S account. They say its possible the funds were  withdrawn and the account was closed. 
Our adjudicator looked into this complaint. She concluded  that NatWest  had done  enough to 
search for Ms S account  and that she wouldnt be asking them  to do anything  more. 
Ms S didnt agree. She believed that the money she held in her account  must be somewhere 
and that the bank should still be able to trace this. She asked for an ombudsman  to consider 
her complaint so its been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see Ms S feels strongly about  this and I understand that she wants to know  why 
NatWest cant find her account. But I dont think NatWest need  to do anything  more in trying 
to find the account  which I know will disappoint Ms S, so Ill explain why.
Ms S has provided evidence showing that the account existed. She has sent us a copy  of a 
paying in slip which includes the sort code and account number. The book also shows  a 
deposit slip which is stamped by the bank dated  November 1977 showing that Â£2,500 was 
paid into the account. 
NatWest have sent us a screenshot of the searches they carried out on their systems in 
order to locate Ms S deposit account.  The searches show that NatWest  have  tried to locate 
her account  using several different  details  such as the details on the paying in slip from 
1977, Ms S personal details such as her name,  date of birth and the address  Ms S was at 
when she opened  the account. Despite using this information, they were  still unable to locate 
her account  on their system. 
NatWest explained  that they hold customer information for six years  after their relationship  
with a customer ends.  For accounts  which become dormant, where there  is a balance on the 
account, they confirmed a permanent record is held. 
NatWest have sent me information to show me that theyve carried  out a search  of their 
dormancy register using  Ms S details  to check if this account  became dormant. But the 
results showed no trace  of this account  on the dormancy register.  So based on this, I think 
its unlikely Ms S account has an outstanding  balance and is dormant.
Ref: DRN91678492NatWest also say any records  of account closures  going back more  than six years would 
have been destroyed. Thats not unusual or unreasonable. 
As NatWest have been unable to identify any details regarding the account or an 
outstanding balance, I think on balance its more likely the account  had been  closed and the 
outstanding balance paid out. I appreciate  Ms S says thats not the case but given  the 
passage of time, Ms S may not recall  this. And Ive no doubt that this claim has been made 
in the genuine belief  that she still has an account  with NatWest, but I dont have enough  
evidence to make that finding.
I appreciate this isnt the outcome Ms S was hoping for but I cannot fairly ask NatWest to do 
anything more.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 December  2019.
