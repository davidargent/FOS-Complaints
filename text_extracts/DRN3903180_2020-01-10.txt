The loans were  all due to be repaid  in 1 instalment and were  all repaid either on time or 
early, apart from the last loan which Mr R hasnt paid.  
Peachy it said that it recognised that by loan 4, Mr R had already taken 3 loans in a relatively  
short period  of time and was starting to develop a lending history. Peachy agreed  that it 
couldve done more  to establish  the reasons behind his continued borrowing.
Peachy made an offer to partially uphold the complaint about loans 4  19 and it offered  
settlement proposals.  
Mr R said that Peachy shouldnt have given him any of these unaffordable loans which 
werent appropriate for him and added  to his money  problems  overall . 
Ref: DRN39031802Our adjudicators overall view was that there wasnt enough information to say it was unfair 
for Peachy to have provided  loans 1, 2 and 3 to Mr R - but loans 4 to 19 shouldnt  have been 
lent. Thats because  our adjudicator felt that by loan 4, Mr R had shown signs  that he was 
struggling to repay previous loans  and by loan 7, his overall  pattern of borrowing 
suggested they hed become persistently reliant  on short-term loans. 
Peachy said it wasnt disputing what the adjudicator said about loan 7 onwards  - but it said it 
would appreciate some additional information to explain the decision taken in relation to 
loans 4 - 6. 
There was a further exchange of correspondence  between the adjudicator  and Peachy. But 
as the complaint hasnt been  resolved, it now comes to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Peachy needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Peachy should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Peachy was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN39031803Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Looking at loans  1 - 3, like our adjudicator,  I think that the amounts that Mr R needed  to 
repay wouldve seemed  relatively affordable compared with the take home pay hed 
declared. Given these repayment amounts, what was apparent  about  Mr Rs circumstances 
and his borrowing  history  at that time with Peachy, I dont think  it wouldve been 
proportionate for Peachy to ask Mr R for the amount  of information that would be needed  to 
show the lending  was unsustainable  before agreeing the first three  loans. So Im not 
upholding Mr Rs complaint about loans 1 - 3.
But, given the particular circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that Peachy should reasonably 
have realised that loan 4 wasnt  likely to be sustainably affordable  for Mr R and it shouldnt 
have provided  this loan. 
I say this because:
when Mr R took out loan 4, this was the third time in a row that hed borrowed again 
more or less immediately when hed repaid a previous loan
there was no reduction in the amount he was borrowing  loans 3 and 4 were bigger 
than loans 1 and 2
I think Peachy ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr R was having  to 
borrow further to cover a shortfall in his finances each time he paid the previous loan 
in other  words, he had to keep on borrowing in order to pay for borrowing hed taken  
out previously,  and Mr Rs indebtedness  was generally increasing  unsustainably.
Ive taken into account that before  approving Mr Rs loan applications Peachy said it 
conducted a full account review each time. But I think that Peachy was right to acknowledge 
in its final response letter  that there were clear signs that Mr R was becoming reliant on short 
term high cost loans  by the time he took loan 4. I think  by then, Peachy ought to have 
realised that this loan,  and any further lending, wasnt likely to be sustainably affordable for 
him. 
And I think thats borne out by what followed. Loan 5 was taken out the same  day that Mr R 
paid loan 4. It was bigger again than the loan hed just paid, indicating a clear  upward 
borrowing trend.
Ref: DRN39031804And loan 6 was then taken out the same day that Mr R paid loan 5 - and for more money 
again. By now, Mr R was borrowing half as much  again as hed taken on loan 1, the previous 
month. 
So I dont  think that Peachy  shouldve provided  loans 4 - 6 to Mr R.
I also agree  with our adjudicator that by loan 7, Mr Rs overall pattern of borrowing indicated  
that this loan, and all the loans that followed after, were unsustainable.  So they shouldnt 
have been given either. And Peachy has agreed   so I dont think  I need  to say any more 
about this.  
In coming to this view,  I appreciate that (save for loan 19) Mr R repaid his loans on time or 
often earlier  than the agreed  end dates. But this doesnt mean he managed to do so in a 
sustainable way. Borrowing and repaying this number of loans early suggests to me that 
Mr Rs finances were  unstable and volatile  particularly when its also clear that he 
borrowed again very quickly (often the same day). So this doesnt  affect  my overall view. 
This means  that Im upholding the complaint about  loan 4 and all the loans that followed. 
putting things right  what Peachy needs to do
Peachy should  buy back  the debt it sold to a third party so it can carry out these directions  
or otherwise tell the third party that it needs  to carry out these steps to put things right.
refund  all interest, fees and charges Mr R paid on loans 4 - 18. 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any outstanding interest, fees and charges* from loan 19 and treat any 
repayments made by Mr R for loan 19 (if any have now been  made) as payments  
towards the capital.  (*This would include any fees or costs charged and added  on to 
the loan account by the third party)  
when Peachy  works out what it owes Mr R, it can first apply this towards offsetting 
any outstanding  capital balance Mr R owes on loan 19 

if reworking Mr Rs loan 19 account as Ive directed results in Mr R effectively having  
made payments  above the original  capital borrowed, then Peachy should refund 
these overpayments  with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments,  from 
the date the overpayments would  have arisen,  to the date of settlement. 
in the event that there is still an outstanding capital balance then I remind  Peachy  
that it should take a sympathetic view when  seeking to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Mr R
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Rs credit file in relation to loan 4, 
loan 5 and loan 6
remove all information about loans 7 to 19 from Mr Rs credit file
Ref: DRN39031805 HM Revenue & Customs requires Peachy to take off tax from this interest. Peachy must 
give Mr R a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Cash  On Go Limited 
(trading as Peachy)  should take the steps  Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 February  2020.
