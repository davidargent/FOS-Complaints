K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains about the short  term loans he took out with Casheuronet UK LLC trading as 
QuickQuid. Mr S says that QuickQuid  lent irresponsibly. He says his financial situation  was 
poor and that he was frequently  borrowing from other payday  lenders as well as QuickQuid. 
He says that QuickQuid  shouldve  made better checks. If it had, it wouldve noticed this and 
not lent to him. 
background
Mr S agreed with our adjudication  so I wont look any further  into loans 1 to 5 or loans 12 or 
12a as it seems these are no longer in dispute. My decision will focus  on loans 6 to 11 and 
loans 12b and 12c (additional capital  taken out on loan 12).
Mr S took out 12 payday loans between May 2015 and April 2018. Some of the loans were 
due to be repaid  over more than one month and around half were increased. Some  of the 
information QuickQuid  has given us is shown in the table at the end of this decision
QuickQuid has looked at Mr S complaint and said that it shouldnt be upheld. It said that it 
did appropriate checks for all of the loans. And these checks  showed  that the lending was 
affordable based  on Mr S declared  monthly income.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr S complaint  and recommended that QuickQuid refund 
the interest and charges that he paid on loans 6 to 11 and 12b and 12c. QuickQuid  didnt 
agree with this recommendation and so the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Having done so, Ive decided to partially  uphold Mr S complaint. Having reviewed  the 
evidence I have available I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  given Mr S loans 6 to 11 and 
12b and 12c. Ill explain why.
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Mr S and QuickQuid said. He thought  Mr S 
complaint should  be partially upheld. He thought that it had made  proportionate checks  for 
loans 12 and 12a, after a break  in the lending. So he thought that QuickQuids decisions to 
approve these loans were  reasonable. 
He didnt think that QuickQuid had made proportionate checks  for loans 1 to 11 and 12b and 
12c. He thought if it had then it wouldnt have agreed to lend Mr S money  for loans  6 to 11 
and 12b and 12c. This is because he didnt think that Mr S could afford the repayments. And 
QuickQuid wouldve seen  this had it completed  better checks.  
But he thought  proportionate checks wouldve shown that Mr S could sustainably afford the 
repayments to loans 1 to 5. 
Ref: DRN83631972QuickQuid didnt comment  on our adjudicators  findings about the proportionality of its 
checks or the affordability of the loans,  nor did it provide any new information for me to 
consider. It responded to our adjudication saying:
In response to FOS assessment which recommends Casheuronet uphold loans which  were  
funded after March 2015, we regret to inform you that we cannot agree to FOS 
recommendations. Please note that in Casheuronets initial response to FOS we provided  
detailed information  indicating why the loans were responsibly lent to Mr S. I have now 
attached the entire lending process including all the checks that we perform prior to lending, 
the screenshots of customer applications as well as the sample acknowledgement from the 
contract that customers have to check when their repayment amount is greater than their 
estimated disposable income. 
As QuickQuid says it first mentioned this argument  in its business submissions to us in 
which it said:
 We started implementing changes to affordability assessment in June  2014  and all the 
changes were completed by 28 Feb 2015.  Starting 1 March 2015,  QuickQuid  had 
implemented an affordability review that is consistent with the FCA Handbook  and that was 
in place at the time we received authorisation by the FCA. We confirm that this assessment 
was conducted  properly and individually for each of the 12 loans 
It provided further detail  about the checks it had made when it approved  loans from 2015  
onwards in a document called CEU  Lending Criteria  and Proportional Checks.  This 
document also didnt  have  any further detail about Mr S individual  circumstances and it 
didnt change our adjudicators opinion about the complaint. 
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument  directly and through 
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to expand on this point any further here, though  I 
have considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. 
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman  are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent 
who handled  the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  
complaints received by the respondent and using this in training and development of 
the individuals dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA, other relevant regulators and the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  and communicating it to the individuals dealing  with 
complaints in the respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr S complaint  and what  both parties  have said 
about this.
Ref: DRN83631973The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr S borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in mind  
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect Pounds  to Pocket to be conversant with these through  previous ombudsman  
decisions, particularly  recent decisions, which set these out in detail.) 
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher  the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
Turning to the specifics of Mr S complaint,
Mr S didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion about loans 1 to 5, 12 and 12a. Because 
of this I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. And so, as Ive 
said, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But they were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr S had with QuickQuid. So they are something I will take into account  when 
considering the other loans he took.
QuickQuid says: 
it recorded Mr S monthly income  as being between  around £1,100  and £1,300 
except for loans 8 and 9 when it was recorded as being  £800  
it recorded his monthly expenditure as being around £300 up to loan 9 and then 
around £400 thereafter
it validated the information it obtained using credit reference  agency reports
it says it used the information  it had gained from the credit  reference agency reports 
to adjust the amounts Mr S provided to calculate  what it called his estimated 
disposable income (EDI)  
And based on the above checks it thought it was reasonable to lend.
why I dont  think QuickQuids checks were  proportionate for loans 6 to 11, 12b and 
12c
Ive carefully thought  about what QuickQuid and Mr S have provided and what  both sides  
have said. 
By the time QuickQuid approved loan 6, Mr S had been taking loans from QuickQuid  for over 
six months. And going forward Mr S borrowed increasingly larger amounts (by increasing his 
loans) and started  to take loans with longer  repayment periods. This suggests  to me that he 
was finding the repayments  difficult,  and he was becoming dependent  on this type of 
lending. 
So I think QuickQuid couldve realised at that time that Mr S may have some longer term 
financial problems and he wasnt just using the loans to help with a temporary  cash  flow 
problem. QuickQuid shouldve also become  concerned  about  whether it knew  enough about 
Mr S true financial situation.
Ref: DRN83631974So I think that it wouldve  been proportionate  to make a full review of Mr S finances to get an 
accurate picture  of his income and expenditure before approving loans 6 to 11. 
And whilst there was a gap of a year between loans 11 and 12, which  I find significant, by 
loan 12b Mr S was again showing  signs of financial problems. He was rapidly borrowing 
increasing amounts  again over a short period of time.  So for loans 12b and 12c I think that it 
wouldve been proportionate to find out about  Mr S normal  monthly  living costs and regular 
financial commitments  including any existing  short-term  lending to check that he wasnt 
relying on these loans to meet an ongoing need.  
I dont think QuickQuid did this. Although  I havent seen the full details of all QuickQuids 
credit checks, it has provided me with its estimate of Mr S disposable income (EDI). This is 
lower than deducting Mr S declared expenditure from his declared  income  for these  loans. 
But I dont know exactly how QuickQuid calculated Mr S EDI  it has said that credit  checks 
are one relevant  factor.
Because I dont know how QuickQuid actually worked out the EDI, I cant say this reflects a 
proportionate check as Ive outlined above. I cant be certain that it fully reviewed his 
finances to get sufficient  information about all of Mr S credit commitments  (including other 
short term lending), living costs and expenditure for the earlier loans. And I cant  say that it 
found out about his income  and expenditure, including his long and short  term financial 
commitments for the later loans. 
So I need to think  about what its likely proportionate checks wouldve shown QuickQuid if it 
had carried these out.
what I think proportionate checks would most  likely have  shown for loans  6 to 11 and 
12b and 12c. 
Mr S has provided some  information about  his financial circumstances which  includes his 
bank statements and a recent credit  report. I accept that this isnt exactly  what  QuickQuid 
wouldve seen at the time. But I think  it wouldve  found out similar information if it had made 
proportionate checks, so I think  its reasonable to rely on it.
Mr S financial situation could be complex over the time QuickQuid approved these loans. 
Our adjudicator provided full details about  why Mr S couldnt sustainably afford the 
repayments for these  loans. No party to the complaint has commented on this or said the 
amounts provided  were  incorrect. So I wont repeat  this detail here but I will outline what I 
think are the main reasons why I think Mr S complaint should be upheld
At the time Mr S took loan 6, and through  the start of loan 7, he wasnt employed. So even  
though the repayment  for loan 6 was low at first he wouldnt  have been able to afford  the 
repayments in a sustainable way as he didnt have any income and Ive seen no evidence of 
him having savings.   
I understand Mr S started work again shortly  after he took loan 7. But he increased  the 
amount he borrowed  for this loan over short period of time and he needed to repay over 
£500 in the near future. And I think he wouldnt  realistically be able to afford the repayments 
to this loan given his employment situation  at the start of it. 
Ref: DRN83631975Going forward the income  and expenditure details QuickQuid  recorded for Mr S werent  too 
far away from what his banks statements show. There was some variation, but this wasnt  
more than a few hundred pounds either way. But Mr S bank statements show  he was now in 
financiall difficulty. It looks like this was because his income had been reduced earlier.  
Mr S was now using other short term lenders. The amounts he was borrowing and repaying  
each month  could be significant,  that is up to £800. Mr S recorded disposable income was 
around £600 for these later loans. So I think its reasonable to say that Mr S expenditure 
was already well above  his stated  income for loans 8 to 11 and 12b and 12c, without  taking 
into account any normal living costs.  
And whilst Im not certain  what QuickQuids EDI figure is comprised of it could be very low. 
In particular for loan 10 it is just under  £100  for two pay periods. The loan repayments for 
this loan of £50 were  around £75. So even using QuickQuids own figures  Mr S would have 
almost nothing left after repaying this loan. So I think QuickQuid shouldve been  aware  that 
Mr S was having problems at this time.  
I think that QuickQuid wouldve found  out this information if it had made  proportionate  
checks. And I think QuickQuid wouldve seen Mr S wouldnt have been  able repay  the loans 
in a sustainable way. So I think that QuickQuid shouldnt have given loan 6 to 11 and 12b 
and 12c to Mr S and I think hes lost out as a result  of this. So Im upholding Mr S complaint  
about these loans. 
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
To put things right for Mr S, QuickQuid should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loans 6 to 11 and 12b and 12c; 
and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr S credit  file about  these loans;
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr S complaint. 
Casheuronet UK LLC should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2019.
