The complaint
Mr K complains that Barclays Bank (UK) PLC won't refund to him the money that he paid to  
a builder.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr K made three bank transfers for a total of £3,425 to a builder for some building 
works;
he ended his contract with the builder because, amongst other things, he wasn't 
happy with the work and he paid another builder to rectify some issues and complete 
the work;
he took court action against the builder and a payment plan was agreed under which 
the builder agreed to make 10 payments of £500 to Mr K - but he says that the 
builder hasn't made the agreed payments;
he claimed a refund of the money that he'd paid to the builder from Barclays Bank 
and says that he made the payments using his bank card and that the builder has 
been fraudulent;
the evidence that I've seen shows that Mr K made bank transfers to the builder (and 
not card payments) so the protections that might have been available to him if he'd 
made card payments to the builder don't apply in these circumstances;
Barclays Bank made the payments that had been requested by Mr K and I'm not 
persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that it acted incorrectly in 
connection with those payments;
nor am I persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that those payments were 
made fraudulently;
I sympathise with Mr K for the issues that he's had with the builder - but I don't 
consider that Barclays Bank should refund to him any of the money that he paid to 
the builder; and
I find that it wouldn't be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Bank to refund any money to Mr K - or to take any other action in response 
to his complaint.
 
 
My final decisionFor these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 June 2020.
