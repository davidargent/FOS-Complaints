The complaint
Miss M complains that NewDay Ltd unfairly defaulted her account after agreeing to put it on 
hold.
What happened
Miss M was provided with a credit card by NewDay which she explained was being used and 
paid for by a family member. Sadly, the family member passed away suddenly in December 
2018 causing her a great deal of distress. Miss M received a letter in January 2019 about a 
missed payment and contacted NewDay. She explained she couldnt make the payment 
noting she was studying and not in employment and was also suffering with poor mental 
health. She says NewDay said it would look to put her account on hold for six months.
Miss M then received a default notice dated 26 February 2019. She contacted NewDay in 
March 2019 and says she was told to ignore this. The six-month hold was applied to her 
account, and she received a letter confirming this. However, Miss M then received a letter 
saying her account would be terminated and that the full balance needed to be repaid. She 
contacted NewDay and was told her account hadnt been put on hold. Miss M then offered to 
pay £20 a month but her account was defaulted and sold to a third party.
NewDay issued a final response letter dated 23 May 2023 saying that Miss M hadnt 
maintained her payments and the default had been applied in line with the account terms 
and conditions. It said that Miss M had been sent statements that detailed the arrears on her 
account and that when an account falls more than 60 days into arrears it is required to act to 
prevent its customers falling further into debt. It said Miss M was sent a letter dated 14 
March 2019 saying it had terminated her agreement and a further letter dated 12 June 2019 
notifying her that a default would be applied to her credit file.
Our investigator didnt think that NewDay had provided the service it should have. He noted 
that Miss M was proactive in contacting NewDay and that NewDay agreed to put her 
account on hold but then terminated her agreement and registered a default. He thought 
NewDay should have been clearer when communicating with Miss M about its intended 
actions. Because of this he thought Miss M should be paid compensation and noting the 
distress this issue caused at an already very difficult time for her he recommended a 
payment of £300. 
Regarding the registering of a default, our investigator noted Miss Ms financial situation at 
the time and said that based on the information received she couldnt significantly reduce or 
repay the debt. Therefore he didnt think that NewDay was wrong to apply the default to her 
account.
Miss M didnt agree with our investigators view. She didnt think that NewDay had treated 
her fairly by applying the default. She provided further evidence showing receipts of money 
into her account which she said she was saving to pay off the NewDay account once the six-
month hold had been lifted.
NewDay responded to our investigators view saying that the six-month arrangement was set 
up on 15 March 2019 but as no payments were being made under the plan arrears 
continued to build. It said that the letter sent about the plan said that Miss Ms credit file 
would be affected. It noted Miss Ms comment that she was told on the call that it wasnt 
intending to register a default but said the call was no longer available. It said that Miss M 
couldnt repay the amount owing on the account and so the correct process was followed in 
terms of the default being applied and the account sold. It sympathised with Miss Ms 
situation and said it would agree to pay £100 compensation but didnt agree to pay £300.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am sorry to hear of the distressing circumstances that Miss M has experienced and I do not 
underestimate the additional upset she was caused at the time by the issues with her 
NewDay account. But for me to uphold this complaint I would need to be satisfied that 
NewDay had done something wrong or treated Miss M unfairly.
Miss M received a letter in January 2019 about a missed payment on her credit card. This 
was shortly after the sudden death of a family member and Miss M has explained that it was 
that family member who used and paid for the card. Therefore, I can understand how 
distressing it would have been for her to realise there was an amount outstanding on the 
card. However, as the credit card was in Miss Ms name NewDay was correct to inform her 
about the outstanding balance and missed payment.
Following receipt of the letter Miss M contacted NewDay to explain her situation including 
that she couldnt make the payment due to being at university and not employed. The call 
notes show that the late fee was removed as a gesture of goodwill and an income and 
expenditure form was sent out. At the time while Miss M said she thought a hold had been 
applied to her account it doesnt appear that this happened. 
Miss M was sent a default notice dated 26 February 2019 and she contacted NewDay on 15 
March 2019. The call notes from this time show that following the income and expenditure 
assessment Miss M had no disposable income. A six-month hold was placed on her 
account. I find this a reasonable response to Miss Ms situation. 
Miss M has said she was told that a default wouldnt be applied during the hold period. 
Unfortunately, a recording of the call is no longer available so I cannot say what was said. 
But I accept that Miss M thought following this call that her account wouldnt be defaulted, 
and she didnt need to take any further action. However, Miss M then received letters saying 
that her account had been terminated and the full balance was due, and a default would be 
recorded.
Having looked through the evidence provided including the call notes and Miss Ms 
testimony I accept that Miss M left the calls in January and March 2019 thinking that no 
further action would be taken on her account for six months. NewDay has said the letter sent 
in March 219 noted that Miss Ms credit file would be affected but this letter says that 
NewDay will let the credit reference agencies know she is on a payment plan, not that further 
action could be taken regarding registering a default. 
Given the above, I dont think that NewDay provided the service it should have. Miss M was 
experiencing a very stressful situation and she explained this to NewDay. NewDay placed 
her account on hold which I find reasonable, but it doesnt appear to have informed Miss M 
that the arrears would continue to build and that her account was still at risk of default. In 
fact, Miss M says that she was told her account wasnt at risk of default. Given the upset caused by the unclear and potentially incorrect information given I think Miss M should be 
paid compensation. 
Our investigator recommended a payment of £300. Given Miss Ms circumstances at the 
time (which she made NewDay aware of) I accept that the confusion about this account 
caused her a significant amount of distress at an already very difficult time. Miss M has 
explained she was in poor mental health and the medication she was on, so in this case, I 
find that £300 compensation is reasonable.
Miss M feels that NewDay unfairly applied the default to her account. I can understand why 
she feels this, but I also accept that as she wasnt making payments towards the account 
then the arrears were increasing and NewDay was right to take action to prevent Miss M 
getting into further debt. Miss M has provided details of payments she was receiving into her 
account which she says she was saving to pay the credit card off when the hold was lifted. 
But I find it reasonable that had she had money available then she would have contacted 
NewDay about this and made payments at the time. 
NewDay carried out an income and expenditure assessment on Miss M in March 2019 and 
she didnt have any disposable income. She had explained she was at university and so it 
didnt appear that her circumstances were likely to change significantly in the short term. As 
she couldnt make payments towards the account, I do not find that I can say NewDay was 
wrong to take further action. NewDay is required to provide accurate information to the credit 
reference agencies and in this case, I do not find I can say that NewDay applied the default 
incorrectly. Because of this I do not require it to remove the default from Miss Ms account.
In conclusion, I do not find that Miss M was provided with the service she should have been 
when she reached out to NewDay for help and she should be compensated for this. But I do 
not find I can say NewDay was wrong to apply the default.
Putting things right
NewDay should pay Miss M £300 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused 
while she was trying to set up an arrangement on her account.
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd should take the action set out above in resolution of this 
complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 January 2024.
