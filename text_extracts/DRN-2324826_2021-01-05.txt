The complaint
Mrs Cs complaint about Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclaycard) relates to a payment from her 
credit card account to her bank account which she says she did not authorise.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
To see clearly what has happened here I shall look at the statements relevant to the time 
period Mrs C complains about. However, before I do that I recognise that trying to follow 
what actually happened could possibly appear confusing, so I shall explain first, the gist of it. 
On 1 July Mrs C paid to her credit card account £961.67. On 10 July, the exact same sum 
was paid from her credit card account back to her bank account. 
Barclaycard have told this service that they were contacted by a member of branch staff on 
9 July with a request to send the £961.67 back to Mrs Cs bank account, which they did. 
Barclaycard say this was at Mrs Cs request when she either rang from a branch of Barclays 
or was present in it. The payment arrived back in her bank account on 13 July. She says she 
didnt authorise this payment.
The statements show;
Statement 4 June. This shows that Mrs C paid the statement prior to this one (I shall call that 
the 4 May statement) closing balance in full. Following the 4 May statement Mrs C spent 
£285.99 on her card and so the closing balance on this statement, the 4 June statement was 
£285.99.
Statement 6 July. On 25 June Mrs C paid to her account the £285.99 closing balance from 
the above statement. She also paid £961.67 on 1 July. The total paid to her card was 
£1,247.66 (£285.99 plus £1,247.66). 
Mrs C spent £1,002.37 on her card between 8 June and 6 July which left a closing balance 
of £40.70. (This is calculated by adding the £285.99 closing balance of the previous month 
to the spend that month of £1,002.37 and then deducting the total payments that month of 
£1,247.66)
Statement 6 August. On 30 July Mrs C paid the £40.70 closing balance from the above 
statement. Mrs C then spent £911.06 on her card between 8 July and 6 August, but also 
there appears on 10 July a direct credit for £961.67. The total sum used on her card was 
therefore £1,872.73 which was the closing balance.
Statement 4 September. On 25 August Mrs C paid £911.06. This is clearly the amount she 
spent on goods and other items from the previous month. It doesnt of course take account 
of the £961.67 direct credit payment on 10 July. Mrs C spent £784.11 between 10 August 
and 1 September which left a closing balance of £1,763.01. (This is calculated by adding the 
£1,872.73 previous month closing balance to the spend that month of £784.11 and the 
interest which had accrued of £17.23, then deducting the payment that month of £911.06)
As I have said the above can be confusing, but Mrs C has provided a very helpful report in 
which she confirms she paid £961.67 to her credit card account online on 1 July. She also 
confirmed she went into a branch on 9 July. The reason she did that she says was because 
she had become concerned about potential fraud on her account since the statement 
amount was for more than she felt she had actually spent. 
Mrs C also confirms that on that day she spoke with a personal banker who rang 
Barclaycard for her. She says that the personal banker concluded that an annual direct debit 
had been actioned, he said he had had it cancelled and a refund of the £961.67 initiated. It is 
clear from Mrs Cs own account that she therefore knew the refund was being made from 
her credit card account to her bank account, because the personal banker told her so.  
I have noted that Mrs C has said she was horrified when she received her August statement 
to see the direct credit of £961.67, but I am at a loss as to understand why that should be 
when she has very clearly said that the personal banker told her that was what was going to 
happen. 
So, whilst at first this complaint does appear complicated, I dont think it is. I am satisfied that 
following Mrs Cs visit to the branch on 9 July she has instructed the personal banker to 
return the payment of £961.67 made on 1 July to her credit card account back to her bank 
account. I am also satisfied that that exact sum did in fact go back into Mrs Cs bank account 
and she has not lost out. 
So, although Mrs C will probably be disappointed with my decision, I cant say Barclaycard 
has acted unfairly or unreasonably here. On a balance of probabilities, having been told that 
the payment was being made back to her bank account by the personal banker, it is likely 
that was at the instruction of Mrs C. So, Im not upholding this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 February 2021.
