K821x#15complaint
Mrs C says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to her. She has told us she was consistently  provided with repeat borrowing and her 
credit limit was increased. Mrs C says she had borrowing with other  short-term  loan 
providers as well as Sunny and she got into a cycle of debt. The pressure of the borrowing 
caused her to default on her loans.

When Sunny  responded to Mrs Cs complaint it offered to write off the outstanding balance  it 
said Mrs C owed. Mrs C wasnt happy  with the offer and brought  her complaint to this 
service. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mrs Cs complaint and thought  the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. They also thought any information about Mrs Cs 
borrowing from loan seven onwards would have  an adverse impact  on her credit  file so said 
all information about them should  be removed. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan 11 onwards.  We put the 
offer to Mrs C but didnt  hear back from her. 
Ref: DRN60759102As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs C could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mrs C didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to three shouldnt be 
upheld. Because  of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision  about this lending.  But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mrs C had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account  when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ref: DRN60759103Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Cs complaint.  After  doing so Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint  in part. Ill explain why.
When Mrs C started  borrowing in September  2016 she quickly returned for more  borrowing  
taking out three loans  within three  days  and taking her total borrowing for that month up to 
£350. Sunny  has told us its product  allows a flexible approach so that consumers can take 
more than one loan at a time provided the amount borrowed stays within a notional  credit 
limit it determines. But I think that Mrs Cs very quick uptake could have been an indication 
that she was struggling with her finances. 
So, when Mrs C returned for more borrowing at loan four, just under three weeks  after she 
had taken loan three,  I think Sunny should have found out more about  her financial situation. 
She had taken out four loans within three  weeks and the amount borrowed had now 
increased to £500  with the monthly  repayments correspondingly increasing. Mrs C has told 
us she got into a cycle of debt and her quick further  borrowing at loan four would suggest  
this was potentially  the case.  So, I dont think any borrowing from loan four should have 
been given. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan seven. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs C was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Mrs C had taken  out 11 loans within  seven months. So Sunny  
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mrs C was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that 
Mrs Cs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.  
Mrs Cs first loan was for £150 and loan seven was for £400.   At this point Sunny 
ought to have known that Mrs C was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in her income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Mrs C was provided with a new loan within days or weeks of settling a previous one. 
And I note that she was repaying  her loans before the term of six months  which was 
agreed at the outset.  While this would have saved  her interest  charges, I would 
question why someone would repay a loan only to take out further borrowing. It can 
be an indication that someone is juggling their finances in order  to repay  current 
borrowing in order to make ends meet. 
Mrs C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  19 was 
taken out 17 months after Mrs Cs first. And it was for a larger amount. Mrs C had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mrs C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan seven 
onwards because:
Ref: DRN60759104these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Cs indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mrs C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mrs Cs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, like the adjudicator Im also upholding the complaint about loans four to 19 and Sunny 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do 
If there is any outstanding  balance due on Mrs Cs loans which  has been transferred to a 
third party Sunny should buy the loans back if it can. If Sunny cant  buy the loans back, then 
it needs to work with the third party  to make sure the following is achieved: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs C towards  interest, fees 
and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mrs C which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs C originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mrs C as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding  loans. 
If this results  in Mrs C having made overpayments then Sunny should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date the complaint is settled. 
Sunny should  then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step 
E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus, then the surplus should  be paid to Mrs C. However, if there  is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan 
with Mrs C. 
E) Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mrs Cs credit file in relation to 
loans four to six. 
The number of loans  taken from loan seven onwards  means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So, all entries  about loans seven to 19 should  be 
removed from Mrs Cs credit file. Sunny  does  not have to remove  any outstanding 
loans from loan seven  onwards from Mrs Cs credit  file until these  have been  repaid, 
but any adverse  information recorded about these loans should still be removed.
                                                                                                                                 
Ref: DRN60759105 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs C a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
If after doing the above Mrs C still has an outstanding balance due, then Sunny should try 
and work  together to come  to a mutually  agreeable repayment plan with Mrs C in order to 
repay what is owed. But Id remind Sunny of its obligation to treat Mrs C fairly. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 May 2020.
