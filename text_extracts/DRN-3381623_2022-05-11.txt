The complaint
Ms P says AvantCredit of UK, LLC irresponsibly lent to her.
What happened
This complaint is about a loan provided by AvantCredit for Â£1800 to Ms P in January 2016.
Our investigator upheld Ms Ps complaint and thought AvantCredit shouldnt have been 
given the loan. AvantCredit disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Ms Ps complaint. These two 
questions are:
1. Did AvantCredit complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Ms P would be able to repay loans in a sustainable way and without experiencing 
significant adverse consequences?
If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
If not, would those checks have shown that AvantCredit wouldve been able to do 
so?
2. Did AvantCredit act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
The rules and regulations in place required AvantCredit to carry out a reasonable and 
proportionate assessment of Ms P ability to make the repayments under this agreement. 
This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or
affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower focused  so AvantCredit had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would be sustainable and cause significant adverse consequences for Ms 
P. In practice this meant that business had to ensure that making the payments to the loan 
wouldnt cause Ms P undue difficulty or significant adverse consequences.
In other words, it wasnt enough for AvantCredit to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Ms P. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking.
Even for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different
applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have
been more thorough:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ps complaint.
Did AvantCredit complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Ms P 
would be able to repay the loan in a sustainable way or without experiencing significant 
adverse consequences?
AvantCredit has provided evidence to show that before lending to Ms P, it asked her for 
information about her income, expenditure and carried out an affordability assessment. This 
involved it carrying out a credit check. Based on those checks AvantCredit thought it was fair 
to lend.
Ms P was entering into a significant commitment with AvantCredit. She was agreeing to 
make monthly repayments for a period of 4 years. So, I think it is right that AvantCredit 
wanted to gather, and independently check, some detailed information about Ms Ps 
financial circumstances before it agreed to lend to her. I think that the checks it did were 
sufficient to achieve that aim. I think AvantCredits checks on this occasion were 
proportionate. 
Did AvantCredit make a fair lending decision?
I have concluded AvantCredit made proportionate checks. But simply performing 
proportionate checks isnt always enough. A lender also needs to react appropriately to the 
information those checks show. Those results might sometimes lead a lender to undertake 
further enquiries into a consumers financial situation. Or, in some cases, the results might 
lead a lender to decline a loan application outright. This is what I think AvantCredit should 
have done here.
I agree with the investigator when she said Ms P was paying a significant amount of 
her income to credit commitments. Ms P had 4 loans to repay along with a large hire 
purchase agreement. This HP agreement also had a long term left that Ms P was 
committed to. Ms P also had an overdraft and a credit card too. This all meant that, 
once added to the monthly repayment of this loan, Ms P was paying such a significant 
proportion of her monthly income on credit repayments. AvantCredit ought to have 
realised it was unlikely Ms P would be able to sustainably repay her loan over the four-year term in her circumstances at that time. On balance, I think AvantCredit should 
reasonably have concluded that it was not fair to lend to her.
AvantCredit needs to put things right.
Did AvantCredit act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive also thought about whether AvantCredit acted unfairly in some other way and I havent 
seen any evidence that it did.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Ms P paid on the loan;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about the loan from Ms Ps credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to take off tax from this interest. AvantCredit must 
give Ms P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I am upholding Ms Ps complaint. AvantCredit of UK, LLC 
should put things right for Ms P as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 June 2022.
