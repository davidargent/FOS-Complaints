The complaint
Mr W complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA dismissed his claim for a refund even 
though he didnt receive a gift he purchased for his son. He is also unhappy with how PayPal 
has responded to his complaint.
What happened
Mr W bought a gift for his son in early July 2020. When the item didnt arrive, he made a 
complaint to PayPal on 15 July 2020. It contacted the merchant. The merchant provided 
some evidence to PayPal which PayPal thought satisfied its requirements for proof of 
delivery and as such no Buyer Protection was offered to Mr W. This decision was made on 
19 August 2020.
Mr W is convinced that there has been fraudulent activity and that PayPal is protecting the 
fraudsters.
The investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. He was satisfied that PayPal 
had dealt with Mr Ws complaint fairly and he hadnt seen anything to suggest it had delayed 
things.
Mr W remained unhappy. He felt he had been scammed and that he wasnt able to make 
any progress with the couriers because he had no details regarding the proof of delivery. He 
doesnt even know if they have been falsified. Mr W feels if he had used a different method 
of payment, he would have received a refund. Mr W was also concerned that if he got the 
proof of delivery now it might be too late.
The investigator felt it would be unfair to hold PayPal responsible for an item going missing 
in transit. He also said we cant look at a complaint about complaint handling because this is 
not a regulated activity. He provided Mr W with the proof of delivery shown to him.
Mr W felt that the courier wouldnt keep tracking information forever and wanted the 
complaint escalated to an ombudsman. He felt that PayPals complaints handling process 
needs to be addressed and questioned how a vulnerable consumer would deal with PayPal.
A second investigator responded to Mr W. She agreed with the first investigator that we can't 
say PayPal needs to do anymore. It has asked the merchant for proof of delivery which it 
has provided, and this shows the item was delivered, so anything beyond this would need to 
be raised as a dispute with the courier directly. She didnt think the delay in Mr W receiving 
this information would change how we considered the complaint. She thought Mr W should 
take up any concerns he had about PayPals complaint handling process with the regulator.
Mr W remained unhappy and requested an ombudsmans decision.
When I looked at the complaint, I asked both Mr W and PayPal some additional questions. 
Mr W, despite repeated chasing hasnt responded. So, I dont know whether he had any luck 
tracing the parcel or why during his complaint with PayPal he changed the complaint from an 
item not received dispute to an unauthorised transaction dispute.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Like the two investigators who have looked at this complaint before I have sympathy for 
Mr W. But I think it is most likely the parcel was delivered  a proof of delivery has been 
provided. I therefore dont think it would be right for Mr W to be refunded. I havent seen 
anything to suggest fraudulent activity on the part of the supplier or PayPal. And I very much 
hope Mr Ws failure to respond to my questions means that he has now received the parcel. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 June 2021.
