The complaint
Mr M complains that MBNA Limited wont refund to him the money that he paid for some 
holiday club membership points. Hes being represented in his complaint by a claims 
management company.
What happened
Mr M and his wife entered into a purchase agreement in October 2012 to buy 4,000 holiday 
club membership points. The total price payable under the agreement was £4,800 and Mr M 
paid £960 of that amount using his MBNA credit card in October 2012 and the balance of 
£3,840, also using his MBNA credit card, in November 2012.
Mr Ms representative made a claim to MBNA in August 2017 under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the membership had been misrepresented to Mr M 
and his wife and that the holiday company had breached the contract. MBNA said that there 
was no debtor-creditor-supplier agreement in relation to Mr Ms contract with the holiday 
company so he didnt have a valid section 75 claim. Mr M wasnt satisfied with its response 
so a complaint was made to this service that the holiday company was in breach of the 
contract by misrepresenting the contract to Mr M and his wife and breaching the EU 
Timeshare Directive.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that MBNAs decision to turn down his claim was unfair or unreasonable. She wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract agreed between it and Mr M and his wife. She 
said that, because there wasnt enough evidence to uphold Mr Ms complaint, she hadnt 
made a finding on the debtor-creditor-supplier relationship.
Mr Ms representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says that our investigators recommendation is manifestly wrong and none of 
the relevant clauses have been reviewed. It says that there have been breaches of the 
Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010, the Unfair 
Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 and the Consumer Protection from Unfair 
Trading Regulations 2008 and it has provided an indicative and non-exhaustive list of 
terms which it says may be regarded as unfair. It has also provided a generic submission 
from counsel about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses and a further 
document in which it describes what it says has been a fundamental breach of contract by 
the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ms complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Ms claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
Mr Ms claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company and that the membership points were misrepresented to him and his wife 
and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to them;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not MBNAs response to Mr Ms 
claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Ms complaint form says that the holiday company was in breach of the contract 
by misrepresenting the contract to Mr M and his wife, and his representatives letter 
to MBNA in August 2017 describes the misrepresentations that it says were made to 
Mr M and his wife, including that:
they would receive a guaranteed yearly rental income which would cover the 
maintenance fees and provide a profit;
they were advised that they would receive priority when booking; and
they were informed that the selection of destinations would continue to 
broaden;
and it says that those promises were untrue;
Ive been provided with a copy of the purchase agreement that Mr M and his wife 
signed in October 2012 and I consider it to be likely that they would have also signed 
other documents as that time but neither Mr M nor his representative has provided 
copies of those documents;
Mr Ms representatives August 2017 letter to MBNA says that Mr M and his wife 
were advised that they would receive a guaranteed yearly rental income from their 
membership points which would cover the maintenance fees and provide a profit but 
theyve never made any profit on the product;
the letter says that Mr M and his wife were forced to endure an extremely high-
pressured presentation about the benefits of purchasing the membership points but 
no further evidence about the rental income that they were advised that they would 
receive has been provided and Mr M hasnt provided any evidence to show that he 
has unsuccessfully tried to generate a rental income from the points; 
I dont consider that Mr M has provided enough evidence to show that the holiday 
company said that he and his wife would receive a guaranteed yearly rental income 
which would cover the maintenance fees and provide a profit;
Mr Ms representative says that Mr M and his wife have attempted to reserve 
holidays on several occasions only to find that theres no availability but the same 
weeks are available to the general public through third party booking agencies  but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that they were advised that they would receive priority 
when booking or that the resorts were exclusive to club members;
Mr Ms representative also says that Mr M and his wife were informed that the 
selection of destinations would continue to broaden but the selection has been 
reduced in favour of increasing the availability elsewhere  but Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that they were informed that the selection of 
destinations would continue to broaden or that the selection has been reduced;
if the holiday company had made such promises to Mr M and his wife but the 
promises werent contained in the documents that they were then signing, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have asked for the promises to be set 
out in writing;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
were misrepresented to Mr M and his wife by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the purchase agreement to buy the membership points by 
any such misrepresentations or that the membership points were mis-sold to them;
Mr Ms representative says that holiday company is in breach of contract by including 
manifestly unfair terms and that Mr M and his wife are entitled to receive notice of, 
and attend and speak at, all general meetings of the holiday company but they 
havent been provided with notices of the general meetings;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr M and his wife contacted the holiday company 
to tell it that they hadnt received notices of the general meetings and I dont consider 
that any failure by the holiday company to send Mr M and his wife any notices of 
meetings in these circumstances would be a breach of contract for which MBNA 
would be liable under section 75;
Ive carefully considered what Mr Ms representative has said about the unfairness of 
the terms of the documents that Mr M and his wife entered into with the holiday 
company and the breaches of regulations and the EU Timeshare Directive that it has 
described (including the various submissions that it has provided since our 
investigators recommendations);
Ive not been provided with all of the documents that Mr M and his wife are likely to 
have signed with the holiday company in October 2012 but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in those documents was unfair;
Mr M and his wife signed the purchase agreement and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence in these circumstances to show that theres been a breach of 
contract by the holiday company for which MBNA would be liable under section 75;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that there must be a debtor-creditor-
supplier agreement but, as Mr Ms credit card statements show that the payments of 
£960 and £3,840 were made to a trustee, and not to the holiday company (even 
though the holiday company is also referred to on the statements), its now possible 
that there was no such agreement in place following the High Courts judgment last 
year in the case of Steiner v National Westminster Bank plc;
but as Im not persuaded that theres been a misrepresentation or breach of contract 
for which MBNA would be liable under section 75, I consider that theres no need for 
me to make any finding as to whether or not there was a debtor-creditor-supplier 
agreement in these arrangements;
I sympathise with Mr M and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their holiday 
club membership points but I consider that MBNAs response to Mr Ms section 75 
claim was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
MBNA to refund to Mr M any of the money that he paid for the membership points, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 July 2023.
