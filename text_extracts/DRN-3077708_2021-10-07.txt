The complaint
Mrs G has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) continued charging 
her excessive amounts for her overdraft when she was in financial difficulty.
  
What happened
Mrs Gs complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators. She thought that NatWest 
ought to have realised that Mrs G was experiencing financial difficulty by 30 December 2015 
and so shouldnt have added any more interest, fees and charges from this point onwards. 
NatWest has since refunded interest and charges applied since that date, less £500 which it 
had previously paid to Mrs G as a goodwill gesture. Mrs G didnt think the £500 should have 
been deducted. And she says that NatWest should also pay her some compensation for the 
distress she has suffered due to the overdraft charges. She asked for the case to be looked 
at by an ombudsman.
I understand that Mrs G would like NatWest to refund all the interest she has paid since 
2006. But our adjudicator has already explained that we cant look at interest and charges 
applied more than six years before Mrs G brought her complaint. So Im only looking at the 
interest and charges applied from 13 May 2015 onwards.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at whether a bank treated a customer fairly and reasonably when applying 
overdraft charges. So I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, Im intending to find that NatWest acted 
unfairly when it continued charging overdraft interest and associated fees from 30 December 
2015. By this point, it ought to have been clear that Mrs G was in no position to sustainably 
repay what she owed within a reasonable period of time.
By this point, Mrs G was hardcore borrowing. In other, words she hadnt seen or maintained 
a credit balance for an extended period of time. NatWests own literature suggests that 
overdrafts are for unforeseen emergency borrowing not prolonged day-to-day expenditure. 
So I think that Mrs Gs overdraft usage should have prompted NatWest to have realised that 
Mrs G wasnt using her overdraft as intended and shouldnt have continued offering it on the 
same terms. As NatWest didnt react to Mrs Gs overdraft usage and instead continued 
charging in the same way, I think it failed to act fairly and reasonably. 
Mrs G ended up paying additional interest, fees and charges on her overdraft and this ended 
up exacerbating difficulties she already had in trying to clear it. So I think that NatWest didnt 
treat Mrs G fairly and she lost out because of what NatWest did wrong. And this means that 
it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what NatWest needs to do to put things right for Mrs G
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Mrs Gs complaint for NatWest to put things right by:
Reworking Mrs Gs overdraft balance so that all interest, fees and charges 
applied to it from 30 December 2015 are removed.
AND
If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer 
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments 
and returned to Mrs G along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from 
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement. If no 
outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, then 
NatWest should remove any adverse information from Mrs Gs credit file. 
NatWest has already made a payment to Mrs G since our adjudicator issued her view. It 
deducted £500 from its calculation of the refund due, as this amount had previously been 
paid to Mrs G. I think thats a fair approach. The £500 paid previously was a goodwill refund 
of interest. So, if it isnt taken into account now, it will mean that interest is being refunded 
twice, which I dont think would be fair.
Im not going to ask NatWest to make a payment for distress here. Thats because I think 
theres a balance to be struck between what NatWest did and Mrs Gs own actions in 
spending (and so having the benefit of) the funds which the overdraft provided.
I understand that, following the recent refund to Mrs Gs account, NatWest has removed Mrs 
Gs overdraft. I think thats reasonable. Mrs G says she would like to keep a small overdraft 
facility for use in emergencies. But this complaint has been upheld because the overdraft 
was unsustainable. So its not unreasonable for NatWest to have removed it, and NatWest 
isnt obliged to continue to lend to Mrs G.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to take off tax from this interest. NatWest must 
give Mrs G a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mrs Gs complaint. If it hasnt already done so, 
National Westminster Bank Plc should put things right in the way Ive set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 November 2021.
