K820x#14complaint
Mr T complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick  Quid) gave him loans he 
couldnt afford to repay. He asks that it pays compensation and removes information  about 
the loans from his credit file. Mr T is represented by a claims management  company.
background
Mr T took out seven  loans  and one top up loan from Quick Quid between  June 2016 and 
May 2017. His representative says Quick Quid didnt carry out affordability checks. 
The adjudicator recommended that the complaint  should be upheld.  He said the checks 
made by Quick Quid were  proportionate  for the first two loans.  The information it received 
suggested the loans were  affordable.  It should  have made more  checks before loan 3 and 
the later loans. Had it done  so, it would have seen that Mr T had short  term commitments  
that, with his usual expenditure,  made the repayments for loans 3 and 5 unaffordable. The 
adjudicator said Quick Quid should  refund interest and charges on loans  3 and 5 and 
remove adverse data about  them  from Mr Ts credit file. Quick  Quid  didnt agree, saying it 
had provided information  to show the loans were  lent responsibly. 
I didnt agree with all of the adjudicators recommendations. So I sent a provision decision to 
the parties to explain why. In, I said that Quick  Quids checks were  proportionate for loans 1 
and 2 but it should have  made more  checks before  the later loans. But, based  on the 
evidence I had about Mr Ts financial circumstances, I thought it likely Quick Quid  would  
have still assessed  the loans as affordable.  
Neither Mr T nor his representative provided further  comments or evidence.  Quick Quid 
asked that I review my findings in light of the information it provided  about its checks, which 
it says are adequate  and proportionate. The information Quick Quid  provided was about its 
lending process  rather than specific to Mr Ts loan applications.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments  including  the further evidence  
and arguments  provided in response to my provisional decision  to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
When Mr T applied for the loans,  he told Quick Quid his monthly income was £1,450 and his 
normal monthly living costs and regular financial commitments were  £825. He gave the 
same information before  each loan. Quick Quid did a credit  check and says the results didnt 
cause it any concern.

7 (top up) £50 26.05.2017 £186.00 30.06.2017
*loan 4 was originally due on 30 December 2016. It was refinanced by loan 5. 
** includes £50 borrowed on 19 November and £100  borrowed on 24 December  2016.
I think the checks made by Quick  Quid were proportionate for loans 1 and 2. The information  
Quick Quid received about Mr Ts income  and outgoings suggested the loans  were  
affordable. 
I think Quick Quid should have made further checks before it offered loan 3. This was Mr Ts 
third loan in three months. I think Quick Quid should  have  asked  about  Mr Ts short term 
financial commitments. But I think, if it had, it would have  assessed loan 3 as affordable. 
While Mr Ts bank statements show he made  payments  to short  term lenders of about £360 
in September  2016, one of these  repayments  (of about £190) was for a loan taken out on or 
about the same day that Mr T took out loan 3. I dont know whether this loan was taken out 
before or after Mr T took out loan 3. Also, this loan was repaid at the beginning of October. 
The repayment for loan 3 was due at the end of October 2016  after Mr T had received his 
monthly income. 
Based on the available evidence, I dont think Mr T had short  term commitments  outstanding 
when he took out loan 3 that made the repayment  due in October 2016 unaffordable. 
I think Quick Quid should have made similar checks before offering loan 4. But the available 
evidence suggests  that the information  it would have  received would have suggested the 
repayments were affordable. 
Mr T took out loan 5 in December 2016.  This was Mr Ts fifth loan in about  six months.  He 
re-financed loan 4 instead of repaying  it. Given his borrowing  pattern,  I think  Quick Quid 
should have made further checks.  I think it should have asked for information to gain a full 
understanding of Mr Ts financial  circumstances.  While there are different ways  of doing this, 
one is to look at his bank statements as Ive done.  I think it should have made similar checks  
before the later loans.
Mr Ts bank  statements show his financial commitments were higher than hed told Quick  
Quid  especially when  he took out the later loans. Overall, his normal  monthly expenditure 
was about £930, increasing to about £1,100  by May 2017.
Mr T had short term commitments when he took out loan 5. He made  payments of about 
£400 to short term lenders (other than Quick Quid) at the end of December 2016  debiting  
his bank account on 3 January 2017.  But I think, after meeting his normal expenditure and 
existing commitments, Mr T would have  had enough  income left to meet  the first payment for 
loan 5 due in December 2016  (about  £21). Based on the evidence available  to me, I dont 
Ref: DRN35130533think Mr T had short  term commitments outstanding  when he took out loan 5 that would have 
made the second payment (of £188) due at the end of January 2017  unaffordable.
Mr T continued to take out short term loans with other lenders. But I think if Quick Quid had 
looked more closely  at Mr Ts financial circumstances, its likely it would have said he had 
enough income to meet  his normal monthly expenditure, his short term commitments and 
the loan repayments.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 February  2019.
