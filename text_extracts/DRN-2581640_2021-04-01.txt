The complaint
Mr O complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) declined his refund request.  
What happened
In July 2020, Mr O bought a computer online for £614 - and paid using PayPal. The
computer was advertised as new. After 10 weeks he tried to use it and found it didnt work
properly. He sent a claim to PayPal in October 2020. PayPal declined it.
Mr O complained that the computer wasnt new  it still had its previous owners data on it.
And it had probably been rebuilt. He didnt start to use it for 10 weeks after purchase as he
had a lot of documents on his old computer which he needed to work on. He had problems
with the new computer from when he started to use it  such as a recurring blank screen and
persistent crashing. He said the computer fell under PayPals definition of Significantly Not
As Described. If there was a product warranty it was held by the seller  whod blocked him
and wouldnt cooperate. In any case, because he thought the computer had been rebuilt,
any warranty would be worthless.
PayPal said that theyd declined to refund the money Mr O had paid. Hed left a positive
review about the transaction online. And it had taken him three months to lodge his claim 
the problems could have arisen during that time. They said their User Agreement said, an
item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if: The item was properly
described but did not meet expectations. So, he didnt qualify for its Buyer Protection. This
was because in his claim to PayPal, Mr O had not referred to it not being new, but hed said
there were faults with it. After our investigator said that Mr Os claim was that the product
wasnt new, PayPal maintained their decision to decline it. They said the problem should be
rectified by claiming under the product warranty.
Mr O brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said PayPals Buyer Protection
applied here. She said Mr Os claim fell within PayPals definition of Significantly Not as
Described as the condition of the item was misrepresented. For example, the item was
described as new but the item was used. Mr O had produced evidence that the computer
was advertised as new. And, that the computer had been used  he showed personal emails
and voice mails involving the seller dating from February 2020 to July 2020. Mr O had tried
to resolve the problems with the seller, but hed been blocked by him. She said that where
the buyer satisfies PayPal that the item was misrepresented in a way that affects its value or 
usability, then its full purchase price, plus postage costs, should be reimbursed. PayPal
should reconsider the claim  and give Mr O the chance to show them his evidence.
PayPal disagreed. They asked that Mr Os complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
I reached a provisional decision, where I said:
I can see where Mr O is coming from. He bought a computer which was advertised as new.
He received it and put a positive review online about it. When he started to use it  10 weeks
later  he found it crashed frequently, among other problems. He found there was personal
data on it  such as voice mails and emails  relating to the seller. So, he said it cant have
been new. He suspected it had been rebuilt. Any warranty was therefore worthless  and the
seller had blocked him anyway, so he couldnt resolve his case with him.
PayPals User Agreement contains Buyer Protection. It says: PayPal Buyer Protection
may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction: 
You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a
Significantly Not as Described claim).
And, Significantly Not as Described is defined as: An item may be considered Significantly
Not as Described if:
The item is materially different from the seller's description of it.
You received a completely different item.
The condition of the item was misrepresented. For example, the item was
described as new but the item was used.
The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (I.E counterfeit)
The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the
description of the item when you bought it.
You purchased a certain number of items but didn't receive them all.
The item was damaged during shipment.
The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.
So  PayPals Buyer Protection applies if the product was misrepresented  in this case, it
was described as new, but it wasnt. And, the policy says: PayPal Buyer Protection entitles
you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping
costs you paid, if any.
But equally, PayPals Buyer Protection says that it has sole discretion over claims for Buyer
Protection as it says. PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim
qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection. PayPal's original determination is considered final,
but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or
compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you
believe there was an error in the decision-making process.
PayPal have said to us that Mr Os initial claim was based on the fact that the computer
didnt work  not that it wasnt new. This would have meant it fell outside its Buyer Protection
 and therefore did not qualify for a refund. Of itself, this would be fair. But - Mr O has shown
us that he contacted PayPal in October 2020 to say his claim was that the computer wasnt
new  he says these were ignored. On 2 October 2020, Mr O said in an email to PayPal the 
seller stated that the machine was new but this is wrong as he has personal details and
message on there going back to May 2020 and I purchased this in July.the machine is not
new as it was statedas the seller was obviously using it.
Mr O has shown us evidence that the computer was advertised as new  Ive seen the
online advertisement. Hes also shown us that the computer had been used by the seller
 Ive seen evidence of emails, voice mails, and texts on it involving the seller. I think this
is compelling. So, it does appear to meet the definition of Significantly Not as
Described The condition of the item was misrepresented. For example, the item was
described as new, but the item was used. So, the purchase is covered by PayPals Buyer
Protection. And PayPal shouldve therefore reviewed Mr Os claim on that basis.
PayPal have questioned why it took Mr O three months between receiving the computer and
then using it and discovering the problems  they say these couldve occurred if hed been
using it. Mr O says that he didnt - as he continued to work on his old computer. It was only
when he started to use it  that he experienced problems. This then led him to investigatewhy that was. And he then discovered that the computer had been used before it was sold to
him.
They also say that he posted a positive online review about the purchase. In August 2020,
he posted a review which said Great seller, awesome before and after sales. Love the
computer!. This would imply that Mr O was happy with the overall process  but it doesnt
obviously mean hed used the computer extensively, so he hadnt at that stage discovered
that it wasnt new.
So, on balance, I think that Mr Os evidence shows that the computer wasnt new - as
advertised. It therefore falls within PayPals definition of Significantly Not as Described -
and qualifies for Buyer Protection. PayPal should therefore give Mr O the benefit of PayPals
Buyer Protection  this says Mr O should be reimbursed for the full purchase price plus any
shipping costs. In this case, the cost of the item was £600 plus shipping costs of £14  so Mr
O should be reimbursed with £614. In line with the Buyer Protection, Mr O should return the
computer to the seller  and Mr O must pay the shipping costs incurred for this.
Mr O accepted my findings. So did PayPal.
So  I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 As both Mr O and PayPal have accepted my findings, I wont be departing from what I said 
in my provisional decision for the reasons I gave in it. So, my final decision is that PayPal 
should do what Ive already suggested here. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint.
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should reimburse Mr O with a total of £614 - the cost of the 
computer (£600), plus shipping costs of £14. Mr O should return the computer to its seller 
and pay the shipping costs of doing this.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 April 2021.
