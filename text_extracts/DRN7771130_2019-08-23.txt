Mr A complains about the way PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA handled a dispute about a 
payment into his account.
background 
Mr A has an account with PayPal. He received  payment into that account for an item he sold 
for £245. 
The buyer later returned the item,  claiming  that it was faulty,  and raised a claim with PayPal 
to dispute the payment.
PayPal took £245 from Mr As account pending  the outcome of the dispute. This meant 
Mr As account had a negative balance. 
After being pursued  by PayPals collections team, Mr A paid money into his account to bring  
it back to a £0 balance.  He says this was difficult for him, given  his financial circumstances.
Mr A says the item he sold wasnt faulty.  He says the buyer had misunderstood the items 
functionality and expected it do something  it didnt in fact do.
PayPal initially resolved the dispute  in the buyers  favour. Mr A says they only reversed that 
decision after hed raised an appeal. And he says he had to put his case  to PayPal on 
several occasions before they realised  their error. 
He says PayPals  communications at this point  were poor. He had to chase them for 
responses, was placed on hold for prolonged periods when he rang them  and was mis-
informed about  their reasons for finding in the buyers favour.
PayPal did overturn their original decision and returned the £245  to Mr As account. 
Mr A had complained  to PayPal. He thought it was unfair in the circumstances that theyd 
taken the £245 from his account. He was unhappy with the communication  from PayPal.  
Hed had the stress  of dealing with the collections  team. And hed had to pay money into his 
account when  this was difficult for him.
As well as refunding  the £245  into Mr As account, PayPal offered £75 to Mr A as a goodwill 
gesture to reflect the fact that they could have better handled their communications  with him. 
They later offered a further £100  to bring  the matter to a conclusion.
Mr A wasnt  happy with that outcome  and complained to us. Our investigator looked  into it 
and thought PayPal neednt do anything  more than theyd offered to put things right for Mr A.
Mr A disagreed and asked for a final decision  from an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN77711302PayPal have admitted  that they could  have communicated better  with Mr A about  this matter. 
This is reflected in the offer of £175  in compensation. 
They did also eventually reverse their original  decision  to find in favour of the buyer after 
Mr A provided further evidence. 
However, they maintain they acted  correctly  and in line with their user agreement  when 
they took the £245 from Mr As account  once the claim was raised by the buyer.
And they say they were entitled to ask Mr A to bring  his account balance  to at least  £0 after 
theyd taken back the £245.
Mr A has very helpfully said that he thinks the compensation offered would be adequate to 
cover any problems with PayPals communications after theyd opened the dispute  claim. He 
recognises that they have followed their protocol from that point onwards.
However, he maintains  that it was wrong for PayPal  to deal with the buyers  claim in the way 
they did. He says they should have realised the item wasnt  faulty and not taken  the £245 
from his account. 
Ive looked carefully  at PayPals user agreement, which Mr A signed up to when he decided  
to use their services. And Im afraid I cant agree  with Mr A. Ill explain  why.
In the introductory  section, the user agreement  states that if a buyer  wishes  to open a 
dispute they must do so within 180 days of making their payment. In this case, the buyer  
was well within that time limit and was entitled  to raise a dispute.
In Section 3, the agreement says that when users receive a payment theyll be liable to 
PayPal for the full amount  if the payment is later invalidated for any reason. 
And at paragraph 10.1(d),  it says:
If a buyer files a Claim on a payment you received, PayPal will place a temporary 
hold on the funds in your account to cover  the full amount of the Claim
Its clear to me from those  sections, taken in the context of the rest of the agreement,  that a 
buyer can raise a dispute claim when they wish to do so. And that if so, PayPal will hold 
funds back from the seller until theyve investigated  the matter  and established  whether  the 
buyers case is justified.
In other  words, there  isnt some kind of pre-vetting of a buyers  claim before PayPal regard it 
as a legitimate  or formal  dispute and deal with it accordingly. They  take a buyers claim at 
face value and run it through  their dispute process.  And its the dispute process that requires 
them to hold the funds from the seller pending  an outcome.
In this case, the dispute revolved around whether the item was significantly not as 
described (SNAD) when  it was received by the buyer.
PayPal have guidance about when  items  can be seen as SNAD.  I believe Mr A is right to say 
the item he sold wasnt  as it turned  out  SNAD and wasnt  covered by the guidance. 
Ref: DRN77711303But it was the buyer  who raised the dispute  claim,  not PayPal.  And PayPal  from that point 
onwards  followed their process for dealing with such claims. They werent  entitled,  under 
the terms of their own user agreement, to deny  the buyer the right to raise a claim. 
So, I dont agree with Mr As suggestion  that it was unfair for PayPal to open a claim dispute  
(and therefore re-claim money  from his account  pending the outcome of their investigations)  
because it should  have been clear  from the outset the item wasnt SNAD.  Thats  what  their 
investigation would find out.
In summary,  Mr As item has been  returned  to him. PayPal have also paid him for the item at 
the price charged  to the original buyer. And theyve offered him £175 in total for the trouble 
and upset hes experienced  because  of the poor service he was given.
PayPal have been clear that the offer of £175 still stands. And that being  the case, I cant  
say PayPal have  acted unfairly  or unreasonably towards Mr A in their handling of this matter.
I understand Mr A was affected by PayPals taking £245 from his account when the dispute 
claim was opened.  Hes told us it wasnt easy to find the money  to bring the balance  back  to 
£0 and I accept that. 
However, I think the terms of their user agreement are clear that a payment may be disputed 
up to 180 days later. And theyre clear that funds  will be required  to cover the payment in 
that case.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 September  2019.
