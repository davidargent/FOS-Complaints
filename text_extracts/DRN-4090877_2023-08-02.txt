The complaint
Mr L complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and closed his account. He 
would like them to correct his credit file and reopen the account.
What happened
Mr L had accounts with NatWest.
NatWest following a review decided to close Mr Ls account. They wrote to him on 10 March 
2022 advising his account would close. Ten days later NatWest wrote to Mr L again to let 
him know they had made an error with the original letter, and he would receive further 
correspondence. Mr L could continue using his account. On 22 March 2022 a third letter was 
sent to Mr L confirming that his account would be closed and giving him 60 days notice. 
Mr L wasnt given a reason.
Mr Ls account was overdrawn by £5,432.99 at closure. Mr L says his credit file is showing 
him owing £11,878. 
NatWest said that although they had made an error and sent the wrong letter on 10 March 
2022, the bank had correctly decided to close Mr Ls accounts and confirmed this in their 
letter of 23 March 2022.
Mr L complained to our service. One of our investigators looked at the case. She thought 
NatWest hadnt provided us with enough information to conclude that Mr Ls account had 
been fairly closed. She also recommended NatWest correct the credit file and pay £100 in 
compensation for the errors made including putting the incorrect balance on his credit file.
NatWest accepted the view. Mr L didnt. He thought the compensation wasnt sufficient, hes 
seen others get higher amounts for similar reasons.
Mr L was also unhappy that he was being charged interest when the account was closed, 
and he mentioned NatWest hadnt requested payment of the overdraft.
NatWest agreed to correct the credit file in their post view correspondence.
As there was no agreement the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has important legal and regulatory obligations it must meet when providing 
accounts to customers. These obligations are ongoing. To comply with its obligations 
NatWest may need to review an account and/or restrict its customers access. The terms 
and conditions of Mr Ls accounts also permit NatWest to review an account.
A bank is also generally entitled to close an account providing its in line with the terms and 
conditions of the account. In this instance the terms of Mr Ls accounts say that in certain 
instances NatWest can close the accounts with immediate notice and by providing 60 days 
notice. And it doesnt have to provide a reason to its customer for doing so. 
However, NatWest needs to provide information to this service so we can fairly decide a 
complaint. Despite being asked by the investigator, NatWest has failed to provide 
information about why it blocked Mr Ls accounts and the reasons why it no longer wanted 
him as a customer. Ive considered what NatWest has said about why it wont provide further 
information to our service about the reasons it blocked and closed Mr Ls accounts. This 
service has the power to request evidence of this nature under the dispute resolution rules 
(DISP) and Im not persuaded the reasons given by NatWest exclude it from complying with 
these rules. So, in this particular case, because of the lack of information, I cant be satisfied 
that NatWest has treated Mr L fairly when it blocked and closed his accounts. 
Taking this into account, I agree with the investigator that NatWest should pay Mr L 
compensation for the trouble and upset caused by blocking and closing his accounts. 
NatWest agreed to pay £100 as recommended by the investigator. Mr L says he should be 
paid more compensation. Having considered what Mr L has told us about how the block and 
closure of his accounts impacted him Ive no doubt this was a worrying and upsetting time 
for him. 
He has said that he was able to reopen another account. Mr L did say that some of his direct 
debits failed, and he has some late payment flags as a result. Having considered the impact 
on Mr L and taking into consideration the available evidence, Im satisfied that the block and 
closure of his accounts has caused Mr L some trouble and upset. Therefore, I think he 
should receive compensation for this.
Mr L has said he has seen that others have received more compensation for the same 
issues. I am not able to comment on other cases and we treat each case individually and 
consider the circumstances of each individual case and the impact on each individual 
customer separately when considering the awards of compensation.
Looking at how Mr L has been impacted by NatWest blocking and closing his accounts, Im 
satisfied that £100 compensation is a fair amount of compensation an in line with what we 
would award and proportionate to the trouble and upset Mr L was caused. 
When Mr Ls accounts were closed, he had an overdraft balance of £5,432.99. NatWest 
have agreed that they reported this account incorrectly and they have confirmed they have 
corrected this on Mr Ls credit file, so I wont be asking them to do anything more.
Mr L is saying he shouldnt be charged any fees as his account has closed. Mr L still owes 
the bank because his account was overdrawn at the time of closure. I have had confirmation 
from NatWest that Mr L owes £7,312.86. I have checked the closure letter and it does 
mention that accounts that are overdrawn will need to be cleared by the closure date. I dont 
think Mr L has been in touch with NatWest to clear the overdraft. And whilst the overdraft is 
outstanding NatWest are entitled to continue to charge Mr L interest, so I dont think they are 
doing anything wrong there.
However, I can also see that Mr L is being charged fees for his premier account. The 
account was due to close in May 2022. Mr L continues to be charged a monthly fee for this 
account despite his not being able to use the account or benefit from its features. I think this 
isnt fair so I will be asking NatWest to refund all package bank account fees incurred by 
Mr L since the account was due to close in May 2022. My final decision
For the reasons stated above I partially uphold this complaint. I direct National Westminster 
Bank Plc to pay Mr L
£100 compensation for the inconvenience caused 
Refund him all package bank account fees incurred since 20 May 2022
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 August 2023.
