The complaint
Mr W complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) refunded someone he sold 
an item to, after they claimed it wasnt received.
Mr W is represented by his wife, Mrs W.
What happened
On 22 April 2020, Mr and Mrs W sold an item via an on-line marketplace and they received 
payment through Mr Ws PayPal account. On 19 July, the buyer raised a claim with PayPal 
on the basis the item wasnt received. 
On 20 July, PayPal notified Mr W of the buyers claim by email and it asked him to log into its 
resolution centre and provide tracking or proof of delivery. PayPals email also explained that 
if he didnt respond by 30 July, the case would be closed in the buyers favour. PayPal sent 
two further reminder emails to Mr W before the deadline expired.
Because Mr W didnt respond by the deadline, the claim was closed in the buyers favour 
and a refund was made. Soon afterwards, Mr W emailed PayPal the information it had 
requested. However, despite several chasers, PayPal didnt respond.
Mr and Mrs W were unhappy with the lack of response from PayPal, so they contacted our 
service for help. PayPal told us that, although it hadnt responded to Mr Ws complaint 
emails, it had considered the buyers claim in accordance with its user agreement. 
One of our investigators considered the matter, but he didnt think PayPal had done anything 
wrong by refunding the buyer. Mr and Mrs W remained unhappy, so Mr Ws complaint has 
been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
For me to uphold Mr Ws complaint, I need to be persuaded PayPal did something wrong by 
considering the buyers claim, or when considering Mr Ws eligibility for protection against 
the claim. Thats not the case here. Ill explain why.
Mr and Mrs W are unhappy the buyers claim was successful given it wasnt raised for about 
90 days after the transaction date. However, PayPals user agreement explains buyers can 
make a claim within 180 days. So, Im not persuaded PayPal did something wrong by 
considering the claim that was raised.
Mr and Mrs W are also unhappy PayPal didnt contact the website through which the item 
was sold, to check if the buyer had also raised a dispute with it. However, I havent seen 
anything that leads me to believe PayPal was under an obligation to do so. Importantly, 
PayPal gave Mr W an opportunity to respond to the claim.
The user agreement sets out the requirements that need to be met for a seller to be eligible 
for protection when a buyer makes a claim. The requirement of relevance here is the seller 
must respond to PayPal's requests for information in the time requested. The agreement 
also explains that PayPal can decide if the seller is eligible for protection based on the 
information provided during the resolution process.
Given that Mr W didnt provide the requested information by the deadline, and PayPal sent 
him three emails setting out the decision that would be made, I cant reasonably decide it 
unfairly decided the claim in the buyers favour. Because Mr W didnt respond by the 
deadline, as per the user agreement, he wasnt eligible for protection.
Mr and Mrs W have explained that they didnt think PayPals emails were genuine given no 
dispute had been raised through the marketplace website. Although I accept what they say, 
thats not something I can reasonably hold PayPal responsible for. I can understand Mr Ws 
reluctance to click on links in emails he wasnt sure about, but I consider it more likely than 
not, he could have accessed PayPals resolution centre through its website to check if a 
claim had been made against him.
Mr W did go on to email PayPal the information it had requested, and I accept its possible 
the buyers claim wouldnt have been successful if PayPal had considered this information 
before making its decision. However, in my view, I cant reasonably decide PayPal acted 
unfairly by not considering this information. I say this because the resolution process had 
already ended, and Mr W had been provided a reasonable opportunity to respond to the 
claim before PayPals decision was made. Notably, the user agreement doesnt offer an 
appeal process when a claim is decided in the buyers favour.
Mr and Mrs W point towards the lack of response to Mr Ws emails after the funds were 
refunded to the buyer. However, whilst I dont doubt their frustration, I understand these 
emails were sent to general email addresses. Ive not seen anything that persuades me 
PayPal wouldnt have considered the information it had requested from Mr W, if he had 
submitted this through PayPals resolution centre by the deadline (as per its request). 
Because Im satisfied PayPal processed the claim in line with its terms and conditions, and it 
gave Mr W a reasonable opportunity to defend the claim before it made its decision, Im not 
persuaded I can uphold his complaint.
My final decision
Im sorry to disappoint Mr and Mrs W. But for the reasons explained above, I dont uphold 
this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 January 2021.
