K820x#14complaint
Mr P complains that TransferWise  Ltd didnt make  a SWIFT payment as directed. 
background
On 1 April 2019  Mr P arranged for a payment to be sent to a hospital  abroad as his wife was 
booked to have  a medical procedure on 15 April 2019. Mr P called TransferWise  and was 
given advice on how to complete the transfer  instruction. The payment was sent the 
following day. 
TransferWise used  an intermediary bank to make  the payment. The payment instruction 
included a recipient name  and reference.  But the recipients name was wrong. On 
11 April 2019 the recipients intermediary bank contacted TransferWises intermediary bank 
to discuss the transaction. Because of the errors,  TransferWises intermediary bank asked 
for the payment to be returned. 
On 15 April 2019 Mr Ps wife travelled abroad but wasnt able to undergo the medical  
procedure. Details of SWIFT messages between the intermediary banks were given to 
Mr Ps wife and forwarded to TransferWise.  Mr P went  on to complain.  Mr P said hed 
followed TransferWises  instructions when completing the payment instruction. 
TransferWise responded on 8 May 2019  but didnt agree  it had made an error.  TransferWise 
said Mr P had completed the instruction  and provided the recipients name. It also said the 
intermediary bank cant make significant changes to a payment instruction which is why the 
payment was recalled. 
Mr P referred his complaint to our service and an investigator looked at it. He listened to the 
call on 1 April 2019 and said TransferWise didnt tell Mr P what recipient name to use. The 
investigator didnt  uphold Mr Ps complaint and he asked to appeal. As a result, the 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its often complex to work out whats happened  when  there  are intermediary  banks involved.  
In his response to the investigator, Mr P said TransferWise hired the intermediary  bank. And 
I agree  thats  the case as the intermediary bank is acting as the agent for TransferWise  in 
order to complete the SWIFT payment. So TransferWise would be liable for any errors made 
by its intermediary. I need to decide  whether either TransferWise or its intermediary  have 
made mistakes here. 
Ive listened to the calls Mr P had with TransferWise  on 1 April 2019.  Mr P was taken 
through the payment process by TransferWises  call handler, but they didnt  tell him what 
details to enter for the recipient. When Mr P asked  what details to input the call handler said 
to put in the hospitals details but left it to Mr P to complete. Im sorry to disappoint Mr P but I 
havent found that it was TransferWise that caused the hospitals banks name  to be used 
instead. As a result, I dont think TransferWise was responsible for the payment failing to go 
through. 
Ref: DRN87566692The recipient  banks intermediary contacted TransferWises intermediary bank on 
11 April 2019 to query the payment  details.  When they couldnt be confirmed the payment 
was requested back. I can see Mr P has concerns that this was unnecessary  but 
TransferWise says it cant make significant changes  to a payment instruction once its been 
completed and Im satisfied thats  correct. So I think it was right for the intermediary  bank to 
request the payment back on 11 April 2019. 
Mr Ps wife arrived  at the hospital on 15 April 2019  but at this stage TransferWise hadnt 
received the payment back from its intermediary bank. TransferWise says it generally takes 
between two and five working days to receive  a refund when something goes wrong.  
TransferWise received the payment back on 17 April 2019 (it was refunded to Mr P the 
following day) but by that time it was too late. Ive looked at the dates and the payment  was 
received back within  five working days. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr P and I understand his wife travelled abroad at great 
inconvenience and considerable expense.  But Im satisfied TransferWise wasnt  responsible 
for mistakes inputting the recipients details into the payment instruction and I havent found 
it gave incorrect advice  during the payment process. As I havent been  persuaded 
TransferWise or its intermediary bank made a mistake, Im not telling it to take any further 
action to resolve this complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 September 2019.
