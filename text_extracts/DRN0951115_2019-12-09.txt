19/08/2017 AMEX refunded the disputed transactions
19/09/2017 AMEX reversed the refund
30/08/2017 Final response letter issued
In their final response AMEX outlined  that they held Mr O liable for the transactions. They 
pointed out:
there was only one card in existence  and the chip cannot be duplicated, 
the chip was read at the point(s) of sale,
Mr O said the card has remained in his possession,
Mr O has declined to provide evidence of his location at the time of the transactions.
Being unhappy with this  Mr O referred  his complaint to our service.  He says he didnt 
authorise the transactions and that the card had always  been in his possession in the UK. 
One of our adjudicators thought it should be upheld. She concluded  Mr O hadnt authorised 
the transactions and recommended that AMEX shouldnt hold him liable for them. AMEX 
disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to review  the complaint. 
relevant considerations
considering authorisation
In circumstances  like this the relevant regulations are the Payment Service  Regulations  
2009 (the PSRs 2009). These explain that a payment out of someones  account  can only 
be authorised if the payer has consented to it. The payment service provider must show 
the payment was authenticated.  But its not enough for the bank to simply rely on the fact 
that the card and the personalised set of procedures necessary to authenticate a payment  
were used; that doesnt necessarily mean  that the payment transaction  was authorised by 
the account holder.
Whether a payment has been authorised or not is important because  account holders will 
usually be liable for payments theyve authorised and, generally speaking,  banks  will be 
liable for unauthorised payments. But account holders can become liable for unauthorised 
payments when they havent met certain obligations.  These  obligations are set out in 
Regulation 57 PSRs  2009.
It's been suggested by AMEX that the PSRs may not be strictly applicable in this 
case. Theyve referred to the issue of where  the transactions took place.  Its not 
disputed that the transactions  took place in the USA and were  made  in US Dollars. 
However, I dont think that its necessary for me to make a finding  as to the relevance of 
Ref: DRN09511153the specific application of any particular part of the PSRs here.
I say that as AMEX  still have an obligation to treat their customers  fairly. And as Mr O 
says that he didnt authorise  the transactions in dispute, I need to consider whether its fair 
and reasonable for AMEX to continue  to hold him liable  for them.
The credit card agreement governing Mr Os account says:
Authorising and declining transactions
You authorise a Transaction when you do any of the following:
Request a Transaction using your Account by presenting or providing  a Card, the 
Card details  or Account details and, if required  for the Transaction, entering  a Card 
PIN, password,  personal identifiers or by following the relevant personalised set of 
procedures that we have agreed  that you may use in order  to request a 
Transaction; or
Ask us to carry out a balance transfer by requesting the Transaction in a way we 
permit you to (and satisfying any additional requirements that we tell you about)
The agreement then goes  on to say:
You will not be responsible for Transactions  where  you or a Supplementary Card  member 
have not allowed someone else to use your account or Card.
Integral, therefore,  to my determination  of this complaint is whether Mr O authorised  the 
disputed transactions,  whether they were made by him or with his knowledge.
considering credit  credit  facilities 
Where a credit facility has been used the relevant legislation is Section 83 of the CCA 
1974. The CCA says that a consumer isnt liable for any loss arising  from the use of a 
credit facility unless they (or someone  acting as their agent) used the facility.
Here all of the transactions were made using a credit facility/token. So in this case, if Mr O 
(or someone acting as his agent) didnt use the credit facility,  he cant  be held liable. 
credit tokens
But as an exception to that, section 84 says that if the person using a credit  token had it 
with the consumers consent,  the consumer can be made liable for the unauthorised  
transactions.
whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the complaint?
AMEX has a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care,  to follow  good  industry  practice 
and take steps  to keep the customers accounts safe, as well as other  obligations. And in 
considering whats  fair and reasonable in the particular circumstances of the complaint, Ill 
also need to review AMEXs actions to understand whether they couldve done anything  
else to prevent the disputed transactions. 
summary of relevant  considerations  in this case
Ref: DRN09511154With these relevant considerations in mind  I think there are two key questions in deciding 
what is fair and reasonable here:  
-were the disputed transactions authorised by Mr O?
-whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the complaint? 
In November 2019 I issued a provisional decision in which I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not currently 
intending to uphold this complaint. 
In cases like this, I need  to make my decision on the balance  of probabilities as to what  I 
think is most likely  to have happened. The key question here is whether or not Mr O 
authorised the transactions. Based on the evidence Ive seen, I think  its more  likely than not 
that he did. Let me explain  why. 
Mr O says he knew nothing of the disputed transactions  until they appeared on his monthly 
statement  at which point  he promptly raised his concerns  with AMEX. He says he was in 
the UK at the time the transactions took place and that his AMEX card was in his possession 
at all times. Both AMEX  and our investigator asked Mr O to provide evidence  of his location  
at the time of his disputed transactions. Suggested options were a copy  of his passport or 
confirmation from his employer as to his location. Mr O declined to provide any evidence of 
this, saying it was for AMEX to solidly prove  their case, not the other way round. 
AMEX have provided to following summary of events:
 When this transaction  took place;
their system declined it as suspicious and generated an email, asking that Mr O confirm  
whether or not the transaction was genuine.  The email was sent to an address Mr O had 
previously used to communicate  with AMEX.  Whilst AMEX havent  been able to provide a 
copy of the email itself,  theyve explained that it included a link to click to confirm  whether or 
not the transaction was genuine. Their system recorded that a response was received via 
the link confirming the transaction was genuine. They say this is what  resulted in subsequent  
transactions being authorised. AMEX  also pointed out that the IP Address that their email 
was accessed  from appears to have been  in the USA. But they acknowledge this isnt in 
itself definitive  evidence of the location.  Mr O says he didnt receive or respond to any email. 
But on balance, Im satisfied that the email was sent and a response  received as AMEX 
describes. 
Each of the disputed  transactions  are recorded  on AMEXs systems as being authenticated  
through CHIP and SIGNATURE. I asked AMEX for some further  evidence  of what  their 
system records  about authentication. Theyve explained that the common methods are:
Keyed- refers to online or phone transactions.
CHIP and PIN  refers to when  the chip is read by the merchants terminal  and the 
PIN is entered  by the customer.03/05/2017 20:55 Best Buy Chip and 
Signature3,888 Declined 
Ref: DRN09511155CHIP and SIG  refers to when  the chip is read by the merchants terminal  and 
verified by signature.
SWIPED  refers to when the cards  magnetic  strip has been swiped through the 
merchants terminal and verified by signature. 
AMEX also pointed out that chip and pin verification  isnt widely used in the USA.
Based on this Im satisfied  that Mr Os card was presented to each merchant  for the disputed  
transactions, as the genuine  chip has been  read at the point of sale.  But AMEX havent been  
able to provide  the signatures  made at each point  of sale.  This leads me to two main 
possible scenarios  in relation to the disputed transactions. 
scenario one
A third party  was able to remove Mr Os AMEX  card from his possession in the UK and 
travel to the USA. They were then able to make  the disputed transactions, presumably by 
forging his signature. They also compromised Mr Os email  account to enable  them  to 
respond to AMEXs email.  They were  then able to return Mr Os card without him having 
noticed it was missing. 
scenario two
Mr O or someone with his consent and or knowledge took his card to USA and made the 
transactions in question. And Mr O or someone acting on his behalf responded to AMEXs 
email. 
summary
Taking all the circumstances into consideration, I think scenario  two is whats  most  likely to 
have happened. Theres no evidence to suggest  that Mr Os card or his email account had 
been compromised. I dont think that AMEX being unable  to provide the signed signature 
slips in relation to the transactions makes a difference. I dont think  basing the outcome on 
AMEXs inability to locate these slips from the USA and relying  solely on Mr Os testimony 
would lead to a fair and reasonable outcome. 
There is no evidence to suggest that anyone  had Mr Os card without his consent.  I find the 
technical evidence  recorded by AMEX  that Mr Os cards unique  chip was read by the 
terminal at each point  of sale persuasive. And as I think its most  likely that he or someone 
acting as his agent used  the credit facility   I think it is fair and reasonable for AMEX  to hold 
him liable for the transactions. 
Mr O also raised  that the transactions went above  his credit limit. He believes this is another  
reason they should have been stopped  by AMEX. Ive looked at the terms and conditions  of 
Mr Os account with AMEX. These  explain that AMEX may authorise transactions  beyond  
the agreed credit limit. And that doing so doesnt  constitute an increase in the agreed  credit 
limit. In the context that Im of the opinion its more  likely than not that Mr O authorised the 
transactions he disputes, I dont think this means  its unreasonable  for AMEX  to hold Mr O 
liable for those transactions. 
Mr O responded to my provisional decision and said that he had nothing further to add.
AMEX responded  and also said that they had nothing further to add. 
Ref: DRN09511156my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party had anything further to add, I see no reason to deviate from my provisional 
decision. 
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above, my final decision is that I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 January 2020.
