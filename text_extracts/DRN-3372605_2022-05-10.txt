The complaint
Mr W complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their decision to decline the 
claim he made under their Buyer Protection Policy (BPP).
What happened
On 22 September 2021, Mr W purchased three games from an online retailer, who Ill refer 
to as C. This purchase was made through Mr Ws PayPal account, for a total of £81.56. But 
Mr W says he didnt receive the code for one of the games. And that the codes he received 
for the other two games didnt work. So, he asked C for a refund. And when this refund 
wasnt received, Mr W opened a dispute with PayPal under their BPP on 1 October. This 
claim was escalated to a Significantly Not as Described (SNAD) claim on 14 October.
But on 20 October, PayPal declined the claim, stating their belief that Mr W wasnt using the 
codes properly rather than the codes not being as described following information provided 
by C. And they said they were unable to refund Mr W for the game that hadnt been 
received, as the game itself hadnt been released yet. Mr W was unhappy with this, so he 
raised a complaint.
Mr W didnt think PayPals decision to decline his claim was fair, as he was out of pocket for 
£81.56 without any of the games he paid for. So, he wanted this decision to be reversed. 
PayPal responded and didnt agree, maintaining their belief the claim decline was fair. Mr W 
remained unhappy with this response, so he referred his complaint to us.
While the complaint was with our service, C refunded Mr W for one of the games, worth 
£7.68. And as a gesture of good will, PayPal agreed to refund Mr W £29.99 for the game he 
didnt receive. 
So, our investigation continued to look into the complaint with this in mind. And they upheld 
it. They recognised one game had been refunded by the merchant, so didnt consider this 
further. And they thought PayPals gesture of goodwill was fair. So, their investigation 
focused on the remaining game, worth £43.89. And they didnt think PayPal were fair to 
decline the claim, and not refund this outstanding amount. They thought Mr Ws claim 
satisfied the SNAD definition. And they didnt think it was fair for PayPal to rely on 
information provided by C, without requesting supporting evidence from Mr W. So, they 
thought the remaining amount should also be refunded.
Mr W agreed. But PayPal didnt. They didnt think Mr W had provided them with supporting 
information to assess the claim. So, they thought they were fair to decide in Cs favour. Our 
investigator explained wed received no evidence to show PayPal requested supporting 
information from Mr W, so asked for proof of this to reconsider their view. PayPal didnt 
provide this but still didnt agree. So, the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
One game, worth £7.68, has been refunded by C since Mr W referred his complaint to us as 
they accepted the code sent wouldnt work on the console Mr W used. As Mr W received the 
outcome he was hoping for regarding this game, I havent considered this any further.
PayPal have also agreed to refund Mr W £29.99 for the game he didnt receive, as they 
accepted he didnt receive this after the games release date had passed. Again, I think this 
provides Mr W with the outcome he was hoping for when he raised the claim. So, I think this 
offer is a fair one and I wont be commenting on this any further.
So, my decision focuses mainly on the final game Mr W ordered for £43.89. PayPal thinks 
their decision to decline the claim relating to this game was fair and so, a refund shouldnt be 
provided. For me to agree with this, Id need to be satisfied Mr Ws claim for this game fails 
to qualify under the SNAD criteria set out with PayPals BPP. Or, if I think the claim does 
satisfy this, Id need to be satisfied that Mr W failed to follow the claim process correctly and 
so, PayPals decision to find in the favour of C was a reasonable one. And in this situation, I 
dont think thats the case.
PayPals BPP states an item may be considered as SNAD for several reasons. Ive 
considered all these reasons against the circumstances of Mr Ws claim. In particular, 
PayPals BPP states an item can be described SNAD if The item is unusable in its received 
state and was not disclosed as such.
The item Mr W purchased was a code that would allow him to download a game to play on 
his console. And Mr W has stated the code C sent him didnt work. So, I think its fair to say 
the item, in this case the code, was unusable as it didnt allow Mr W to download the game 
as he expected and as the code was intended. So, Im satisfied the circumstances of Mr Ws 
claim satisfies the SNAD criteria.
PayPal dont agree with this, and theyve referred to e-mails between C and Mr W which 
they feel show Mr W was using the code incorrectly, rather than the code being unusable. 
But I dont think view of PayPals is fair.
Firstly, Ive seen no evidence that shows PayPal requested supporting information from Mr 
W, as well as C. So, I dont think its fair of PayPal to rely on supporting information C 
provided as Mr W wasnt allowed a reasonable opportunity to argue against this. Nor do I 
think its fair that PayPal use Mr Ws failure to provide supporting information as a reason as 
to why they think the claim was declined fairly as I wouldnt expect Mr W to do this unless 
requested. And as Ive already explained, Ive seen no evidence to show he was requested 
to do so, despite our services request for this information to be provided by PayPal.
And even so, the supporting information C provided is purely an opinion on what they 
believe may be the issue. Within the e-mail chain, I think its made reasonably clear that C 
thought the location Mr W needed to set was different to the one they then told him to use. 
And Mr W confirmed within the e-mails hed followed Cs instructions and that neither 
location suggested by C worked. I dont think these e-mails suggested Mr W failed to 
understand the instructions of C. 
Mr W has also confirmed hes purchased similar items from C before. So, I think its reasonable for me to assume Mr W had a working understanding of how these codes 
needed to be used. Because of this, I dont think its fair for PayPal to decide that the code 
was working when, on the balance of probability, I dont think it was. And so, I think PayPal 
have acted unfairly when refusing to provide Mr W a refund for this game. As I think PayPal 
have acted unfairly, Ive then thought about what I think they should do to put things right.
Putting things right
Any award or direction I make is intended to place Mr W back in the position he wouldve 
been, had PayPal acted fairly. And in this situation, had PayPal acted fairly, I think they 
wouldve upheld Mr Ws claim. So, hed have received a full refund of the £81.56 he paid.
So far, Mr W has received £7.68 of this from C directly. So, I think PayPal should refund Mr 
W the remaining £73.88. I recognise PayPal have already agreed to refund Mr W £29.99 of 
this, so I think they should add £43.89 to this amount to cover the final game thats been 
contested.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I uphold Mr Ws complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et 
Cie SCA and direct them to take the following action:
Refund Mr W the remaining £73.88 related to the payment he made to C in 
September 2021.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 June 2022.
