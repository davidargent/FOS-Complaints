The complaint
Mr B complains that the purchase price on his finance agreement with Oodle Financial 
Services Limited is incorrect.
What happened
In February 2023 Mr B was supplied with a car and entered into a hire purchase agreement 
with Oodle.
After the agreement commenced, Mr B raised a complaint with Oodle. He said that the 
vehicles purchase price was stated incorrectly because it said £19,900 instead of £19,000. 
Mr B said that this had resulted in him paying an extra £900 to the dealership. He asked 
Oodle to refund him the sum of £900.
Oodle didnt uphold the complaint. It said it couldnt find any evidence of an error on the 
agreement.
Mr B remained unhappy and complained to this service. He said that although the 
documentation states that he paid £19,900 for the car, he actually paid £20,800. Mr B said 
hed received a part exchange value of £900 for his old car and hed also paid a further £900 
to the dealership.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She said the finance agreement clearly stated 
that the cash price of the car was £19,900, and that there had been a part exchange for 
£900, meaning that the credit amount was £19,000. The investigator said that she couldnt 
find an error and wouldnt be asking Oodle to take any further action.
Mr B didnt agree. He said hed contributed £1800 towards the car, £900 part exchange and 
£900 cash. He provided a screenshot from his banking app showing that hed paid £900 to 
the dealership on 25 February 2023.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the hire purchase agreement. This states that the total amount of credit is 
£19,000 repayable over 60 months by an initial instalment of £491.59 followed by 58 monthly 
instalments of £441.59 followed by a final instalment of £491.59. the total amount payable 
under the agreement including the charge for credit is £27,495.40.
The hire purchase agreement states that the cash price of the car was £19,900, minus a 
deposit/advance of £900, resulting in a  credit amount of £19,000.
Mr B has provided a copy of the advertisement for the car. The advertised price was 
£20,800. Hes also provided an invoice addressed to him from the supplying dealer which 
states that the vehicle price is £20,800. Mr B says that he received a part exchange value of 
£900 for his old car and that he paid a further £900 to the dealership.
Ive considered all of the documentation, but I cant see that Mr B has been overcharged 
here or that any refund is due. The price of the car was £20,800. Mr B received £900 part 
exchange value for his old car (£20,800 - £900 = £19,900) and made a cash contribution of 
£900 (£19,900 - £900 = £19,000). The amount to be financed was therefore £19,000.
On the basis of what Ive seen, there isnt an error in the hire purchase agreement and Mr B 
isnt due a refund.
Mr B has made the point that the purchase price of the car in the hire purchase agreement is 
£19,900. He thinks this should be changed to £20,800.
I understand the point that Mr B is making here. However, Oodle has produced the finance 
agreement based on the information it was provided with from the dealership. And Mr B 
signed the pre credit information document to say that the figures were correct.  I cant fairly 
say that Oodle has made an error because it has used the figures it was provided with.
Even if the finance agreement was amended to show a purchase price of £20,800 minus the 
part exchange of £900 and the cash contribution of £900, this would make no difference to 
the current position, because the amount to be financed would still be £19,000. No refund 
would be due to Mr B.
For the reasons Ive explained, Im unable to say that theres been an error by Oodle. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 October 2023.
