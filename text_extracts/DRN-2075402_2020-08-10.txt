The complaint
Mr B complains that Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) acted irresponsibly when 
lending to him. 
What happened
Between July 2018 and April 2019 Lending Stream provided Mr B with eleven loans. When 
they were arranged, all these loans were originally due to be repaid over six months or so. 
Heres a table setting out details of these loans:

Mr B feels that if Lending Stream had done proper checks then he shouldnt have been 
given these unaffordable loans. He told us that he was borrowing to pay other loans and he 
ended up in a spiral of debt. 
Our adjudicator partly upheld Mr Bs complaint. He didnt think hed seen enough to say that 
loans 1 - 4 shouldnt have been lent  but he felt that by loan 5 Lending Stream shouldve 
seen that Mr B was likely having money problems. And by loan 10, Mr Bs overall pattern of 
borrowing suggested hed become persistently reliant on short-term loans. So our 
adjudicator said Lending Stream shouldnt have lent to Mr B from loan 5 onwards and he 
gave detailed directions setting out what he thought Lending Stream should do to put things 
right for Mr B. 
Lending Stream hasnt responded to our adjudicators view letter or to a reminder. So the 
complaint comes to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice, this means that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Lending Stream was required to establish whether Mr B could sustainably repay his loans  
not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence 
calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties. And, in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time while 
meeting other reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Taking all this into account, Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and 
information provided and thought about what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
Lending Stream has told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr B. It asked him to 
provide details of his income and to tell Lending Stream what he normally spent each month. 
And Lending Stream also carried out creditworthiness checks on Mr Bs credit file. 
I agree with the adjudicator that looking at the information it appears Mr B told Lending 
Stream about his income and outgoings and what Lending Stream had recorded about his 
financial situation, it wasnt wrong for Lending Stream to give him loans 1 - 4. 
Heres why I say this.
Given the repayment amounts, what was apparent about Mr Bs circumstances at the time, 
and his borrowing history with Lending Stream, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate 
for Lending Stream to ask Mr B for the amount of information that would be needed to show 
the lending was unsustainable before agreeing the first two loans. 
I think Lending Stream shouldve perhaps looked further into Mr Bs circumstances by the 
time he took out loans 3 and 4, given that hed taken out loan 2 the same day he repaid 
loan 1, and he was now borrowing again without repaying his previous loans so that loans 3 
and 4 overlapped with loan 2. But the combined monthly repayments still looked affordable 
for Mr B and I havent seen anything in the information available to me which shows Lending 
Stream would have decided not to agree loans 3 and 4 had it done more detailed checks or 
taken steps to verify what Mr B had said about his financial situation. 
So I agree with our adjudicator about the first four loans  and as it seems Mr B hasnt 
objected to what our adjudicator has said, then I don't think I need say more about loans 1-4. 
Like our adjudicator, I dont agree it was reasonable for Lending Stream to provide loan 5. At 
this point, I think Lending Stream shouldve realised that it was clear from looking at Mr Bs 
borrowing history that he was likely having money problems. 
I say this because by the time he asked for loan 5, Mr B already had three other outstanding 
short-term loans with Lending Stream (loans 2, 3 and 4). This suggests to me that Mr B was 
finding it hard to get on top of his money problems and his financial difficulties were likely 
ongoing.  
So although the loan mightve appeared affordable, I think that Lending Stream shouldve 
realised that Mr Bs borrowing record painted a picture of a person struggling with debt. And 
despite what hed told Lending Stream about his finances, it showed that Mr B was having 
serious problems managing his money. So Lending Stream shouldve seen that the 
indications were that loan 5  and any further lending, wasnt likely to be sustainably 
affordable for Mr B. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Mr B to see if 
there was a point at which Lending Stream reasonably shouldve seen that further lending 
was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and so it shouldnt have provided further loans. 
I think by loan 10 Lending Stream should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. I say this because:Mr B wasnt managing to repay his loans sustainably. Mr B had been paying Lending 
Stream loans without a break for 7 months in a row since hed started borrowing from 
Lending Stream and he was now taking out his tenth loan  due to keep him indebted 
to Lending Stream for a further 6 months 
hed regularly taken out overlapping loans  in other words, he borrowed more 
money before he had finished paying for earlier borrowing 
Lending Stream didnt necessarily do anything wrong when it loaned again to Mr B 
before hed paid all his earlier loans. But Lending Stream shouldve seen that he 
wasnt making any real inroads into his debt. When Mr B took out loan 10, the 
previous four loans hed taken out were still outstanding. I think Lending Stream 
shouldve realised that Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing in a way that suggested 
hed become dependent on this type of borrowing and he wasnt using the loans for 
their intended purpose as a short-term fix to help out with temporary money problems 
I appreciate that Mr B mostly repaid his loans earlier than the agreed term. But 
successfully repaying his loans doesnt mean he managed to do so in a sustainable 
way. And borrowing and repaying this number of loans early suggests to me that 
Mr Bs finances were not in a stable position. 
I think that Mr B lost out because Lending Stream continued to provide borrowing from 
loan 10 onwards when:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time  
the number of loans was likely to have a negative impact on Mr Bs ability to access 
mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So overall, Im upholding the complaint from loan 5 onwards and Lending Stream should put 
things right.
Putting things right
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr B towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 5 - 11, not including anything it has already refunded.
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr B which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr B originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Pay Mr B the amounts calculated in "A" and "B".
D. Remove all adverse entries from Mr Bs credit file for loans 5 - 9. The overall pattern 
of borrowing by loan 10 means any information recorded about loans 10 and 11 is 
adverse. So all entries about loans 10 and 11 should be removed from Mr Bs credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partly upholding Mr Bs complaint. Gain Credit LLC 
(trading as Lending Stream) should take the steps Ive set out to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 September 2020.
