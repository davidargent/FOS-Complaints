K822xcomplaint
Miss S complains  that FirstRand Bank  Limited  (trading as MotoNovo Finance)  mishandled 
a credit agreement for a used car which  has negatively impacted on her credit file.
background 
In August  2017  Miss S agreed to purchase  a used car from a dealership. The dealership 
submitted a signed application for finance to MotoNovo,  which was agreed. MotoNovo 
provided the funds  for the car to the dealership. However, when Miss S went  to insure the 
car she discovered that the mileage recorded  on the credit agreement  was incorrect and 
didnt match the actual mileage of the car.
Miss S contacted the dealership who informed her that it would be necessary for them to 
submit a second credit application with the correct car details. They  said that the first credit 
agreement would be cancelled. So in September 2017 a second  credit agreement was 
signed and sent to MotoNovo who agreed it and for a second time provided the funds for the 
vehicle to the dealership.
Unfortunately the first agreement wasnt cancelled as MotoNovo says it didnt receive the 
paperwork from the dealership or the overpaid  funds. As both agreements  remained active 
both of the direct debits  remained active  too. This meant that Miss S had two payments 
requested each month from her bank account.  This resulted in two payments being missed 
under one of the agreements.
In December 2017 Miss S contacted MotoNovo and explained she had been  charged twice. 
MotoNovo repaid Miss S one months payment. It tried to make  contact with the dealership  
to arrange cancellation of the new agreement and have the funds refunded  but this was 
unsuccessful.
In early January  2018 MotoNovo sent Miss S a Notice  of sums in arrears  letter  that told her 
the account was in arrears and it was seeking  payment of the outstanding amounts. The 
letter also informed Miss S that the missed payments would affect  her credit file. Miss S 
contacted MotoNovo and complained.  
At the end of January  MotoNovo closed  down the new agreement  and amended  the old one 
to show the correct mileage. But during that month Miss Ss bank significantly reduced her 
credit card limit.
Miss S complained to MotoNovo about  the impact of having two live credit agreements,  with 
one showing  missed  payments and the effect  this had had on her credit file. MotoNovo 
upheld her complaint.  It said it understood the inconvenience that had been caused by 
having two credit agreements in place  for the same car with both taking direct  debit  
payments from Miss Ss account.
MotoNovo confirmed it had unwound  the new agreement and that it would now disappear 
from her credit file as though it hadnt  existed.  It also confirmed that any defaults recorded on 
the original agreement would be rectified. MotoNovo also offered Miss S £200 compensation 
for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Miss S was unhappy  at MotoNovos offer and complained to this service.  She said that in 
light of the distress and inconvenience caused  to her the amount of compensation should  be 
Ref: DRN48330462far greater.  Miss S also said she was concerned that it was even possible that two credit 
agreements could be opened for the same car in such close  succession.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the compensation should be increased to £400. She said 
the business had accepted responsibility and admitted the error  and she agreed MotoNovo 
hadnt acted reasonably.
She said MotoNovo  had acted fairly  in issuing the notice of arrears letter  as the account had 
fallen behind  in payments.  And, as it had a duty to share information about how finance 
accounts were being managed, MotoNovo had correctly passed this information  on to the 
Credit Reference Agencies. But she thought the delay in cancelling  and unwinding the new 
agreement had been unfair.  She noted that Miss Ss credit file now accurately shows  one 
agreement with MotoNovo and that the payments  are up to date.
Our adjudicator said that, although frustrating  for Miss S, she could see how the two 
agreements had been created for the same car. The second proposal had been submitted 
under a separate reference number and MotoNovo had explained that where this happens  
the existing agreement remains live until the dealership settles  the existing finance and it 
remains the customers responsibility to settle the finance. 
She said that, looking at the date the bank had reduced Miss Ss credit limit on her credit 
card, she thought that it was more  likely  than not due to the information placed on Miss Ss 
credit file by MotoNovo. However, MotoNovo having now amended  the credit file, she would 
need to address this issue directly with her bank.
Miss S disagreed with our adjudicators view. She said she thought MotoNovo should:
Provide a full explanation about how two credit agreements could be open in 
parallelfor the same  vehicle
Explain why the dealership took so long to repay  the additional  funds 
Provide a letter for her bank setting out in detail the error that had occurred
Pay a larger amount of compensation
Miss S also says the impact on her credit  file remains as shes  undertaken some dummy 
applications for small amounts of credit, which have all been  declined.
MotoNovo has agreed to the increase of compensation  from £200  to £400. It says it has 
answered the points  raised by Miss S and the letter it provided as the final response to her 
complaint contains  all the information about the error that arose and would be all her bank 
required.
As the parties cant  agree the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its agreed that two credit  agreements shouldnt have been  opened  in Miss Ss name  for the 
car. Its also accepted that having  two live agreements led to Miss Ss account being  asked 
for double  payment each month. This in turn caused  arrears to build up on one of the 
agreements.
Ref: DRN48330463MotoNovo has explained  that the error occurred due to the second agreement  being put 
through under a different reference number. Miss S does not accept that explanation  and 
says this could  be a potential fraud. She is also concerned  that the dealership delayed in 
repaying the funds  to MotoNovo.
While I agree its concerning that this error arose,  I dont have any evidence  this was a 
fraudulent act by any party. And I think that its understandable (but regrettable) that the 
agreements werent  tied together if they had different reference numbers. I dont think  
MotoNovo can provide  a more detailed response to Miss S than it has already done.
MotoNovo says that it cant  answer  why there was a delay in repayment  by the dealership.  I 
understand the funds have now been  repaid. I dont  think I can reasonably require MotoNovo 
to investigate this matter further. It has now closed and unwound the new agreement that 
was created.
Ive seen the final response  letter  sent to Miss S by MotoNovo. This sets out that there were 
two credit agreements in error and that this led to the doubling of the direct  debit payments. 
It also explains that the credit agreement has been  closed and removed from her file and the 
remaining credit  agreement is now marked as up to date. Ive seen a copy  of Miss Ss credit  
file and it is now showing the correct information. I think this letter is sufficient  to explain what 
happened and I dont think MotoNovo can provide  more information. Miss S can provide her 
bank with a copy  of this letter should  she wish to do so. 
I agree  with our adjudicator that due to the timing of Miss Ss bank reducing her credit  limit 
on her card its more likely than not that was related to her credit  file showing two active  
credit agreements with MotoNovo, one with defaults.  I appreciate  that credit limits are a 
safety net and reassuring  in the event of unexpected bills. I think  the loss of this facility  
wouldve caused Miss S distress and inconvenience.
Miss S says that she is still having difficulties with credit, but Ive seen her file now shows the 
correct information.  There can be a number of reasons why someone is declined  for credit. I 
dont have any evidence  that this error by MotoNovo is still having  an impact  on her credit  
file, or is the sole cause  of any problems shes having getting  further  credit
So looking  at the impact this has had on Miss S, Im satisfied that £400 compensation is a 
fair and reasonable amount for her distress and inconvenience. And Im asking MotoNovo to 
pay that sum to Miss S.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above Im asking  FirstRand Bank Limited to pay Miss S £400  
compensation for the distress  and inconvenience  caused to her.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 April 2019.
