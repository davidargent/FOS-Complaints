Complaint
Mr M is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) recorded adverse 
information about his overdraft after it closed his account when he switched to another bank.
Background
Mr M used the current account switching service to switch his current account from NatWest 
to another bank in March 2021. Mr M says he wanted to retain his NatWest account even 
after he opened his new account. But his NatWest account was closed as part of this 
process. As a result of this, the outstanding balance on Mr Ms overdraft became repayable 
in full and NatWest contacted him to let him know. Mr M was unhappy and complained. 
As part of its investigation into Mr Ms complaint, NatWest agreed to pause collections 
activity and it offered to pay £75 for any inconvenience is collections may have caused. But it 
remained satisfied that it was entitled to report that Mr M had an unarranged overdraft to 
credit reference agencies once his account was closed. Mr M remained dissatisfied and 
referred his complaint to our service.  
Mr Ms complaint was then considered by one of our adjudicators. And he didnt think that 
NatWest had done anything wrong or treated Mr M unfairly. Mr M disagreed and so the case 
was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision.   
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered everything, Im not upholding Mr Ms complaint. Ill explain why 
in a little more detail.  
It might help for me to explain that NatWest appears to have acted upon the instructions it 
received, from Mr Ms new bank, when taking the decision to close this account. I 
understand that this was because Mr M opened a new account and used the current account 
switching service. And even though Mr M might not have wanted or intended to close his old 
account, Mr Ms new bank appears to have told NatWest that Mr M wanted to close his 
NatWest account as part of the switch. 
I appreciate that this caused Mr M some inconvenience, especially as led to his overdraft 
being repayable in full at short notice. But while Mr M might have had these difficulties, I 
dont think that this was as a result of anything NatWest did wrong as it was merely acted 
upon Mr Ms request to switch and the notification from his new bank. And, in these 
circumstances, I dont think that it did anything wrong when processing the request.
As a result of Mr Ms request his overdraft became due. I know that Mr M was unhappy at 
being sent letters by NatWests collections department and that NatWest agreed to pause 
collections activity pending the outcome of his complaint. But pausing this activity didnt 
mean that it could report that Mr Ms overdraft wasnt still outstanding or that Mr M wasnt 
over his limit, as it had a duty to report accurate information to credit reference agencies. 
Indeed, Ive not seen anything to suggest that NatWest told Mr M that it would report that his 
account was up to date as part of its discussions on pausing collections activity. 
Furthermore, while Mr M did repay his overdraft shortly afterwards, that is precisely what 
NatWest has reflected on his credit file. So it seems to me that NatWest has accurately 
reported what happened here. 
I know Mr M is unhappy and he believes that NatWest has accepted the issues with his 
overdraft and the reporting on his credit file were down to its errors. But NatWest paid him 
£75 because Mr M was unhappy with the letters he was receiving from collections  not 
because it incorrectly processed the switch or inaccurately reported the status of Mr Ms 
overdraft. 
Given what Ive said already said about these matters and although Ive thought about what 
Mr M has said and why he may be unhappy, I dont think that NatWest has done anything 
wrong here, or that it has treated him unfairly. So Im not upholding Mr Ms complaint. I 
appreciate this will be very disappointing for Mr M. But I hope hell understand the reasons 
for my decision and that hell at least feel his concerns have been listened to.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2022.
