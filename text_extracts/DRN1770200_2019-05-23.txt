K821x#15complaint
Mr W says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr W had 13 loans with QuickQuid. His complaint is about loans 2 to 13. Ive set out some of 
the information QuickQuid provided about  these loans in the appendix to this decision.
An adjudicator considered  Mr Ws complaint and recommended  it be upheld  in part. He 
didnt think QuickQuid shouldve approved  loan 4b or any of the subsequent loans.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC  which  applied  from 
loan 3 onwards)  defines sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
Ref: DRN17702002commitments; as well as without having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. And it follows  
that a lender should realise, or it ought  fairly  and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont  
be able to make their repayments  sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their 
repayments without  borrowing  further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
Our adjudicator thought that QuickQuid had carried out proportionate checks for loans 2 and 
3 and that they appeared to be affordable. He didnt think QuickQuid had carried  out 
proportionate checks for any of the other loans  although he thought  proportionate  checks 
wouldve suggested the lending up to loan 4a was affordable; or that there wasnt enough 
information to suggest otherwise. This included the FlexCredit account (for clarity  the 
adjudicator didnt assign that loan a number and Ive done the same for the sake of 
consistency).
I agree  with the adjudicator about these loans, for the same reasons he gave. So Im not 
upholding the complaint  about loans 2-4a, or the FlexCredit account.
As well as considering  the nature of the checks QuickQuid  carried out, Ive also looked at the 
overall pattern  of QuickQuids lending history with Mr W, with a view to seeing if there was a 
point at which it should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 4b. I say this because:
Mr W had been borrowing from QuickQuid for a year without a significant  break  
between the loans, so it was unlikely  he was using  them for their intended  short-term  
purpose.
Loan 4 was the third occasion  on which QuickQuid had provided Mr W with a new 
loan within days or weeks  of settling a previous one. Although the base  loan (loan 4) 
may have been affordable, when Mr W topped it up twice   increasing the loan 
amount to much more  than his first loan  QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr W was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Ws indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr W hadnt been making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid. His 
last loan (in the third chain in lending  in my table) was taken out about 40 months 
after the first. And each  loan was more than the first  sometimes substantially more. 
So Mr W had paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to QuickQuid 
over an extended period.
I think that Mr W lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan four 
onwards because:
Ref: DRN17702003these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ws 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 4b and all the subsequent loans.
I should add that Ive taken into account the information QuickQuid provided in response  to 
the adjudication. This included the figures QuickQuid estimated as Mr Ws monthly  
disposable income (EDI) for the loans. The figures also include the amounts QuickQuid 
factored in for credit  commitments, based on the credit checks QuickQuid carried out.
QuickQuid hasnt provided the underlying  data for its estimates, so I havent  placed much 
weight on the figures  provided. But in any event, as Ive said above, Im looking at more than 
just whether the loans were affordable on a pounds and pence calculation.  Taking into 
account the pattern of lending  which I emphasise means taking into account more  than just 
the number of loans provided  I think QuickQuid ought reasonably to have realised that the 
lending became unsustainable for Mr W. So the EDI figures  do not change my decision.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loan 4b to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4b onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 4b to 13 should be removed from 
Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. CashEuroNet  UK 
LLC should put things right by taking the steps  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 June  2019.

Ref: DRN17702004Appendix  loan table  and notes
Most of Mr Ws loans were  payday loans, repayable in between one and three instalments. Some  of 
these loans were topped-up; this is where  Mr W borrowed extra funds during the course  of the loan 
agreement, before repaying the base loan. The top-ups are denoted in my table with a letter  in the 
loan no. column.
Mr W also had an open-ended credit facility known as a FlexCredit account.  This allowed Mr W to 
make drawdowns  up to a fixed  limit of £600 and then repay those  drawdowns in up to ten monthly 
instalments.
Ive indicated in the table where there were some significant breaks in the chain  of lending.
