The complaint
Mr W complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) in respect of its handling 
of his refund of a laptop. He wants PayPal to refund him the balance of the price he paid. 
What happened
In mid-January 2021, Mr W bought a laptop through an auction website, E. The laptop cost 
around £900. 
Mr W paid for the laptop by PayPal. PayPal used around £250 from Mr Ws balance held 
with PayPal, and it drew down the remainder of the purchase price from Mr Ws payment 
card. 
When Mr W received the laptop, he began using it and experienced a recurring fault. 
On 7 February 2021 Mr W initiated a payment dispute with PayPal on the basis that the 
laptop was not as described. 
PayPal responded and gave Mr W 10 days to provide evidence of the faulty laptop. PayPal 
required an independent report demonstrating that the laptop was faulty. 
Mr W did not provide the required evidence because he was unable to source an 
independent report during the pandemic restrictions. He sent PayPal screen grabs of 
diagnostic reports which he had carried out using an online service. 
PayPal declined to refund the purchase price, as Mr W had not provided the required 
evidence. 
Mr W complained to PayPal. He said that he should be able to return the laptop within the 
legally permitted time and referred to the distance selling regulations. 
PayPal responded to his complaint and did not uphold it. PayPal explained that as a 
payment processor it requires specified evidence in order to make refunds.
Mr W was not happy and contacted us. 
In the meantime, Mr W made a claim with his payment card. That has been initially 
successful and has refunded around £650 to him. He wants the balance of the payment 
(around £250) to be refunded by PayPal. 
Our investigator did not uphold his complaint. She noted that Mr W had not provided the 
information required by PayPal under its terms of use and so was not eligible for their refund 
scheme. 
Mr W did not accept this view and asked for an ombudsman decision. He repeated his 
concerns that PayPal had not abided by the distance selling regulations as it had not allowed 
him to return the laptop. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have also considered the different roles of businesses involved in this transaction. 
The purchase in this case was made via business E. PayPals involvement was limited to 
facilitating the payment, both from Mr Ws PayPal balance, and from the credit card, and 
relaying this to the merchant.
PayPal carried out this function and had no other role in the purchase. 
It is therefore important to respond to Mr Ws comments that PayPal has prevented him from 
returning the laptop. This is incorrect. PayPal has no role in the sale other than making the 
payment on instruction. Company E and the merchant remain responsible for the sale and 
any return of goods. 
PayPal operates a goodwill scheme in which it may, in certain circumstances, refund 
payments. This scheme operates subject to its set terms and conditions, and in this case Mr 
W did not abide by the conditions in order to help PayPal assess the laptop. In those 
circumstances it is reasonable for PayPal to decline to refund Mr Ws money. 
I appreciate that this will be disappointing to Mr W, but I hope it makes clear my reasons for 
reaching this decision. He is, of course, still free to pursue a refund directly with the seller.
My final decision
For the reasons given above I do not uphold Mr Ws complaint and I do not ask PayPal 
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to do anything further. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2021.
