The complaint
Mr J has complained that TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED reported incorrect 
information on his credit file.
What happened
Mr J had someone elses information displaying on his credit file, including negative 
information such as county court judgements and insolvency.
TransUnion sent Mr J a series of overlapping emails either saying theyd amended the data, 
or saying they couldnt process his dispute, or saying the data suppliers hadnt agreed the 
information was incorrect, or referring him to other organisations such as the county court  
who then referred Mr J back to TransUnion. 
In the end, TransUnion corrected Mr Js file. 
Our investigator looked into things independently and thought TransUnion should pay Mr J 
£200 compensation. TransUnion didnt agree, so the complaints been passed to me to 
decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
TransUnion havent provided substantial evidence to defend themselves, so Ive had to base 
my decision on limited information. And given that TransUnion were aware of the complaint 
by June 2021 at the latest, and given that its now February 2022, I think theyve had more 
than enough time to make substantial submissions to our service.
I understand that the other credit reference agencies were not reporting the incorrect 
information on Mr Js file. TransUnion have admitted they held historically incorrect data for 
him. And it looks like TransUnion were able to correct the file themselves. This all suggests 
that the original error was on TransUnions end. So I think thats most likely.
I understand that this error caused Mr J some real trouble and upset, not least given the 
nature of the negative information that had been put on his file in error. Hes explained that 
he had trouble with credit, and he had to deal with letters and calls from debt collectors for 
debts in this other persons name.
Further, from the emails Mr J has sent us, TransUnions correspondence looked rather 
jumbled and unhelpful. Instead of dealing with the matter as a whole, they sent him reams of 
overlapping emails, few of which were very clear about what they were referencing, and 
whose messages seemed rather contradictory at points. Its also unclear why TransUnion 
sent Mr J to other organisations when it seems they were perfectly capable of correcting the 
error themselves. Mr J was then directed back to TransUnion, so it looks like TransUnion 
rather sent him round the houses.
Lastly, from what Mr Js sent us, it sounds like this took TransUnion some time to fix. 
TransUnion say they corrected things in good time, but they havent provided any evidence 
to back this up.
Putting everything together, it looks most likely that TransUnion caused Mr J some real 
trouble and upset here, both by getting his credit file wrong and by causing him further stress 
when he tried to fix it.
Looking at our guidelines around compensation, I agree with our investigator that its fair for 
TransUnion to pay Mr J £200 compensation.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mr Js complaint, and direct TRANSUNION 
INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED to pay him £200 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2022.
