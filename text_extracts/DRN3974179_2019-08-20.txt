K821x#15Complaint
Ms M has complained about the loans she took out through MYJAR Limited (MYJAR). She 
says the loans were  not affordable and she fell into a debt spiral.  Ms M also says MYJAR 
didnt carry out suitable credit  or affordability  checks.
Background

Our adjudicator felt that proportionate checks for loans  3 and 5 would most likely have 
shown that Ms M was having problems managing her money  and that she did not have 
sufficient disposable  income to repay these loans.  
The adjudicator also concluded that due to the overall pattern of borrowing, MYJAR  
should've stopped lending  to Ms M from loan 6 onwards, as she felt the lending had become 
unsustainable at this point.
I issued my provisional decision on 18 July 2019  explaining why I was thinking of upholding 
Ms Ms complaint about loans 3 and loans 5-8.
MYJAR accepted my provisional decision. Ms M did not provide any further  comments.
My findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
As neither party has provided any further evidence  or arguments  for consideration, I see no 
reason to depart from the conclusions set out in my provisional decision. For completeness,  I 
have set this out below.
Ref: DRN39741792Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when  MYJAR  lent to Ms M. 
The FCAs Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC) is the specialist sourcebook  for credit-
related regulated activities. It sets out the rules and guidance specific  to consumer credit 
providers, such as MYJAR. 
I am not quoting all the specific  regulations  here, because I would expect MYJAR to be 
familiar with these through previous ombudsman decisions, particularly recent  decisions,  
which set these rules out in more detail.
It is important  to note that the FCA didnt, and doesnt, specify exactly  how an assessment of 
affordability is to be carried out but the extent  and scope and the types  and sources of 
information to use needed to be enough  to be able to reasonably  assess  the sustainability  
of the arrangement for the consumer.
In other  words the assessment  needs  to be consumer-focussed.  It is not an assessment of 
the risk to the lender  of not recovering the credit but of the risk to the consumer of incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant  adverse  consequence  as a result of the 
decision to lend.
As set out in CONC,  the risk to the consumer  directly  relates  to the particulars of the lending  
and the circumstances of the consumer. Therefore, a lenders assessment of 
creditworthiness would  likely need to be flexible. That is to say, what is sufficient for one 
consumer might not be for another, or indeed  what might  be sufficient for a consumer in one 
circumstance might not be so for the same  consumer in other circumstances.
Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment  of creditworthiness  to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect  a lender to require more  assurance, the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way.  
Certain factors might point to the fact that MYJAR should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include, 
but not limited  to:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN39741793So MYJAR was required  to establish whether Ms M could sustainably  repay her loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  Ms M could 
sustainably make her repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.  
This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook  (CONC) defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  and without having  to borrow to meet  
the repayments. 
So, it follows  that a lender  should  realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably - if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ms complaint.  
As there is no dispute about loans 1, 2 and 4, it only remains for me to make a decision on 
loan 3 and loans 5-8.
For loans 3 and 5, after MYJAR had completed  the detailed  checks it told us about; I think it 
would have seen  that the loan repayments  were  not affordable. I say this because MYJAR 
told us:- 
for loan 3 
Ms Ms declared  income was £1,300 
Ms Ms expenses were  £500  rent, £100  credit commitments and other expenses of 
£556 after MYJAR applied an adjustment
This left £144 per month to meet  the highest repayment of around  £149.
for loan 5
Ms Ms declared  income was £1,100 
Ms Ms expenses were  £400  rent, £155  credit commitments and other expenses of 
£435 after MYJAR applied an adjustment
This left £109 per month to meet  the repayment of around £125.
So I think MYJAR ought to have  realised from the information it obtained,  including any 
adjustments it made before  lending, that Ms M couldnt afford to repay loans 3 and 5. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MYJARs  lending history with Ms M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ms case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 1-5 of Ms M taking new loans  shortly  
after repaying previous ones. I think that by loan 6, MYJAR  ought fairly and 
reasonably to have  regarded  that pattern as established.
Ref: DRN39741794From  loan 6 onwards  Ms M was provided  with a new loan within  days  of settling a 
previous one. So MYJAR ought to have  realised it was more  likely than not Ms M 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances and that Ms Ms indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ms M wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed MYJAR.  Loan 8 was 
taken out 23 months after Ms Ms first loan.  And it was for 11 times  the amount she 
initially borrowed. 
Over  the 23 month period from loan 1 to loan 8  there were only 18 days  when 
Ms M was not indebted to MYJAR. Ms M had paid large amounts of interest  to, in 
effect, service a debt to MYJAR over an extended period.
I think that Ms M lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ms indebtedness by allowing  her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Ms Ms 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6-8 as well as loans  3 and 5 and MYJAR should 
put things right as set out below.
putting things  right
I understand there is an outstanding debt with MYJAR, if this is the case, redress  should be 
along the following lines: 
A.Add together the total of the repayments made by Ms M towards  interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld  loans without an outstanding balance,  not including anything  
MYJAR has already  refunded.
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Ms M which were 
considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Ms M originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C.Remove all interest, fees and charges  from the balance on any upheld  outstanding 
loans, and treat any repayments made  by Ms M as though they had been  
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Ms M having 
made overpayments  then MYJAR should  refund these overpayments  with 8% simple 
interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would 
have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. MYJAR  should  then refund the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E.
D.If there  is still an outstanding balance then the amounts  calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should  be paid to Ms M. However if there  is still an 
Ref: DRN39741795outstanding balance then MYJAR  should try to agree an affordable  repayment  plan 
with Ms M.
E.MYJAR should remove any adverse information it has recorded  on Ms Ms credit file 
in relation to loans  3 and 5. The overall  pattern of Ms Ms borrowing for loans 6-8 
means any information recorded about them is adverse, so MYJAR should remove  
these loans entirely from Ms Ms credit file. MYJAR does not have to remove any 
outstanding loans from Ms Ms credit file until these have been repaid, but MYJAR 
should still remove any adverse  information  recorded about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to deduct tax from this interest. MYJAR should  
give Ms M a certificate showing  how much  tax MYJAR has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  Ms Ms complaint as Ive explained  above  and in 
my provisional decision. I require MYJAR  Limited trading as MYJAR to put things right for 
Ms M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 September  2019.
