The complaint
Mr M complains that BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited (BMWFS) gave him incorrect 
information (which he relied on to his detriment) when he enquired about voluntary 
terminating his hire purchase agreement (agreement) with it.
What happened
In October 2017 Mr M entered into an agreement with BMWFS for a new car costing 
£31,403.20. Everything else being equal Mr M agreed to make an advance payment of 
£3,597.40, 47 monthly payments of £347.41 followed by an optional final payment of 
£13,897.28  making a total sum repayable of £33,822.95 at an APR of 2.9%.
The agreement allowed for early settlement (voluntary termination) on Mr M returning the car 
to BMWFS and on him paying to it, or having paid to it, £16,911.48 (half the total amount 
payable under the agreement of £33,822.95).
On 27 November 2020 Mr M phoned BMWFS to enquire about voluntary terminating his 
agreement and to establish what he would need to pay to be able to do so. Mr M understood 
from this conversation that he would need to pay £459.91 immediately, or £112.50 in 
December 2020  after his December 2020 payment of £347.41 had cleared his account.
On 1 December 2020 Mr M made his 37th contractual monthly payment of £347.41. Having 
done so he understood  based on his 27 November 2020 call with BMWFS  that what he 
was now required to pay BMWFS, to voluntary terminate his agreement, was £112.50.
On 2 December 2020 Mr M phoned BMWFS to confirm what he needed to pay to voluntary 
terminate his agreement, understanding that it would be £112.50. However, BMWFS 
confirmed it was £459.91. During this call BMWFS agreed to log a complaint from Mr M 
about what he was advised during his call with it on 27 November 2020.
On 8 December 2020 Mr M contacted BMWFS to confirm that he wanted to go ahead with 
voluntary terminating his agreement. On the same day BMWFS confirmed to Mr M that it 
was looking into his complaint logged on 2 December 2020.
On 9 December 2020 BMWFS contacted Mr M to say that following the termination of his 
agreement he needed to pay £459.91 to bring his payments made up to half the total 
amount payable under the agreement (£16,911.48 [50% of £33,822.95] less £3,597.40 
[advance payment] less £12,854.17 [37 monthly payments of £347.41]). Mr M didnt pay, 
and as I understand it still hasnt paid, BMWFS this sum. 
On 14 December 2020 BMWFS collected the car from Mr M.
On 23 December 2020 BMWFS contacted Mr M to say that following the termination of his 
agreement he needed to pay £633.53 in respect of excess miles travelled. Mr M paid 
BMWFS this sum on 12 January 2021. On the same day BMWFS wrote to Mr M to say that 
it wasnt upholding his complaint because it was satisfied that he was ultimately provided 
with correct information about what he would need to pay to voluntary terminate his 
agreement in his call to it of 27 November 2020.
Unhappy with BMWFS response to his complaint, Mr M referred it to our service for 
consideration.
Mr Ms complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that it 
should be upheld in part. In summary he said he was satisfied that Mr M was obliged to pay 
£459.91 to voluntary terminate his agreement, but for being told otherwise in the call of 
17 November 2020 BMWFS should pay him £75 in compensation.
BMWFS accepted the investigators view.
Mr M initially accepted the investigators view, but then decided not to. And because Mr M 
ultimately decided not to accept the investigators view his complaint has been passed to me 
for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I can confirm that Ive come to the same overall conclusion as the 
investigator and for broadly the same reasons. There is also very little I can usefully add to 
what has already been said.
First, I would like to point out Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my 
comments on what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point, its not 
because Ive failed to take it on board and think about it but because I dont think I need to 
comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right outcome. 
Secondly, I would add that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or 
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
Thirdly, I would also like to make it clear that Im not considering in this decision any 
concerns Mr M might have about what BMWFS has or hasnt recorded with third party credit 
reference agencies in respect of his agreement.
Ive seen a copy of Mr Ms account. And having done so I can confirm that Im satisfied that 
after he had made his December 2020 monthly payment Mr M still needed to pay BMWFS 
£459.91 to bring his payments made up to half the total amount payable under the 
agreement and BMWFS is entitled to seek recovery of this sum.
Ive listened to a recording of the call that Mr M made to BMWFS on 27 November 2020. 
And having done so I think that despite what I say above it was entirely reasonable for Mr M 
to have understood that to voluntary terminate his agreement he would need to pay £459.91 
immediately, or £112.50 in December 2020  after his December 2020 payment of £347.41 
had cleared his account. Put another way, Im satisfied that during the call of 27 November 2020 BMWFS 
misrepresented to Mr M what he was required to pay to voluntary terminate his agreement. I 
also accept that Mr M may have relied on this misrepresentation to his detriment by placing 
an order, before 2 December 2020, for a new car  although Ive seen no documentary 
evidence (such as an order form) in support of this.
Now where someone has acted in reliance on a misrepresentation, the normal remedy isnt 
to put them in the position they would be in if the misrepresentation had been true, but in the 
position they would be in if the misrepresentation hadnt happened to begin with. 
If the misrepresentation hadnt been made I accept that Mr M might have delayed his 
decision to order a new car by a month or two and delayed his decision to voluntary 
terminate the agreement subject to this complaint by the same amount of time. But its not 
possible to put Mr M in that position now. So Ive considered what financial loss, distress and 
inconvenience Mr M suffered as a result of his reliance on BMWFS misrepresentation.
I cant see that Mr M has suffered a direct financial loss here. However, I accept that Mr M 
would have suffered some disappointment in realising  on 2 December 2020  that what he 
had understood to be the position, following his call to BMWFS on 27 November 2020, 
wasnt the position and for this he should be fairly compensated. 
Now I appreciate that Mr M might not agree, but taking everything into account I can confirm 
that I agree with the investigator that £75 represents an appropriate sum for BMWFS to have 
to pay Mr M in this case by way of compensation.
My final decision
My final decision is that BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited must pay Mr M £75. And for 
the avoidance of doubt this sum should be paid to Mr M and not offset against any 
outstanding debt.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2021.
