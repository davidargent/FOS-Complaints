K820x#14complaint
Miss T complains that British Gas Insurance Limited is responsible for poor service in 
connection with a home emergency insurance  policy.
background
Final decisions  of the Financial Ombudsman  Service are published on our website. We 
include the full name  of the insurance company  or other regulated financial firm. We dont 
name the complainant or any other  companies  or individuals.  Where  I refer to British  Gas 
Insurance I refer to the insurance company of that name and I include other companies and 
individuals for whose actions I hold that company responsible.
Miss T had an annual British Gas Insurance HomeCare  400 policy.  It covered her central 
heating including  an annual  service.  The renewal date was in the month of April each year. 
Shortly after a renewal  letter and annual service in March 2018, Miss T complained about 
multiple issues. 
Those issues included  a complaint that British  Gas Insurance hadnt done  an annual service  
in the policy  year 2016/2017. 
Other issues  included complaints about the supply of energy by a sister company of that 
insurance company.  The sister company responded and Miss T took those complaints to 
another ombudsman  service.
British Gas Insurance didnt respond  to the complaint  about  the annual  service. Miss T 
further complained  that it had mishandled that complaint.
British Gas Insurance sent a final response on 3 April 2019. It agreed  it hadnt sent out 
correspondence to Miss T to arrange the annual boiler service for 2016/2017.  It said it was 
sending Miss T a cheque  for £80.00 compensation. It said it had offered a 15% discount off 
her cover for the policy year 2019/2020.
The policy renewed  on about 14 April 2019 without the 15% discount  - at a cost for that year 
of £367.89. Miss T was paying  that by direct debit  monthly instalments of about £30.00.
Our investigator didnt  recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She thought  that 
British Gas Insurance had dealt with Miss Ts complaint fairly. She said there is no set fee for 
the annual service. She thought the £80.00 compensation sent to Miss T was fair.
Miss T disagreed with the investigators opinion. She asked for an ombudsman  to review the 
complaint. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It is important  that a central  heating boiler is serviced regularly.  And - unless there is a call-
out for a repair-  an annual service visit is the only time British  Gas Insurance will visit.
But an annual service  requires cooperation between British Gas Insurance and its customer 
so as to arrange a mutually convenient appointment for access  to the boiler.
Ref: DRN73985862The policy also covered  the (risk of) cost of parts and labour for repairs. And that was not 
only for central heating  but also for plumbing  and drainage and home electrics. 
The annual service  represented only a small proportion of the cost of HomeCare. The policy  
terms apply a charge  of £65.00 for an annual service if the customer then cancels the policy.
Miss T had an annual service in January 2016.  And the policy  renewed  in April 2016. At that 
time the applicable policy terms  were those published in 2015. They  included   for 
complaints  a postal  address in Dunstable. The terms also included the following:
When  your annual service is due well send you an email,  letter,  text message or 
call you to arrange it. Well  try to get hold of you up to three times. If we dont hear 
back from you, we wont  make another attempt, but you can contact  us at any time to 
arrange your annual  service
British Gas Insurance accepts that it didnt  send a reminder in 2017. But Miss T couldve  
asked it to do an annual  service, for example  in January 2017 or when it sent her a renewal 
letter in March 2017.  
I find it likely  that it was the renewal letter dated 9 March 2018 that prompted Miss T to book 
an annual service. That was completed  on 15 March 2018. And it confirmed that there hadnt 
been a service since January 2016.
Miss T had  in the previous policy year - paid for a service  she hadnt had. She may also 
have worried that her boiler had suffered from lack of a service.  So I accept that she suffered 
some distress and inconvenience. But theres no technical evidence to show any damage.
After she complained on about  20 March  2018,  the policy renewed in April 2018.  At that time 
the applicable policy terms were those published in 2017. They  included   for complaints  a 
postal address in Winchester.
British Gas Insurance shouldve sent a final response to the complaint within  eight weeks,  
that is by about  mid-May 2018. Its failure  to do so caused Miss T to chase up her complaint.  
Unfortunately she used the Dunstable address and the postal service returned some  of her 
letters in late 2018 and early 2019.
Miss T had another annual service  in March 2019.
British Gas Insurance didnt send any substantive response to her complaint until 27 March  
2019. And  without waiting to hear further from Miss T - it sent its final response on 3 April 
2019. It said it had sent a cheque for £80.00. It also said it was offering a 15% discount  for 
the policy year 2019/2020. And it said the following:
If you wish to accept  the policy discount, please  either contact me directly  on the 
below details, or our Customer Service team on 0333 200 8899 at a time that's 
convenient to you.
Ive seen a letter from Miss T dated 2 April 2019. But I havent  seen any evidence that she 
accepted the discount  at that time.  So I dont find it unfair that the policy renewed again on 
14 April 2019 without  the 15% discount.  
Ref: DRN73985863Miss T brought her complaint to us in early May 2019.
From what  Miss T has told us, she presented the £80.00 cheque for payment before  the 
usual six-month period of validity  expired in October  2019.
At about the same time, British Gas Insurance told us that  from the 2019/2020  annual  cost 
of £367.89 - it was applying the 15% discount  of £55.19.  After  an initial error in calculation,  it 
told us it was writing to Miss T with a revised schedule of monthly payments of £21.44. As 
she hasnt told us otherwise, I find that Miss T is now receiving the benefit  of that discount.
Ive thought about the fact that shes been out of pocket by not having had the discount 
sooner. But as she couldve accepted it sooner  I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct 
British Gas Insurance to pay any interest.
I find that British Gas Insurance treated Miss T unfairly by not sending a reminder  for an 
annual service in 2016/2017   and later by not responding to her complaint for over a year. 
But she couldve mitigated her distress and inconvenience by booking  a service  in 2017.
Overall Im satisfied that the cheque for £80.00 and the discount  of £55.19 (a total of 
£135.19) is fair and reasonable  compensation. I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct  
British Gas Insurance Limited to do any more  in response to this complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct British Gas Insurance Limited to do any more in response  to this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 December  2019.
