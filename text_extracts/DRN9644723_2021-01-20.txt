Ms M says Lloyds Bank  PLC mis-sold her a payment protection insurance  (PPI)  policy.  
background and summary to complaint
Ms M bought the policy in 1997 at the same time as taking out a loan. She applied for the 
loan and PPI policy in branch. 
The policys  one-off upfront  premium was paid in advance  by being added  to the loan (a 
single premium) where it attracted interest  over the term of the loan. The loan was 
repayable over an 18-month  term and the policy term matched that of the loan. Based on the 
loan being for £600, Lloyds has calculated that the single premium is likely to have been 
£99.89, with interest of £15.19 over the term of the loan. So, the monthly cost of the PPI was 
about £6.39.
The policy provided  cover  for Ms M for accident, sickness, unemployment and life  subject 
to its exclusions and limitations. It offered to repay Ms Ms monthly  loan repayment  for up to 
the remaining  term of the loan in the event of a successful disability claim and 12 months  in 
the event of unemployment. 
At the time,  Ms M was employed  as a medical secretary. She has told us she was entitled  to 
12 months sick pay, plus death  in service cover. But she didnt have any other way of 
repaying her loan should she be unable  to work (such as savings). She hasnt indicated that 
he was entitled  to any redundancy pay, so Ive assumed she was entitled  to statutory 
redundancy pay. Ms M has said she was in good health at the time of the sale. 
Lloyds has sent us screenshots to show that the loan account closed in 1999.
Ms Ms representative has made lengthy and substantial representations on her behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have  read and considered  them all carefully. In 
summary, Ms Ms representative says:
Lloyds failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the time.  In those 
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on 
handling PPI complaints  under  DISP  APP 3, it should be presumed  Ms M wouldnt 
have taken out the policy and the complaint should be upheld.  Ms Ms 
representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that presumption;
The policy excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress,  which  are some  of the 
most common reasons people  are off work. This significantly reduced  the value of 
cover;
The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a 
successful claim  meant the policy was of inherently poor value as shown by the low 
claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good  faith means Lloyds should have 
told Ms M about  the poor value;
 
The common law duty of utmost good faith also means Lloyds should have explained 
the significance  of the exclusions  and limitations of cover  to Ms M and the impact  
they would  have had on her chances  of making  a claim; and
Ref: DRN96447232Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint  both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Ms M disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  for 
several reasons.  
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; relevant regulators rules, guidance  and standards;  relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Ms Ms. I dont intend to set that out in 
much detail here, but Ive taken this into account in deciding Ms Ms complaint
This sale took place  in 1997 before the General Insurance Standards Council (GISC) 
published its code  of practice in June 2000  and before the sale of general insurance 
products like this became  regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC code, the FSAs (and 
FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses  and insurance conduct rules (ICOB and 
ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint,  nor is the FCAs Perimeter  guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself concluded  in 1999. That means the unfair relationship  provisions 
set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court judgment in Plevin  about  
s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance made by the FCA about the handling  of 
complaints about  the non-disclosure of commission  in light of the Plevin  judgment,  arent 
applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at that time, which Im satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular,  The Association of British Insurers  General Insurance Business 
Code of Practice for all intermediaries  (Including  Employees of Insurance Companies) other  
than Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. 
The ABI code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries  
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected  of 
intermediaries like Lloyds  at the time. So, Im satisfied I should take the ABI code and these 
Ref: DRN96447233other publications into account  when  deciding, what is in my opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of Ms Ms case.  
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including:  the law relating to 
negligence, contract  (including the express  and implied duty on professional advisers to give 
advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence; the law relating to the utmost  duty of good 
faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness). 
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  Im also required  to take into account  what 
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Office of the Banking  
Ombudsman  might have been expected  to reach  in relation to an equivalent complaint. I 
note that under the Banking  Ombudsmans terms of reference the Ombudsman  was 
required to decide  complaints by reference  to what was, in his opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances   and that the Ombudsman was required to observe any applicable 
rule of law or relevant judicial authority. 
Im also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first issued 
by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating  to the sale 
of PPI. This sale took place before insurance  mediation became a regulated activity, so 
Lloyds was required to take into account the provisions in DISP  App 3 as if they were 
guidance when  considering Ms Ms complaint. 
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me that the key questions I need  
to consider in deciding  what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all circumstances of this 
complaint, are:
-If Lloyds gave advice,  whether  it advised Ms M with reasonable care and skill  in 
particular, whether the policy  was appropriate  or suitable for her, given her needs 
and circumstances.  
-Whether Lloyds gave Ms M sufficient, appropriate and timely information to enable  
her to make an informed choice about  whether to take out the policy,  including  
drawing to her attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading  way  
the main provisions of the policy and significant  limitations and exclusions.  
-If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Ms M, I 
must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Ms M suffered loss or 
damage and what  I consider would amount to fair compensation for that loss or 
damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Ms M and 
Lloyds, Ive decided  not to uphold  Ms Ms complaint. Ive set out my reasoning below. 
Ref: DRN96447234did Ms M know  she had a choice?
Lloyds had to make it clear that the PPI policy was optional. 
Ive seen a copy  of the loan agreement in use at the time of sale. This describes the PPI as 
optional and sets out the cost separately  to the cost of the loan. It also has yes and no box 
for the customer to tick to indicate whether or not they want the PPI. 
Taking everything into account,  I think its more likely that Ms M knew  the policy was optional  
and she agreed  to take it out without undue pressure.  
did Lloyds provide  advice?
Both Lloyds  and Ms M agree that advice was provided during this sale.
 
This means  Lloyds had to advise Ms M with reasonable care and skill, in particular  whether 
the policy was appropriate or suitable given her needs and circumstances.
the advice
I dont know what steps Lloyds took to establish whether the policy  was a suitable 
recommendation for Ms M. It seems Ms M cant remember  clearly what  happened and there  
is no record of what the adviser discussed  in relation to the policy. This is unsurprising  in 
respect of a sale during a meeting. The adviser  likely had some limited information  about 
Ms Ms financial  circumstances,  but there is no specific evidence to show  the adviser took 
steps to establish whether Ms M would have been caught by the significant  exclusions and 
limitations which might have meant the policy did not fully meet her needs. For example, 
there is nothing to suggest  Lloyds considered whether Ms M had any pre-existing medical 
conditions.
Overall, on the balance of probabilities Im not persuaded Lloyds did all it should have done 
to determine whether  the policy was suitable  for Ms M given her circumstances. So, Im not 
persuaded Lloyds advised  with reasonable care and skill.
While Im not persuaded Lloyds did all it should  have done  to make sure the policy was 
suitable for Ms M, I do think its more likely than not that the policy  was ultimately  suitable  for 
her. In reaching  that conclusion  Ive taken into consideration:
-Ms M met the eligibility criteria  for the policy.
-Ms M had a need  for the policy  it seems likely that Ms Ms ability  to continue to 
meet her loan repayments would have been put under strain if she was not working 
for an extended period of time  even allowing for the employment  benefits she 
would have been entitled to.
-The monthly cost of the policy appears  to have  been affordable for Ms M.
-The exclusions and limitations didnt make the policy unsuitable  for Ms M. There was 
nothing about  Ms Ms employment or occupation  which would have made it difficult 
for her to claim.  And she hasnt told us about  any pre-existing medical conditions that 
could affect her ability to claim. There were also no additional restrictions  on cover for 
mental health or back problems.
Ref: DRN96447235-The policy provided for a pro-rata  refund if it was cancelled early,  so the policy  
provided flexibility if Ms M decided to repay  the loan early and cancel the policy.
Ive also considered whether, when providing  advice,  Lloyds  gave Ms M sufficient 
information about the cover provided by the policy to enable her to understand what  Lloyds 
was recommending to her and make an informed decision  about  whether to follow that 
advice and take out the policy.
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not that Ms M was given a broad description of what  the 
policy was intended  to cover (that is that the policy would protect her payments if Ms M was 
unable to work through accident,  sickness and unemployment.)  I have reached this 
conclusion because I think  its unlikely  Ms M would have taken out the policy without  any 
sense of what the policy was. And I think Ms M knew the amount  of the single premium 
being added to the loan,  and the monthly cost of the PPI (as this information  was, in my 
view, sufficiently clear on the loan agreement in use at the time).
But the evidence  from the time of sale doesnt tell us whether  Lloyds  gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit, sufficient information about  the cost  for 
example the loan agreement does not show the total cost of the policy over the term of the 
loan, including  interest - or about  the exclusions or limitations before Ms M agreed to take 
out the policy. 
Overall, having considered the parties  representations about what  happened,  while Im 
satisfied the policy was a suitable recommendation for Ms M Im not persuaded Lloyds did 
enough to present information about the policy it was recommending in a way that was fair 
and reasonable to Ms M. Im not persuaded Lloyds gave Ms M all of the information she 
needed about the policy to make an informed decision  about  whether to follow the 
recommendation and take it out.
Ive considered how my findings interact  with the FCAs  list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out at DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, I am persuaded there  were  significant  failings in this case.
In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Ms Ms representative has raised a number 
of general points in regard  to the requirements on a business when providing information  in 
PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like Ms Ms. Ive considered  
these carefully and summarised them  as:
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Ms Ms representative considers to be poor 
value  and the fact that much of the premium went  to the business  rather than the 
insurer. 
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just 
told Ms M about  the limitations and exclusions, it should have gone further and 
explained the significance of them to her. 
Ref: DRN96447236Im not persuaded by Ms Ms representatives  views on this. The duty of utmost  good faith in 
insurance law imposed a duty on both parties  to the contract  to disclose material facts  and 
not to make  material misrepresentations. While I cant be certain what  a court  would say  I 
think its unlikely a court would  find that this extended to the insurer  having  to disclose the 
claims ratio information or explaining  the significance of the limitations and exclusions in the 
way Ms M has suggested. And taking into account  the law, industry  codes and standards  of 
good industry practice applicable to this complaint,  I dont think its fair and reasonable to 
conclude that Lloyds ought  to have done either. 
What effect did Lloydss shortcomings  have  on Ms M? To what extent  did Ms M suffer 
loss or damage as a result?
Ive found that Lloyds  didnt do all it should have done when it sold this policy to Ms M. So, I 
have gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude Ms M suffered 
loss and damage as a result. To answer  this, I must decide whether  or not Ms M would have 
still taken out the policy,  had Lloyds  done things properly. 
While Im not persuaded Lloyds took the steps it should have done to establish whether the 
policy it recommended  was suitable for Ms M, I have found  that the policy was ultimately 
suitable for her.
In those circumstances it seems to me that, whether  or not Ms M has suffered loss or 
damage in this case primarily depends  on whether, if Lloyds had explained  things properly, 
Ms M would have acted  differently, or whether she would have taken out the policy in any 
event.
Ms M says she wouldnt have taken it out and believes I should presume this to be the case  
given the significant failings identified  above.  Ive considered  the representations of both 
sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
Deciding whether  to follow advice to take out insurance requires the consumer to weigh up a 
number of factors before  deciding  whether to proceed. Effectively the consumer has to 
weigh up the advice to take out the policy, the cost of doing so given the benefits offered in 
return and the potential consequences they will suffer if they do not have insurance, should 
the risks come  to fruition.
The evidence in this case suggests that Ms M had some interest in taking out payment 
protection insurance. By this I mean  when Lloyds  advised her that there was a suitable  
product she could buy that would protect  her loan payments in the event she was unable  to 
work because of accident, sickness and unemployment, she concluded she wanted that 
product. But she made that decision based on incomplete information, meaning what  she 
thought she was getting is not exactly what she got. 
As I explained earlier, Im satisfied from the evidence about  Ms Ms circumstances at the 
time of the sale that the policy was not fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her.
Although I consider it more likely than not that Ms M knew she was borrowing the money to 
pay for the policy and its monthly cost, it doesnt appear Lloyds told her the total cost of the 
policy over the loan term including the interest.  
Having said that, given the loan was relatively small  and interest  would only accrue  over 18 
months, and the interest would not have made the policy cost significantly more than Ms M 
Ref: DRN96447237realised, I dont think it likely the missing  cost information would have affected Ms Ms 
decision to buy the policy in her circumstances. 
Overall, Im not persuaded Ms M would have found  the cost unacceptable if she had been  
given all of the cost information during the meeting in which she agreed to the policy.
In addition, Im not persuaded  Lloyds  made  clear  exactly what Ms M would get back  in return  
in the event she made a successful claim. But I think its unlikely Ms Ms expectations about 
what the policy would pay in the event  of a claim (an amount sufficient to meet  her loan 
repayment) were significantly different to what the policy actually did.
Possibly the most significant differences between what Ms M thought she had bought and 
what she actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to medical  conditions and that Ms M knew about 
or ought to have  known about before the start date of the policy; 
The policy limited, and in some situations,  excluded unemployment  cover  if Ms M 
wasnt a permanent employee;
The requirement that in order to be eligible for a disability claim  Ms M be unable  to 
do her own job, or any other  job which she could  do bearing in mind her knowledge  
and training.
I do accept there is a possibility the limitations and exclusions  above might well have caused  
Ms M pause for thought   and may well have  caused her to conclude  the policy wasnt  as 
good as she thought, and she might have decided not to proceed.  The limitations on the 
cover, when  coupled  with the other shortcomings in this sale, might  have  dissuaded some  
consumers in slightly different circumstances from Ms M from taking out the policy.  
But, the evidence  about Ms Ms circumstances at the time of sale shows  the policy  wasnt 
fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. She was eligible for its benefits and it provided 
cover that, despite its limitations and exclusions, couldve proved valuable  to her should  the 
insured risks have  become a reality. 
I also havent seen  any evidence to suggest she wouldve been caught by any of the 
significant exclusions  Ms M didnt  have any pre-existing  medical  conditions  and she was in 
permanent employment.  So, I still think she had some good  reasons to take the policy  out.
The policy didnt exclude back or mental  health conditions or place  any additional restrictions  
or more  onerous evidential requirements  in the event of a claim on those grounds than 
would have applied  to any other  disability  claim.  And I think  its unlikely Ms M would have  
expected to make a disability claim on the policy without first providing some  evidence to 
support that claim.
If Ms M had known she could only claim for disability if she was unable  to do both her job 
and any other job which  she could do bearing  in mind her knowledge and training, it might 
have played into her thinking  about  what she would have done.  And I accept it may have 
given her pause for thought  although  its possible she may not have been overly 
concerned given that if Ms M was unable (through disability) to carry on her own job, the 
chances that she would be able to take up another occupation would also, in all probability, 
be limited.
Ref: DRN96447238Having considered all of the evidence  and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not Ms M would still have taken out the policy. The policy was suitable  for her, was 
sufficiently close to what its likely she thought she was getting  and provided benefits that 
would help her manage  the consequences  were  Ms M made redundant, or unable  to work 
through accident or disability. In the circumstances I consider it more likely than not Ms M 
would have taken  out the policy  in any event notwithstanding the limitations on cover.
Ms Ms representatives say the rules  about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 3) 
make it clear  that, where  a significant  failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have  taken out PPI, unless  there  is evidence  to outweigh  the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration, so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
Ive thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, Ive found it would be reasonable to conclude there were 
substantial flaws in the sales process. 
In those circumstances, DISP App 3 says it should be presumed Ms M would  not have 
bought the PPI she bought unless, in the particular circumstances of the complaint, there is 
evidence to rebut the presumption. 
Im satisfied, applying DISP App 3, its reasonable to conclude the presumption is rebutted in 
the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking  into account Ms Ms 
circumstances as detailed  above, I consider it reasonable to conclude  the position  Ms M 
found herself in as result of the sale was the same  position she would have been in had the 
breach or significant failings not occurred. 
Ms M believes  the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws in the sales  process 
were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were  highly material and we have failed to give 
proper weight to the evidence  including her own comments  that she would not have taken 
out the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out at DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because  I do not consider, in this case,  that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Ms M in the position  she would have been in if she had 
not bought the policy.  
That is because,  while I accept it is possible that she would not have taken out the policy,  I 
am satisfied  that of the two possibilities, its more  likely than not that she would still have 
taken out the PPI had she been  given clear,  fair and not misleading  information about the 
policy she was buying. So, Im not persuaded it would  be fair and reasonable in those  
circumstances, to conclude Lloyds should pay Ms M compensation, as that would put her in 
a better  position than she would have been in if everything had happened  as it should have 
done. 
Ive also thought about the approach Ms Ms representative  says a court might take if it were 
to find Lloyds had been in breach of its duty of utmost  good  faith.  But this doesnt  persuade  
me to alter my conclusions about  what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the 
complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the circumstances of this case. For 
Ref: DRN96447239the reasons Ive already  set out I dont  think  it would be fair and reasonable to put Ms M in a 
better position than if everything had happened  as it should have done. 
my decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 February  2021.
