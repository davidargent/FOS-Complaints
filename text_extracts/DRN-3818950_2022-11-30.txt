The complaint
Mr C complains about how Arval UK Limited (Arval) administered and managed a hire 
agreement he entered into with it.
What happened
On 30 May 2018 Mr C signed a vehicle order form. This detailed the car Mr C was to take 
delivery of and that, everything else being equal:
he would make 36 monthly payments of £439.98
the contractual mileage was 45,000
excess mileage would be charged at 6.8 pence a mile 
On the same date Mr C entered into a hire agreement (agreement) with Arval for the car. 
The pre-contract copy of the agreement states, everything else being equal, that Mr C 
agrees to make 36 monthly payments of £439.98 (£368.24 plus £71.74 for a total care 
service package). This copy has a recorded contractual mileage of 60,000 and an excess 
mileage charge of 8.16 pence (inclusive of VAT). 
The first customer copy of the agreement (signed by Mr C) states, everything else being 
equal, that Mr C agrees to make 36 monthly payments of £439.98 (£368.24 plus £71.74 for a 
total care service package). This copy has no recorded contractual mileage and no excess 
mileage charge. 
The original (Arval) copy of the agreement (signed by Mr C) states, everything else being 
equal, that Mr C agrees to make 36 monthly payments of £439.98 (£368.24 plus £71.74 for a 
total care service package). This copy has no recorded contractual mileage and no excess 
mileage charge. 
The second customer copy of the agreement (signed by Mr C) states, everything else being 
equal, that Mr C agrees to make 36 monthly payments of £439.98 (£368.24 plus £71.74 for a 
total care service package). This copy has a recorded contractual mileage of 60,000 and an 
excess mileage charge of 9.00 pence (inclusive of VAT).
Between July 2018 and August 2020 Mr C paid Arval the following payments under his 
agreement:
27 monthly payments of £439.99, total £11,879.73
5 other payments of various amounts totalling £116.00
total £11,995.73 
In September 2020, and after Mr C says that Arval (amongst other things) had 
consistently collected 1 penny more per month from him than it should have done 
under the terms of his agreement
had failed to acknowledge the precise agreement terms he had agreed to
consistently used, amongst other things, an incorrect contractual mileage of 45,000 
(rather than a correct contractual mileage of 60,000) when quoting him for an 
increase in the same to 90,000 miles 
failed to pay for a scheduled service on the car that it should have paid for under his 
total care service package 
he took the decision to early terminate his agreement and to cancel his direct debit.
After Mr C took the decision to early terminate his agreement and cancel his direct debit, 
Arval invoiced him for the following: 
 early termination charge £1,288.86 
 excess mileage charge £1,506.26 
 excess mileage charge £816.00 
 total £3,611.12 
Arval then raised a credit note in favour of Mr C for £3,276.63, bringing his early termination 
liability down to £334.49, being 4,099 miles (64,099 less 60,000) at 8.16 pence per mile 
rounded up plus 1 penny. 
Arval then pursued Mr C for the following: 
 excess mileage charge £334.49 
 monthly payment (for September 2020) £439.99 
 monthly payment (for October 2020) £439.99 
 total £1,214.47 
Mr C then raised a direct debit indemnity claim with his bank and the sum of £11,995.73, 
referenced above, was returned to him. 
Arval then pursued Mr C for the sum of £13,210.20 (£11,995.73 plus £1,214.47).
In May 2022 I issued a (first) provisional decision. In summary I said: 
Its clear that both parties have very strong feelings about this complaint. Both parties 
have provided detailed submissions in support of their respective views which I can 
confirm Ive read and considered in their entirety. However, I trust that the parties will 
not take the fact that my findings focus on what I consider to be the central issues, 
and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as a discourtesy. The 
purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The purpose of my 
decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them. 
I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear, or 
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities. Now based on what Mr C has submitted, its my understanding that on early 
terminating his agreement early he believes he should have had to pay Arval the 
following: 
 27 monthly instalments of £439.98, total £11,879.46 
 early termination charge (9 months x £219.99)^ £1,979.91 
 excess mileage charge (64,099 less 45,000* @ 6.8 pence) £1,298.73 
 total £15,158.10 
^remaining months to run on agreement (36  27) x 50% of monthly payment of £439.98 
*60,000 over 36 months miles equates to 45,000 miles over 27 months on a pro rata basis 
Now given that Arval is seeking from Mr C £13,210.20, it has in essence reduced the 
figure I understand Mr C believes he should have had to pay by £1,947.90 
(£15,158.10 - £13,210.20). 
Now I dont underestimate the distress and inconvenience this whole matter has 
caused Mr C, and I accept that he may have suffered a financial loss. But in my view 
an agreement liability reduction of £1,947.90 is as much as I would ever award, even 
if I was to uphold Mr Cs complaint in its entirety. Therefore, I currently see no good 
reason to direct Arval to do anything else in the particular circumstances of this case.
Arval responded to my (first) provisional decision to say that it had nothing further to add. 
Mr C responded to my (first) provisional decision to say: 
he took the decision to cancel his direct debit long before September 2020 
he had raised concerns about the administration and management of his agreement 
as early as six months into it 
he gave written notice that he would early terminate his agreement in July 2020 so 
could argue that he shouldnt have been invoiced for any hire payments after this 
date 
he asked for, but didnt get, a breakdown of the £13,210.20 Arval ultimately decided 
to seek payment of from him 
Arval agreed that he would only need to pay £334.49 excess mileage charge to early 
terminate the agreement and to bring matters to a close, a sum he was happy to pay 
Arval then decided to seek from him payment of £1,214.47 made up of an excess 
mileage charge of £334.49 and two further monthly hire payments totalling £879.98 
(£439.99 plus £439.99) 
for various reasons Arval should have stood by its agreement to accept from him 
£334.49 
his direct debit indemnity claim wasnt defended by Arval 
he has always been happy to settle with Arval, but only at a sum that is fair and 
reasonable 
he doesnt feel the servicing issue has ever been addressed 
Arval is seeking payment of £13,210.20 but £15,158.10 (as quoted in my provisional 
decision) less a credit note for £3,276.63 gives a figure of £11,881.47 
Arval are seeking the payment of £11,995.73 (direct debit indemnity claim) plus 
£1,214.47 (£13,210.20) figures that dont match any contractually agreed amounts 
the agreement (contract) was incorrect and incomplete 
the credit note for excess mileage was for 8.16 pence per mile rather than for 6.8 
pence per mile 
Arval should waive at least one of the further hire monthly charges of £439.98, 
bringing the total payable down to £11,441.49 (£11,881.47 less £439.98) Arval should reduce the sum of £11,441.49 further for the scheduled service that was 
never undertaken but paid for in the £71.74 a month total care service package 
Arvals service has been poor throughout 
he felt Arval should accept from him the sum of £10,000 in full and final settlement of 
his liability with it
In June 2022 I issued a (second) provisional decision. In summary I said: 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Im still of the view that Arval need do nothing further in this case. But in light of 
Mr Cs response to my (first) provisional decision I thought it would be beneficial to 
expand on my reasoning. 
First I would like to point out that the investigator put Mr Cs offer to pay £10,000 in 
full and final settlement of his liability with Arval to it. However, Arval responded to 
say that it wasnt prepared to accept anything less than £13,210.20 from Mr C. 
When considering whats fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account; 
relevant law and regulations, relevant regulatory rules, guidance and standards and 
codes of practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good 
industry practice at the relevant time. However, I would like to make clear that 
although Im obliged to take into account the relevant law when I think about whats a 
fair and reasonable way to resolve this complaint, I dont have to reach the same 
view as, for example, a court might reach. 
I can understand Mr C being frustrated by Arvals administration and management of 
the agreement and that this had a bearing on his decision to early terminate it when 
he did. But this was ultimately Mr Cs choice and the option to continue with the 
agreement for the full 36 months was always available to him. 
I mention this simply because Im satisfied that on taking the decision to early 
terminate the agreement Mr C would have understood, or should reasonably have 
understood, that he would be required to pay Arval (to the extent he hadnt done so 
already) £439.98 for each and every month the car was on hire to him, an excess 
mileage charge and an early termination charge. 
Although Mr C might have considered early terminating the agreement as early as 
July 2020, this doesnt alter the fact that he didnt actually opt to early terminate the 
agreement until September 2020. So, it follows that Mr C would have understood, or 
should have reasonably understood, that on requesting early termination of the 
agreement in September 2020 he would have been required to have made, or been 
required to make, the following monthly payments: 
 27 monthly payments of £439.98 £11,879.46, or 
 28 monthly payments of £439.98 £12,319.44, or 
 29 monthly payments of £439.98 £12,759.42All the agreements provided state that: 
On termination of this Agreement, an excess mileage charge of xx pence for each 
mile travelled by the Vehicle in excess of the Contract Mileage of xx miles (or if 
applicable the Pro Rata Contract Mileage) during the Contract Term is payable by the 
Hirer. [excess mileage charge] 
So, in my view, Mr C would have understood, or should reasonably have understood, 
that depending on how many monthly agreement payments he had made, or was 
required to make, the following would be payable by him in respect of excess 
mileage: 
27 monthly payments payable 
64,099 less 45,000 [27/36 x 60,000] @ 8.16 pence per mile £1,558.47, 
or 
64,099 less 45,000 [27/36 x 60,000] @ 6.8 pence per mile £1,298.73, 
or 
64,099 less 60,000 @ 8.16 pence per mile  £334.47, 
or 
64,099 less 60,000 @ 6.8 pence per mile £278.73 
28 monthly payments payable 
64,099 less 46,667 [28/36 x 60,000] @ 8.16 pence per mile £1,422.45, 
or 
64,099 less 46,667 [28/36 x 60,000] @ 6.8 pence per mile £1,185.37, 
or 
64,099 less 60,000 @ 8.16 pence per mile £334.47, 
or 
64,099 less 60,000 @ 6.8 pence per mile £278.73 
29 monthly payments payable 
64,099 less 48,334 [29/36 x 60,000] @ 8.16 pence per mile £1,286.42, 
or 
64,099 less 48,334 [29/36 x 60,000] @ 6.8 pence per mile £1,072.02, 
or 
64,099 less 60,000 @ 8.16 pence per mile £334.47, 
or 
64,099 less 60,000 @ 6.8 pence per mile £278.73 
All the agreements provided state that:
On early termination of this Agreement the Hirer may be liable for the difference 
between the net resale proceeds of the Vehicle and the ARVAL Written Down Value 
at the date of termination and an administration fee of £25 plus VAT. [early 
termination charge]Mr C says that on early terminating the agreement he understood he would be liable 
to pay 50% of any future monthly payments that would have been payable under the 
agreement had it run full term, meaning he understood the following sums would be 
payable by him: 
 27 months paid/payable  9 to run (9 x £439.98 x 50%) £1,979.91, or 
 28 months paid/payable  8 to run (8 x £439.98 x 50%) £1,759.92, or 
 29 months paid/payable  7 to run (7 x £439.98 x 50%) £1,539.93 
However, what Arval sought from Mr C in this respect, at least initially, was 
£1,288.86. 
Given everything Ive said it above, if I was to agree that Mr C was liable to pay Arval 
27 monthly payments (whether on contractual grounds or on the grounds of what is 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances), then on a best case scenario basis for 
Mr C, he would have been required to pay Arval £13,447.05  broken down as 
follows: 
 27 monthly payments of £439.98 £11,879.46 
 64,099 less 60,000 miles @ 6.8 pence per mile £278.73 
 early termination charge (as calculated by Arval) £1,288.86 
on a best case scenario basis for Mr C 28 monthly payments due gives a required sum to pay of 
£13,887.03 and 29 monthly payments due gives a required sum to pay of £14,327.01 
If I was to agree with Arval that Mr C was required to pay it 29 monthly payments 
(whether on contractual grounds or on the grounds of what is fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances), then on a worst case scenario basis for Mr C, he would have 
been required to pay Arval £15,585.77  broken down as follows: 
 29 monthly payments of £439.98 £12,759.42 
 64,099 less 48,334 miles @ 8.16 pence per mile £1,286.42 
 Early termination charge (as calculated by Mr C) £1,539.93 
on a worst case scenario basis for Mr C 28 monthly payments due gives a required sum to pay of 
£15,501.81 and 27 monthly payments due gives a required sum to pay of £15,417.38 
So, what Arval is seeking from Mr C is £236.85 less than the sum calculated by me 
(above) as being due on a best case scenario basis for Mr C (£13,447.05 less 
£13,210.20) and £2,375.57 less than the sum calculated by me (above) as being due 
on a worst case scenario basis for Mr C (£15,585.77 less £13,210.20). 
But in reality its my view that what Arval could have reasonably required Mr C to pay, 
on early termination, was a sum that sits somewhere between £15,585.77 and 
£13,447.05.
Taking everything into account (including the terms of the various agreements 
supplied) I think it would have been entirely appropriate for Arval to have required 
Mr C to make 28 monthly payments of £439.98, to pay an excess mileage charge of 
8.16 pence per mile and to pay an early termination charge of £1,288.86. 
This means that based on a pro rata mileage of 46,667 miles Arval could have 
reasonably required Mr C to pay £15,030.75 (£12,319.44 plus £1,422.45 plus 
£1,288.86), £1,820.55 less than its now looking to him to pay (£15,030.75 less 
£13,210.20).And on a non pro rata mileage of 60,000 miles Arval could have reasonably required 
Mr C to pay £13,942.77 (£12,319.44 plus £334.47 plus £1,288.86), £732.57 less than 
its now looking to him to pay (£13,942.77 less £13,210.20). 
I will now turn to what Mr C says was a scheduled service that wasnt undertaken on 
the car because Arval refused to pay for the same under the total care service 
package he had purchased and for which he was paying £71.74 a month. 
Ive thought about this very carefully and in my view I think Mr C has made a valid 
point. And taking everything into account I find that Arval should give Mr C the benefit 
of a £200 credit for this. Now I accept that Mr C might feel this sum is insufficient. But 
in coming to the sum of £200 Ive had regard to the fact that Mr C didnt have the 
service undertaken at his own cost and he hasnt said that any other services were 
missed. 
So, on the basis that Arval can reasonably recover an excess mileage charge on a 
pro rata basis and it should provide Mr C with a £200 credit for the missed service 
then it follows that by seeking £13,210.20 from Mr C Arval, in essence, has given Mr 
C the benefit of £1,620.55 (£1,820.55 less £200). 
On the basis that Arval can reasonably recover an excess mileage charge on a non 
pro rata basis and it should provide Mr C with a £200 credit for the missed service 
then it follows that by seeking £13,210.20 from Mr C Arval, in essence, has given 
Mr C the benefit of £532.57(£732.57 less £200). 
Now I appreciate Mr C is likely to remain disappointed. But given that in my view 
Arval has, as a minimum, given him the benefit of £532.57 in seeking from him the 
sum of £13,210.20, Im not persuaded it need do anything more.
Arval responded to my (second) provisional decision to say that it had nothing further to add. 
Mr C responded to my (second) provisional decision to say he didnt agree with it and to 
reiterate and expand on his previous submissions and to add that he paid for a servicing 
package on the basis of 45,000 miles rather than 60,000 miles.
In October 2022 I issued a (third) provisional decision. In summary I said: 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
As I said in my (first) provisional decision, its clear that Mr C has very strong feelings 
about this complaint. But having considered everything that has been said and 
submitted by the parties, including Mr Cs most recent submissions, I remain of the 
view that Arval need do nothing further and it can fairly and reasonably seek 
recovery, from Mr C, the sum of £13,210.20. 
I would also like to reiterate that although Im obliged to take into account the relevant 
law when I think about whats a fair and reasonable way to resolve this complaint, I 
dont have to reach the same view as, for example, a court might reach.Based on what Mr C has said and submitted, Im satisfied that he understood (on a 
best case scenario basis) that he would be: 
1. subject to a minimum (hire) term of 12 months
2. obliged to pay £439.98 a month for each month the car was on hire to him
3. subject to a monthly mileage limit of 1,667 (60,000 miles over 36 months) 
4. obliged to pay, on termination, 6.8 pence per mile for each mile travelled over 
the mileage limit of 1,667 a month
5. obliged to pay, on early termination, the difference between the net resale 
proceeds of the car and the written down value of the car at the date of 
termination plus an administration fee of £25
This means, ignoring for the moment what Mr C says Arval agreed to accept from 
him to early terminate on 28 October 2020, he would have understood that he would 
have been obliged to pay Arval at least £13,831.51 broken down as follows: 
£12,759.42 for 29 monthly rentals of £439.98 for the period June 2018 to 
October 2020 (2 above) 
£1,072.09 for excess milage at 6.8 pence per mile for 15,766 miles* (4&3 
above) 
*based on a mileage in October 2021 of 64,099 miles against a limit of 48,333 miles (1,667 miles x 29 
months) 
And this sum of £13,831.51 equates to £621.31 less than the sum of £13,210.20 
Arval is currently seeking the recovery of from Mr C. 
Ive also calculated the amount Arval were expecting to receive had the contract ran 
its full term to ensure it didnt unfairly benefit from allowing early termination. To do 
this Ive calculated the total amount payable under the agreement with the Expected 
Residual Value of the car. 
The total amount payable was £15,839.28. This was comprised of 36 monthly 
payments of £439.98. Arval has told our service the Expected Residual Value was 
£7,804.17. So, Arval were expecting to receive £23,643.45 if the contract had run full 
term. 
However, the agreement was terminated early with Arval seeking from Mr C the sum 
of £13,210.20. Arval have also informed our service the car sold at auction for 
£9,500.00. So, Arval actually received £22,710.20. 
Because of this I can see Arval made £933.25 less than they were expecting to if the 
agreement ran its original full term. 
Given the above, and given that Im not persuaded the calculated figures of £621.31 
and £933.25 would be less in any other reasonable scenario (for example assuming 
a different early termination date but with say a different mileage charge to that 
quoted under 4 above and with a charge payable under 5 above) it could be said that 
by seeking the recovery of £13,210.20 Arval have compensated Mr C at least 
£621.31. 
I will now turn to the other points Mr C has raised, and which I think require comment 
from me. Mr C says he terminated the agreement early on the understanding he would only be 
required to pay Arval £334.49. Now even if I was to accept this was the case, and for 
the avoidance of doubt I dont, its not the case I can require Arval to stand by such a 
representation.
Where someone has acted in good faith on what they understood something to be 
(because it was misrepresented to them or not made clear to them), the appropriate 
remedy isnt to put them in the position they would be in if their understanding had 
been correct, but the position they would have been in had there been no 
misrepresentation or where things had been explained clearly to them. 
Now I accept I cant say for sure what Mr C would have done differently had he 
understood that Arval would require from him, on allowing early termination of the 
agreement, £1,214.47 rather than £334.49. But I cant see he would have been in a 
better financial position that the one he is in now. 
I will now turn to Mr Cs submission that his service package costs were calculated 
on a mileage limit of 45,000 miles rather than 60,000 and this has caused him a loss. 
But in my view, had the service package cost been based on 60,000 miles rather 
than 45,000, the cost of that package would have been higher due to the expectation 
of more services being required over the 36 month hire period. So, I cant see that 
this, in itself, has caused Mr C to suffer a loss. However, I stand by my (second) 
provisional finding that for the missed service Mr C should be compensated £200. 
So, taking everything into account, Im satisfied that by agreeing to accept from Mr C 
the sum its now seeking, Arval have adequately compensated Mr C for the distress 
and inconvenience this whole matter has caused him and it need do nothing more.
Arval didnt respond to my (third) provisional decision.
Mr C responded to my (third) provisional decision to say, in summary:
he assumed the vehicle order form he signed (dated 30 May 2018) was for a 
contractual mileage of 60,000 miles and for a 60,000 mile total care service package
no consideration has been given to the deposit he paid of £439.99
he paid 27 instalments of £439.99
had he understood that Arval would want £1,214.47 from him to early terminate his 
agreement, rather than £334.49, he wouldnt have early terminated his agreement 
early
it was his intention to keep the car for the full contract term, but because of Arvals 
administration and management of his agreement he felt he had no choice but to 
early terminate it
the total care service package cost was calculated on 60,000 miles, not 45,000, so 
he has paid far more than the value of what he was provided with
his loss in respect of the total care service package (and the missed service) 
exceeds £200
he doesnt agree Arval suffered a loss, on selling the car at auction when it did, as a 
result of anything he did, or didnt do
Arval may well have suffered a greater loss than it did had it sold the car at auction at 
a later date, for example after the full contract term had come to an end
he was provided with contradictory information about the cost of early terminating his 
agreement, causing him confusion
Arval should stand by what it said it was prepared to accept from him to early 
terminate his agreement, not what it might be able to charge under the agreementhe doesnt understand why it would have been cheaper for him to have allowed the 
agreement to run the full contractual term, and pay an excess mileage charge, than 
renegotiate mid term an increased contractual mileage
 if he was to pay Arval the sum of £13,210.20 its seeking the payment of, then this 
means he has suffered a loss
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would like to thank Mr C for his response to my (third) provisional findings. But Im not 
persuaded he has added anything materially new that would lead me to conclude that Arval 
is unable to seek recovery of the sum of £13,210.20 from him. However, for the sake of 
completeness, I would make the following comments.
Regardless of what the vehicle order from said about contractual mileage, Mr C benefited 
from a 60,000 contractual mileage rather than a 45,000 contractual mileage.
Ive had regards to what Im satisfied were the number of payments made by Mr C of 
£439.99 to Arval.
I accept that Mr C might have preferred to keep the car for the full contract term, but the fact 
is he didnt. I also accept that Mr C might have kept the car for the full contract term, had he 
been made aware sooner that Arval would require payment of £1,214.47 from him rather 
than £334.49 to early terminate. But as I said in my (third) provisional decision, Im not 
persuaded this would have placed Mr C in a better financial position than the one he is in 
now.
I remain of the view that £200 represents fair compensation for the missed service. And 
regardless of on what basis the cost of the total care service package was calculated by 
Arval, by allowing Mr C to early terminate his agreement in the manner that it did, it has in all 
material respects only charged Mr C for the total care service package for the months the 
car was on hire to him.
I accept that Mr C might not be responsible for the loss suffered by Arval on it selling the 
car at auction when it did (and that it may have suffered a greater loss had it sold the car 
later) but I never said Mr C was responsible for this loss.
I dont dispute that Mr C was provided with contradictory information about the cost of 
terminating his agreement early.
As I said in my (third) provisional decision Arval isnt obliged to stand by what it might have 
said, at various points in time, about what it was prepared to accept from Mr C to allow early 
termination of his agreement. 
The cost of varying the contractual mileage mid-term isnt, in my view, material to my 
consideration of this complaint. I would also add that I dont think it would be fair or 
reasonable for me, in the particular circumstances of this case, to interfere in what in 
essence is a matter for Arvals legitimate commercial pricing judgement.
I appreciate Mr C believes that he shouldnt have to pay Arval the sum of £13,210.20. But in 
my view this represents, in all the circumstances, a fair sum for Arval to be able to seek the 
recovery of from Mr C for the reasons Ive outlined in this decision.My final decision
My final decision is that in the particular circumstances of this case Arval UK Limited need 
do nothing further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 December 2022.
