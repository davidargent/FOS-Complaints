The complaint
Mr E complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly blocked his account. 
Mr E also complains that NatWest didnt remove the account block when asked. 
What happened
Mr E held a joint account with a third party known as Mrs E. Mr E has told us that whilst he 
and Mrs E had the same name they were not married. In December 2019 NatWest received 
notice that the account holders were in dispute and put a block in place that meant no 
transactions could be completed by either account holder. Account statement show a debit 
card payment was processed a few days after the account block was applied. 
Last year, NatWest dealt with a complaint from Mr E who asked for the block to be removed 
so funds in his account could be accessed. NatWest tried to call Mrs E to obtain consent to 
remove the account block and went on to write to her. Consent to remove the block was 
provided by the joint account holder and funds were transferred to Mr E. NatWest issued a 
final response to Mr E but didnt agree it had acted unfairly or made any mistakes. 
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Es complaint but thought NatWest had dealt with 
it fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else. Mr E asked to appeal, so his complaint has been 
passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr E has told us he doesnt agree that Mrs E had authority to operate the account in 
question. But the account was a joint account in both names, which could be operated by 
either Mr E or Mrs E independently. NatWest has provided systems evidence that shows the 
account in question was a joint account, not a sole account in Mr Es name only. Im satisfied 
the account Mr E complains about was a joint account. 
Mr E has also told us he and Mrs E werent married. Mr E questions how a marital dispute 
couldve been raised if they werent married. I think its reasonable to note the account was 
registered to two people with the same surname. I take Mr Es point that they werent 
married, but I dont think that was an unreasonable view for NatWest to take. And even Mr E 
wasnt married to the joint account holder, they would still have been able to register a 
dispute and ask for an account block to be applied in the same way. 
The account block was applied in December 2019, at then request of the other account 
holder. Im satisfied thats a request either joint account holder couldve taken to ensure 
funds that remained in the account couldnt be used. I note that shortly before the block was 
put in place Mr E opened a separate sole named account and transferred the majority of the 
funds in the joint account to it. But after the dispute was raised, Im satisfied NatWest acted 
fairly by applying the account block. 
NatWest could only remove the account block once both joint account holders provided their 
consent. Mr E complained about the block in March 2021 and NatWest took steps to contact 
the joint account holder by phone. After a letter was sent, the joint account holder consented 
to the block being removed and Mr E was able to access the funds in the account. Im 
satisfied thats fair in the circumstances. I havent seen any evidence of delays or mistakes 
by NatWest. 
Mr E queried why a payment to a local authority was approved a few days after the block 
was put in place. NatWest has explained the delay in the transaction showing on the 
statement relates to the time taken to process the payment. NatWest has told us the 
payment was approved shortly before the block was put in place. There is often a lag 
between payments being made and showing on a bank statement. Im satisfied NatWest has 
explained the delay here. 
NatWest offered Mr E £100 to resolve his complaint. As I havent been persuaded that 
NatWest made a mistake or treated Mr E unfairly, Im not telling it to take further action or 
increase its offer. Im satisfied that £100 is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
Mr E £100. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2022.
