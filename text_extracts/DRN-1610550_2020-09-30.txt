The complaint
Ms K complains about the issues that shes had with a bathroom that she paid for using a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi Capital (UK) plc, trading as Hitachi Personal Finance.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Ms K used a fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi Personal Finance that she 
electronically signed in July 2018 to pay for a new bathroom that was supplied and 
fitted in February 2019;
she repaid the loan in June 2019 (so didnt pay any interest to Hitachi Personal 
Finance) but she complained to it about three issues with the bathroom in July 2019 
(after the supplier had stopped trading);
it arranged for the bathroom to be inspected by an independent expert in August 
2019 and the inspection report confirmed that there was an issue with the bidet (and 
quoted £450 for repairs) but found that:
When opened, the weight of the glass on the rollers means that the door 
closes slightly, however we would not consider that a fault with either the 
manufacturing or installation. Our engineer has tested the mechanism of the 
door and the seals, these all appear to be working well; and:
The shower head drips after use. This is the excess water in the shower 
head escaping due to gravity and is not a fault with the shower head.
Ms K arranged a separate inspection of the bathroom and that report concluded that, 
as well as the fault with the bidet, the shower head was leaking and the shower doors 
were faulty and it quoted £780 for the repairs;
Hitachi Personal Finance paid for the bidet to be repaired using a fitter of Ms Ks 
choice in October 2019 but said that there was no fault with the shower head and 
doors; 
in certain circumstances, Ms K has an equal right to claim against the bathroom 
supplier or Hitachi Personal Finance, as the provider of credit, if theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the bathroom supplier;
to be able to uphold Ms Ks complaint about Hitachi Personal Finance, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the bathroom 
supplier and that Hitachi Personal Finances response to her claim wasnt fair or 
reasonable  and in these circumstances the breach of contract would be that the 
bathroom wasnt of satisfactory quality;
Ms K clearly feels very strongly that the bathroom isnt of satisfactory quality because 
the shower head leaks and the shower doors are faulty and shes provided detailed 
descriptions and photos of those issues;
Ms K contacted Hitachi Personal Finance in May 2019 about repaying the loan, she 
repaid it in full in June 2019 but she didnt complain to it about the issues until July 
2019;
Hitachi Personal Finance has paid for the bidet to be repaired and it has arranged an 
independent inspection of the bathroom which concluded that the shower head and 
doors werent faulty;
I consider that it was reasonable for it to rely on the findings of the independent 
inspection that it had arranged and that its response to Ms Ks complaint was fair 
and reasonable in these circumstances;
other than the fault with the bidet which, Hitachi Personal Finance has paid to be 
repaired, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the bathroom 
wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied and fitted or that theres been a 
breach of contract by the bathroom supplier; and
I sympathise with Ms K for the issues that shes complained about, but I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Hitachi 
Personal Finance to pay for any repairs to the shower head or shower doors, to pay 
any other compensation to Ms K or to take any other action in response to her 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ks complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2020.
