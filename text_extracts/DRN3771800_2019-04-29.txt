Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Ls complaint and thought that loans five and six shouldnt have 
been given. She said that the length of the lending relationship was unsustainable by the 
time Ms L took loan five. 
Ms L didnt  provide any further comments after the adjudicators opinion. Mr. Lender 
disagreed with the adjudicator, so the complaint has been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Mr. Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms L 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr. Lender should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Ms L. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting  that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
Ref: DRN37718002the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer has been  given loans (reflecting  the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that its important for me to start by saying that Mr. Lender was required to establish 
whether Ms L could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular, the customer  should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Having thought about everything, I havent  seen enough to make me think  that Mr. Lender 
shouldnt have lent the first four loans to Ms L. But loans five and six shouldnt have been  
lent to her. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Ms Ls lending history with Mr. Lender,  with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mr. Lender  should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Thats  to say that Mr. Lender should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ls case,  I think that this point was reached by loan 
five, which  Ms L took in April 2015.  I say this because:
Ms Ls fifth and sixth loans were provided  within eight days of her settling the 
previous loans. So Mr. Lender  ought  to have realised it was more likely  than not Ms L 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole that repaying  her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances. It also shouldve realised that Ms Ls indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably, not least because shed opted to repay  loan five over three 
months, and loan six over four months, which were both longer periods than shed 
repaid her loans  for previously. This increased length couldve further made Mr. 
Lender aware that Ms L was having  trouble meeting  her commitments fully.
Ive seen the comments that Mr. Lender has made about  this service checking  Ms Ls 
bank statements to determine whether loans five and six were unaffordable. But as 
Ive already explained, even if Ms L was able to repay those loans  in the short-term, 
the overall pattern of lending shows that the payments  she made werent  sustainable.
Ms L also wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed  Mr. Lender.  Loan 
six was taken out ten months after Ms Ls first. And it was for a larger  amount, and 
Ref: DRN37718003payable over a longer  period of time.  By this point Ms L had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Mr. Lender over an extended period.
I think that Ms L lost out because Mr. Lender continued to provide lending from loan five 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ls indebtedness  by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Ms Ls ability  to 
access mainstream credit, and so kept her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans five and six and Mr. Lender should  put things 
right.
putting things right
I require Mr. Lender to:
refund  all interest and charges Ms L paid on loans five and six;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove all entries about  loans five and six from Ms Ls credit file. This is because the 
number of loans  taken from loan five onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse  in itself.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr. Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr. Lender must  give 
Ms L a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Ls complaint. PDL Finance Limited 
should pay Ms L compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 May 2019.
