K821x#15complaint
Mr V has complained PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA is expecting  him to pay back 
£7,753.40 to his PayPal  account. PayPal debited this amount from his account after 
receiving a complaint  from the buyer  of Mr Vs watch.
background
Mr V sold an expensive  watch through  an online  marketplace in January  2018.  He sent this 
after hed received the funds  £7.753.40  into his PayPal account. The buyer  had 
messaged Mr V that hed forgot to change the address on his account and could Mr V send 
the watch to a revised address. Mr V did this. The buyer complained  to PayPal theyd  not 
authorised this payment. PayPal reversed the payment from Mr Vs PayPal account,  
although by that stage  Mr V had already transferred the money elsewhere.
PayPal expected Mr V to make good  the loss in his account. They told him he wouldnt get 
PayPal Seller Protection under their rules as hed sent the watch  to a different address  than 
the one on the transaction details.  Mr V brought his complaint to the ombudsman service.
Our investigator reviewed  the evidence. He specifically asked PayPal  for evidence of their 
investigation into the buyers claim  that the payment  was unauthorised. PayPal was unwilling 
to share  any (even redacted) information as they stated it would be against data protection  
rules. They confirmed they reserve the right to reverse payments at our discretion . They 
felt as Mr V had sent the watch to an alternative  address, the fault lay with him.
Mr V provided copies of his messages  with the buyer and evidence  showing the watch  was 
genuine.
Our investigator felt in the absence of any evidence from PayPal,  he wasnt able to ascertain 
whether PayPal had acted fairly  in relying on Mr Vs lack of Seller Protection. He asked them 
to re-set Mr Vs PayPal account  at zero.
Whilst Mr V accepted this view, PayPal didnt. Mr Vs complaint has been  referred  to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached roughly the 
same conclusion as our investigator. Ill explain why.
I can firstly confirm  I have reviewed PayPals Seller Protection and their eligibility criteria. 
Theres no doubt this states goods  should be sent to the address on the transaction details. 
And Ive reviewed the transaction details, along  with Mr Vs tracking details, when he sent 
the watch. The watch was sent to another address.
So Ive considered this in the context of what  Mr V was told by what  appeared to be a 
genuine PayPal  user. Mr V has shared those messages. From  what Ive seen the correct ID 
information is all there.  The buyer  told Mr V of a revised address, clearly  implying  that theyd 
recently changed address and not had time to update their PayPal  account  details.
In the light of what we know  about  fraud,  this obviously  sounds dodgy but I dont think theres 
any reason Mr V would  necessarily know this. In fact hes confirmed to us that hed 
Ref: DRN66546942understood PayPal  accounts couldnt  be hacked so why would he think anyone but the 
genuine buyer was in touch with him.
Ive considered PayPals statement that the buyer told them  the payment from their account  
was unauthorised.  They therefore had no choice but to refund their buyer. And if this was the 
case I agree  they would have had to do this. But unfortunately PayPal is unwilling to share 
the evidence of their investigation with us. So Im unable to assess  whether Mr V was the 
victim of a scam and at the same time the buyers  account that was compromised. Or 
whether the buyer themselves were part of the scam  to get Mr Vs watch without paying for 
it.
This information would  overall have a bearing  on whether I think it would be fair for PayPal to 
rely on exclusions within their Seller Protection.  In the absence  of this information, I have 
considered what  our rules  allow. The Financial  Conduct Authority Handbook on Dispute 
Resolution: Complaints under DISP  3.5.9 states:
The Ombudsman  may:
(3) reach a decision  on the basis of what  has been  supplied and take account of the failure 
by a party to provide information requested;
Taking all this into account I believe PayPal need to take action to put things right. I think  its 
fair and reasonable they re-set Mr Vs account back to zero  as it was on 22 January 2018.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is to instruct  PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
restore the balance  of Mr Vs PayPal  account to zero with effect from the date they 
first took the money from his account;  and
stop pursuing Mr V for repayment of £7,753.40.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 November  2019.
