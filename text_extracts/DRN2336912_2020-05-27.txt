K820x#14complaint
Miss L complained about a number of loans she took out through a company called Elevate 
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Miss L says she was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems.
background
We now know that Miss L took out 8 loans  from Sunny between July 2015 and November 
2016. Ive enclosed a summary  of her borrowing with Sunny, based on the information  it 
provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
I issued a provisional decision (summary attached) in March  2020 about this case,  
comprehensively setting  out why I was considering  not upholding  the complaint. I asked both 
parties to provide any further submissions or information to me within one month.  
my findings
Ive now reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments  to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Neither party has added anything new. Theres therefore no reason for me to change  the 
findings I previously  set out. Im very sorry to disappoint Miss L.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold this complaint or direct Elevate Credit  
International Limited to pay any compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I am required to ask Miss L to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 June 2020.

Ive considered the relevant  information about this complaint. Based on what  Ive seen so far Im 
thinking about  changing  what our adjudicator recommended. Unless  the information  changes my 
mind, my final decision is likely to be along the following lines. Final decisions will be published on our 
website. So that the consumer cant be identified, Ill call her Miss L.
complaint
Miss L complained about  a number of loans  she took out through  a company  called Elevate Credit  
International Limited, trading  at the time as Sunny. Miss L says she was lent to irresponsibly and the 
loans caused her financial  problems.
To keep things simple,  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know  that Miss L took out 8 loans  from Sunny between July 2015 and November 2016. Ive 
enclosed a summary  of her borrowing with Sunny,  based on the information it provided to us. It can 
be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  into the complaint and said they thought it should  be upheld,  but only 
in respect of loan number 8. Sunny didnt agree with the adjudicators view so its therefore come to 
me for an ombudsmans  decision.  
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  Ive 
followed this approach when  thinking about Miss Ls complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure that Miss L could  repay the 
loans she was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to have  taken into account  a range  
of different factors, such as the amount being lent, the total repayment amount and the consumers 
income and expenditure.  
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate. However,  certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should have 
fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for her. These include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during which 
a customer has been given  loans  (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that 
the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point,  as in this case, where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates  that the lending was unsustainable.  So Sunny was required to establish  whether  
Miss L could sustainably  repay the loans, not just whether  the loan payments were  affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.
Ref: DRN23369123Of course, the re-payments  being affordable on this basis  might be an indication  that Miss L could 
sustainably make  them.  But it doesnt automatically follow  that this is the case. This is because the 
relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular, the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments 
as well as without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. So, it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought to have fairly and reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if they are unlikely  to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Ive looked at this lending as 2 separate chains because there  was a significant  time gap in the 
middle, between loans 4 and 5. For the first chain   loans 1 to 4  I dont think  theres any reason  to 
uphold the complaint. Im sorry about that, but bearing  in mind what Ive said above about the length 
of the lending relationship, I think the checks which  Sunny most likely  carried for loans 1 to 4 would 
have been quite basic ones.  However, I think they were also probably  proportionate to the lending  
thus far, which was for moderate amounts. The checks wouldnt have revealed an obvious reason  not 
to lend to Miss L and her self-declared income  and expenditure seemed to support the borrowing she 
had asked for on all 4 occasions. I therefore dont think Sunny would have suspected she might have 
any problems paying the loans back.
As I said, for loan numbers 5 to 8, there was a time gap in the middle. So its fair for me to start the 
above process again. I think  the financial checks would have been basic ones again, but still 
proportionate to the lending  for loans 5 to 8. 
Nor do I agree that we should uphold loan 8. Thats because I cant  really see any reason to  loans 
5, 6 and 7 were  all paid off early and loan 8 amount reduced in value (compared to many of the 
previous loans) to £150. Also, because loan 8 was only ever outstanding on its own,  and the 
payments were scheduled  over 6 months, the monthly repayment  does seem to be well within  what 
Miss L said was affordable for her. I accept that by loan 8 Miss L may have had other debts, but I 
dont think the types of checks Sunny would have carried out would have necessarily showed these  
issues. Because I dont think the checks were inappropriate, Im not thinking about  upholding  the 
complaint about loan 8. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Miss L.
my provisional  decision
I am not intending to uphold Miss Ls complaint for loans 1 to 8 or direct Elevate Credit International 
Limited to pay anything  back  to her. I will consider any further information  from either party, providing I 
get it by 25 April 2020.  Sometime after that Ill issue a final decision.
