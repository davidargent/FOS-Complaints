The complaint
Mrs R complains about the way that some replacement windows and doors, that she paid for 
using a fixed sum loan agreement with First Home Finance Limited, were sold to her. Shes 
being represented in her complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mrs R entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with First Home Finance that she signed in 
June 2016 to pay for some replacement windows and doors. The price of the windows was 
shown as £8,700, Mrs R paid a deposit of £3,100 so the loan was for £5,600 which she 
agreed to repay by 120 monthly instalments of £101.56. Mrs R had also signed the 
suppliers purchase order  but she did that in February 2016. 
The supplier has stopped trading and Mrs Rs representative complained to First Home 
Finance in October 2019 about the way that the replacement windows and doors and the 
loan agreement were sold to her. It said that the loan agreement was fully explained to 
Mrs R, with no pressure for her to take the finance, four months after the original sale took 
place. It says that Mrs R chose to proceed with the loan and it doesnt accept that it failed to 
meet the required standards. Mrs R wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this 
service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She considered 
First Home Finances response to Mrs Rs claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974. She said that she was unable to agree that First Home Finance had acted unfairly 
by declining Mrs Rs section 75 claim so she was unable to agree that it needed to do 
anything more in response to her claim.
Mrs Rs representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. Her representative says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
the supplier was taken to court in June 2016, and convicted in June 2017, of using 
high-pressure sales tactics but continued to use banned sales practices and First 
Home Finance would have been aware of that;
the sales contract and credit agreement show completely different figures; and 
the documentation used by First Home Finance breaches section 61 (1) of the 
Consumer Credit Act because its not accurate or in line with the sales contract 
signed by Mrs R.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mrs R used credit provider by First Home Finance to pay for the replacement 
windows and doors and, in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an 
equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit 
if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Rs complaint about First Home Finance, I must be satisfied 
that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the 
replacement windows and doors and that First Home Finances response to her 
claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the 
outcome of Mrs Rs claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mrs R signed the suppliers purchase order form which showed an order price of 
£13,597.38 for some replacement windows and doors and that a lifestyle account 
had been arranged for her which gave a subsidy of £1,821 so reduced the cost to 
£11,875.28  it also shows that she paid a deposit of £100 (and it said that if she 
chose not to take that account she wouldnt qualify for the subsidy and the cost would 
be £13,597.38); 
Mrs R also signed a portfolio agreement and subsidy analysis in which she agreed to 
participate in a portfolio promotion order and it set out the two year fixed cost of the 
windows and doors as £18,212 from which a total marketing subsidy of £6,336.72 
was deducted to give a portfolio price of £11,875.28  which is the amount set out on 
the order form;
Mrs R signed the fixed sum loan agreement in June 2016 and First Home Finance 
provided her with a loan of £5,600  that was a different amount to the cost price set 
out in the purchase order and was about four months after shed signed the purchase 
order  none of First Home Finance, Mrs R or her representative has explained that 
difference but Mrs R signed the loan agreement so the loan amount must have been 
acceptable to her at that time  and she repaid the loan in June 2017 without 
complaining about the amount of the loan and didnt complain to First Home Finance 
until more than two years later;
Mrs Rs representative says that the loan agreement isnt accurate so doesnt comply 
with section 61(1) of the Consumer Credit Act  but I consider it to be more likely 
than not that in June 2016 Mrs R wanted a loan of £5,600 and Im not persuaded that 
its likely that the loan agreement would be found not to comply with section 61(1) 
and or that it wasnt properly executed (but that would be for a court to decide);
First Home Finance has provided detailed information about the credit and 
affordability assessment that it conducted before the loan was made to Mrs M  and I 
dont consider that Mrs M or her representative has provided evidence to show that 
the loan was unaffordable for her or shouldnt have been made to her  and Mrs M 
repaid the loan in June 2017 and her account was closed;
the windows were installed and Mrs R signed a completion and satisfaction note in 
November 2016 to confirm that the work had been undertaken to her complete 
satisfaction so she received the replacement windows that shed agreed to pay for;
shes complained about the sales tactics that were used by the supplier but she 
agreed to pay for the replacement windows and doors that were described on the 
purchase order which included the subsidies that were shown on the order form and 
the portfolio agreement and subsidy analysis  and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the supplier misrepresented the windows or the loan 
agreement to Mrs R at that time or that the supplier used sales tactics which would 
cause First Home Finance to have any liability to Mrs R under section 75;
the order form said that the supplier would accept a cancellation of the contract if it 
received notice in writing within 7 days and the loan agreement said Mrs R could withdraw from the loan agreement within 14 days  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mrs R tried to cancel the order or withdraw from the loan within those 
periods  and her complaint wasnt made to First Home Finance until October 2019  
about three years after the windows and doors had been installed and if she wasnt 
happy with the way that the windows had been sold to her I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect her to have complained soon after she signed the order form;
Mrs Rs representative has provided a report about some legal proceedings against 
the supplier in which it was convicted of using high-pressure sales tactics  but it 
hasnt provided a copy of the court judgment so Ive not been able to fully consider 
those proceedings  but those legal proceedings arent enough to show that the 
supplier used those high-pressure sales tactics when selling the windows and doors 
to Mrs R;  
I sympathise with Mrs R for the way that she clearly feels about her dealings with the 
supplier, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier; and
I consider that First Home Finances response to her section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for 
me to require it to end the loan agreement, to refund to Mrs R any of her monthly 
payments, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2022.
