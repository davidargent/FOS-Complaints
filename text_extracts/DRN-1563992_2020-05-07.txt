The complaint
Miss H complains that NewDay Ltd ("NewDay") unfairly closed her account and added non-
payment markers to her credit file.
What happened
Miss H had an account with NewDay. In July 2019, the balance on the account exceeded 
the agreed limit. As no payments had been received on the account until October 2019, it 
was closed and reference to the closure and non-payments were added to Miss H's credit 
file.
Miss H was unhappy about this. She said she hadn't received the default notice explaining 
what would happen if she didn't make a payment. And she also said that when spoke to 
NewDay on the phone, she'd been told that the account would not be defaulted if she made 
a payment at the end of October. She also said she'd made them aware of health and 
financial issues which made it difficult to make a payment.
NewDay rejected her complaint. It said its records showed it had informed Miss H on several 
occasions that her account was over the agreed limit and what would happen if she didn't 
make a payment. It also said it had no record of her being told a payment at the end of 
October would mean that the account wasn't closed. 
Miss H wasn't satisfied with this response and brought her complaint to this service. Our 
investigator didn't think NewDay had done anything wrong. He said the evidence available to 
him was that NewDay did give Miss H sufficient notice of the consequences of not making 
payments to the account. He also didn't think the phone calls referred to by Miss H did 
indicate she'd been told she could pay at the end of October, or that NewDay should have 
known from this that she was unable to make a payment. Miss H didn't accept this, and has 
asked for an ombudsman's decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss H argues that NewDay didn't tell her it would close the account if she failed to make a 
payment, and that it had agreed not to close the account if she made a payment by the end 
of October 2019. NewDay disputes this. So this is what I need to decide.
I can see from the evidence provided by NewDay that a default notice was sent to Miss H's 
address towards the end of September 2019. I'm aware Miss H says she didn't receive this 
but NewDay's shown it did send the letter. It's our service's normal position that where 
evidence of posting can be provided, it's reasonable for the sender to assume it's been 
received.
The notice itself details the amount that needs to be paid, and gives a date in mid-October 
2019 that the payment must be made by. The notice also clearly sets out the consequences if this payment isn't made, including that the account will be closed and details may be 
shared with credit reference agencies. 
So I'm satisfied that Miss H was aware that the account was over its limit, and that she 
hadn't made the required payments. I also consider that NewDay had explained what 
needed to be done to prevent the account being closed and a default recorded.
After the default notice was sent, Miss H spoke to NewDay twice in one day at the beginning 
of October. This was before the payment deadline. In the first call, which was made by 
NewDay to Miss H, she said she was struggling financially. NewDay's representative began 
to ask her further questions but due to a poor quality line, it was agreed NewDay would call 
Miss H back.
Miss H spoke to NewDay later the same day. She agreed she was aware the account 
balance was over the agreed limit. She explained she'd left her job and was doing agency 
work, as well as studying. She said she thought she could make a payment towards the end 
of the month. NewDay's representative asked questions about her situation, but before any 
definite answers were given or a plan discussed, Miss H said she was unable to talk further 
and would call back. There's no record of any further call made by Miss H to NewDay before 
the account was closed.
It's important to note here what wasn't said in either call with NewDay. There was no 
agreement that the account would not be closed, or that Miss H could make a payment after 
the deadline which was contained in the default notice. I can't agree with Miss H's 
characterisation of this call to both NewDay and our service that she'd said she would make 
a payment by the end of October and that NewDay had said this was acceptable, and the 
account would not be closed. I can't agree that she could reasonably have assumed from 
this phone call that NewDay had agreed she could make a payment at the end of October. 
She'd said she was going to call back, at which time she would have expected to discuss her 
situation and ability to make payments further. I've not seen any explanation for why she 
didn't do this.
Similarly, Miss H did tell NewDay in her telephone calls that she was having difficulty making 
payments. She referenced her employment , but I can't see that she said her health was 
having an impact on her financial situation. But it's also apparent that NewDay were asking 
questions so it could look at options to assist Miss H. But it was unable to gain enough 
information from Miss H in either call to get to a point where such matters could be 
discussed. And Miss H had said she'd call back to discuss this further, but didn't do so.
So, in the absence of any agreement with Miss H, I'm not persuaded that NewDay acted 
unfairly in closing the account when no payment was received. I'm also satisfied it had made 
Miss H aware that the account limit had been exceeded and she needed to make payments. 
And as she hadn't made the payment, and the account had been closed, it was entitled to 
inform credit reference agencies about this. 
My final decision
It's my final decision not to uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 June 2020.
