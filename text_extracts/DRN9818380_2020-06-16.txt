K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that a hire purchase agreement, under which  he was supplied  with a new 
car, was mis-sold  to him by Sytner  Cars Limited.  
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus  on giving the reasons for 
my decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
before  the car was supplied  to Mr M a demands and needs questionnaire and 
statement was completed and he signed  a pre-contractual explanation checklist  to 
confirm that hed received pre-contract credit information, an explanation of the 
features of the finance agreement and an opportunity to ask questions about it;
he also signed a hire purchase agreement  which was clearly headed as being  a 
hire-purchase agreement  which set out the terms on which the car was being 
supplied to him and he agreed  to make 48 monthly  payments of £958 and a final 
payment of £37,667.50 for the car;
Mr M says that he wasnt clearly informed of the benefits to him of this agreement  or 
the differences between this agreement and the other finance options that were 
available to him  and he says that he wouldnt have signed  the agreement  if hed 
known that there was a risk that the value  of the car would  be less than the final 
payment;
I consider that the evidence that Sytner  Cars has provided shows  that Mr M was 
given enough  information about the agreement that he was signing and that the final 
payment of £37,667.50 was clearly  set out in the agreement  and there  was no 
provision in the agreement that said that the value of the car at the time of the final 
payment would be more than the amount of the final payment;
if Mr M wasnt happy with the terms of the agreement  or wanted  the car to be 
provided to him on a different  basis   I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
him not to have  signed the agreement;  
in its final response  letter, Sytner  Cars said that it had agreed to pay Mr M £38,000 
for the car so that he could settle  the outstanding balance  under the agreement  of 
£37,742.65 - giving him £257.35 of equity;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that Sytner Cars  has acted 
incorrectly in its dealings  with Mr M or that the agreement was mis-sold to him; and
Ref: DRN98183802I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Sytner Cars to pay any compensation  to Mr M  or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 July 2020.
