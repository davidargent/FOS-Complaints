K821x#15complaint
Mr E complains about the short  term loans he took out with CashEuroNet  UK LLC trading as 
QuickQuid. Mr E says he was in financial difficulty when QuickQuid approved  the loans. He 
says he was borrowing  from many  other  lenders at the time. And it should  have been 
apparent from the volume and frequency of the loans that he took that this was the case.  He 
thinks QuickQuid shouldnt have  approved  the later loans.
background
Mr E took out nine payday loans between  May 2016 and December 2017. He increased the 
amounts he borrowed  for loans 2 to 4 and 7 to 9. And Mr E also, at times, increased  the time 
needed to repay the loans. Some of the information  QuickQuid has given us is shown in the 
table below:

QuickQuid has looked at Mr Es complaint and said that it shouldnt be upheld. It said that it 
did appropriate checks for all of the loans. And these checks  showed  that the lending was 
affordable based  on Mr Es declared  monthly income. It also said Mr E wasnt dependent  on 
short term lending and it wasnt  aware of any financial hardship that Mr E mayve been 
facing
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Es complaint.  He recommended  that QuickQuid  refund 
the interest and charges that he paid on loans 5 to 9. QuickQuid didnt agree with this 
recommendation and so the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Ref: DRN60404912Having done so, Ive decided to partially  uphold Mr Es complaint. Having reviewed  the 
evidence I have available I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  given Mr E loans 5 to 9. Ill 
explain why.
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Mr E and QuickQuid said. He thought  Mr Es 
complaint should  be partially upheld. He thought that QuickQuid had made  proportionate 
checks for loans 1 to 4. So he thought  that QuickQuids decisions to lend were  reasonable 
for these  loans. 
He didnt think that QuickQuid had made proportionate checks  for loans 5 to 9. He thought if 
it had then it wouldnt have agreed to lend Mr E money for these loans. This is because he 
didnt think that Mr E could afford the repayments.  And QuickQuid wouldve seen this had it 
completed better checks.  
QuickQuid commented  briefly on our adjudicators findings about the affordability of the 
loans. It noted  that Mr E only had a few repayment problems and he repaid some  of the 
loans early. It also said that:
 In response to FOS assessment which recommends QuickQuid uphold loans which  
were funded after March 2015, we regret to inform you that we cannot  agree to FOS 
recommendations. Please note that in QuickQuids initial  response  to FOS we provided  
detailed information  indicating why the loans were responsibly lent to Mr E. 
 In its business submissions to us it said:
We started implementing changes to affordability assessment in June  2014  and all the 
changes were completed by Feb 28th 2015. Starting 1st March  2015 which  was before Mr E 
borrowed these loans,  QuickQuid had implemented an affordability review that is consistent 
with the FCA Handbook  and that was in place  at the time we received authorisation by the 
FCA. We confirm  that this assessment was conducted properly and individually for these 
loansIt provided further detail  about the checks it had made when it approved  loans from 2015  
onwards in a document called CEU  Lending Criteria  and Proportional Checks.
And this response  didnt  change our adjudicators opinion.
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument  directly and through 
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to expand on this point any further here, though  I 
have considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. 
Turning to the specifics of Mr Es complaint.  The FCA was the regulator  at the time Mr E 
borrowed the loans  in question. Bearing in mind  the rules and guidance  set out in its 
Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), I would  expect 
a lenders affordability assessment to vary with circumstance.  (I am not quoting the specific 
regulations here because, as before, I would expect  QuickQuid to be conversant  with these 
through previous ombudsman decisions, particularly recent decisions, which set these out in 
detail.) 
Ref: DRN60404913In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher  the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
Mr E didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion about loans 1 to 4. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr E had with QuickQuid. 
So they are something  I will take into account when considering the other loans he took.
QuickQuid says: 
it recorded Mr Es monthly income  as £3,580 for loans  1 and 2 and £4,200 for the 
remainder of the lending
it recorded his monthly expenditure as £1,925  for all of the lending
it said it validated, and changed,  the other credit commitments  part of the  
information Mr E had provided using credit reference agency data
why I dont  think QuickQuids checks were  proportionate for loans 5 to 9
Ive carefully thought  about what QuickQuid and Mr E have provided and what  both sides  
have said. 
By the time Mr E took loan 5 hed had a lending relationship with QuickQuid for over ten 
months. Albeit, with a gap of a few months between  loans 1 and 2 and loans 2 and 3. And it 
looks like Mr E was having problems repaying  his loans  as he increased  and extended  loans 
2 and 3. And the amount  he borrowed for loan 5, £850, was much higher than his previous  
loans
So I think QuickQuid couldve realised by loan 5 that Mr E may have some longer  term 
financial problems rather than just using the loans  to help with a temporary cash flow 
problem. QuickQuid shouldve also become  concerned  about  whether it knew  enough about 
Mr Es true financial situation.
So I think that it wouldve  been proportionate  to make a full review of Mr Es finances before  
approving loans 5 to 9. And I think that QuickQuid needed to verify this information, as far as 
it could. This was to make  sure Mr E was in position  to make the repayments sustainably.
Although I havent  seen  the full details  of all QuickQuids credit checks, it has provided me 
with its estimate of Mr Es disposable income (EDI). This is lower than deducting Mr Es 
declared expenditure from his declared income  for all of loans 5 to 9. I dont know  exactly  
how QuickQuid calculated  this  but it has said that credit checks  are one relevant factor. 
And it has shown me that it increased the other credit commitments Mr E had declared due 
to these checks. 
But because I dont  know how QuickQuid actually  worked out the EDI, I cant say this 
reflects a proportionate check. And QuickQuid doesnt seem to have fully reviewed  Mr Es 
finances. So I need to think about what its likely  proportionate checks  wouldve shown  
QuickQuid if it had.
Ref: DRN60404914what I think proportionate checks would most  likely have  shown for loans  5 to 9
Mr E has provided some  information about  his financial circumstances. This includes his 
bank statements and a recent credit  report I accept that this isnt exactly  what  QuickQuid 
wouldve seen at the time. But I think  it wouldve  found out similar information if it had made 
proportionate checks, so I think  its reasonable to rely on it.
This shows that on average over loans 5 to 9 Mr E was earning around £3,900. This isnt too 
far away from what QuickQuid recorded.  
But Mr Es expenditure  was much higher than QuickQuid recorded. His regular monthly 
outgoings were  around £2,000. The main components  of this were  his rent of over £800 and 
his food expenditure of £400. The remainder of this was spent on regular household bills and 
spending such as utility bills and council tax. 
Mr E also had significant other financial commitments.  These  were  around £1,000 a month 
and included  large repayments  towards house  related  purchases  and large credit card and 
loan repayments.  
Mr E was also borrowing  and repaying large  amounts to other short  term lenders. This was 
usually at least £1,000 month but could  be higher.  The amount he had outstanding  when  he 
increased loans  8 and 9 was over £2,000. 
So I think its reasonable to say that Mr Es expenditure  was greater than his outgoings when  
QuickQuid approved these loans. I think  that QuickQuid wouldve found  out this information 
if it had made proportionate  checks.  And I think it wouldve seen Mr E wouldnt have been  
able repay  the loans  in a sustainable way. So I think that QuickQuid shouldnt have given 
loans 5 to 9 to Mr E and I think hes lost out as a result of this. So Im upholding Mr Es 
complaint about  loans  5 to 9. 
Ref: DRN60404915what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right for loans  5 to 9
To put things right for Mr E, QuickQuid should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loans 5 to 9; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Es credit  file about  these loans;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Es complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2019
