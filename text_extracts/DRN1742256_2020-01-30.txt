K822xcomplaint
Miss P, on behalf of Mrs P, complains about how National  Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
dealt with the passing away of Mrs Ps husband.
background 
Miss P says that following  the passing away of her father she tried to use NatWests 
bereavement online service without success. She says she attended a branch and says she 
was dealt with inappropriately  and with out sensitivity. Miss P says that NatWest  then 
uploaded someone elses death certificate sharing her late fathers name. She says this 
caused significant distress and NatWest  then didnt make a promised  call back to her and 
sent a letter  to her mother but addressed to Mr P.
.
NatWest accepts that it didnt deal with matters appropriately and has apologised. It accepts 
its level of service was poor and that it did upload the wrong  death  certificate.  It also accepts 
making a mistake with the letter. NatWest has said it will provide feedback to its staff and 
has offered £350  compensation and has also sent Mrs P flowers.
Miss P brought her complaint to us and also makes further complaints. She says NatWest  
sent her mother a new cheque book in joint names  and during a call made her mother  read 
account information which caused  her worry and distress. Miss P also says there was a 
problem releasing  details of some  of her fathers accounts.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and in summary  agreed  that NatWest  hadnt dealt 
with these matters appropriately.  The investigator thought that NatWest had fairly apologised 
and had agreed to provide feedback to staff. The investigator also thought the compensation 
offer was in line with what she would have recommended and so did not think  she could ask 
NatWest to do anything  further.
Miss P didnt accept  that view and in summary says this matter cant  be understated and that 
the compensation should be increased.  She provided further  information  about the later 
complaints and told us how she had cared for her father and provided an update on the 
health position of her mother.
The complaint was referred  to me and I asked NatWest for further  information  and if it 
consented for us to look at the later complaints. NatWest has replied  and said it hasnt 
looked into those  matters but has provided  some explanation for what took place. It also 
hasnt provided  the call recording in which Mrs P was asked to read out account information.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to a similar 
overall view as the investigator for similar  reasons. I realise that Mrs P will be disappointed 
by my decision. I also appreciate how strongly the parties feel about whats  taken  place.
I make  clear that as NatWest hasnt given us permission to look at the later complaints  then I 
cant fairly comment further on them. I appreciate that NatWest  has provided some  brief 
information about its view on them but I can see that it clearly  says it hasnt investigated 
them and that it would  be unfair  for us to make any finding on them.  So in those 
circumstances I hope Mrs P understands why I cant make any findings on what  may have 
Ref: DRN17422562happened and that she will need  to make  a new complaint about those matters  that she says 
took place following NatWests final response to the complaint.
I also make  clear to the parties that I can see that Mrs P is the complainant here and not 
Miss P. So that means I can only consider the impact NatWests  actions  had upon  Mrs P 
and not on her daughter. I say that as I can see that Miss P looked  after her father and has 
described the understandable impact  this has had on her and how she felt during the call 
with NatWest. 
There is no question here that NatWest  made  a number of mistakes at what I accept would 
have been an extremely difficult  time for Mrs P and her family. I have no doubt Mrs P was 
caused distress and inconvenience as a result of those mistakes and it would have taken 
some time to sort out what  had happened. I accept it would  have been  extremely  upsetting 
to see that someone  elses death  certificate  had been uploaded  by NatWest. But Im 
satisfied that NatWest has fairly apologised for what took place and accepted  it made a 
number of mistakes.
I can see that NatWest will provide feedback to its staff. I accept that by providing  feedback 
to its staff NatWest cant change the position as far as this complaint is concerned. But it 
may mean that similar  mistakes  are avoided for others. Im satisfied that the compensation  
offer is fair and reasonable and fairly reflects the level of mistake and the impact it had upon 
Mrs P. I appreciate that Miss P says it should  be higher but for the reasons I have explained 
I think its appropriate.
For those reasons I cant fairly order NatWest to do anything further in the circumstances of 
this complaint. I will leave  it to Mrs P to decide if she wished to accept NatWests offer.
my final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc has made a fair and reasonable offer 
of £350 compensation. Mrs Ps acceptance of that offer would be in full and final settlement 
of this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss P on behalf 
of Mrs P to accept or reject my decision  before 1 March  2020.
