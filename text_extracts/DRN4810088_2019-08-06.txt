Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Js complaint and thought the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. 247Moneybox  disagreed and the complaint was passed  to me.
The adjudicator didnt recommend that loans 1 to 4 should be upheld, and Mr J has 
confirmed that he accepts the adjudication. As loans 1 to 4 are no longer in dispute,  my 
decision focusses on the areas of disagreement  loans 5 to 19.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
247Moneybox needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr J 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN48100882But certain factors might  point to the fact that 247Moneybox should  fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that 247Moneybox was required  to 
establish whether  Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that 247Moneybox ought fairly  and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to do so without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint.
I havent recreated affordability  assessments  of the loans in dispute. This is because I think  
the number of loans and the pattern of lending here are concerning. So Ive also looked  at 
the overall pattern of 247Moneyboxs lending history with Mr J, with a view to seeing if there 
was a point at which 247Moneybox  should reasonably have  seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 247Moneybox should  have  realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
5. I say this because by loan 5, I think a pattern of unsustainable borrowing was emerging. 
Mr J had been repeatedly borrowing from 247Moneybox over a period of around nine 
months. And I can see from the results of the credit search 247Moneybox provided that with 
each credit search, prior to all four previous loans, the number of delinquent and defaulted 
accounts appeared to be increasing.  By loan 5, Mr J had three delinquent and two default  
accounts. These shouldve concerned 247Moneybox about Mr Js ability to manage his 
credit commitments.
Ref: DRN48100883And from loan 5 onwards Mr J was provided  with a new loan within days  of settling a 
previous one and on some  occasions on the same day as settling a previous loan. So I think  
247Moneybox ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr J was having to borrow  
further to cover the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that 
Mr Js indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Given the length of time Mr J was borrowing from 247Moneybox, he wasnt making any real 
inroads to the amount  he owed 247Monybox. Loan 19 was taken out around  20 months after 
Mr Js first, and it was for a larger  amount.  Mr J had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to 247Moneyox  over an extended period.
As 247Moneybox  continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 onwards, Mr J lost out 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Js 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 19 and 247Moneybox  should put things  
right.
putting things right  what 247Moneybox needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 5 to 19;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 19 should be removed from 
Mr Js credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 247Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 
247Moneybox must give Mr J a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Js complaint. Active Securities 
Limited should pay Mr J compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 September 2019.
