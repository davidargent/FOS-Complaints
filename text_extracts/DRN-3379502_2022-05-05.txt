The complaint
Mrs W is unhappy about the way NewDay Ltd handled her credit card account.
What happened
Mrs W held a credit card account provided by NewDay. In July 2020 NewDay sent a 
persistent debt letter to Mrs W advising her that over the last 18 months she had paid more 
in interest, fee and charges than she had paid towards the amount borrowed. The letter 
stated that if the situation remained the same after 36 months NewDay would be required to 
freeze the account under FCA guidelines.
In April 2021 NewDay sent another letter to Mrs W stating that the account remained in 
persistent debt and recommended options to her to avoid the account being frozen.
Mrs W wrote to NewDay in April 2021 and offered to increase her payments from £124 per 
month to £150 per month. She asked NewDay to freeze her card so she couldnt use it. Mrs 
W also asked NewDay to freeze interest on the account and for the account to be closed 
once she had cleared the balance.
In May 2021 NewDay sent Mrs W an income and expenditure form. It advised Mrs W that 
the account was in arrears and said it had placed a 30 day freeze on it.
Mrs Ws complained to NewDay. She said she wasnt in arrears. In response, NewDay said 
it had placed the account on hold for 30 days to allow Mrs W time to complete the income 
and expenditure form, so that it could make sure that her increased offer was affordable. 
NewDay advised Mrs W that there were no arrears on her account and apologised for any 
confusion caused by its previous letter. It paid compensation of £60 to Mrs W.
Mrs W was unhappy with the response because it didnt deal with her offer to increase her 
monthly payment. She brough her complaint to this service.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. He said that although NewDay hadnt done anything 
wrong by following the persistent debt process and requesting details of Mrs Ws income and 
expenditure, he thought that NewDay couldve done more to clarify why it needed the 
information it had requested. The investigator recommended that NewDay paid further 
compensation of £140.
NewDay didnt agree. It said that whilst it acknowledged that it couldve explained more 
clearly why the income and expenditure form needed to be completed, it didnt think further 
compensation was justified. It said that Mrs W had maintained her minimum monthly 
payments and that the real issue was Mrs ws unhappiness about its refusal to freeze 
interest on the account, which it said it wasnt obliged to do.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im partially upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focussed my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on a specific point, it isnt because Ive failed to consider it and take it on board, but because 
I dont think I need to mention  it to achieve what I think is the right outcome.
I recognise that Mrs W has been impacted by this. Shes explained that she found the letter 
she received from NewDay confusing and feels frustrated that she hasnt received a 
response to her offer to increase her monthly payment and her request for the account to be 
frozen.
Ive looked at the letter which NewDay sent to Mrs W. In the initial letter, NewDay advised 
Mrs W that she was in persistent debt and explained what would happen if this didnt 
change. Ive thought about whether NewDay did anything wrong here. I dont think it did. The 
FCA implemented a change in their rules in 2018 which were designed to ensure that 
businesses such as NewDay took action to prevent customers from being in persistent debt 
for long periods of time. This is because when customers are in persistent debt, they often 
end up paying more in interest and charges than they do paying off the actual amount 
theyve spent. Ive thought about whether NewDay followed these guidelines fairly. Im 
satisfied that in sending a letter to Mrs W explaining that she was in persistent debt, and 
explaining that additional monthly payments would reduce the cost of her borrowing and the 
time it would take to repay the debt, NewDay acted in line with the guidelines.
I can see that when Mrs W replied to the letters from NewDay, she asked it to freeze interest 
and block the card. She also put forward a proposal to increase her monthly payment. Ive 
looked at the letter which NewDay sent in response. This stated that Mrs W was in arrears 
and asked her to complete an income and expenditure form. 
Looking at the wording of the letter, I think NewDay made an error here. Mrs Ws account 
wasnt in arrears. The letter didnt make it clear why the income and expenditure form 
needed to be completed.
I understand why NewDay sent the income and expenditure form. It needed to make sure 
that the increased amount offered by Mrs w was affordable for her. But NewDay didnt 
explain this to Mrs W. Its clear from Mrs Ws subsequent letters that she was worried that 
her account was in arrears, and that she thought the income and expenditure form was 
something to do with arrears.
Based on what Ive seen, I think NewDays letter was confusing and misleading. It caused 
Mrs W unnecessary distress. NewDay shouldve done more to explain why the income and 
expenditure form was needed. Given these failings, I think its fair to ask NewDay to pay 
further compensation to Mrs W for the trouble and upset caused. I agree with the 
investigator that a further sum of £140 (making a total sum of £200) is fair.
I appreciate that Mrs W wants to increase her monthly payments and that she wants to have 
interest frozen. Once the income and expenditure form has been completed, NewDay will 
check that her proposal is affordable. In relation to freezing interest on the account, this isnt 
something which NewDay is obliged to do. I understand that Mrs W will be disappointed 
about this, because the income and expenditure form which was sent to her makes 
reference to stopping interest on the account. But this only applies in circumstances where a 
payment arrangement has been set up for arrears. It doesnt apply to Mrs Ws circumstances 
where payments are up to date.     
Putting things right
To put things right, NewDay should compensate Mrs W for the trouble and upset caused by its inaccurate letter. The further sum of £140 is fair and reasonable.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. NewDay Ltd must take the steps Ive set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 June 2022.
