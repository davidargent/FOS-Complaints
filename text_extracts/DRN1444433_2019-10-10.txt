Mrs M says Elevate Credit International Limited irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about 23 loans Elevate provided to Mrs M between 8/12/14 and 25/9/17. 
The first was an open ended credit  facility to be repaid over five months, the remainder were 
instalment loans to be repaid over six. Mrs Ms borrowing history is as follows:

Elevate had already upheld Mrs Ms complaint about  the first two loans, saying that it was 
satisfied that there were  factors in place which should have prevented these two loans from 
being granted. Its made an appropriate  refund.  
So our adjudicator didnt look at those  two loans and my decision will focus on loans 3 to 23.
Our adjudicator went on to partly uphold Mrs Ms complaint  saying the loans from 6 to 23 
shouldnt have been given. Elevate disagreed, but said that it would now agree also to 
uphold the complaints about loans 20 to 23. Mrs M was not prepared to accept this as a 
resolution of her complaint. As there  was no agreement,  the complaint was passed to me.
Ref: DRN14444332my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Elevate needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Elevate should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Elevate was required to establish 
whether Mrs M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ms complaint. 
I dont think it was clearly irresponsible for Elevate  to agree loans three to five. This is 
because I dont think checks  of Mrs Ms circumstances, or her pattern of lending, would have 
shown that the lending  was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN14444333But Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of Elevates lending history  with Mrs M, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Elevate should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Elevate should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ms case,  I think  that this point was reached  by 
loan 6. I say this because at this point Elevate ought  to have realised  Mrs M was not 
managing to repay her loans sustainably. I say this because:
Loan 2 was taken out before loan1 had been repaid. And similarly loans 3 and 5 
were started before the previous loan had been paid off. This suggests  that Mrs Ms 
finances were not stable. 
Similarly, Mrs M was applying for loan 6 before she had paid off loan 5.
Mrs Ms first loan was for £200 and loan 6 was for £300, and this was similar  to the 
average she had asked for, in all the previous five loans. This suggested her need for 
borrowing was not going down.
When Mrs M applied for loan 6, she had established a steady pattern of borrowing 
over a period  of eleven months. Elevate has said this borrowing pattern showed that 
Mrs M took out the loans  as and when she needed them. But I think a more likely 
interpretation is that she had apparently become reliant on the loans  over a long 
period.
This should have  made Elevate realise that Mrs M was not managing to balance  her 
finances, and was probably relying  on repeated loans to finance an ongoing  deficit rather 
than a temporary shortfall in her income. Repaying the ongoing loans over a short  term 
would potentially have  made it harder for her to solve the situation. Instead Mrs M had paid 
large amounts of interest  to, in effect,  service  a debt to Elevate over an extended period.
I think that Mrs M lost out because Elevate continued to provide borrowing  from loan 6. I say 
this because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ms indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mrs M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mrs Ms ability  to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 6 onwards and Elevate should put things right.
putting things right  what Elevate needs to do
Elevate must:
refund  all interest and charges Mrs M paid on loan 6 and all subsequent loans covered 
by this decision.
Ref: DRN14444334pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 and onwards should be removed from 
Mrs Ms credit file.
If it hasnt  yet done so, Elevate should honour  its offer to refund interest and charges for 
loans 1 and 2. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate to take off tax from this interest. Elevate must 
give Mrs M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mrs M compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 November  2019.
