Complaint
Miss M is unhappy that Monzo Bank Ltd wont reimburse her after she fell victim to an 
investment scam.
Background
In November 2021, Miss M fell victim to an investment scam. She was contacted on a social 
media platform by someone who claimed they could earn her a generous return on her 
money. She was told that she could expect to earn a return of ten times her initial 
investment. She was also reassured that, due to the technicalities of this individuals 
investment strategy, there was no risk to her capital. In the event that her investments didnt 
perform, she would simply have her initial outlay returned to her.
Unfortunately, Miss M wasnt talking to a legitimate investment professional at all, but a 
scammer. She used her account with Monzo to transfer £3,500 to an account controlled by 
the scammer. This was spread across three separate payments. Each time she authorised a 
payment in the Monzo app, a warning was displayed. It said:
Stop, dont pay.
Its very likely this is a scam.
Remember:
# Legitimate Investments will never guarantee profit
# Legitimate Investments arent arranged on social media or things like WhatsApp
Check out the company
See if theyre a legitimate company here. Dont pay unless theyre registered with the 
FCA and youre certain you can trust them.
Miss M says she doesnt remember seeing the warnings. She proceed with the payments. 
When she realised that shed fallen victim to a scam, she notified Monzo. It looked into what 
had happened, but it decided it wouldnt reimburse her. It didnt think she had carried out 
sufficient checks before transferring her money to the individual shed been in contact with.
Miss M referred her complaint to this service. It was looked at by an Investigator who 
considered it under the Lending Standards Boards Contingent Reimbursement Model 
(CRM) Code. She upheld the complaint in part. She wasnt persuaded that the warning met 
the codes technical requirements for it to be an effective warning. 
However, she thought that Miss M had made the payments without a reasonable basis for 
believing the investment was genuine. Applying the code, she recommended that Monzo 
reimburse 50% of the money Miss M lost to the scam.
Monzo disagreed with the Investigators opinion. It said that it cannot be considered 
responsible for a customer not seeing or not remembering seeing the relevant warnings. It 
also argued that the warning was broadly relevant to the scam type. Its not realistic for it to 
have warnings which cover every conceivable scam type. There was more than enough 
information in the warning for it to have raised alarms with Miss M. 
Because Monzo disagreed with the Investigators opinion, the complaint has been passed to 
me to consider and come to a final decision.
Findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the relevant evidence and arguments for this complaint and Ive come to 
the same overall conclusion as the Investigator and for broadly the same reasons.
The starting point in law is that Miss M is presumed liable for any transaction she authorises. 
She did authorise the payments that are the subject of this complaint, albeit only because 
hed been tricked into thinking she was investing her money. However, thats not the end of 
the story. Monzo has agreed to follow the terms of the CRM code. This code says that firms 
should refund its customers where they fall victim to a scam like this one, except in a small 
number of circumstances. 
There are two potentially relevant exceptions on this case. They are:
The Customer ignored Effective Warnings  by failing to take appropriate action in 
response to such an Effective Warning
The Customer made the payment without a reasonable basis for believing that  
the payment was for genuine goods or services; and/or the person or business with 
whom they transacted was legitimate.
Im not persuaded Miss M had a reasonable basis for believing this was a genuine 
investment opportunity. There were several potential red flags that ought to have made Miss 
M proceed more cautiously. The rate of return she was promised was extraordinary. She 
was told that she could turn £1,000 into £10,000 with two hours. As an annual rate of 
interest, this would be over 40 million per cent. She wasnt told that shed need to pay for 
these services, nor that there was any risk to her upfront investment. I think she ought to 
have recognised that there was no realistic prospect that this investment opportunity was a 
genuine one.
In addition to that, the payments werent all sent to the same payee, even though shed only 
dealt with one named individual who she believed would be managing her investments. I 
think she ought to have had concerns about that anomaly. And finally, the vocabulary used 
by the scammer in her messages to Miss M was extremely informal and not what one would 
expect of a genuine investment professional.
Ive also considered whether Monzo did what was expected of it under the code. Its argued 
that it displayed an effective warning when Miss M made these payments and so that 
exception to reimbursement should apply here.
The CRM Code has a specific set of requirements that must be met for a warning to be 
considered effective. Monzo has said that the warnings displayed when Miss M made these 
payments met those requirements. Although there was content in this warning that was 
relevant to the scam that Miss M had been targeted by (in particular, talking about the fact 
that legitimate investments dont originate on or get arranged through social media 
channels), Im not persuaded that it met all of the requirements under the code.It didnt bring to life what such an investment scam would look like from the perspective of 
the customer or highlight the most commonly occurring features of such scams. It didnt talk, 
for example, about the need to be wary of the promise of spectacular and implausible 
returns. I can also see from the messages Miss M exchanged with the scammer that she 
wasnt told that her profit was guaranteed, simply that her initial outlay wasnt at risk if 
something went wrong. The warning also talked about the importance of consulting the FCA 
website, but it rather took for granted that the customer would know how to go about doing 
so and how to interpret what information they might find there.
I also considered whether Miss M could be considered vulnerable, as that term is defined in 
the CRM Code. I asked Miss M to provide some further information about this, but it hasnt 
been forthcoming. Im aware that she had some mental health challenges around the time 
she fell victim to the scam and that this was partly connected to the fact that she lost her job 
because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, Im not persuaded that those circumstances 
alone wouldve made her meet the codes definition of vulnerability and so I dont think this 
affects the fair and reasonable outcome in this case. 
For completeness, I also looked at whether Monzo had done everything it could to recover 
Miss Ms money from the receiving bank  that is, the account controlled by the fraudster. I 
can see from the evidence that Monzo has shared with us that it contacted the receiving 
bank promptly after she notified it that shed fallen victim to a scam. Unfortunately, Miss Ms 
funds have been moved on from that account very quickly and so there was nothing left to 
be recovered. 
Overall, Im satisfied that Monzo hasnt been able to show that it met its standards under the 
CRM Code. As a result, I think it needs to refund 50% of the money Miss M lost.
Final decision
For the reasons Ive set out above, I uphold this complaint in part.
If Miss M accepts my final decision, Monzo Bank Ltd needs to pay her 50% of the money 
she lost to the scam. It was also add on any interest that wouldve been earned on that 50% 
if it remained in the origination account. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 April 2023.
