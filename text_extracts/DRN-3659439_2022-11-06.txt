The complaint
Mr O complains about how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) dealt with his credit 
card account applications.
What happened
Mr O says he was told by NatWest that he had a 95% chance of being approved for a credit 
card account. He says he applied in 2021 and 2022 but was refused on both occasions. Mr 
O says he appealed the last decision and says NatWest told him the application hadnt been 
denied but it needed further information. He says the account was then approved which 
provides evidence the previous applications should also have been approved. Mr O would 
like a full investigation into what has taken place for him and other customers affected by 
what he believes is a bug in NatWests software.
NatWest accepts it didnt make clear that Mr Os application hadnt been fully rejected and 
accepts it didnt provide clear or appropriate service. It has apologised and offered £75 
compensation. NatWest says its entitled to reject an application in line with its internal 
processes.
Mr O brought his complaint to us and questions if his surname was causing the issues. He 
says NatWest has a duty to its customers to sort out a potential problem.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint and thought Mr O wasnt given a 100% 
guarantee of being approved for the account. He thought NatWest had acted fairly by 
apologising and offering appropriate compensation. The investigator explained that he could 
only look at Mr Os complaint and not consider other potential customers and thought 
NatWest was entitled to reject the applications.
Mr O doesnt accept that view and in summary says his applications were not considered on 
their own merit and maintains there may be discrimination. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr O will be disappointed by my decision and appreciate how strongly he feels 
about this complaint. It may be helpful if I explain to Mr O that we are not NatWests 
regulator and so its not our role to investigate it as he suggests or direct it on how it runs its 
business. I can only consider Mr Os complaint and cant consider other potential consumers 
affected as Mr O suggests I do. I have not seen any evidence of discrimination.
There is no question here that NatWest made a mistake by not explaining its process to Mr 
O and by providing poor service to him about the application. I have no doubt Mr O was 
caused inconvenience by that mistake and would have spent some time trying to sort 
matters out. But Im satisfied that NatWest has fairly apologised for that part of the complaint 
and did look again at Mr Os application which was then approved. Im also satisfied that 
NatWest has offered a fair and reasonable compensation amount of £75 which I think fairly 
reflects what took place and what I think was a fairly limited impact on Mr O. I dont think Mr 
O suffered any financial loss or that the impact justifies further compensation. I appreciate 
this complaint is not about the level of compensation.
I have looked carefully at NatWests records and I am satisfied that it didnt give Mr O a 
100% guarantee that a credit card account application would be approved. So, I dont think 
NatWest misled Mr O and think that any application is subject to further checks. I have not 
seen any evidence NatWest made a mistake by rejecting Mr Os earlier account applications 
and have not seen any evidence those decisions were linked to his surname or a bug. I am 
satisfied that NatWest rejected Mr Os application for entirely different reasons which I am 
satisfied its entitled to do when exercising its commercial judgement. I am sure Mr O 
appreciates that NatWest is entitled to decide with whom it enters into a business 
relationship with and is not obliged to open an account for applicants. I find that NatWest is 
not obliged in certain circumstances, as here, to provide the exact reasons for rejecting the 
applications but has clearly reconsidered its decision which I think is a fair approach.
Overall, I accept Mr O will have unanswered questions, but I am satisfied that NatWest has 
acted fairly by offering compensation for part of the complaint. I am satisfied NatWest was 
entitled to reach the decisions it did about the applications. If Mr O wishes to accept the 
compensation offer, then that will be up to him. But this now brings an end to what we in 
trying to resolve this dispute informally can do.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 December 2022.
