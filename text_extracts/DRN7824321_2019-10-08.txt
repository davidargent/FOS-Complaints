K821x#15complaint
Mr B says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
says that the checks the business  made before lending  were insufficient. He thinks  that if 
Sunny had made better  checks it wouldve seen that he couldnt afford the loan repayments. 
background
This complaint is about 29 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr B between  March 2016  
and October 2017.  Ive attached a table to the end of this decision that shows some of the 
information Sunny has provided about  the lending
Sunny looked  at this complaint before it came to this Service.  It said that it should pay 
compensation in respect of loan 1 and loans 9 to 14. Mr B didnt accept this offer.  
The first adjudicator partially  upheld the complaint. He agreed  with the offer Sunny had 
made in respect  of loan 1. He also thought it lent irresponsibly  for loans 6 to 29. A second 
adjudicator thought that Sunny shouldnt have approved loans 5 to 29. 
Sunny has responded to our adjudicator  and said that it shouldnt have approved any 
lending after 12 months. So it offered  to pay compensation from loan 14 onwards. Mr B 
hasnt accepted this offer.  
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been  passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN78243212There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Bs complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
Mr B didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion about loans 1 to 4. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr B had with Sunny. So 
they are something  I will take into account  when considering the other loans  he took.
By loan 5 Mr B had been borrowing from Sunny without a break  for over seven months. And 
he hadnt repaid  loan 3, and hed only very recently  repaid  loans 2 and 4. As our adjudicator 
explained, by loan 5 it wouldve been  proportionate for Sunny to fully review Mr Bs finances 
to see if he could sustainably repay  the loans. 
If Sunny had done this it would most likely  have  seen  that Mr B was having  problems 
managing his money. This is because he was due to make  repayments to other short term 
lenders at the same time. This was in addition to still making repayments to more than one 
Sunny Loan. 
I think that Sunny wouldve found  out this information if it had made proportionate checks.  
And I think Sunny wouldve seen  Mr B wouldnt have been able repay the loans  in a 
sustainable way. So I think that Sunny shouldnt have given loan 5 to Mr B and I think  hes 
lost out as a result of this. So Im upholding Mr Bs complaint about loan 5. 
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 29 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  
history with Mr B, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  Sunny should  
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
up to loan 6 the amounts Mr B was borrowing hadnt really  decreased.  Mr B had 
been provided with a new loan within day of settling a previous one and this 
continued going forward. 
Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr B was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Bs indebtedness was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN78243213Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 29 was 
taken out 22 months after Mr Bs first. And it was for the same amount. I think this 
indicates Mr B couldnt really make the repayments without borrowing further and he 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr B lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Bs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 29 and Sunny should put things right.  
Sunny has agreed  that it was wrong  to lend any after loan 12.This is because it thought it 
was likely that Mr B had become reliant on credit  at this point and so it shouldnt  have 
approved any further loans. This is an agreement of sorts but, put simply, in this case  I think 
this was evident at an earlier point as Ive detailed above. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 5 to 29;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Mr Bs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 29 should be removed from 
Mr Bs credit file.
If Mr B still owes Sunny  any of the principal balance he borrowed on his final loan Sunny 
should remove all the interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. Sunny  should  
then re-work the account as if all payments made by Mr B went  to towards the principal.  But 
importantly, Sunny needs to make sure that Mr B doesnt repay more than the principal 
amount borrowed.  
If after doing this Mr B hasnt repaid the principal he borrowed Sunny can deduct this from 
the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr B has already paid enough to repay the principal  
then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple*  interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Mr B.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr B a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN78243214my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Bs complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 November 2019
