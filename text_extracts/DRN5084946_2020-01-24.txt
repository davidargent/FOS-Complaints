Mr S says Elevate Credit International Limited   trading as Sunny  irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about one flex-credit loand and 39 instalment loans Sunny provided to 
Mr S between December 2014  and December  2016.  Mr Ss borrowing history  is summarised  
at the end of this decision.
Sunny upheld Mr Ss complaint about  loan 1  the flex-credit account  and has paid the 
redress for this loan. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ss complaint  and thought  the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and offered to uphold  Mr Ss complaint about 
loans 20 to 40. Mr S didnt  accept Sunnys offer, so the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN50849462Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint. Having done so, Ive decided to partially 
uphold the complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Sunny has agreed  to uphold loan 1, so I wont consider that loan any further, but I will take it 
into account when  considering Mr Ss complaint about the other loans. Our adjudicator didnt  
think Sunny  had done anything wrong when it lent Mr S loans 2 to 5. As there has been  no 
further dispute about loans 1 to 5, Ive focussed my decision on the loans still in dispute.  
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr S, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr S was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out 6 loans within six months.  So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr S was having to borrow further  to cover the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his/her finances and that Mr Ss 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ss first instalment  loan (loan  2) was for £750  and loan 6 was for the same 
amount.  At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mr S was not likely borrowing 
to meet  a temporary shortfall  in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr S was provided  with a new loan within  days of taking out a 
previous one. 
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 40 taken 
out two years after Mr Ss first. Mr S had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
I think that Mr S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ss ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN50849463putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 6 to 40;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
rework any loans which are outstanding, applying all payments made by Mr S as if 
they went towards the principal  amount borrowed. But importantly, Sunny needs  to 
make sure that it collects no more than the principal  sum lent. 
If and when the amount Mr S has paid exceeds the amount he was lent, any further 
amounts paid should be treated as overpayments. Any overpayments  that may have 
been made should be refunded to Mr S with 8% simple  interest  from the date the 
overpayment was made to the date of settlement ;
if there is still an outstanding balance, any refunds  should  be used to repay any 
balance remaining on the outstanding loan. If there  is any surplus this should be 
repaid to Mr S.
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 to 40 should be removed from  
Mr Ss credit file. You do not have to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Ss 
credit file until these have been  repaid, but any adverse information recorded about 
these loans should still be removed.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr S a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
If after doing the above Mr S still has an outstanding  balance due, then Sunny should try 
and work  together to come  to a mutually  agreeable repayment plan in order to repay what is 
owed. But Id remind Sunny of its obligation  to treat Mr S fairly. 
Ref: DRN50849464my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
