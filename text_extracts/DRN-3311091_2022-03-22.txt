The complaint
Mrs P complains about the amount that shes been charged by Volkswagen Financial 
Services (UK) Limited for a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement. 
Her husband is also involved with her complaint.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mrs P under a hire purchase agreement with Volkswagen 
Financial Services that she signed in March 2021. She complained to Volkswagen Financial 
Services later that month because shed entered into the agreement following its Three 
months on us advertising campaign and she wasnt happy with the payments that she was 
making. It said that the first three monthly payments were removed from the total amount of 
the finance and that the first three monthly rentals were charged at £0. It also explained how 
the price of the car had been calculated.
Mrs P wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service and says that 
Volkswagen Financial Services should pay for the first three monthly instalments. Our 
investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that shed 
lost out financially as shed received three months free, but the saving was spread over the 
term of the agreement.
Mrs Ps husband, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. He has responded to our investigators recommendations in detail and says, in 
summary, that: 
he phoned Volkswagen Financial Services and it said that calls are recorded but 
cant now produce the recording of the call;
the quote that was given said that Volkswagen Financial Services would pay for the 
first three months and states an interest rate of 2.9% but doesnt say that its a 
reduced interest rate;
he was told at least four times that Volkswagen Financial Services would pay the first 
three instalments and its not acceptable that the offer is confusing;
he looked at the total amount borrowed and was led to believe that, if the agreement 
was settled early, three payments would have been made by Volkswagen Financial 
Services which would reduce the settlement figure accordingly;
even if Mrs P would have bought the car anyway, its not acceptable for Volkswagen 
Financial Services to be misleading and confusing;
Mrs P entered into the agreement on the basis of the personal quote which said we 
make a further contribution of £261 and pay your first 3 months instalments"; and
many people will have been subject to the same promotion believing that 
Volkswagen Financial Services paid their first three months instalments. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mrs Ps husband has provided a copy of the quote for the car from the dealer which 
says: Alternatively you could opt for our 3 On Us Deal, discount £1,961, deposit 
contribution £1,500, we make a further contribution of £261 and pay for your first 3 
months instalments, interest rate 2.9%, amount financed £19,674, a deposit of £200 
reduces the amount financed to £19,474  [over] 3 years would calculate to £345.88 
[per month];
Mrs P signed the hire purchase agreement which showed the price of the car as 
£21,112 and an advance payment of £1,638 so the amount of credit was £19,474 
and the APR was 2.9% - it showed that the total amount payable was £22,391.16 
and that Mrs P was to make 32 monthly payments of £345.88 and a final payment of 
£9,675 (there was also a £10 option to purchase fee);
the agreement said: You must pay the Advance Payment to us when you sign this 
Agreement. You must then make: one payment of £0  followed by 32 monthly 
repayments of £345.88  save that there will be a Payment Holiday in month(s) 1,2 
and 3; followed by a final payment of £9,675 ;
the term of the agreement was 36 months but Mrs P was only required to make 32 
monthly payments of £345.88 (and a final payment of £9,675) and no monthly 
payment was due from her for the first three months - so there were three months 
when she wasnt making a payment;
the monthly payment of £345.88 was the same as the monthly payment set out in the 
quote;
I consider that the terms of the Three months on us offer werent as clear as they 
could have been and that both the quote and the provisions of the hire purchase 
agreement could have been more clearly presented  but Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that Mrs P has been charged the wrong amount for 
the car;
Mrs P signed the hire purchase agreement and, in doing so declared that she agreed 
to be legally bound by its terms;
if the payment arrangements set out in the agreement werent what Mrs P was 
expecting or they werent acceptable to her, I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect her not to have signed the agreement and to have raised any issues with 
Volkswagen Financial Services before the car was supplied to her;
Volkswagen Financial Services has explained that the total price of the car was 
£23,175, there was a new car discount of £2,001, a dealer contribution of £261 and a 
contribution from Volkswagen Financial Services of £1,239 which reduced that price 
but, when the cost of the service plan, road fund licence and first registration were 
added, the price of the car was £21,112 which was the price shown on the 
agreement;
the amount of credit shown on the agreement was £19,474 which is the same as the 
amount to be financed as shown on the quote; 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Volkswagen Financial 
Services has acted incorrectly in these circumstances; andI find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Volkswagen Financial 
Services to change the payments set out in the agreement, to pay any compensation 
to Mrs P or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 April 2022.
