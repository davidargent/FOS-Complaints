The complaint
Mr O complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wont refund money he says he lost as 
a result of falling victim to a scam. 
What happened
The background to this complaint is well known to both parties, so I wont repeat it in detail 
here. But in summary Mr O says he fell victim to a scam. Hes said somebody impersonating 
NatWest persuaded him to move funds to a safe account, to keep his money safe.
Mr O complained to NatWest, but it declined to refund Mr O the money he said he lost. 
Unhappy with NatWests response, Mr O then brought his complaint to our service and one 
of our Investigators looked into things. Our investigator didnt think the complaint should be 
upheld.
As agreement couldnt be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im satisfied that NatWest has considered matters fairly in not refunding    
Mr O under the provisions of the Contingent Reimbursement Model. It follows that I cant 
fairly or reasonably ask NatWest to refund the money Mr O has said he lost.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 November 2022.
