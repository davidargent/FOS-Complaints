MYJAR has agreed to uphold Mr Ys complaint about loan 2 and it has offered to refund all 
the interest and charges he paid on this loan. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ys complaint  and thought  the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because Mr Y was showing signs  of being in a debt cycle. 
MYJAR disagreed and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman.  It said the 
adjudicator hadnt given  enough information as to why they were upholding the complaint. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it was passed to me to issue a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr Y 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN83524082the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr Y could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ys complaint.
MYJAR has agreed to uphold loan 2 so I wont be considering this loan any further.  Our 
adjudicator didnt think MYJAR needed to do more  when it approved loans 1 and 3. Mr Y 
didnt disagree  with the adjudicators findings about  these loans. As there is no dispute with 
the adjudicators  opinion  about these loans, I won be making any findings on them.  But Ive 
kept these in mind  when  thinking about the context of the overall lending  relationship.  
This leaves  loans 4 onwards for me to consider. As our adjudicator  explained, a 
proportionate check for loan 4 would most likely  have shown that Mr Y was in a cycle of debt 
and was further borrowing to cover the hole that repaying his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances. This was Mr Ys forth loan in three months and Mr Y had been in debt with 
MYJAR the entire  time, with only small breaks  between loans. In these circumstances there 
was a risk that by allowing  Mr Y to take on further loans he wouldnt be able to sustainably  
make the repayments.   
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MYJARs  lending history with Mr Y, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ys case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I say 
this because at this point MYJAR  ought to have realised Mr Y wasnt managing to repay his 
Ref: DRN83524083loans sustainably. Mr Y had taken out seven loans in six months  and he wasnt  really  making  
any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. Mr Y was provided with loan 8 within  a day 
of settling loan 7. And this loan was taken  out only 10 months after Mr Ys first. Mr Y had 
paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to MYJAR over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr Y lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ys indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr Y borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ys ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him/her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 to 6 and loans 7 and 8 and MYJAR 
should put things right.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
In addition to the redress  that MYJAR  has already agreed to pay for loan 2, it should  carry 
out the following: 
refund  all interest and charges Mr Y paid on loan 4 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4, 5 and 6 from Mr Ys credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  7 and 8 should be removed from 
Mr Ys credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give Mr Y a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ys complaint. MYJAR  Limited  
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 February  2020..
