K821x#15complaint
Mr B complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called Elevate 
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr B says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
background
We now know that Mr B took out 17 loans from Sunny between April 2015 and June 2016. 
Ive enclosed a summary  of his borrowing with Sunny, based on the information it provided  
to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
I issued a provisional decision (summary attached) in March  2020, comprehensively setting 
out why I thought the complaint should be partly  upheld from the point of loan number 5, 
rather than loan 4, as our adjudicator had recommended. I asked both parties to provide any 
further submissions or information to me within one month. 
my findings
Ive now reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments  to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Mr B accepts my decision and the only point he made was in respect  of the 3 loans which  
were at one time unpaid  and outstanding (loans 8, 16 and 17). He says these have been 
settled a while ago.
Sunny hasnt sent me anything which changes  my provisional decision either.
Theres therefore no reason for me to change the findings  I previously set out. I uphold  this 
complaint in respect of loans 5 - 17, fully in line with my provisional decision.
putting things right
In order to put things  right for Mr B, Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 5 - 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges on these from 
the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  from Mr Bs credit file in relation to loan number 5. 
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 -17 should be completely 
removed from Mr Bs credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr B a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I partly uphold this complaint  and I direct  Elevate Credit 
International Limited to pay Mr B the above  compensation.
Ref: DRN91043512Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I am required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 May 2020.

Ive considered the relevant  information about this complaint. Based on what  Ive seen so far Im 
thinking about  still partially upholding the complaint, but not quite to the extent our adjudicator 
recommended. Ill look at any more comments I get by 18 April 2020. 
complaint
Mr B complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called Elevate Credit  
International Limited, trading  at the time as Sunny. Mr B says he was lent to irresponsibly and the 
loans caused him financial  problems.
To keep things simple  Ill refer mainly  to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know  that Mr B took out 17 loans from Sunny  between April 2015 and June 2016. Ive 
enclosed a summary  of his borrowing with Sunny,  based  on the information  it provided  to us. It can be 
found in the appendix  at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  into the complaint and said they thought it should  be upheld from the 
point of loan number 4 onwards. Sunny  didnt agree with the adjudicators view although  it did make 
an alternative offer, which  wasnt  accepted by Mr B. Its therefore come to me for an ombudsmans 
decision. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  Ive 
followed this approach when  thinking about Mr Bs complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure that Mr B could  repay  the 
loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to have  taken into account  a range  
of different factors, such as the amount being lent, the total repayment amount and the consumers 
income and expenditure.  
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate. However,  certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should have 
fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during which 
a customer has been given  loans  (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that 
the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point,  as in this case, where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates  that the lending was unsustainable.  So Sunny was required to establish  whether  
Ref: DRN91043515Mr B could sustainably repay the loans, not just whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the re-payments  being affordable on this basis  might be an indication  that Mr B could 
sustainably make  them.  But it doesnt automatically follow  that this is the case. This is because the 
relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular, the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments 
as well as without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. So, it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought to have fairly and reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if they are unlikely  to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Our adjudicator said they thought  the complaint  about loan numbers 1 - 3 ought  not to be upheld. 
There seems  no real dispute  about this and I also agree.
But the adjudicator said that by loan number 4, there were signs that Mr B was having problems 
managing money.  However, whilst I dont doubt that Mr B may well have been having problems when 
he took out loan 4, I bear in mind what Ive said above about the length of the lending  relationship. 
And I think the financial  checks which  Sunny  most likely carried for loan 4 would have been the same 
as those carried out for loans  1  3 i.e. quite  basic ones. I also think they were  probably proportionate 
to the lending thus far. 
With that in mind, I dont think the checks which Sunny actually carried out would have necessarily  
revealed an obvious reason not to lend to Mr B for loan 4. By then Mr B had already paid off 2 
previous loans (1 and 2) successfully and the income he declared as having each month did appear 
to be quite a healthy  [one]. So Im afraid I disagree with our adjudicator about loan 4. I therefore dont 
intend to uphold his complaint about any of the loan numbers 1  4. 
However, I think from the point of loan 5 onwards,  Sunny ought to have been carrying out much more  
comprehensive financial  checks.  These  could  have included verifying all the financial information  hed 
given about his earnings and outgoings and checking his bank statements  for other relevant  
information. I think this was appropriate given  that loan 5 saw another  increase in what  he wanted to 
borrow. Mr B was also being lent money whilst his biggest loan to date (loan 3) was still outstanding.
I think  if Sunny  had carried out better checks at this point it would have seen Mr B was having  money  
problems and was also regularly using on-line  gambling  sites. These important revelations  would 
have shown that lending to him was harmful. I therefore intend  to uphold the complaint in relation to 
loan 5 and all those thereafter.
This is because in addition to him having these money problems and the lending being  harmful, I think  
by loan 6 onwards, there was also an emerging  pattern of repeated lending becoming very clear. By 
then, hed been borrowing repeatedly and regularly with Sunny for almost 4 months and this pattern 
should have caused Sunny  to see that he wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term cash-flow  
problems; he was borrowing  regularly, to address shortfalls in his income  and to meet  an ongoing 
need. Mr B was having to consistently take out high interest, short-term  lending  over a sustained 
period and the indebtedness  caused  by this type of borrowing was also harmful, in my view. 
Loans 7 and 8 showed  the amount being borrowed substantially rising  again and he was lent to a 
repeatedly after that until the end of the chain  when hed been lent to some 17 times in around 14 
months. So Im also upholding this complaint in respect of loans  6 - 17. For these particular loans 
Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr B in an unsustainable manner because:
 
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use, over an extended period; and
the length  of time over which Mr B borrowed  was likely to have had negative  implications on 
his ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these  high-cost loans

I am intending to partially uphold Mr Bs complaint and direct Elevate Credit  International Limited,  to 
put things right for Mr B as set out above.
