K820x#14complaint
Mr I complains that Barclays  Bank  UK PLC returned the cheque he wrote out to his 
management company  unpaid.  
background
Barclays said the cheque  was not signed  in accordance with the signature mandate.  It asked 
Mr I to sign the cheque  in accordance with the mandate, or make  alternative arrangements 
for payment. 
Our investigator did not recommend that the complaint should  be upheld. She said Barclays  
was entitled to return a cheque if it detected a problem. Mr I disagreed,  so the case  has 
been passed to me to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusions as our investigator  and for broadly the same  reasons. 
I understand Mr Is frustration that the cheque was returned. Yet where Barclays  has 
concerns about  the veracity of a signature, it has to be entitled to defer  payment of the 
cheque.
And I can see that our investigator asked Barclays if there were any other reasons that the 
cheque may have been flagged up. Barclays said its system may also have picked up on the 
cheque because there was writing  of an additional payee line over the top of the cheque.  
This could  have caused detection. And the date on the cheque  was blocked out which 
added to the issues around  the cheque. 
So based  on the overall circumstances  of this case, I do not believe that I can reasonably  
conclude that Barclays was not entitled to return the cheque as unpaid.  
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about Barclays  Bank UK PLC.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 May 2019.
