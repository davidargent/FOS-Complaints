DRN-4239200
The complaint
Mr D complains about the closure of his account with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and 
that the money in his account was blocked. 
What happened
Mr D received a large payment into his account with PayPal and this was flagged for 
identification checks. Mr D says he provided the correct documents, but his account was 
limited, and the money withheld. Later Mr D was able to withdraw most of the money, but 
PayPal withheld £2,500. 
Mr D contacted PayPal and was told that he had breached its terms and conditions by 
opening an account under the age of 18. Mr D was now 25 years old, so he logged a 
complaint with PayPal. 
PayPal looked into the complaint but didnt uphold it. So, Mr D brought his complaint to our 
service.  
Our investigator looked into the complaint and thought it should be upheld. Our investigator 
said that the decision to hold Mr Ds money and close his account was unfair. He 
recommended PayPal pay Mr D £400 compensation for the trouble and upset it caused. 
PayPal didnt agree with the investigators view. So, the complaints been passed to me for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive decided to uphold this complaint, for largely the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ill explain why. 
PayPal has said in its response to our service that Mr D agreed to the User Agreement when 
underage, and this makes it invalid. PayPal has also said Mr D is free to open another 
account and sign up to the same User Agreement. As its my understanding that the same 
User Agreement is used for all accounts, this seems like an inconvenience to Mr D thats not 
required and doesnt achieve anything. 
Mr D may have been underage when he opened his PayPal account and if it had picked up 
on this at that time and limited his account, Id be satisfied it was fair. Given Mr D is now the 
required age and does qualify for the same account, it wouldve made more sense to allow 
him to continue with his original account. 
PayPal also seems to be indicating that the User Agreement is invalid, as Mr D was 
underage when he opened the account, but this is the same User Agreement that PayPal is 
relying on when it has decided to limit and close the account. So again, this makes little 
logical sense to me. 
When limiting Mr Ds account, PayPal has also held some of Mr Ds funds. Given that Im 
satisfied it was unfairly in the first place, I find it also unfair they deprived Mr D of this money. 
And I agree with the investigator that Mr D should be compensated for not being able to 
access and use this money. 
In summary and in the circumstances of this complaint, taking all the information Ive been 
given by both parties into account, Ive found some discretion needed to be applied by 
PayPal here and by limiting and closing the account, Mr D has been treated unfairly. This 
has in turn caused trouble and upset that I believe Mr D should be compensated for.
Putting things right
PayPal should pay Mr D a total of £400 for the trouble and upset the limitation and closing of 
his account caused him. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and require PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
to pay Mr D in line with the above award. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 November 2023.
