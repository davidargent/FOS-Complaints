The complaint
Mrs G complains that a payment was delayed by BlaBla Connect Limited trading as PassTo 
(PassTo). 
What happened
Mrs G wanted to make a currency transfer to India on 22 August 2020. PassTo asked for 
more information from Mrs G. She provided this. She was then asked to resubmit the 
payment request. She did this on 24 August 2020 and the payment was then made.
Mrs G complained. She said the delay meant she got a worse exchange rate. She wants 
PassTo to honour the exchange rate from 22 August 2020.
PassTo replied. They said the payment on 22 August 2020 was held as they wanted to 
undertake regulatory checks. To do this, they asked Mrs G to provide some more 
information. She did this on the same day. PassTo said to Mrs G that the checks were 
passed - but she needed to re-submit the transfer request as the exchange rate had 
changed. They must carry out checks for regulatory purposes  and to protect customers. 
Where this happens, the exchange rate may change  as they are constantly fluctuating. 
Mrs G brought her complaint to this service. Our investigator looked at what had happened. 
In January 2021, he said he was satisfied PassTo could carry out the checks  this was 
within their terms and conditions. He said the checks were reasonable ones to make. And 
that it was fair for them to ask Mrs G to resubmit her payment request. When she did this  
on 24 August 2020, the exchange rate had got worse. This was unfortunate, but that was out 
of PassTos control. He didnt recommend that PassTo do anymore.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs G believes that PassTo shouldve kept the exchange rate for her while they considered 
the information that shed sent to them. I can see she feels strongly about this.
All firms carrying out currency payments - like PassTo - must carry out regulatory checks as 
part of doing business. And PassTos terms and conditions allow them to hold payments 
while they make regulatory checks. They say: Risk-Based Holds: We may, in our sole 
discretion, place a hold on any or all of the payments you receive when we believe there 
may be a high level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your 
transactions. Our determination may be based on different factors and we may rely on 
information it receives from third parties. If we place a hold on a payment, the funds will 
appear in your pending balance and the payment status will indicate the hold.
Ive looked at the emails between Mrs G and PassTo on 22 August 2020. In an email at 
10.11am, PassTo asked Mrs G for certain information. They also said: Meanwhile your 
transaction will remain holding until we receive the above requested information and once 
we have received the above information we will review and endeavour to progress your 
transaction as quickly as possible.  They didnt say they would hold the exchange rate  and 
said they would do their best to sort things out as soon as possible. 
Mrs G provided the information at 11.39am. At 14.19pm, PassTo said: We are pleased to 
confirm that your transaction is now approved, however unfortunately both did fail due to 
exchange rate is a fast changing process.
Therefore, could you please resubmit your transfer request which we will ensure it`s 
completeness with no further delays.
So, PassTo took two hours 40 minutes to look at the information Mrs G had sent to them  
and approve the transaction. I think this is reasonable. I have found nothing in PassTos 
terms of business which says that they fix exchange rates  and given that they do fluctuate, 
it seems reasonable to me that they asked Mrs G to make the payment request again  this 
would make sure that Mrs G would be happy with the new exchange rate. 
PassTo have said to us that if shed made the request again on 22 August 2020, theres a 
good chance it would have been processed on that day and at the rate on that day  but she 
didnt, as she made the request again on 24 August 2020. So, I dont think its fair to expect 
PassTo to have held the exchange rate for another two days. 
So, while Mrs G will be disappointed by my decision, I think that PassTo acted reasonably 
here  and I wont be asking them to do anymore. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2021.
