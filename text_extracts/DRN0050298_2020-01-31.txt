K820x#14Complaint
Mrs B complains that Barclays Bank UK Plc wont raise a chargeback claim for a holiday 
club membership she paid for in 2015.  
Background
On 3 July 2015 Mrs B paid £3,000 by Visa debit card to a business  for a holiday 
club/timeshare membership. Mrs B says that on 15 July 2015 she paid a further £9,000  to 
the business. 
Mrs B explains that the service provided had been misrepresented and in 2018 she asked 
Barclays to raise a chargeback to retrieve both payments. But Barclays said that it couldnt  
process a chargeback claim  as it hadnt  been  raised within the time limits allowed by Visa.  
Mrs B referred her complaint to our service but the investigator thought  Barclays  decision 
was reasonable.  She also said that Barclays couldnt trace  the £9,000 payment Mrs B says 
she made. Mrs B asked to appeal  so her complaint has been passed  to me to make  a 
decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Mrs B is upset. She paid a lot of money for a service  that she says 
was misrepresented and mis-sold. But, under this complaint I can only look at whether 
Barclays decision not to process a chargeback  claim for Mrs B was reasonable. 
Id like to begin  by talking about  the £9,050 payment Mrs B made. Barclays  says it cant  
trace that payment.  And Mrs B has sent us in a bank statement from another  bank  (not 
Barclays) that shows she paid £9,050 by online transfer on 6 August 2015. Whilst I can see 
Mrs B made a payment on 6 August 2015, it was from another  bank. So its not something 
Barclays could claim back under the chargeback  rules. 
The £3,000 payment was made by Visa debit card payment on 15 July 2015. But as 
Barclays and the investigator have already said, there are a number of time limits for raising  
a chargeback claim. The time limit that would have  given Mrs B the most amount of time to 
raise a claim  is 540 days from the date of the transaction. In this case, Mrs B asked Barclays  
to raise the claim in June  2018, around 1,000  days after the payment was made.  Im very 
sorry to disappoint  Mrs B but that means the claim wasnt raised within the time limits  given 
in the rules. So Barclays couldnt process  a chargeback  claim for Mrs B. 
I know Mrs B has genuine concerns over the service  she paid for. And I make  no comment  
on whether the holiday  club services  were mis-sold to her. This complaint only deals with 
Barclays decision to decline Mrs Bs request to raise  a chargeback claim in June 2018. 
As Ive said above,  the £9,050 payment  was made  from another bank so Barclays couldnt 
reclaim it for Mrs B. And the £3,000 card payment couldnt be reclaimed because  the 
chargeback claim wasnt raised in time.  Im very sorry to disappoint Mrs B but Im satisfied 
Barclays' actions were reasonable and that its dealt with her complaint fairly. As a result, Im 
not telling  it to take any further action. 
Ref: DRN00502982My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2020.
