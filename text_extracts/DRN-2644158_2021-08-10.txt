The complaint
Mrs R says Hamsard 3225 Limited trading as CLC Finance (CLC) lent to her irresponsibly. 
She says she was unemployed when she took the loans and she was already in financial 
difficulty. She thinks CLC shouldve found out about this and not lent to her. Instead it 
encouraged her to borrow more despite having repayment problems. 
What happened
This complaint is about 33 home collected loans CLC provided to Mrs R between 
October 2008 and March 2015. Ive included a table below that contains some of the

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. Initially she thought that CLC couldve done 
more to establish if the loans were affordable by loan 6. But she didnt have enough to 
uphold the complaint at this point. She thought that the lending pattern itself looked to be 
unsustainable by loan 9. 
It later came to light that another business was responsible for loans 1 to 10. CLC had taken 
over this business but it didnt have responsibility for the sale of these loans until 
15 December 2020 onwards. So, she clarified that CLC shouldnt have lent from loan 11 
onwards due to the pattern of lending itself becoming problematic by this point. 
CLC disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It said that:
It fully assessed Mrs Rs creditworthiness before each loan to ensure she could 
make the repayments.
The point of sale documentation supports this, it shows that her indebtedness was 
reducing.
These assessments took into account repeat lending. Again, the point of sale 
documentation supports that the loans were taken by choice and were affordable. 
The loans were for discrete purchases each time.
It referred to a recent court case where the judge had said that a consumer would 
have gone elswhere if a business didnt lend. So no compensation is due as Mrs R 
wouldve likely incurred lending costs in any event.
Mrs R didnt disagree with the adjudicators opinion. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, 
to issue a decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
CLC needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs R could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  But certain factors might point to the fact that CLC should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Mrs Rs complaint in part and Ive explained why below.
This Service has responded to CLC on some of the issues raised in response to this 
complaint in detail through other final decisions it has received, and the published decisions 
on our website. So, Im not going deal with these points at length here.
I will say that I consider it reasonable to describe this lending as high cost credit, as does the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  who is the current regulator. The FCA includes home 
collected credit within its identified high cost credit cohort. And while I note it has a longer 
term than, for example, a payday loan, that does not make it a low risk, or inexpensive, 
option for a consumer. And, as such, long-term use of these products can be harmful to a 
consumer. The FCA has not said anything to the contrary on this point. I have considered 
these issues alongside everything else in making my decision.
As Ive said above loans 1 to 10 were sold to Mrs R by a separate business. Whilst CLC did 
purchase any active loans sold before 15 December 2020, it didnt take on responsibility for 
the sale of the loans before this time. These loans are the responsibility of another business. 
But CLC was aware of them when it arranged loan 11 onwards to So it is something I will 
take into account when considering the other loans Mrs R took.
CLC says that the checks it made were proportionate. Its provided application data for some 
of the lending which it says shows this. And it says that these checks also considered repeat 
lending. 
But there isnt a great deal of detail in the application data Ive seen. I think its fair to say it 
doesnt really get to the bottom of Mrs Rs financial circumstances or why she was taking 
these loans. The information recorded is very brief. I dont think its relevant for CLC to now 
say the information Mrs R had provided shows the loans may have become more affordable 
over time. This is because going forward CLC shouldve been fully looking into Mrs Rs 
circumstances rather than relying on what she provided.But most importantly, as Ive outlined above, the regulators guidance is clear in that the 
longer a lending relationship exists the more a business should do to make sure the lending 
is right for the consumer. CLC hasnt done this. As far as I can see it has followed the same 
sales process throughout. I dont think this is right. 
Notwithstanding my concerns about the sales process itself, Ive looked at the overall pattern 
of CLCs lending history with Mrs R, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which CLC 
should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. 
And so CLC should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Rs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 11. I say this because:
Mrs R had been indebted to another business for around two years and CLC was 
aware of this. The loans were intended to run for around five to six months, so CLC 
could have perhaps expected a longer time of indebtedness. But there was no 
indication at this time that Mrs R would be able to stop or reduce her borrowing at 
loan 11. This indicates to me she was reliant on this credit. 
Right from the start Mrs R was provided with a new loan within a short time of settling 
an earlier one, or when she hadnt repaid her existing loans. So, there wasnt an 
appreciable time when Mrs R wasnt in debt to CLC. 
Loan 11 was for £140, twice the amount of loan 1, so Mrs R s debt was increasing. 
At this point CLC ought to have known that Mrs R was not likely borrowing to meet a 
shorter-term need for income but to meet an ongoing requirement. 
Due to the above, there wasnt a clear picture of decreasing or managed 
indebtedness. Rather there was a pattern of maintaining or repeated and increasing 
borrowing. I think taking out 11 longer term high cost loans, over this period, is a 
strong indicator that Mrs R was starting to struggle financially.
And CLC has indicated that Mrs R started the loans for discrete yearly expenditures 
such as holidays, Christmas and house or car maintenance. And whilst Ive not seen 
this detailed in the point of sale information, I accept this may be the case. 
It isnt necessarily or automatically unreasonable to use this type of credit to do this. 
But using a high cost form of borrowing over a prolonged period is still likely to have 
caused financial problems, and in this case the evidence suggests it left Mrs R with 
little alternative but to borrow again in the future, when these yearly expenditures 
were likely to be incurred again, as she did.
So, because of the above factors, CLC ought to have realised it was more likely than not that 
Mrs Rs indebtedness was unsustainable at loan 11.
Mrs R didnt make any real inroads to the amount she owed CLC. Loan 33 was taken over 
seven years after Mrs Rs first. So, the harmful pattern I think CLC should have been aware 
of at loan 11 continued. Mrs R had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt 
to CLC over a very long time.
I think that Mrs R lost out because CLC continued to provide borrowing from loan 11 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Rs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs R borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mrs Rs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.Putting things right
In its submissions to us, CLC has talked about the 2020 High Court judgement in the case of 
Kerrigan vs Elevate Credit International Limited. CLC drew on the Courts findings to 
question assumptions about what might have happened had it declined the lending in 
question, and so Mrs R had had to apply to a third-party lender. 
In deciding what redress CLC should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Mrs R from loan 11, as Im satisfied it ought to 
have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs R may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Mrs R in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mrs R would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce CLCs liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
CLC shouldnt have given Mrs R loans 11 to 33.
A) CLC should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs R towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything 
it has already refunded.
B) CLC should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs R 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs R originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) CLC should pay Mrs R the total of A plus B.
D) The overall pattern of Mrs Rs borrowing for loans 11 to 33 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Mrs Rs credit 
file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs Mrs R requires CLC to deduct tax from this interest. CLC should 
give Mrs R a certificate showing how much tax CLC has deducted, if they ask for one.
My final decisionFor the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mrs Rs complaint.
Hamsard 3225 Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 September 2021.
