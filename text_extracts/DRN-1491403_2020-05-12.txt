DRN-1491403
 
The complaint
Mr D complains John Lewis Financial Services Limited (John Lewis) have made mistakes 
on his credit card account.
What happened
Mr D told us the statement of 27 October 2019 for his credit card account showed an 
incorrect balance for that month of £53.19 rather than £13.19, which he thought it should 
have been. He thought this was evidence of a further mistake made by John Lewis in 
respect of his credit card account with them. 
John Lewis told us Mr D hadnt complained to them about this. They said the balance in the 
statement was correct and later sent us evidence from their records to show a goodwill 
payment - relating to another matter - was made on 9 October 2019.
Our investigator didnt uphold this complaint. She initially thought the complaint related to the 
statement charging Mr D £53.19 rather than £13.19. She itemised the transactions which 
came to £53.19 so was satisfied the statement was correct. Mr D didnt agree with this view 
and told us he didnt dispute the spending of £53.19 which hed been charged for but rather 
that he hadnt received a £40 credit  which John Lewis agreed to pay as a goodwill gesture 
for online access issues. He told us this had never been credited to him and asked us to look 
again at the matter.
The investigator told Mr D shed interpreted his initial email and call raising this matter as 
him being unhappy with the balance being incorrect and not about £40 unpaid 
compensation. After making further enquiries with John Lewis she told Mr D she was 
satisfied theyd made the £40 goodwill payment. Mr D didnt agree and told us he hadnt 
received the £40 into his bank account or as a credit in his credit card statement - which he 
said the investigator had seen and had confirmed there was no £40 credit coming in. He 
asked for the matter to be put forward for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see from the internal records John Lewis sent to us they made a payment of £40 on 9 
October 2019. Mr Ds own evidence, his credit card statement of 27 October 2019, has an 
entry for the same date - 9 October 2019  marked adjustment to your account showing a 
£40 credit to his account. This appears on the second page of the statement just under the 
list of transactions from 27 to 28 September 2019 which the investigator itemised in her 
view.  So Im satisfied Mr Ds had the goodwill payment of £40 and that its been correctly 
applied to his account but to the balance from the previous month.The front page of the statement showed Mr Ds previous balance due as £646.03. His 
payment to the account of £606.03 - itemised on the second page as being made by direct 
debit on 22 October 2019  although being £40 less than the amount due has cleared the 
account. Thats due to the £40 credit on 9 October 2019. So its entirely right that the new 
balance showing on the account for the October statement is the full amount of spending 
itemised for this month of £53.19.
So, for the reasons Ive explained, from everything Ive seen, I dont think John Lewis have 
failed to pay the £40 credit or have made any mistakes in Mr Ds statement of account. So I 
dont require them to do anything further. 
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 June 2020.
