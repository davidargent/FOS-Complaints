K821x#15complaint
Ms R complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA closed her account without 
explanation, and that one of its call handlers  was rude.
background
In February 2019,  Ms Rs PayPal account  was closed.  She phoned PayPal about this, and 
she says its call handler was condescending  and sarcastic.  She complained to PayPal by 
email, and the next day PayPal replied to her email address to say that she had violated its 
user agreement. It did not explain what  the violation was, or further elaborate.  In May she 
complained to our Service, via a claims management company (CMC).
PayPal refused to co-operate with our Services investigation, although it is subject  to our 
voluntary jurisdiction. It said it is not its policy to respond to complaints from third parties, 
including CMCs, even  though Ms R had complained directly to PayPal herself  in February,  
without any intermediary, and PayPal had replied to her own email  address, the same  one 
that was registered to her account.  On 21 October 2019 my colleague, ombudsman Ken 
Rose, issued a jurisdiction  decision in which he held that as PayPal had had eight weeks  to 
resolve Ms Rs complaint since she had first complained  which she had done  herself,  
without using a CMC, and which PayPal had clearly received and acknowledged   the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  clearly had power  to consider this complaint. PayPal did not 
challenge that decision, save  to the extent that it still refused to co-operate.
On 31 October one of our investigators issued a decision based solely  on Ms Rs evidence, 
since PayPal had provided no evidence or meaningful explanation for its actions.  She said 
that she didnt  have enough information to consider whether PayPal had closed Ms Rs 
account fairly. So she upheld this complaint and recommended that PayPal  pay Ms R £150 
compensation for her inconvenience. No reply was received from PayPal, and so this case 
has been referred to me for an ombudsmans decision.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I uphold it, for broadly the same  reasons 
as our investigator.
I am disappointed that PayPal has chosen not to co-operate with my colleagues  
investigation of this complaint. PayPals explanation for why it is not co-operating flies in the 
face of the facts. It says it does not accept complaints made via CMCs, even though this 
complaint was not made via a CMC but by Ms R in person, using the email  address 
registered to her PayPal  account. PayPal knows this, since  it replied to that email,  and so 
I cannot accept  that PayPals  refusal  to co-operate, and its explanation for that refusal, have 
been made in good faith. I take that into account.
PayPal has not identified which term of its user agreement it says Ms R violated,  and so its 
not possible to evaluate whether her account was closed correctly.  No evidence  has been 
offered to contradict Ms Rs allegation that its call handler was rude to her. So there  is no 
reason for me to disbelieve Ms Rs account,  and I accept it. I therefore uphold  her complaint 
about both issues.
Ref: DRN15889772I think that £200, rather than £150, better  reflects the inconvenience to Ms R, and is fair 
compensation for her trouble.
my final decision
So my decision is that I uphold this complaint. I order PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay 
Ms R £200.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 March  2020.
