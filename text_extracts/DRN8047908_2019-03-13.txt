K820x#14complaint
Mrs I complains that National  Westminster Bank  Plc (NatWest) hasnt treated her fairly  or 
reasonably when dealing with her mortgage. She wants a large sum in compensation.
background
Mrs I had a mortgage  with NatWest. She began to struggle  to pay the mortgage following 
her husband  becoming seriously ill and complained that NatWest  wasnt  helping  her deal 
with her financial difficulties. This service  investigated the complaint and found that NatWest 
had acted fairly in the circumstances, but reminded  it that as the situation was likely to be 
ongoing, its duty to act fairly also continued  when dealing with Mrs I in the future.
Mrs I then complained that NatWest  wouldnt let her rent out the property initially,  though it 
later agreed. NatWest  agreed that its customer service in relation to this had been poor and 
paid £75 compensation. But it said the complaint previously  dealt with by this service  
wouldnt be re-opened, and paid an extra £225  compensation  for sending Mrs Is account to 
its litigation team in error.
Mrs I complained to us. The adjudicators view was that the complaints previously 
considered by the service couldnt  be re-opened.  But we were able to look at what  had 
happened since October 2017. The adjudicator noted that NatWest did initially  refuse to let 
Mrs I rent out her property, but then agreed and had accepted  that it had handled the 
application poorly. She also noted that NatWest had accepted that it had sent Mrs Is 
account to the litigation  team in error. But the adjudicator  also pointed out that Mrs I was in 
arrears from 2017 onwards and NatWest had tried to speak  to her without success. While 
the adjudicator  agreed that NatWests  customer service  hadnt been good enough, she said 
that it was also entitled  to payment in full and to issue possession proceedings in the 
circumstances (though  it didnt do so). She didnt uphold Mrs Is complaint.
Mrs I disagreed. She said that she wanted a full investigation and NatWest  had been 
negligent. Mrs I re-iterated her view of the complaint and that she felt NatWest had acted 
unfairly and had tried to delay matters.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I cant re-open  the previous final decision 
of this service, which means  I can only look at the events that occurred  from October 2017 
onwards. I should  also point  out that Im required to bear in mind the compensation 
guidelines of this service and compensation  for trouble and upset are rarely, if ever, given for 
the tens of thousands Mrs I seeks.  Money  never truly compensates for trouble and upset 
suffered. Also, complaints  handling  isnt an activity regulated  by this service, though I can 
look at whether NatWest  generally treated Mrs I fairly and reasonably.
Ref: DRN80479082NatWest accepts that it handled Mrs Is request to rent out her property poorly. I agree. It 
also feels that it shouldnt  have referred her account  to the litigation team, though its worth 
noting that legal proceedings werent  issued. That decision is a matter  for NatWest  Mrs I 
was in arrears and legally NatWest was able to issue  possession  proceedings. I thought  
though about whether it was fair and reasonable in the circumstances  to have referred  the 
account to the litigation  team and to have told Mrs I that it was considering issuing 
proceedings (though the threat was withdrawn after about three weeks). As Mr I was clearly 
very ill at the time and Mrs I kept NatWest updated, I think  NatWest  is correct in saying that 
sending the mortgage to the litigation team was a mistake at that time and it hadnt  acted  
fairly.
Mrs I has also said that after October 2017,  NatWest hasnt helped her. She says for 
example that it didnt  make any proposal about a repayment plan. But I can see it got details 
from Mrs I about  her financial situation  and Mrs I did put forward a repayment plan. Indeed, a 
plan was agreed when the property was rented out as Mrs I agreed to use the rent money  to 
pay the mortgage. Mrs I has said that she felt disadvantaged by NatWests failings, but apart  
from the issues identified  above, I cant see that NatWest has acted  unfairly on the basis  of 
the evidence available  to me. Mrs I may wish that NatWest would act as she required,  but it 
wasnt required to do as she demanded and it wasnt  unfair  or unreasonable to refuse.
What compensation  is fair and reasonable for the trouble  and upset caused by the handling  
of the request to rent out the property and the referral of the account  to the litigation team? 
NatWest has paid a total of £300  in compensation. Mrs I says that this doesnt properly 
reflect all the stress  that she has suffered. But compensation can only be given for the 
identified failings of NatWest, not the stress suffered  in connection with the whole situation, 
particularly given the previous decision of this service which  found  NatWest not to be at fault 
prior to October 2017. Looking at the evidence available to me and all the circumstances, I 
think £300 compensation for the trouble  and upset caused by a notification that the litigation 
team was now dealing with the mortgage  (withdrawn shortly afterwards) and the initial  
refusal to allow  the renting out of the property (again, later reversed)  is fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances   I wont  award  compensation for issues where I havent found 
NatWest to be at fault.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs I to accept or reject  my decision before 
13 April 2019.
