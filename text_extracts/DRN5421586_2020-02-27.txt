Miss O has told us that she was given  the loans without sufficient affordability checks. This 
created a spiral  of debt which dramatically impacted her income.
In its final response,  Sunny said it had carried out the necessary checks  including 
affordability checks in order to decide  whether to provide the loan.  It said its records showed  
that out of 10 loan applications Miss O had applied for, it only granted  8. Sunny says this 
illustrated that it did carry out affordability  and creditworthiness  checks  and the amounts 
advanced were  assessed  as being affordable over the term of each loan.
Our adjudicator didnt  think shed seen enough to uphold  Miss Os complain about loans 1-3. 
But she said loans 4-8 shouldnt have been  given to her. Sunny disagreed with this view. It 
said that whilst it could  see Miss O had taken out a number of loans, her declared income 
compared with her monthly  repayment as a percentage  of her income suggests these were  
suitable. It did not accept that the loans  were unaffordable, or that they demonstrated over 
reliance on the product.  It also said that the loans were repaid within the contractual period 
so no evidence of any detriment could be seen. It did however agree to refund the sum of 
£274.05 for loans  4-8 as a gesture of good  will without the interest. Miss O did not respond 
to this offer. As the parties are not in agreement  the complaint has been passed  to me to 
make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN54215862Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss O could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss O could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Os complaint. Having  done  so, Im intending to 
uphold this complaint from loan 4 onwards. I will explain why.
Miss O didnt  disagree with our adjudicators  opinion about loans 1-3. Because  of this I dont  
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So, I wont be making a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Miss O had with Sunny. 
So, they are something  I will take into account when considering the other loans she took.
But going  on to consider  loan 4, I think Sunny did the same checks  for loans 1,2 and 3. 
Despite the short time over which Miss O had been borrowing, she had taken out 4 loans 
within two months and when she applied for loan 4, she was still repaying the first three 
loans. So I think on balance Sunny should have fully reviewed Miss Os finances and carried 
out further checks and taken  steps  to verify Miss Os income and expenditure.
Ref: DRN54215863If Sunny had made these checks it wouldve seen that Miss O was having problems 
managing her money. Her income  was relatively  low at around £850.  The credit  checks  
Sunny did, indicated that Miss O had payday  and instalment loans with other providers. And 
Miss O has provided information that confirms this. And by loan 4, the combined  repayments 
of all the outstanding loans were  a reasonably high proportion of her income.   
And the situation  didnt improve going  forward. Loan 5 was taken out on the same date that 
loan 4 was repaid but nevertheless Miss O still had loan 3 outstanding at that time. By the 
time Miss O requested her sixth loan she did so within one day of applying for loan 5 and 
she still hadnt repaid loan 3. Equally, loan 7 was taken out just over four months  after taking 
out her first loan at which  time she still had loans 3,5 and 6 outstanding.
Ive taken everything into account but I'm not persuaded that Sunny acted responsibly  when 
it provided loans  4-7 to Miss O and as a result,  I think there was a significant risk in this case  
that Miss O would be unable to meet  her repayments in a sustainable  manner for these 
loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss O, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Os case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss O was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss O had taken out 8 loans in around 5 months and she had 
been indebted to Sunny for all that time with no gaps . So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Miss O was having to borrow further  to cover the 
hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Os 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Os first loan was for £100.00 and loan 8 was for £200.00.  So, the amounts 
Miss O was borrowing  had doubled within 5 months  and was taken whilst she still 
had loan 3 outstanding, one of the earlier loans  in her chain of borrowing. So, it 
doesnt seem likely that Miss Os need  for cash was reducing which  points to her 
having a longer term need for funds. And at this point Sunny ought  to have known 
that Miss O was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in her income but 
to meet  an ongoing need. 
Loan 8 was provided to Miss O whilst she still had loan 3 outstanding and within 12 
days of settling loan 7. 
Miss O wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 8 was 
taken out around 5 months after Miss Os first. And it was for a larger  amount. Miss O 
also still had to repay loan 3 when she took out loan 8. So, she had paid large  
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Sunny lost out because Miss O continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
Ref: DRN54215864these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Os indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss O borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Os ability to access  mainstream  credit  and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4-7 and loan 8 and Sunny should  put 
things right.
putting things right 
In order to put things  right for Miss O, Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Miss O paid on loans 4-8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4-7 from Miss Os credit file;
given the length of time Miss O had been  borrowing  from Sunny  any information 
recorded about loan 8 is adverse. So, all entries  about loan 8 should be removed  
from Miss Os credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss O a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Miss Os complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out in the putting  things right section 
above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss O to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 March 2020.
