The complaint
Mr and Mrs G complain that First Holiday Finance Limited has rejected the claims that 
theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
What happened
Mr and Mrs G entered into an acquisition agreement with a holiday company for a holiday 
club membership in February 2011. The purchase price, after a trade in value had been 
deducted, was £16,449 and they also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with First 
Holiday Finance for a loan of that amount.
Mrs G made a claim to First Holiday Finance in April 2019 which it forwarded to the holiday 
company and the holiday company responded to her claim. Mrs G wasnt satisfied with its 
response so Mr and Mrs G complained to this service. They say that they were mis-sold a 
timeshare product so had made a claim to First Holiday Finance under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. She said that the 
time limit applicable for a misrepresentation claim was six years from the date of loss so Mr 
and Mrs G would have needed to raise their claim under section 75 by February 2017 but 
didnt make a claim until 2019. She also said the evidence available didnt appear to show 
that there was an unfair relationship between First Holiday Finance and Mr and Mrs G under 
section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act.
Mrs G has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says, in 
summary, that: the holiday companys methods of obtaining an agreement were unethical 
and irresponsible; First Holiday Finance lent money when they werent financially sound; it 
was a pressurised sale with no guidance on the 14 day cooling off period; shes now 
separated from her husband and has agreed a payment plan but is paying an extortionate 
amount of interest; the holiday company is in voluntary bankruptcy and shes unable to use 
the product due to the management fees and travel costs; and that her outstanding debt 
should be written-off.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of, or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs Gs complaint is that First Holiday Finance turned down the claim that 
theyd made under section 75 and (and our investigator also considered whether 
their relationship with First Holiday Finance was unfair under section 140A) - I accept 
that their complaint was referred to this service within six years of their claim being 
turned down but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to their 
claims;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Gs claims under sections 75 and 
140A in this decision as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering 
whether or not First Holiday Finances response to those claims was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Gs claim under section 75 is holiday club membership was 
misrepresented to them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to them - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, First 
Holiday Finance would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was 
brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case the claim 
would be time-barred;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr and Mrs G could have made a claim to the holiday company or 
First Holiday Finance about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into 
buying the membership soon after they entered into the acquisition agreement in 
February 2011 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations would have 
been made and any loss would have been incurred as that was when they also 
entered into a loan agreement with First Holiday Finance;
I consider that Mr and Mrs Gs cause of action accrued in February 2011, so they 
would have had six years from then to bring any claim under section 75 against First 
Holiday Finance  but a claim wasnt made to First Holiday Finance until April 2019, 
more than eight years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act so I consider that their claim under section 75 is now time-barred;
our investigator also considered their claim under section 140A which gives a court 
the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the 
debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship 
between the debtor and the creditor;
Mr and Mrs G signed the acquisition agreement and immediately above their 
signatures it says, in capitals: You have the right to cancel this agreement. You have 
until [specified date in March 2011] in which to do so  Please refer to the end of the 
agreement for further details of your cancellation rights;
Mr and Mrs G also signed the loan agreement and the same words were immediately 
above their signatures in capitals;
I consider that Mr and Mrs G ought reasonably to have been aware of their right to 
cancel those agreements, but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that 
they tried to cancel the acquisition agreement or the loan agreement within the 
cancellation periods;Mr and Mrs G also signed an application form for the loan which showed that their 
total annual income was £68,000, they were homeowners and had monthly 
outgoings of £1,439  the monthly payment under the loan agreement was £234.42 
so I consider that it was reasonable for First Holiday Finance to conclude, on the 
basis of that information, that the loan was affordable for them at that time;
Mr and Mrs G have now separated and Mrs G has described the financial difficulties 
that shes experiencing  I sympathise with her for those circumstances but those 
events have occurred since the loan was made to her and Im not persuaded that 
shes provided enough evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for them in 
February 2011 or that it was irresponsible for First Holiday Finance to have made the 
loan to them;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs G were 
unduly pressured into buying the membership or entering into the loan agreement or 
that the holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices against them  
Mrs G didnt complain to First Holiday Finance about those issues until April 2019  
more than eight years after they entered into the loan agreement and I consider that 
it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained to First Holiday Finance 
about any such issues before then;
Mrs G says that the holiday company is in voluntary bankruptcy and shes unable to 
use the product due to the management fees and travel costs  its my understanding 
that a company related to the holiday company is in voluntary bankruptcy but that the 
holiday company is still operating and that the services that were to be provided 
under the acquisition agreement continue to be provided;
the holiday company says that Mr and Mrs Gs holiday club membership was 
suspended for non-payment of the 2014 management fees  Mr and Mrs G signed a 
members declaration in which they agreed to be liable for the management fees 
which the declaration said were calculated on the basis set out in the memorandum 
and articles of association of the holiday company and the scheme rules and 
regulations;
the management fees have increased and Mrs G says that she couldnt afford them  
I consider that a clearer explanation of the management fees would have been 
helpful but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday 
company has acted incorrectly in connection with the management fees;
if Mrs G now wishes to use the services that were to be provided under the 
acquisition agreement I suggest that she contacts the holiday company to discuss 
the options that are available to her;
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs G for the issues that theyve had with their 
memberships and the difficulties that theyve experienced, but Im not persuaded that 
its likely that a court would find that the relationship between First Holiday Finance 
and Mr and Mrs G was unfair in these circumstances;
Mrs G says that shes agreed a payment plan with First Holiday Finance but if shes 
still experiencing financial difficulties and is unable to make those payments she 
should contact First Holiday Finance  its required to respond to any such difficulties 
positively and sympathetically; and
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require First Holiday Finance to write-off the outstanding amount of Mr and Mrs Gs 
loan, to refund to them any of the money that theyve paid under the loan agreement, 
to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in response to their 
complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs G to 
accept or reject my decision before 4 November 2022.
