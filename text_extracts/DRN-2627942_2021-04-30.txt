The complaint
Mr S, who lives abroad, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wont agree to a 
transfer of title on his mortgage to allow him to transfer half the title of a property he owns in 
the UK to his wife who also lives abroad. Mr S wants NatWest to permit the transfer of title.
What happened
Mr S has a property in the UK and, since 2012, a mortgage on it in his sole name. Mr S lives 
abroad and has a consent to let on the property. Mr S is doing some financial planning and 
wants to change the ownership of the property into joint names so that in the event of the 
death of one of them there will be automatic ownership of the property by the surviving 
spouse.
NatWest said that it couldnt facilitate Mr S as Mr and Mrs S lived abroad and had no plans 
to return to the UK. NatWest said that it had a policy that existing customers of NatWest can 
no longer request a Transfer of Title application if the party being added is resident outside 
the UK. Our investigator didnt recommend that that this application should be upheld as her 
view was that this was a legitimate use by NatWest of its commercial judgement. Mr S 
disagreed and asked for a review. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr S wants to make a significant change to his mortgage. He wants to add another party to 
the mortgage, namely his wife who lives abroad. NatWest wont agree to that. It says that 
under its ex-pat rules related to legal jurisdiction that it wont accept an application for a 
Transfer of Title if the party being added is resident outside the UK. 
Mr S cant see any reference to this in the terms and conditions of his mortgage, but I 
wouldnt expect that there would be a reference to it there, as the mortgage contract is 
between Mr S and NatWest. Mrs S isnt a party to the mortgage. Mr Ss application is 
effectively asking NatWest to add a third party to the contract - to amend the mortgage 
contract - and NatWest doesnt agree. It isnt NatWest which is asking for a change but Mr S. 
The reason for its refusal is that it has a policy against adding non-UK residents to existing 
mortgages and Mrs S is such a person. NatWest as a commercial entity can decide on a 
policy as to whether it wants to provide mortgages to residents of non-UK jurisdictions or not. 
Its not our role to decide on its commercial policy. The refusal of course has nothing to do 
with Mr S and I appreciate that he may have a good financial standing and credit history. But 
that doesnt mean that NatWest is required to join Mrs S to the mortgage. Unfortunately, Mrs 
S cant join in the mortgage as Mr S wants but I cant fairly say that NatWest has done 
anything wrong, so I dont uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 May 2021.
