K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA withheld  a payment hed received for 
the sale of some goods. 
background
Mr M sold an item through  an online auction site in December  2018. But PayPal withheld his 
payment of Â£99. He said PayPal told him it was waiting for a tracking  number. But the item 
was collection only. He wants to know why the payment was taken from the buyer but not 
passed on immediately.  His PayPal account had a temporary limitation placed on it which 
limited his access. And it stopped him withdrawing his money.  
Mr M was told PayPal  needed proof of identity before it would unlock the account. But he 
was concerned about the security issues of passing  his personal information to PayPal. And 
PayPal decided to close his account without  replying to his questions. His money was still 
being held on account. And it was causing  him financial  problems.  
PayPal said it understood it was frustrating when payments were withheld. It explained 
payment holds were  common practice  for new or relatively inexperienced sellers.  It was 
designed to provide a safe environment for buyers  and sellers in case  there  were  problems 
with the transaction. Because Mr M hadnt  used a tracking service to deliver the goods 
PayPal said it was required to hold onto the funds. And it needed to confirm  Mr Ms identity.
Mr M wasnt satisfied  with PayPals response. So he contacted  our service and our 
investigator looked into the matter. She looked at the terms and conditions of the user 
agreement Mr M had accepted with PayPal. And the terms confirmed PayPal had the right to 
review certain payments  at their discretion. She appreciated Mr M couldnt provide tracking 
or delivery  confirmation  as the buyer had collected the goods in person. But itd asked  for 
further information to verify the account.  And Mr M had decided not to provide it. So she 
couldnt say PayPal had applied the terms unfairly  or incorrectly.
Mr M didnt  agree. He felt it was unreasonable to expect anyone  to provide copies of 
passports or similar information  to a stranger at PayPal. And he had no confidence his 
money would  be returned  within the 180 day limit stated in PayPals terms. So hes asked for 
an ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how frustrating this mustve  been  for Mr M. He sold some goods  online and 
expected to receive the payment promptly. But PayPal didnt release the funds. And his 
account has now been closed. So Ive looked  carefully at everything Mr M and PayPal have 
said.
The role of this service is to consider whether PayPal has made any mistakes when it held 
onto Mr Ms funds. And if so, what  it needs to do to put things right.  So Ive looked  at the 
user agreement Mr M accepted when  he opened his PayPal account.
Ref: DRN25909882Section 5.2 details  the payment review PayPal may carry out on transactions in certain 
circumstances. In Mr Ms case PayPal determined it was necessary to place a hold on the 
payment until itd completed the review and found  the payment to be in order.  PayPal asked 
for tracking  information  to confirm delivery.  But, as Mr M has pointed  out, the item was 
collection only. So he wasnt able to do so. However the buyer  of Mr Ms goods  did contact 
PayPal to say hed collected the item and his funds should be released to Mr M.
I can see PayPal contacted Mr M in January 2019  to say it needed to validate Mr Ms details. 
PayPal asked Mr M for proof of identity. But Mr M felt this was unnecessary and potentially 
exposed him to identity  fraud. And I understand Mr Ms concerns. But it is important that 
businesses like PayPal are able to confirm certain details before passing on funds. Financial 
organisations are constantly being targeted by fraudsters.  And they have to try and find the 
right level of checking and protection to safeguard  their customers  without applying 
unnecessary or burdensome ways of doing  so. 
The user agreement does  allow PayPal to ask for additional information  from Mr M. And 
even if he didnt think it was appropriate I cant really say PayPal has done anything wrong in 
asking for it. Mr M agreed to the terms and conditions of the account. I can see PayPal has 
written to Mr M to confirm  the request for identification wasnt intended to suggest  any 
wrongdoing on his part  or invade  his privacy in any way. But it does need to verify the 
account before it can release the funds.
I know Mr M feels it is unacceptable for PayPal to continue  to hold onto his funds. As far as 
he is concerned the goods were delivered  to the seller, the seller has paid and confirmed he 
has received the item. 
My role is to see if PayPal has done  anything wrong. And, based  on what  Ive seen, PayPal 
has acted within the terms and conditions of the account. But Ive asked PayPal to clarify  the 
current position and it has now agreed to release the funds. The account will remain limited. 
But if Mr M logs into his account  he should  be able to withdraw the funds at his convenience. 
Although I cant uphold Mr Ms complain I am pleased to see PayPal has agreed to release 
his money before the 180 day limit.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 July 2019.
