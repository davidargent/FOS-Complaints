K820x#14complaint
Ms L complains that MoneyGram International Limited (MoneyGram) released  a money 
transfer intended for her, to an unknown third party.
background
Ms Ls mother  sent £700 to her through MoneyGram. When Ms L went  to collect the 
transfer, she was told the funds  had already been taken.
Ms L complained, saying  she wanted  MoneyGram to pay her the money shed lost out on. 
MoneyGram issued its final response  to Ms Ls complaint on 1 February 2019. It said it 
released the money to someone  who identified  themselves as Ms L. The recipient provided  
the transactions unique reference,  along with photographic  identification and confirmed the 
correct names of the sender and receiver.
It said it was contractually obliged to release the funds  on receipt of the above, and that it 
couldnt uphold  Ms Ls complaint, given it had followed  the correct steps.
Our investigator didnt  agree. He said the date of birth, phone number and address given by 
the recipient didnt match the details for Ms L. So he thought MoneyGram hadnt carried  out 
satisfactory checks, and said it should refund Ms L.
MoneyGram didnt agree,  so it asked for an ombudsman to review  the matter  afresh.
On 16 June 2021, I issued a provisional  decision. In it, I said:
When  Ms Ls mother arranged for MoneyGram  to send  £700 to Ms L, she completed 
MoneyGrams standard form that included various details for herself, but limited details for 
Ms L: i.e. only her full name. Ms Ls mother was given a unique transaction  reference 
number (UTRN),  which  is the code required to enable the recipient to collect the funds.
In order to collect funds,  the recipient had to present  the UTRN  as well as photographic 
identification confirming  their name. The receivers form completed in relation to this 
transaction included the correct UTRN, senders name and Ms Ls full name. It also included  
an address, phone number, date of birth and place  of birth that differs  to the information
Ms L has given our service.  So, on the face of it, it appears that Ms L didnt in fact collect the 
money intended for her.
However, MoneyGram didnt have  Ms Ls correct address, phone number, date of birth or 
place of birth. The only details it had for her was her full name. So, it wasnt able to check  
whether or not the details  presented  by the person who collected the money matched those 
of the senders intended recipient. 
Moneygram says the receiver  presented  a Passport that matched its identification 
requirements. It didnt retain  a copy of the Passport  (its not its policy to do so), so I cant say 
if the ID matched  presented matched Ms Ls name.
But what  I can say is that the information  Ive seen that was provided to MoneyGram  
matched the information it had on file, including the UTRN which  was only known to 
MoneyGram, Ms L and her mother. It appears then that the collection details were  
compromised or intercepted somewhere along the way. But I havent seen any evidence  as 
Ref: DRN43434942to how that mightve  happened, so Ive based my decision on whether or not MoneyGram 
took reasonable care to release the funds to the correct  person.
I accept Ms L didnt collect the money, and that the collecting party gave the wrong address 
for Ms L. But given  MoneyGram didnt have Ms Ls address, date of birth or any further 
details, it couldnt  have known it wasnt giving the money to the correct person. 
MoneyGram followed its procedures, which included checking a Passport and requesting  
details that should have  only been  known to the parties involved in the transaction. Because 
of that, Im satisfied it took reasonable care to ensure the money was given to the correct 
person. 
Ms L appears to be the victim of a scam. Although  in saying that, I havent  seen  anything  to 
demonstrate how the necessary details were  compromised and, for the reasons Ive set out 
above, I dont  consider  I can reasonably  hold MoneyGram responsible for her loss, given 
that it followed its procedures, and took reasonable steps to identify the recipient. 
I asked Ms L and MoneyGram  to provide any further  submissions or evidence  by 30 June 
2021. MoneyGram responded saying it had nothing to add and Ms L didnt respond.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Ms L, nor MoneyGram made any further  representations or offered any
further evidence,  my findings about  this complaint havent changed. It follows  that I dont 
uphold Ms Ls complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 October  2021.
