The complaint
Solicitors acting for the estate of Mrs W complain that National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) failed to use its reference number and estate name when sending emails. The 
solicitors also complain about problems forwarding a copy of the Grant of Probate to 
NatWest and using its online portal. 
What happened
The late Mrs W passed away in the summer of 2021. Solicitors were appointed to deal with 
the estate and NatWest was notified. NatWest sent requests for a Grant of Probate in the 
weeks that followed. The solicitor acting for the estate of Mrs W went on to complain that the 
requests were sent too early and chased without sufficient time to obtain the Grant of 
Probate. They also complained that the emails only contained NatWests reference which 
was not the same as the one being used by the solicitor and led to delays tracing the client.
The solicitor acting for the estate of Mrs W said theyd also experienced difficulties 
submitting the Grant of Probate.  
NatWest sent the solicitor acting for the estate of Mrs W a final response on 8 December 
2021 and said it had received the Grant of Probate copy on 29 November 2021. But 
NatWest explained it hadnt acted because it was still witing for the solicitor to complete 
account closure instructions. NatWest also advised it couldnt accept an emailed copy of the 
Grant of Probate but would be able to accept one loaded via its portal or received in the 
post. NatWest gave instructions on how the solicitor could submit an acceptable copy in its 
final response. 
On 15 December 2021 NatWest says it received a usable Grant of Probate for the estate of 
Mrs W. NatWest says it received account closure instructions on 31 December 2021. 
The solicitor complained on behalf of the estate of Mrs W and said NatWests actions had 
led to additional costs being incurred by the estate. NatWest didnt agree its email format 
was unreasonable or that it its portal system wasnt a viable way to submit the Grant of 
Probate. 
An investigator at this service looked at the estate of Mrs Ws complaint. They didnt agree 
that using a NatWest reference in the email was unreasonable and said the solicitor couldve 
taken straight forward steps to retain a record. The investigator didnt think NatWest had 
caused additional costs to be incurred in relation to the submission of the Grant of Probate 
and didnt ask it to take further action. 
The solicitor acting for the estate of Mrs W asked to appeal and said NatWest should include 
their reference and estate name in its emails and that failure to do so had led to wasted time. 
As the solicitor acting for the estate of Mrs W asked to appeal, its complaint has been 
passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware Ive summarised the events surrounding this complaint in less detail than the 
parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by my approach which reflects the informal 
nature of this service. I want to ensure all parties Ive read and considered everything on file. 
Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every point raised to fairly reach my decision. And if 
I dont comment on something, its not because I havent considered it. Its because Ive 
focused on what I think are the key issues. My approach is in line with the rules we operate 
under. 
The solicitor acting for the estate of Mrs W says the portal NatWest provides to submit the 
Grant of Probate isnt useable. But looking at the emails with NatWest, it appears to me 
there was a general frustration with the way NatWests system works as well as difficulties 
submitting documents in a format that was acceptable. But NatWest is free to decide the 
format in which its willing to accept documents, like the Grant of Probate, and how its portal 
operates. Here, it advised what steps the solicitor needed to take to submit a copy via the 
portal along with how to submit the Grant of Probate by post. Im satisfied thats reasonable.
I can see the solicitor feels NatWests process is unreasonable. But I havent been 
persuaded the steps NatWest required were unreasonably inconvenient. I havent been 
persuaded NatWest acted unfairly. 
The solicitor has told us they feel the fact the emails only included NatWests reference 
caused an unreasonable delay and additional work. I thought the investigator made a 
reasonable point when they said a separate note of NatWests reference couldve been 
made and used to identify incoming emails. And whilst I accept having their own reference 
and name of the estate wouldve made tracing emails in relation to the estate of Mrs W more 
straight forward, Im not persuaded thats grounds to tell NatWest to compensate the estate. 
I havent seen any evidence that leads me to think identifying the estate from the emails sent 
by NatWest was unreasonably inconvenient to the point Id expect NatWest to pay additional 
costs. 
Ive reviewed all the submissions provided and arguments made by the solicitor acting for 
the estate of Mrs W and NatWest. Having done so, I havent found evidence of poor service 
or unnecessary delays by NatWest. As Im satisfied NatWest dealt with the estate of Mrs Ws 
complaint fairly, Im not telling it to do anything else. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of 
Mrs W to accept or reject my decision before 13 December 2022.
