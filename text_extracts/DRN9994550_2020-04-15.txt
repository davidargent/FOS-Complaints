K821x#15complaint
Mrs B has complained about loans granted to her by Provident Personal Credit Limited 
(Provident or the lender). Mrs B says that Provident didnt properly look into her finances  
before agreeing to lend to her and it didnt treat her fairly  when she couldnt meet her 
repayments. 
background
Provident agreed 16 loans for Mrs B from November 2009 to December 2014.  The loan 
terms varied from 29 to 110 weeks and some  of the loans ran concurrently. The below table 
sets out some of the information Provident provided  about these  loans (with  numbers  
rounded to the nearest  pound).

I dont have a complete  picture of when  Mrs B repaid her loans but I understand she didnt 
completely repay two of them and so there may be outstanding balance owing. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into Mrs Bs complaint and found that it should be upheld  in 
part. He recommended that Provident  refunds the interest and charges Mrs B paid on 
loans 3 to 16. Provident  has not responded to this recommendation and so the complaint 
has come  to me, as an ombudsman, for review  and final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  these  types of loans  - including the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. And Ive followed this approach.
Ref: DRN99945502Having done so, I plan to uphold Mrs Bs complaint in part. I appreciate this will be 
disappointing for Provident and I hope the following explanation makes it clear  why I have 
come to this conclusion. 
When Mrs B first asked Provident  for credit the lender was regulated by the Office of Fair 
Trading (OFT)  and then from April 2014  by the Financial  Conduct Authority (FCA).  The 
requirements under both regulators were similar. Provident needed to take reasonable steps 
to assess whether or not Mrs B could afford  to meet its loan repayments in a sustainable 
manner. Neither the law nor the regulators specified exactly how the assessment was to be 
carried out but, whatever the method, it needed  to be enough  to assess  the sustainability of 
the arrangement  for Mrs B. 
In early 2010 the OFT published  its Irresponsible Lending Guidance (ILG) which  set out the 
obligations on lenders before and after agreeing credit.
ILG Paragraph 4.1 stated:
 In the OFTs view, all assessments of affordability  should involve a consideration of the 
potential for the credit  commitment to adversely impact on the borrowers financial situation, 
taking account  of information that the creditor  is aware  of at the time the credit is granted.  
The extent  and scope  of any assessment of affordability, in any particular circumstance, 
should be dependent upon  and proportionate to  a number of factors
Assessing affordability,  in the context of this guidance, is a borrower-focussed test which 
involves a creditor assessing a borrowers ability to undertake a specific credit commitment, 
or specific additional credit commitment, in a sustainable manner, without the borrower 
incurring (further) financial difficulties  and/or  experiencing  adverse consequences.
Paragraph 4.2 stated:
Whatever means and sources of information  creditors employ as part of an assessment of 
affordability should be sufficient to make an assessment of the risk of the credit  sought  being
unsustainable for the borrower in question. In our view this is likely  to involve more than 
solely assessing the likelihood of the borrower  being able to repay the credit  in 
question. (my emphasis)
Paragraph 4.3 stated:
The OFT regards in a sustainable manner in this context as meaning  credit that can be 
repaid by the borrower:
without  undue difficulty  in particular without incurring or increasing problem 
indebtedness (again, my emphasis)
over the life of the credit agreement or, in the case  of open-end agreements,  within a 
reasonable period  of time 
out of income and/or available savings, without having to realise security or assets.
And Paragraph 4.4 described  undue  difficulty:
The OFT would regard  without undue difficulty in this context as meaning the borrower 
being able to make repayments (in the absence of changes in personal circumstances that 
were not reasonably foreseeable  at the time the credit was granted):
Ref: DRN99945503while also meeting  other debt repayments and other normal/reasonable  outgoings 
and
without  having  to borrow  further to meet these repayments.
Finally, Section 4.26 said that a business would be acting irresponsibly  if it granted an 
application for credit when, on the basis of an affordability assessment, it is known, or 
reasonably ought  to be suspected, that the credit  is likely to be unsustainable.
All of this means  that the assessments Provident  carried out before lending needed to be 
consumer-focussed. It was not an assessment of the risk to Provident of recouping  its 
money, but of the risk to Mrs B in having difficulty meeting her repayments, experiencing 
adverse consequences or incurring or increasing problem indebtedness.  The assessment 
needed to be proportionate to both the circumstances of the lending and the circumstances 
of the consumer. Therefore, a lender might need to be flexible in its approach to making 
such an assessment  what was reasonable for one consumer might  not be so for another,  
or indeed  what might  be reasonable for a consumer in one circumstance might not be so for 
the same  consumer in other circumstances.  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more  difficult  to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
-the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting  that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher  repayment from a particular level of income);  
-the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time 
during which a customer  has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Bs complaint.
In its final response to Mrs B about  her complaint Provident said that it reviewed the 
information she provided on her application  forms and while  it showed that she was a 
homemaker, it also showed that she had suitable  disposable income to meet her 
repayments. I note that Provident knew Mrs B was unemployed from around the time of her 
first loan. 
Provident explained that it would  have asked Mrs B for her income  and expenditure each 
time she asked for a loan. It said its agent would  have  discussed the customers credit 
needs and the suitability  of our product and the particular loan terms to match to their ability  
to meet  the repayments.  Provident hasnt provided a record of the income and expenditure 
figures it gathered  for all 16 loans  the earliest information I have appears to be from May 
2012 which shows Mrs B declared  a weekly income of £200  and said that she had three 
dependents.
Provident said that Mrs B signed documents to indicate that the information she provided at 
that time was a true reflection of her financial circumstances. And that her repayment history 
Ref: DRN99945504didnt raise concerns  about granting further  credit. The lender also checked  Mrs Bs credit  
file and provided the summary information  it obtained for some of her loans from 2012.
Mrs Bs first loan was for £100  to be repaid  over 29 weeks.  When  she repaid this she took 
out a second loan for twice the amount. This was to be repaid over a year.  I note what  
Provident has said about Mrs B signing to indicate that the information  she provided  was a 
true reflection of her finances, but I dont  think it was fair to rely on the information she 
provided without  verifying it, given  her circumstances and that shed  need  to meet her loan 
repayments each  week for a year.  I dont  know whether or not Provident did go further and 
verify any of the information Mrs B provided. And I dont know  what it would have  found  out 
had it do so because  I have limited information  from Mrs B about  her circumstances at the 
time. So, considering  everything in the round,  I am not upholding her complaint about her 
first two loans.
Around the time Mrs B repaid her second  loan she took out two more loans on the same  day 
amounting to £1,200. Shed now been  indebted to Provident for over 18 months. Agreeing 
these two loans  took Mrs Bs account balance to almost £2,500. I think at this point 
Provident ought to have  considered that Mrs Bs debts were continuing and increasing and it 
wasnt likely that she was going to be able to repay  any further credit in a sustainable 
manner. These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness,  and so I think it 
was irresponsible  to have agreed  to further  credit  for her. 
Mrs B remained indebted  to Provident  for over three years  and I can see from customer 
records that her balance never reduced below £1,000.  I understand that she still has an 
outstanding debt with the lender.  I think Mrs B lost out when Provident continued to agree 
credit for her because  the length of time over which shed  borrowed was likely to be seen 
negatively by other lenders and potentially kept her in the market for this high cost credit.
what Provident  needs to do to put things right
Ive concluded  that Provident shouldnt have provided loans 3 through  to loan 16 for Mrs B, 
in other  words it shouldnt  have provided her with any of the loans taken from (and including) 
loans taken out in July 2011 and it should  put things right as set out below:
1)Add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs B towards interest,  fees and 
charges on the loans  which have  been repaid. 
2)Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mrs B which were 
considered as part of 1), calculated from the date she originally  made the payments, 
to the date the complaint is settled.
3)Pay Mrs B the total of 1) plus 2)
For any unpaid loans  Provident should:
4)Remove any interest and charges which form part of the remaining balances.
5)Treat any payments made by Mrs B towards  these loans as payments towards  the 
original capital.
6)For each loan,  if this means Mrs B has made  payments over and above the capital 
balance then it needs to refund these payments to her, along with 8% simple interest 
from when the overpayment originated to the date the complaint is settled. 
7)Alternatively, if this means  there is still a capital balance outstanding, Provident may 
use the refund in 3) above to reduce this balance. Any remainder should be paid to 
Mrs B.
Ref: DRN999455058)If a capital debt still remains  after applying the refund,  then Provident  needs to treat 
Mrs B fairly and sympathetically which may mean agreeing an affordable  repayment  
plan with her.
If any loans have been sold on Provident should seek  to buy this debt back or work  with the 
new owner to achieve steps 4 to 8. 
9)The overall pattern  of Mrs Bs borrowing for loans  3 to 16 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so if they still appear  on her credit  file Provident 
should remove them entirely, or work  with a third party to do so, once settled.
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires Provident  to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Mrs B a 
certificate showing how much  tax it has deducted,  if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, Im upholding Mrs Bs complaint in part and require  
Provident Personal Credit Limited  to put things right for her as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 May 2020.
