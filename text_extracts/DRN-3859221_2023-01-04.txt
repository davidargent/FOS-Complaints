The complaint
Mr W complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) sent him a text alert with the wrong 
balance.
What happened
Mr W received weekly text alerts each Thursday showing his balance. In June 2022, he went 
on holiday to Greece. On Thursday 23 June 2022 he received a text message from Barclays 
showing a balance of £13,444.15. On Sunday 26 June 2022, he received another text which 
said his balance was £12,689.35.  There hadnt been any transactions on his account since 
23 June 2022  so he was concerned at what had happened.
Mr W complained. He said that Barclays had sent the text and it showed the wrong balance. 
So, he wants Barclays to refund the difference of £755. He said that he called Barclays on 
26 June 2022 and spoke to the fraud department  and they were very unhelpful. He says 
he was worried that money had been taken from his account fraudulently  and this stress 
ruined his holiday.
Barclays issued two responses. After the first one, Mr W contacted Barclays and asked for a 
fuller explanation. In their second and final response, Barclays said they didnt uphold Mr 
Ws complaint. Barclays said they didnt send a text message to Mr W on Sunday 26 June 
2022. Theyd looked at the weekly text messages sent to Mr W and each one was accurate 
and showed the correct balance  checked against his bank account. Barclays said the text 
message received by Mr W was the one sent on 9 June 2022, and that showed a balance of 
£12,689.35. Barclays said the text received by Mr W was sent by Barclays  but the one 
received on 26 June 2022 must have been delayed or re-sent by Mr Ws mobile network 
provider. 
Barclays said that text messages were unsecure and shouldnt be relied upon as secure. 
They said that the delayed delivery may have been due to mobile phone signal issues, 
roaming or other mobile network problems. They encouraged customers to use other means 
of checking their accounts  such as online, phone or in branch.
Barclays said no loss had been suffered by Mr W  no money had been taken from his 
account. And when he called Barclays on 26 June 2022, the balance was confirmed then as 
£13,444.15  the correct balance. The issues experience by Mr W wasnt to do with Barclays 
 and they didnt agree to pay any compensation. 
Mr W didnt agree and brought his complaint to us. Our investigator agreed with Barclays. 
He was satisfied that Barclays didnt send a text message to Mr W on Sunday 26 June 2022. 
On the evidence provided, he said there must have been a network delay in sending the text 
message from 9 June 2022. But  that wasnt Barclays fault. He clarified that Mr Ws 
network provider wouldnt have access to Mr Ws balance or bank details  the network 
provider only carried Barclays text messages. The money in question hadnt left Mr Ws 
account and therefore Barclays hadnt made any errors. Therefore, he didnt uphold Mr Ws 
complaint.
Mr W didnt agree.  He said Barclays had been dishonest; nor had it been established where 
the text message came from. He asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint  and so it 
has come to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how distressing this was for Mr W - he was on holiday and got a text 
message which showed his balance was £755 less than he thought it was  or than the 
balance hed been advised three days before. And he knew he hadnt made any payments 
or purchases with his debit card since that time. 
Let me be clear on our role. We can only look at the conduct of Barclays in this complaint. 
We cant for example, look into what happened with Mr Ws mobile network provider. And it 
would only be fair and reasonable of me to uphold Mr Ws complaint if I felt, based on the 
balance of evidence from both Mr W and Barclays, that Barclays acted unreasonably or 
erroneously. And I dont think they did.
Mr W did get a text message on 26 June 2022, and Barclays confirmed it did come from 
Barclays. Mr W has shown us screenshots of the message  and it appears in the same 
format as the previous balance alerts sent to him. It showed the balance as £12,689.35. I 
looked at the balance alerts sent to Mr W by text and compared them to his bank statement:
Date Text Message Balance Mr Ws Statement Balance
9 June 2022 £12,689.35 £12,689.35
16 June 2022 £12,976.75 £12,976.75
23 June 2022 £13,444.15 £13,444.15
26 June 2022 £12,689.35 £13,444.15
Therefore, there was a difference between the text message balance and bank account 
balance on 26 June 2022.  But  its also clear that the balance reported in the text message 
on 26 June 2022 was the same as that reported on 9 June 2022.
I also saw in Barclays internal records that text messages had been sent to Mr W on 9 June 
2022, 16 June 2022, and 23 June 2022. But a text message was not sent to him on 26 June 
2022. And so  while I accept that Mr W did receive a text which appeared to come from 
Barclays  on 26 June 2022  it wasnt sent by Barclays on that day.
Based on the balance of probability, it looks like there was a network problem with Mr Ws 
network provider which caused the text from 9 June 2022 to be re-sent, or it was delayed. I 
say this as the balance was the same as between the text dated 9 June 2022 and 26 June 
2022. And  in all fairness, I cant hold Barclays responsible for that.
I also saw that no amount for £755 (or sums amounting to that figure) was taken from Mr 
Ws account. So  there wasnt any loss here.
And so, based on the evidence Ive seen, Barclays acted reasonably. Whether there was a problem with Mr Ws mobile network provider  is not something we can investigate, as we 
dont have any jurisdiction to do so. Mr W may wish to approach them to see if there was a 
problem during the period in question.
Mr W called Barclays on 26 June 2022 after he received the text. Mr W says that the fraud 
department were unhelpful, but I dont agree with him. I listened to the call and the call 
handler was professional and polite. She confirmed that Mr Ws balance was then 
£13,444.15  she repeated that twice. She couldnt explain why the text message had been 
sent  and asked Mr W to call again when the customer services department reopened the 
following day. But  she did reassure Mr W about his account balance  which was what 
was needed in the circumstances. 
I did observe that Mr W became very aggressive towards the call handler, and while I 
understand his frustration, that wouldnt have helped the situation. So, on the matter of the 
call, Barclays acted reasonably.
I appreciate that Mr W feels strongly about what happened and will therefore be 
disappointed by my decision. But Im not going to ask Barclays to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 February 2023.
