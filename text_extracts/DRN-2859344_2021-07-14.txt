The complaint
Mrs G complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wouldnt give her a refund 
for an item she didnt receive.
What happened
 In October 2020, Mrs G bought an item from a seller for £47.99 and paid via PayPal.  It 
wasnt received by her. She raised a claim with PayPal, who declined it in February 2021.
Mrs G complained. She had proof that the seller had sent the item to the wrong address. 
And Royal Mail also confirmed it had been delivered to the wrong address.
PayPal didnt accept Mrs Gs complaint and considered that the dispute had been resolved 
successfully. They said the seller had provided proof that the item had been delivered  
because the tracking number had confirmed it had been delivered. So, under their User 
Agreement, the transaction didnt qualify for a refund.
Mrs G brought her complaint to us. Our investigator considered PayPal had unfairly denied 
Mrs Gs claim. She could see that the seller said the product had been sent to the wrong 
address. And  Royal Mail had also confirmed the item had been delivered to a different 
address. She said PayPal should refund to Mrs G the cost of the product, plus 8% per 
annum simple interest on the amount shed paid.
PayPal didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at Mrs Gs complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at PayPals User Agreement which is relevant here. Mrs G was claiming a refund 
under its Items Not Received claims clause. Here, it says: Item Not Received 
claimsYour claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item 
Not Received claim, if:
The seller has provided proof of delivery.
If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in 
favour of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the 
goods.
And proof of delivery is defined as Online or physical documentation from a shipping 
company that includes:
Date of delivery and delivered status
An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the "Transaction 
Details" page
An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal 
code (or international equivalent).
PayPal argue that proof of delivery was evidenced. Ive seen the shipping label  it has Mrs 
Gs address on it. And the tracking information says delivered. So  I can see where 
PayPal are coming from here and why they decided to deny Mrs Gs claim.
But on the other hand, all the tracking information shows is that the item was delivered on 
20 October 2020  but not to which address. And  Ive seen the seller confirmed they sent 
the item to the wrong address. And also  Royal Mail confirmed in an email to Mrs G that the 
item wasnt delivered to her address. So  I must consider whether this information 
outweighs PayPals arguments. 
These are two strong pieces of evidence. And, so, on balance, I think that in the 
circumstances of this case, its clear that the item wasnt delivered to Mrs G. And therefore, 
PayPal should refund £47.99 to Mrs G. And I agree with our investigator that they should 
also pay interest at 8% per annum simple for the period of time shes been out of pocket  
from October 2020 to the date of this decision. This adds about £3 to the amount.
Putting things right
PayPal should refund £47.99 to Mrs G, and pay interest at 8% per annum simple on this 
sum for the period shes been out of pocket  from 10 October 2020 to the date of this 
decision.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint.  PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must:
Pay £47.99 to Mrs G, plus interest at 8% per annum simple from 10 October 2020 to 
the date of this decision.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2021.
