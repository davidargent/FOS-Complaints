The complaint
Mrs H complains that PayPal overcharged her for a transaction. She also complains about 
how PayPal handled this dispute, including that it has harassed her. Her husband, Mr H, has 
supported her in bringing this complaint. 
What happened
Mrs H said PayPal charged her credit card over £100 for a transaction that should have 
been under £22. The credit card company got the overcharged amount back for her, but she 
said that PayPal was harassing her to pay it again. Mrs H said calls to PayPal had cost her 
money, she wanted that back, and compensation for how PayPal had treated her.
PayPal said that Mrs H received a payment in February 2019, from someone who bought 
goods from her through a popular online auction site. PayPal applied its fees, and paid the 
remaining £79.96 to Mrs H. But in early March the buyer disputed the transaction, and tried 
to get their money back. When this happens, a hold is placed on the disputed amount. 
The disputed amount is taken into safekeeping, so PayPal takes the money out of a seller's 
PayPal account until the dispute is resolved. In this case, Mrs H had already taken her 
money out. That meant that after PayPal had also taken this amount out, her account had a 
negative balance, a little like an overdraft on a bank account. 
Mrs H then tried to make a payment using PayPal. When she did this, PayPal didnt just take 
the amount for the transaction, it took more money to clear the negative balance too. So she 
was charged the payment amount of £21.90, and the negative balance of £79.96. 
Mrs H said it was very misleading for PayPal to take all of this money as one transaction. It 
looked like shed been significantly overcharged for her transaction. She thought PayPal 
should have made two transactions, and been clear about what it was doing. 
PayPal said it had shown Mrs H how much it would take in this transaction before the money 
was taken, and shed agreed to that as part of the transaction. It also said whenever 
someone owes it money, it will always recover that money before it allows further 
transactions to go through. 
The dispute with the buyer was resolved, and the money that had been taken into 
safekeeping was paid back to Mrs H. She spent a small amount of this money, and moved 
the rest of it out of her PayPal account. But Mr and Mrs H had also asked their credit card 
provider to make a chargeback on the payment they made to PayPal, and that request was 
successful.  This meant that Mrs H had had this money twice. So PayPal said Mrs H still 
owed it money, and it wanted that to be paid back. 
PayPal started asking for this money back at the start of May. Towards the end of June, it 
converted the outstanding debt into euros. A number of small payments were then made, 
over a little more than a month, and the debt was cleared. Our investigator didnt think PayPal had done anything wrong. She didnt think it made a 
mistake when it charged Mrs H enough money to cover both her transaction and the money 
she owed PayPal. Our investigator had checked the terms of the account, and PayPal was 
entitled to show the debt in euros. She also said PayPal had updated Mrs H a number of 
times by phone and email. She didnt think PayPal had to do more than it had done. 
Mrs H wanted PayPal to send her a statement of her account. She said all banks were able 
to do this, she thought PayPal should too. And shed never received a formal response to 
her complaint. She also said PayPal had initially failed to explain what was happening. She 
said PayPal made bullying phone calls, then passed the debt to a  collection agent. She still 
didnt think PayPal should hide one transaction within another. She didnt think she should 
bear the cost of calls to PayPal. And she thought PayPals bullying and unhelpful 
management of the issue meant that she should be paid compensation. 
Because Mrs H didnt agree with our investigator, the case came to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal works with an online auction site, to provide buyer protection. As part of that, money 
will be taken into safekeeping if a buyer challenges a transaction. Thats what happened 
here. I dont think PayPal did anything wrong when it did that. 
This can lead to problems, if the seller has already taken the money for the transaction out of 
the PayPal account. Again, thats what happened here. If there isnt any money in that 
account for PayPal to take into safekeeping, the account goes into a negative balance. 
Mrs H then tried to use her PayPal account to make a payment. PayPal took both the 
transaction amount, and money to clear Mrs Hs negative balance. Although I think this could 
have been explained more clearly to Mrs H, I dont think that PayPal made a mistake when it 
did this. 
Mrs H says banks can give her a statement of her account, with a running total. She thinks 
PayPal should do that too. I understand why Mrs H says it would be easier to understand if 
PayPal provided its information in a more accessible format. But my role is to provide a fair 
and reasonable outcome to this complaint. I cant tell PayPal that it has to make overall 
service improvements, and I dont think its unfair or unreasonable for PayPal only to offer 
the information that it does provide. 
The buyer dispute was resolved, and the money was released from safekeeping, back into 
Mrs Hs account. She spent some, and moved the rest. But she also asked her credit card 
company to make a chargeback request for the extra money that had been added to her 
earlier transaction, and that request was successful. Im satisfied that, as a result of this, she 
did then owe PayPal money.
Mrs H complained about the phone calls and messages she then got from PayPal. I 
understand that Mrs H may have found this unpleasant, but I don't think that PayPal was 
harassing Mrs H. I have seen messages sent from PayPal to Mrs H, and I think that by the 
start of May, at the latest, PayPal had clearly explained to Mrs H why she still owed it 
money. So I dont think that PayPal did anything wrong when it then proceeded with action to 
recover that money, including involving a debt collection agent. Mrs H says she shouldnt have to pay for calls trying to sort this out. She showed us she was 
charged for calls at the end of May. Those calls seem to have cost her money because she 
was out of the country. I dont think it was PayPals fault if Mrs H was out of the country then. 
So I dont think PayPal needs to pay for that. 
Mrs H also says that she made a formal complaint, but never received a formal response. 
Thats unfortunate, and I do think it wouldve been better if PayPal had responded formally to 
Mrs H. But I do think PayPal has explained to Mrs H what happened. And she was clearly 
aware of her rights to bring a complaint to our service, as she did so. So she doesnt seem to 
have lost out because PayPal didnt provide a formal response. For those reasons, I dont 
think that PayPal needs to pay Mrs H compensation for this. 
Ive considered this complaint carefully, and I dont think that PayPal has to pay Mrs H for 
the call charges she incurred whilst overseas, or that it needs to pay her compensation. So I 
dont think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 April 2020.
