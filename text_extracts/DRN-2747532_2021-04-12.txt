One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that Mutual needed to put
4 and 5. Mutual did not agree. The complaint remained unresolved was passed to me to 
decide. I issued a provisional decision on 1 April 2021 in which I said that I was planning not 
to uphold the complaint and I gave my reasons why. Mrs Ws representative has informed us 
that Mrs W is content with that provisional decision outcome. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about high cost credit lending - 
including all the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand
whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list several things a lender could consider before agreeing to lend. The key element 
was that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to consider several different things, 
including how much was being lent and when the sum being borrowed was due to be repaid.
Mrs W has not given us any evidence of her financial situation at the time of these loans.
Our adjudicator was not able to come to any conclusions about Loans 1 to 3. After her view
was sent to both parties no additional information or comments have been received from
Mrs W or her representative other than an acknowledgement. 
And since my provisional decision was issued Mrs W has indicated that she is content with 
the outcome of my provisional findings and so I repeat them here in my final decision. In light 
of Mrs Ws response then I can keep it brief.  
I have not heard from Mutual about my provisional decision but as it was a provisional 
non-uphold decision I would not necessarily expect to. For expediency then it makes sense 
to issue the final decision. 
I am not reviewing loans 1 to 3, as I have no additional evidence to review and Mrs W has 
not indicated that she disagrees with the outcome for them.
Our adjudicator did think that loans 4 and 5 were lent irresponsibly. Mutual sent extensive 
submissions on why it did not agree with our adjudicators view that loans 4 and 5 were 
unsustainable for Mrs W.
There were many aspects of Mutuals submissions I did not agree with. For instance, we 
know from the final response letter (FRL) that for Mrs W it carried out a credit search (no 
copy sent to us) for Loan 5 only, which is late in the lending relationship. And yet in its recent
submissions Mutual said that it carried out credit reference agency checks to verify the
information Mrs W had given it. This suggests this was done for each and every loan. Thats
clearly not correct. And we have no evidence of what any checks revealed in any event.
Mutual makes the point that the repayments for Loans 4 and 5 were low at just over £8 and
just under £14 a week respectively. It questioned why we think that these would be
unsustainable for Mrs W when they are significantly lower each week than earlier in the
lending relationship. In the absence of financial evidence from both parties, and following on 
from my provisional decision, I have decided that there is not enough for me to uphold this 
complaint for Mrs W on loans 4 and 5 on the basis of unsustainability.
I make no comment on the extensive points Mutual made relating to FCA reviews from 2018 
and a recent webinar it referred to. I make no comment on the Kerrigan judgment 
submissions made by Mutual in its response to Mrs Ws complaint outcome.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mrs Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 May 2021.
