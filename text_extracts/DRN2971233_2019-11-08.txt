K822xcomplaint
Mr and Mrs C complain that Barclays  Bank  UK PLC wrongly applied  some of their lump sum 
payments to the repayment part of their mortgage instead of the interest only part. They ask 
that it refunds  interest that they believe theyve overpaid as a result.  
background 
Mr and Mrs C took out a mortgage with Barclays in early 2011. The mortgage was part 
repayment and part interest only. Since early 2013 theyve made six lump sum payments to 
their mortgage account. They recently noticed  that two lump  sum payments  made in 2016  
and 2017  were  applied  to the repayment  part of their mortgage. Mr C says all of the 
payments should  have  been applied to the interest  only part of the mortgage.
Mr and Mrs C re-mortgaged  at the end of February  2019 and no longer have a mortgage 
with Barclays.
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld  in part. She said 
Mr and Mrs C werent  worse off as a result  of the two lump sum payments being applied to 
the repayment part of the mortgage. But Barclays should have discussed the allocation  of 
the payments  with Mr and Mrs C. The investigator said Barclays  should pay £150 
compensation for its poor service. 
Mr and Mrs C didnt agree, so the complaint  has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs C took out a mortgage that was part capital repayment and part interest only. 
They made a number of lump  sum payments to the mortgage account. Some of these 
payments were applied  to the interest  only part of the mortgage. Two of the payments  
about £10,500 in 2016 and about £9,200 in 2017  were applied to the repayment  part of the 
mortgage. Mr and Mrs C say they only realised this when they contacted Barclays in 
September 2018 about taking out a new product: they were  told all of the mortgage  balance 
was on interest only terms as the repayment  part of the mortgage had been  repaid.
Mr C says they made the payments  as the interest only part of the mortgage wouldnt  have  
otherwise been  reduced or repaid. I understand this. However, its not clear that Barclays 
made an error with the payments.
The mortgage application says Mr and Mrs C had an endowment  policy in place to repay the 
interest only part of the mortgage. So Barclays wouldnt necessarily have assumed the 
payments were only intended  for the interest  only part of the mortgage.  
When Barclays responded to Mr and Mrs Cs complaint it attached  re-calculations  intended  
to show how their account would have looked if the lump sum payments had all been  
allocated to the interest only part of their mortgage. These showed that Mr and Mrs C were 
about £6,000 worse  off as a result  of some of the payments being  allocated to the 
repayment part of the mortgage. Barclays provided calculations to us which suggested  this 
Ref: DRN29712332had left Mr and Mrs C better off, by about £12,000. I can understand why Mr and Mrs C have 
found this frustrating.
I think the recalculations produce these results because they assume the monthly payments 
made by Mr and Mrs C after each  lump sum payment would have changed. The assumption  
in the recalculation sent to Mr and Mrs C is that they would have paid about £5,565 more 
than they actually paid. Once the reduced amount of interest  (due to the lower balance)  is 
taken into account,  the re-calculated mortgage balance is about  £6,000  lower  than the actual 
mortgage balance.  
I didnt think this was the most helpful  way to present the re-calculation.  So I asked Barclays 
to provide new re-calculations using the actual payments made by Mr and Mrs C. A copy of 
the table showing  the re-calculations is at the end of this decision.
The revised calculations  show the payments made by Mr and Mrs C would have reduced the 
mortgage balance  (and the amount of interest  applied) in the same way regardless of how 
they were allocated between the interest  only and repayment parts of the mortgage. 
Essentially what it means is that, irrespective of which part of the mortgage  the payments  
were allocated to, the combined balance of the two parts would  come  to the same total. As 
the same  interest  rate was charged on both parts of the mortgage, the total amount of 
interest charged would  be the same.
I think this is correct and in accordance with the mortgage offer which says:
Following receipt of an overpayment or a lump sum reduction we will immediately 
reduce the balance on which interest is charged. This means  that you will receive the 
benefit straight away.
I dont think Mr and Mrs C have suffered a financial loss (such  as additional interest)  due to 
the two lump sum payments being allocated to the repayment part of their mortgage. So I 
wont be asking Barclays to compensate them for this. Theyve repaid the mortgage and 
moved to another lender, so I cant ask Barclays to make changes to their mortgage account  
(such as to reallocate payments to the interest only part).
However, I do think this has caused Mr and Mrs C some trouble and upset. Barclays paid 
£159 compensation for Mr and Mrs C being on its standard variable rate while it looked into 
their complaint and £50 for sending them a notice which was confusing. It agreed to pay an 
additional £150 for the upset and inconvenience related to the lump  sum payments. Overall, 
I think this is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order Barclays Bank UK PLC to pay £150 to 
Mr and Mrs C.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision  before  8 December 2019.
