I have listed the first 10 loans taken  by Mr W above as my findings  relate  to this part of the 
loan chain. But to be clear I am considering  all 92 of the loans taken out by Mr W with 
MyKredit that started with loan 1 in October  2016  and ended with loan 92, taken out in 
December 2018.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ws complaint in part and thought loans 4-92 shouldnt have been 
given. MyKredit respond to the view and disagreed. So as both parties are still not in 
agreement, the complaint was passed to me, an ombudsman,  to make a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MyKredit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MyKredit  should fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN86369232the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MyKredit was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
MyKredit needed to do more when it approved  loans 1-3. This was early on in the lending 
relationship between the two parties and the loan repayments for each one of these loans 
seemed affordable based on what Mr W had told MyKredit. So I dont think MyKredit was 
wrong to give these three loans to Mr W.
However by loan 4 there were clear  signs that Mr W was struggling to repay his loans. I say 
this because:
Mr W had requested  £400 when he asked for his fourth loan.  This was for four times that 
of the first loan Mr W took out with MyKredit  and there were no indications that the 
amount he was asking  for was being  reduced at all.
This was Mr Ws fourth loan in a little over 5 weeks. He was repeatedly asking for a loan 
shortly after repaying  his previous one. He repaid his first loan and then a day later 
asked for loan 2. Then when he repaid loan 2, it took him only 6 days to ask for loan 3. 
And it took Mr W only 2 days to ask for loan 4 after he had repaid loan 3. This pattern of 
lending that Mr W was displaying  shows me that he was most likely unable to repay  
previous loans without taking out a new one and was borrowing again to fill a gap in his 
finances. 
Ref: DRN86369233I think there was a significant risk that Mr W would be unable  to meet his repayments for 
loan 4 because  he was showing signs that he was struggling to repay in a sustainable way. 
It follows that I dont think MyKredit should have given loan 4 and every loan agreed  after 
this point to Mr W (loans 4-92).
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MyKredits  lending history with Mr W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MyKredit should reasonably have seen  that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MyKredit should  have  realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached at loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point MyKredit  ought to have realised  Mr W was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr W had taken out seven loans within  two months.  So MyKredit 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr W was having to borrow  further  
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan(s) was leaving in his finances and that 
Mr Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MyKredit.  It ought to 
have known that Mr W was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. Mr W had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to MyKredit  over an extended  period.
I think this pattern of lending should have alerted MyKredit to the likelihood that Mr W 
was having problems managing his money. I think that MyKredit  shouldve been 
concerned that Mr W might be borrowing elsewhere to repay its loans, again 
increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Mr W lost out because MyKredit continued to provide  borrowing from loan 7 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ws ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So overall Im upholding Mr Ws complaint about  loans  4-92 for the reasons given above. 
Ref: DRN86369234putting things right  what MyKredit needs to do
Refund all interest  and charges Mr W paid on loans  4 to 92;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
Remove any negative  information about loans 4 to 6 from Mr Ws credit  file.
The number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse, so all entries about  loans 7-92 should be removed from 
Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MyKredit to take off tax from this interest.  MyKredit  must  give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Global Kapital Group  
Ltd (trading as MyKredit) should  pay Mr W compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 March 2020.
