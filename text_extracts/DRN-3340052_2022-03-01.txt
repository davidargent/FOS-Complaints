DRN-3340052
The complaint and background
Mr and Mrs Cs complaint is that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly applied
charges to their account after they had agreed an amount they would pay to close the
account.
Mr and Mrs C say they were given a settlement figure for their account during a web chat 
with NatWest on 7 July 2019. This figure did not include £78 of charges that had been 
applied to their account as they were told that this £78 would be refunded. On 8 July 2019 
they paid the settlement figure they had been told to pay.
But the £78 was not refunded, and so there remained a debit balance of £78 on the account 
and they could not close their account as intended. After they raised a complaint this £78 
refunded as initially promised, but not until 23 July 2019.
Mr and Mrs C complained to NatWest as they had lost out financially because of what they 
felt was a mistake on NatWests part. NatWest didnt agree, so Mr and Mrs C referred their 
complaint to us. One of our adjudicators looked at their complaint and agreed with NatWest 
that it hadnt done anything wrong. Mr and Mrs C remained unhappy, so the case was 
referred to an ombudsman.
I issued my provisional decision on 31 January 2022. In that decision I explained why I felt 
NatWest had likely made an error here, and I set out what I thought it needed to do to put 
things right. NatWest have accepted my findings, but Mr and Mrs C have not responded to 
my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision I explained the following:
On reviewing the statements and contact notes for Mr and Mrs Cs account, I think its clear 
that there has been some kind of error on NatWests part here. 
NatWest has said they dont know why the entire balance wasnt cleared on 8 July 2019, but 
I would think it fairly clear that the balance wasnt fully cleared because Mr and Mrs C had 
been told that the outstanding £78 would be refunded by NatWest, and so it hadnt been 
included in the settlement figure theyd been given.  But what isnt clear to me is exactly what 
period the charges that were then applied on 23 July 2019 related to. NatWest has 
suggested that these charges were incurred for the period between 8 July 2019  when Mr 
and Mrs C intended to close the account  and 23 July 2019  when the account actually 
closed. But if thats the case then it seems at least some of these charges were incurred as 
a result of NatWest not refunding the £78 charge it had said it would refund, and that doesnt 
really seem fair. 
And if some of these charges do relate to the period before 8 July 2019 Id question why 
were they not included as part of the settlement figure that Mr and Mrs C were given when 
they spoke to NatWest online about closing their account.
I asked NatWest for some clarity on this, but given the time that has passed NatWest has 
said its unable to confirm exactly what the charges related to. However, NatWest has told us 
that on the balance of probabilities it seems likely that there was an error on NatWests part.
NatWest has confirmed it is happy to accept my findings as it agrees that its likely it made 
an error in how it handled Mr and Mrs Cs account. As Mr and Mrs C havent responded with 
any comments disagreeing with my findings, I see no reason to change those findings. So I 
remain satisfied that NatWest has made an error but that by taking the steps set out below 
NatWest will have fairly resolved this issue.
Putting things right
I think a fair resolution to this complaint would be for NatWest to refund to Mr and Mrs C the 
charges applied on 23 July 2019. NatWest should refund this amount to Mr and Mrs C with 
8% simple interest on the overpayment from the date it was made until the date of 
settlement.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to take off tax from this interest. NatWest
must give Mr and Mrs C a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if they ask for 
one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I am upholding Mr and Mrs Cs complaint. National 
Westminster Bank Plc should put things right in the way I have set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 29 March 2022.
