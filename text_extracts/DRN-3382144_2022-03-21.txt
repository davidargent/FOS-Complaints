The complaint
Mr S says The Prudential Assurance Company Limited (Prudential) is responsible for poor 
administration and communication regarding his occupational and personal pension plans, 
and that this has led to financial detriment and significant inconvenience.
Mr S is represented by Caleb Roberts Financial Management Limited (Caleb), which was 
also his Financial Adviser when liaising with Prudential about his retirement plans.
What happened
Caleb met with Mr S and his wife on 24 October 2019. They were seeking advice about their 
pension options. Both were members of an occupational pension scheme (OPS). And both 
had personal pension plans. Mr S would reach his OPS scheme retirement age in November 
2019. Mrs S reached this point later, in May 2020.
Mr and Mrs S had six pension plans between them, three each. This appears to have been a 
source of some confusion and mis-communication.
Mr S and his wife have made complaints about Prudentials handling of their OPS plans to 
The Pension Ombudsman. A separate complaint has been set-up with this Service to 
consider issues raised by Mrs S about her personal pensions. So, this decision focuses on 
the personal pensions Mr S had. To be clear, the pension plans Ive considered are the 
policies ending with the references ***048 and ***550.
Another reason things became muddled is that the complaint raised with Prudential has 
evolved during its journey. An initial complaint was brought in January 2020, but points 
werent addressed satisfactorily and new points were raised. Prudential issued at least five 
final response letters (FRLs) to Mr and Mrs S between March 2020 and February 2021. In 
addition there were further clarifying emails. Most of these communications from Prudential 
were directed through Caleb. Some letters muddled-up plans and relevant policyholders, 
adding to the confusion.
I note Caleb brought Mr and Mrs Ss complaint to our Service in July 2020, while Prudential 
were still trying to resolve matters. That said I can appreciate why it did so, it had been given 
referral rights. But its clear to see that with the situation still dynamic, there was scope for 
further confusion.
The circumstances surrounding Mr and Mrs Ss complaints seem to be largely agreed 
between the parties. They and their adviser experienced problems receiving information 
from Prudential, which was important to making decisions about their pension plans. And 
some of the information was incorrect. This led to a situation where they suffered financial 
detriment.
I can see that Prudential apologised on several occasions for the things it got wrong. It set 
out some of the reasons why this had happened, for example it noted problems 
implementing a major system upgrade which had a substantial impact on short term service 
provision.
Mr S made the case that because of Prudentials poor communications, the switch of his 
personal pension plan funds was delayed. And that as a result hes incurred a market value 
reduction (MVR).
Ultimately, Prudential accepted the poor quality of some of its communications. It 
acknowledged that MVRs had been applied to certain of Mr and Mrs Ss pension plans as a 
result of its communication failures. And it undertook to make sure they were no worse off 
financially because of the things it had got wrong.
Prudential also acknowledged it had caused Mr and Mrs S inconvenience over a prolonged 
period. It says to date its paid them £750 in recognition of this. The FRLs and other 
communications Ive seen suggest awards of between £750 and £900 have been paid.
The Investigator didnt uphold Mr Ss case. She thought Prudential had done enough to put 
him in the position hed have been in if everything had gone smoothly.
Given the confusions around this case and the to and fro between Mr S, Prudential, his 
adviser and this Service, to be fair to all parties I issued a provisional decision earlier this 
month. Neither party has provided any additional evidence or arguments, so I see no reason 
to depart from my initial findings and conclusions.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where theres conflicting information about what happened and gaps in what we know, my 
role is to weigh the evidence we do have and to decide, on the balance of probabilities, 
whats most likely to have happened.
Ive not provided a detailed response to all the points raised in this case. Thats deliberate; 
ours is an informal service for resolving disputes between financial businesses and their 
customers. While Ive taken into account all submissions, Ive concentrated my findings on 
what I think is relevant and at the heart of this complaint.
Im not upholding Mr Ss case. Ill explain why.
I can see from the business file Prudential provided that in March 2021 there were a series 
of emails under the title Mr and Mr S  ongoing complaint, between Mr S, Caleb and itself 
which sought to agree a position on redress across their pension plans. This included a 
proposed payment of £2,105 for Mr S and £10,550 for Mrs S.
I note that on 18 March 2021 after reviewing Prudentials proposition, Mr S responds to his 
adviser at Caleb saying:
Thanks I fully understand now. I accept their offer.
Its not clear to me why this didnt draw a line under matters. Perhaps Mr and Mrs S 
remained unclear about how the settlement had been arrived at, although the terms in which 
Mr S accepted Prudentials offer doesnt suggest such. Or perhaps they felt that Prudential 
should be offering further compensation for the things it had got wrong.
In November 2021 the Investigator shared screen shots with Caleb, provided by Prudential 
to show the value of Mr Ss plans ***048 and ***550 as at 22 July 2020. These also showed that no MVR had been applied to the funds switched. Caleb wasnt convinced and remained 
worried Mr S had suffered a reduction in value. The Investigator thought it might be getting 
confused with the situation on his OPS plans.
On 6 December 2021 Mrs S emailed Caleb about her pension plans, and in setting the 
scene she said:
I have looked at our paperwork over the weekend and find that [my husband] did get more 
than the value so his appears to be ok
On the same day Caleb contacted this Service to confirm:
Having reviewed our records, we agree that no MVR was applied to Mr Ss plans (***550
and ***048.
In its response to my provisional decision, Caleb confirmed no further action was required 
regarding Mr Ss case.
Turning to awards for distress and inconvenience. When Im considering a complaint like Mr 
Ss, I think about whether its fair to award compensation for distress and inconvenience. 
This isnt intended to fine or punish a business  which is the job of the regulator. But when 
somethings gone wrong, recognition of the emotional and practical impact can make a real 
difference.
Were all inconvenienced at times in our day-to-day lives  and in our dealings with other 
people, businesses and organisations. When thinking about compensation, I need to decide 
that the impact of Prudentials actions was greater than just a minor inconvenience or upset. 
Its clear to me that this was the case here. And I think thats what Prudential thought too.
Prudential has apologised to Mr S for the things its got wrong. Its tried to put him back in 
the position hed have been in if things hadnt gone wrong. And its offered him and his wife 
over £700 to compensate them for the distress and inconvenience its caused. Thats 
considered a substantial award by this Service.
On balance, I think Prudentials compensation payments to Mr S were reasonable.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive already set out, Im not upholding Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 April 2022.
