K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs D have complained that further advances  on their mortgage  with Bank of 
Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) were unsuitable  and that Halifax should not have agreed to 
this borrowing. To put things right they want Halifax to write off the mortgage.
background
In 2003 Mr and Mrs D took out a mortgage with Halifax,  borrowing £45,000 on a capital 
repayment basis over a term of 15 years. Over the years various further advances have 
been taken out, all for debt consolidation
June 2005 £35,000 over a term of 13 years
November 2006 £14,299 over a term of 18 years 7 months
February 2009 £29,849 over a term of 16 years 4 months
February 2011 £  8,099 over a term of 14 years  4 months
In August  2016  Mr and Mrs D borrowed a further £30,000 and rearranged  the mortgage onto 
a five-year fixed rate. £30,000  was over a ten-year  term with the remaining £77,050 over a 
term of ten years. The initial  monthly  payment until 31 October  2021 is £1,192.37.
In October  2018 Mr and Mrs D complained to Halifax about the length of the mortgage  term. 
They said theyd never agreed to the term being  extended. They also queried why theyd 
have remortgaged with Halifax  in 2003 when they already had an endowment mortgage with 
another lender taken out in 1992.
Halifax explained that the term extension  had been  done at the time of the further advance in 
November 2006  when the whole  term was set to 18 years 7 months and that this had been 
documented in the annual statements ever since. Halifax issued a final response letter  
saying that it thought  Mr and Mrs D had left it too late to complain.
In March 2019 Mr and Mrs D complained  to the Financial Ombudsman Service. In addition 
to their concerns  about the length of the mortgage  term,  Mr and Mrs D said they thought  the 
lending on the further advances had been unsuitable.
Halifax didnt consent to us looking at the complaint, saying it had been  brought outside the 
time limits set out in our rules. An ombudsman looked at the time limits  and decided  that we 
could consider the issue of suitability of the lending for debt consolidation in relation to the 
further advances  taken out after November  2006.
An investigator looked at the suitability of the borrowing from November 2006 onwards. He 
noted that, other than the 2016 borrowing, these were all on a non-advised basis. The 
investigator was satisfied that the further  advances met Halifaxs  lending criteria at the time.  
As they were for debt consolidation, no additional borrowing was taken out, simply a 
rearrangement of existing debt. The investigator  was satisfied there was nothing untoward  in 
Halifaxs approval of those further advances.
In relation to the 2016 further advance, this was on an advised basis (as regulations had 
changed and required advice to be given). The investigator looked at the checks Halifax had 
done and was satisfied that these showed  the borrowing to be affordable. He was also 
satisfied that it was appropriate to arrange  the bulk of the mortgage over an 8-year  term in 
2016 to coincide  with Mr and Mrs Ds retirement ages. The remaining £30,000 was over a 
Ref: DRN95458862ten-year term, which,  on a repayment  basis, would leave a small balance  for them  to repay  
once the main mortgage had been  paid off.
Mr and Mrs D didnt agree with the investigators  findings and asked for an ombudsman  to 
review the complaint. Theyve said they had credit card debts and took out personal loans to 
pay these off, which they then added onto the mortgage. They never  paid much  attention  to 
bank statements or mortgage statements, but think theyve  borrowed about £100,000 over 
the years  in unsecured and secured debt. Mr and Mrs D 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reviewed the available documentation relating  to the further advances from November 
2006 onwards.  This shows that, in addition to their existing mortgage, Mr and Mrs D had 
unsecured debts totalling around £17,000.
The notes from 2006 show that Halifax discussed  with Mr and Mrs D the implications of 
adding unsecured debt to the mortgage.  By borrowing  an additional amount and extending 
the mortgage term, Mr and Mrs D were in a position  to pay off most of their unsecured  debt, 
but with only about a £100 increase in their monthly mortgage repayment  during the initial 
tracker rate period. Given the level of their unsecured debt at the time, I dont think  this was 
unsuitable.
By February  2009  Mr and Mrs D were  looking for an additional further advance. Again this 
was a non-advised sale, with Mr and Mrs D choosing a product from Halifaxs available  
range. Im also satisfied  Halifax explained  the implications of consolidating unsecured  debt 
onto the mortgage.
Although it was just over two years since Mr and Mrs D had remortgaged to pay off other  
debts, Halifaxs records show that since theyd paid off their unsecured debts in November 
2006, Mr and Mrs D had incurred additional unsecured debts  of almost £30,000, with 
monthly repayments of around £640. Their  mortgage repayment  was £570 per month,  so 
they were paying  a total of £1,210 per month.  The remortgage reduced Mr and Mrs Ds 
monthly repayments to £772.06 and provided them  with £29,500 to pay off their unsecured 
debts. Having reviewed  this application, I dont  think it was unsuitable.  Mr and Mrs Ds debt 
was not increased,  but was arranged into a form which was affordable.
In February 2011  Mr and Mrs D borrowed a further  £8,000 to pay off a store  card debt in Mrs 
Ds name. This had a monthly repayment of £170.  At this point the monthly mortgage 
repayment was £777. Adding the debt to the mortgage increased the monthly payment to 
£842. Im satisfied suitable warnings were given about adding unsecured debt to the 
mortgage, and Mr and Mrs D proceeded on a non-advised basis.  After reviewing the 
application, I dont  think the lending was unsuitable.  I didnt increase Mr and Mrs Ds overall  
debt exposure.
The application in 2016 was on a fully-advised  basis, as required by regulations  which had, 
by that point, come into effect.
Mr and Mrs D wanted to borrow  an additional  £30,000. The application shows  that, since  the 
2011 further advance,  Mr and Mrs D had incurred further unsecured debts totalling around 
Ref: DRN95458863£30,000 (including £8,500  on the same  store  card that had been repaid from the 2011 
further advance). 
Im satisfied that the advice to consolidate was suitable, given Mr and Mrs Ds level of 
unsecured debt and the cost of repaying that debt.  The initial monthly  payment  (until 
31 October 2021) is £1,192, which is within the budget of £1,210  which Mr and Mrs D told 
Halifax would be affordable for them.
Overall, Im not persuaded the further  advances  were unsuitable or mis-sold to Mr and 
Mrs D. They  met lending  and affordability criteria and were within an appropriate loan-to-
value ratio. None  of the further advances increased Mr and Mrs Ds existing debt as those 
debts already existing  at the point where  Mr and Mrs D wanted to consolidate them.
I appreciate this isnt the outcome Mr and Mrs D were hoping for. But I think its important to 
remember that Halifaxs role as a bank is to administer Mr and Mrs Ds accounts, not 
manage their spending for them. Its unfortunate that each time Mr and Mrs D have paid off 
their unsecured debts  from the further  advances, theyve gone into debt again,  not just with 
Halifax but with other  businesses.  But Halifax isnt expected to police its customers  
spending  and indeed it would be considered intrusive and inappropriate if Halifax was to 
try to do so. Given this, I cant hold the bank responsible for the unsecured debts Mr and 
Mrs D have taken on.
In all the circumstances, after considering  everything Mr and Mrs D and Halifax have said, I 
dont think the bank has done anything  wrong. If Mr and Mrs D are finding  it difficult  to 
manage their spending, they might find it helpful to contact one of the free debt advisory 
agencies, such as StepChange, Citizens Advice or Shelter. We can provide  contact  details 
for those  agencies if Mr and Mrs D would like us to.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs D to accept or reject my decision 
before 14 November 2020.
