The complaint
Mr S complains that Atlanta 1 Insurance Services Limited (trading as Autonet Insurance 
Group) mishandled his van insurance policy.
Where I refer to Autonet, I refer to the above-named company and I include employees and 
others insofar as I hold Autonet responsible for their acts or omissions. 
What happened
On about 17 April 2020, Mr S went online and took out a van policy for the year from 19 April 
2020. Autonet acted as an intermediary between Mr S and his insurer. He paid an initial 
instalment or deposit of £26.57.
The insurer found some information about a claim that Mr S hadnt disclosed and Autonet 
asked him to pay higher instalments amounting to an additional £61.53. Mr S disputed the 
information. On 21 April 2020, Mr S had a webchat with Autonet. Mr S complained to 
Autonet.
By a final response dated late April 2020, Autonet turned down the complaint.
Mr S brought his complaint to us in mid-June 2020. He asked us to investigate Autonet and 
to get it to refund his initial payment of £26.57.
On 14 January 2021 Autonet refunded £246.75. 
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. He didnt think 
that Autonet had provided a satisfactory service. He said that hed been unable to determine 
if Mr S had been refunded the correct amount. He recommended that Autonet pay Mr S 
£100.00 compensation.
Neither Mr S nor Autonet responded to the investigators opinion. So the investigator asked 
for an ombudsman to review the complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012 imposes a duty on a 
consumer to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation when taking out an 
insurance policy.
Separately, most insurers put information about claims on the Claims Underwriting 
Exchange database. 
I cant hold Autonet responsible for information that Mr Ss previous insurers put on the 
database. In any event, Autonet was an intermediary. So I dont hold it responsible for 
setting or increasing the premiums charged by Mr Ss insurer. Therefore I dont find Autonet 
responsible for Mr Ss unpleasant surprise when Autonet told him his monthly instalments 
were more than he thought. 
The webchat include the following from Mr S:
In the meantime I will exercise my right to cancel the policy forthwith and make a 
complaint to the Ombudsman
So its clear that Mr S wanted to cancel the policy. But Autonet didnt cancel (or get the 
insurer to cancel ) the policy. 
From his letters in early December 2020, Mr S had cancelled his direct debit and believed 
Autonet owed him £185.82 plus his deposit of £26.57, a total of £212.39.
At one time, Mr S told the investigator that Autonet had continued to take payments up to 
April 2021.
More recently, Mr S has said that his payments were as follows:
April 2020 £  26.57
April 2020 £  30.97
May 2020 £  30.96
June 2020 £  30.97
July 2020 £  30.97  
August 2020 £  30.97
September 2020 £  30.97
October 2020 £  30.97
November 2020 £  30.97
Total £274.32
But he has only provided bank statements for April 2020 and for January 2021 (when 
Autonet refunded £246.75). I keep in mind his earlier conflicting statements about what he 
thought hed paid. And Mr S hasnt responded to the investigators opinion. So I consider 
that Mr S has fallen short of showing that he had paid more than Autonet refunded. I dont 
find it fair and reasonable to direct Autonet to make a further refund or to pay interest. 
Putting things right
Nevertheless, I consider that Autonet shouldve done more at an earlier stage to put into 
effect Mr Ss clear wish to cancel the policy. Autonets delay in dealing with this caused Mr S 
irritation and put him to the trouble of contacting Autonet on more occasions than shouldve 
been necessary. So I find it fair and reasonable to direct Autonet to pay Mr S £100.00 for 
distress and inconvenience.
My final decision
For the reasons I have explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Atlanta 1 Insurance Services Limited (trading as Autonet Insurance Group) to pay 
£100.00 to Mr S for distress and inconvenience. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 August 2022.
