The complaint
Mr M is complaining about the handling of a disputed transaction by PayPal Europe Sarl & 
Cie, SCA.
What happened
In December 2019, Mr M bought an item from an online retailer and paid using his PayPal 
account. The item cost £88.98. A few days later, Mr M received an email telling him that the 
item had been delivered, but, having looked around his property, he couldnt see the parcel 
anywhere. 
Mr M contacted the delivery company and the seller to try to find out what had happened but 
wasnt able to resolve the matter with them. So, he took his dispute to PayPal  asking that 
they refund the £88.98 he paid for the undelivered item. 
When Mr M contacted PayPal, he said the delivery company had accepted that the parcel 
wasnt delivered to his address and have apologised. But they wont compensate him 
directly as their contract is with the seller. He also said he has CCTV footage showing that 
there was no traffic in the area of his house at the time the delivery was supposed to have 
happened.
PayPal resolved the dispute in the sellers favour. They said the seller had provided tracking 
details showing that the parcel had been delivered. When Mr M complained, they added that 
its an arbitration process and they need to find a solution thats fair to both parties based on 
the verifiable information available at the time.
Mr M brought his complaint to our service. He reiterated that he hadnt received the parcel 
and the delivery company had admitted they couldnt trace it. He said he wanted PayPal to 
refund him the amount hed paid for it, and to compensate him for the time hed had to spend 
on the dispute. He said PayPal had been very difficult to deal with and not made any attempt 
to address the specifics of his case.
Our investigator thought Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. She thought Mr M had provided 
clear evidence that the delivery company had admitted they hadnt delivered the parcel. So 
she said PayPal should find in favour of Mr M and refund the cost of the item. She didnt 
think they needed to compensate him for the time hed spent on the dispute as she felt it had 
largely been caused by the failure of the delivery company, rather than by PayPal.
PayPal didnt agree with our investigator. They said they couldnt review all the information 
Mr M had sent them because of data protection regulations. And they said theyd based their 
decision on the information available to them at the time. They added that theyd worked 
Mr Ms dispute in line with their terms of reference and asked for an ombudsman to review 
the case. So its come to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ms complaint  Ill explain why.
I appreciate PayPals position that they worked Mr Ms dispute in line with their terms of 
reference. These terms do state that PayPal have full and sole discretion to make a final 
decision on a dispute. However, PayPal also have a duty to treat their customers fairly, and I 
dont think theyve done so here.
PayPal have stated that they cant find in favour of Mr M because the seller provided them 
with proof of delivery. But Mr M explained in detail to PayPal why he was sure the item 
hadnt been delivered to his address. And he provided a file of his correspondence with the 
delivery company, in which the delivery company wrote: 
I'm so sorry you have not received your parcel and for the delay in responding to your 
query. We are sorry to hear that you have been unable to locate the parcel. We have 
investigated this thoroughly to locate the whereabouts of this parcel by contacting the 
support team, however, were unsuccessful.  
Mr M also offered to provide PayPal with the CCTV footage of his road which he said proved 
that the parcel wasnt delivered when PayPal said it was. But PayPal didnt take him up on 
this. Their responses to Mr M didnt address his points at all, or ask for any more information. 
And, in their correspondence with us, PayPal said they couldnt use the file Mr M sent them 
due to data protection regulations  but I cant see PayPal told Mr M this or asked him to 
provide the evidence in a different format. So I dont think they treated him fairly.
If PayPal had treated Mr M fairly, theyd have asked him for more details and evidence, and 
considered his position as well as the sellers position before making a decision. I cant be 
sure PayPal would have upheld Mr Ms claim had they done so. But, I think the delivery 
companys statement that they were unable to locate the parcel casts significant doubt on 
the validity of the proof of delivery. From the evidence Ive seen, I think its more likely than 
not that PayPal would have found in favour of Mr M if theyd treated him fairly and 
considered the evidence and explanations he offered them. 
Putting things right
Because I think PayPal would have found in favour of Mr M if theyd treated him fairly, I think 
they should now pay Mr M the amount of £88.98 that he originally paid for the item. And 
because Mr Ms not had the use of this money, PayPal should pay him simple interest at 8% 
per annum from theyd have settled the dispute if they had treated him fairly. While its 
difficult to say when this would have been, all attempts to resolve the dispute ended around 
the end of March 2020. So, Im satisfied its fair to ask PayPal to pay interest to Mr M from 
31 March 2020. 
My final decision
As Ive explained above, Im upholding Mr Ms complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
need to pay Mr M the sum of £88.98, together with simple interest at 8% from 
31 March 2020 to the date of settlement.
If PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA considers that theyre required by HM Revenue & 
Customs to deduct income tax from that interest, they should tell Mr M how much theyve 
taken off. They should also give Mr M a tax deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can 
reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 November 2020.
