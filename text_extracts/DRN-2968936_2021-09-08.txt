The complaint
T and Mr R complain that NewDay Ltd have irresponsibly lent to Mr R.  
What happened
Mr R was accepted for his first NewDay credit card with a credit limit of £250. In January
2016 his credit limit was increased to £500, which then increased to £1,300 in July 2016. In
February 2017 Mr Rs credit limit was increased to £2,300 and in July 2017 this was
increased to £3,400.
Mr R was accepted for a second NewDay credit card in September 2017 with a credit limit of
£1,000. The credit limit was increased to £2,200 in April 2018, then increased to £3,450 in
September 2018 and then to £4,000 in February 2019.
Mr R complained to NewDay to say that they had irresponsibly lent to him. NewDay did not
uphold Mr Rs complaint. They said that when Mr R was accepted for his first NewDay credit
card he had a gross income of £18,000 and unsecured debts of £600. When he was
accepted for his second NewDay credit card in 2017, Mr R had informed them that his gross
annual income had increased to £22,000 and his unsecured debts outstanding were £5,200.
NewDay said that as a responsible lender, when making a decision to offer credit they
considered the information he supplied on his application and the information held at credit
reference agencies and they said they applied fees and interest in line with his terms in
conditions. Mr R was not happy with the outcome of his complaint, so he brought his
complaint to our service.
During our investigation NewDay said that they would partially uphold Mr Rs complaint for
the first credit card he had with them because they had information when they increased his
credit limit from £500 to £1,300 (the second credit increase on his first NewDay account),
that Mr R had been on a repayment plan elsewhere and they wouldnt have increased his
credit limit if they acted on this information. They proposed to refund the proportion of
interest charged following this increase and also any late and over limit fees. They proposed
the refund should be made directly to the account to help reduce the balance.
Our investigator partially upheld T and Mr Rs complaint. He agreed with NewDays decision
to uphold Mr Rs complaint regarding the increase from £500 to £1,300 and the increases
thereafter.
For the second NewDay credit card, our investigator said that he didnt think the second
NewDay credit card should have been opened as the checks they carried out werent
proportionate to the information they had available such as a repayment plan Mr R was on in
the previous year.
Our investigator recommended that NewDay refund all fees and the interest applied to the
first NewDay card from the time of the second increase in July 2016, to pay 8% simple
interest per year from the date the interest and charges were incurred until the date of
settlement and remove any adverse credit information from Mr Rs credit file from the date of
the second credit increase. For the second credit card he recommended that NewDay refund
all fees and interest applied to the account from when the card was opened to the date of
settlement, pay simple interest of 8% per year from the date the interest and charges were
incurred to the date of settlement and remove any adverse credit information for the second
credit card. NewDay asked for an Ombudsman to review the complaint as they didnt agree.
As my findings differed in some respects from our investigators, I issued a provisional
decision to give both parties the opportunity to consider things further. This is set out below:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided to make a provisional decision here as Im providing further information and this
will give both parties a chance to respond to what Ive provisionally decided.
Before agreeing to increase the credit available to Mr R, NewDay needed to make
proportionate checks to determine whether the credit was affordable and sustainable for him.
Theres no prescribed list of checks a lender should make. But the kind of things I expect
lenders to consider include - but are not limited to: the type and amount of credit, the
borrower's income and credit history, the amount and frequency of repayments, as well as
the consumer's personal circumstances. So Ive looked at what NewDay have considered
and have detailed my findings below.
First NewDay credit card:
NewDay have accepted that they shouldnt have increased Mr Rs credit limit from £500 to
£1,300 (the second credit increase on his first NewDay account). So as both parties agree
with this, Ill just be focusing on what NewDay have considered before this.
NewDay opened Mr Rs account with an initial credit limit of £250 in April 2014. Mr R said his
gross annual income was £18,000 and he had unsecured borrowings of £600. Ive looked at
what NewDays application data told them here. The data shows that Mr R had eight active
cards/accounts and outstanding balances on active or defaulted payday loans of £1,794.
The data shows that Mr R had no adverse credit data in the previous 12 months and was up
to date with his current arrangements.
In January 2016 the limit was doubled to £500. Although the credit limit was doubled, Im
persuaded that the increase was not significant as the increase was for only £250. Looking
at Mr Rs statement balances before the credit limit was increased, although he does go
close to the credit limit each month, he is able to pay substantially more than the minimum
payment. He also doesnt have any adverse credit data showing on the information NewDay
saw.
So based on the information available to NewDay Im persuaded that the initial checks they
carried out were proportionate to the level of the original credit  as the outstanding
unsecured debt would be a small proportion of his annual income and the first increase was
a small amount. I will address how NewDay should put things right regarding the further
credit increases later in my provisional decision.
Second NewDay credit card:
Ive looked at what information NewDay considered when looking at accepting Mr Rs
application for his second NewDay credit card. The application data shows some of Mr Rs
outgoings. His living expenses and his monthly accommodation costs were recorded as a
total of £477 a month. Mr Rs income (£22,000) has increased since he opened his firstcredit card account. So on the surface it may appear that Mr R has a lot of disposable
income. But I think that NewDay should have been aware that this may not have shown the
full picture of the information available and Ill explain why.
Mr Rs first NewDay credit card had a limit of £3,400 when he was accepted for his second
account. And NewDays data shows a total unsecured outstanding balance of £5,200. So the
proportion of debt compared to Mr Rs income is a lot higher than what it was when he
applied for his first NewDay credit card. In addition, NewDay had data to show that Mr R was
on a repayment plan for his external debt earlier in the year. So Im persuaded that NewDay
should have looked into Mr Rs outgoings more closely as part of a proportionate check, as it
appeared he may not have as much disposable income as he told them. I say this because
his debt increased and he was on a payment plan not that long before being accepted for his
second NewDay account. The number of his active accounts also increased since his first
application which suggests a further reliance on unsecured borrowings.
So Im satisfied that if NewDay had asked Mr R for his full outgoings as part of a
proportionate check where he already had several unsecured borrowings, then Im
persuaded that this would have shown his outgoings were substantially higher than just £477
a month, and this would have been one reason to prompt NewDay to do further checks
based on his outstanding commitments. I think this should have prompted NewDay to
conduct further proportionate checks especially as they were giving him £1,000 credit limit.
Mr R hadnt had any defaults or County Court Judgments prior to his application for the
second NewDay credit card. This would suggest, on the face of it, that Mr R hadnt had any
major issues in maintaining his payments up to the point of the acceptance of his application
for the second account. But it also does not show the full picture here and I think its that
which was missing from the assessment. Im persuaded that it would have been
proportionate to investigate the unsecured debt Mr R had in more detail, along with his
outgoings prior to accepting his application for the second NewDay credit card.
So I asked Mr R how he was managing to meet his outgoings here. He said he was
borrowing one pay day loan after another to pay different people each month until his debts
were out of control. He said he had loans from credit unions and his credit cards were
maxed out. This led me to ask for his bank statements so I could see the extent of his
borrowing. This is something that Im persuaded NewDay would have wanted to see if they
asked for details of all of his outgoings prior to the credit limit increase as his outgoings
should give rise to a concern that the £1000 credit limit would be unaffordable and
unsustainable for Mr R.
Mr Rs bank statements show that in the three months leading up to the second NewDay
credit card being accepted, he had took out several credit union loans and a payday loan.
The statements indicated that Mr Rs income was not sufficient to meet his outgoings and
therefore Mr R kept obtaining more credit union loans.
So Im satisfied from the information Ive seen here that Mr R could not afford his
commitments, as he did not have enough disposable income to do so, and when NewDay
gave him a credit limit of £1,000 this also became unaffordable for Mr R as he would need to
keep borrowing from multiple sources to meet his increased minimum payments. If NewDay
had asked for details of his outgoings as part of a proportionate check when accepting his
application and giving him an initial credit limit of £1,000 then Im persuaded they would have
seen the increased payments would not have been sustainable or affordable. Im satisfied
they shouldnt have accepted his application as he was clearly struggling to meet his
commitments and borrowing from a number of sources.
In order to put things right, I intend to ask NewDay to rework Mr Rs first NewDay account toensure that from July 2016 interest is only charged on the first £500 outstanding balance
to reflect the fact that no further credit limit increases should have been provided. NewDay
should remove any late payment or over limit fees from July 2016 and the payments Mr
R made from July 2016 should then be deducted from the reworked account balance.
Any extra that was paid should be treated as overpayments and refunded to T with
interest added at 8% per year simple on any overpayments, if there were any, from the date
they were made to the date of settlement. They should also remove any adverse credit
information from Mr Rs credit file from the date of the second credit increase.
For Mr Rs second NewDay account, I intend to ask them to remove interest charged, any
late payment or over limit fees and the payments Mr R made on the account. Any extra that
was paid should be treated as overpayments and refunded to T with interest added at 8%
per year simple on any overpayments, if there were any, from the date they were made to
the date of settlement. They should also remove any adverse credit information for the
second credit card from Mr Rs credit file.
I invited all parties to let me have any further submissions before I reached a final
decision. Mr R responded and said there was no more information he wished to add. T and 
NewDay did not respond to my provisional decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As no party has presented me with any further information to consider, then my final decision 
and reasoning remains the same as in my provisional decision.
  
Putting things right
In my provisional decision I said I intended to ask NewDay to rework Mr Rs first NewDay
account to ensure that from July 2016 interest is only charged on the first £500 outstanding
balance to reflect the fact that no further credit limit increases should have been provided.
NewDay should remove any late payment or over limit fees from July 2016 and the
payments Mr R made from July 2016 should then be deducted from the reworked account
balance. Any extra that was paid should be treated as overpayments and refunded to T with
interest added at 8% per year simple on any overpayments, if there were any, from the date
they were made to the date of settlement. They should also remove any adverse credit
information from Mr Rs credit file from the date of the second credit increase.
For Mr Rs second NewDay account, I said I intended to ask them to remove interest 
charged, any late payment or over limit fees and the payments Mr R made on the account. 
Any extra that was paid should be treated as overpayments and refunded to T with interest 
added at 8% per year simple on any overpayments, if there were any, from the date they 
were made to the date of settlement. They should also remove any adverse credit 
information for the second credit card from Mr Rs credit file. Im still satisfied this is a fair 
outcome for the reasons given previously.
My final decision
I uphold the complaint. NewDay Ltd should rework Mr Rs first NewDay account to ensure 
that from July 2016 interest is only charged on the first £500 outstanding balance to reflect 
the fact that no further credit limit increases should have been provided. NewDay Ltd should 
remove any late payment or over limit fees from July 2016 and the payments Mr R made from July 2016 should then be deducted from the reworked account balance. Any extra that 
was paid should be treated as overpayments and refunded to T with interest added at 8% 
per year simple on any overpayments, if there were any, from the date they were made to 
the date of settlement. They should also remove any adverse credit information from Mr Rs 
credit file from the date of the second credit increase.
For Mr Rs second NewDay account, Newday Ltd should remove interest charged, any
late payment or over limit fees and the payments Mr R made on the account. Any extra that
was paid should be treated as overpayments and refunded to T with interest added at 8%
per year simple on any overpayments, if there were any, from the date they were made to
the date of settlement. They should also remove any adverse credit information for the
second credit card from Mr Rs credit file.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T and Mr R to 
accept or reject my decision before 6 October 2021.
