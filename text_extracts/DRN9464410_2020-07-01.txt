LAH has objected to the Financial Ombudsman  Service considering these  complaints.  This 
is because of when  Mrs R made her complaint in relation to when she took the loans out. 
Ive considered the jurisdiction of these complaints separately. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She thought that LAH was wrong to approve 
loans 5 to 14. LAH disagreed with the adjudicators opinion so the complaint has been 
passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  high cost credit, including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
LAH needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
Ref: DRN94644102These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that LAH should fairly and reasonably  have done  
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Rs complaint.  Ive decided to uphold Mrs Rs 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Mrs R didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 4. Because of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. So I wont  be making a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Mrs R had with 
LAH. So they are something I will take into account  when  considering  the other loans she 
took.
I havent looked at proportionate affordability  checks for loans 5 to 14 because  I dont think 
that it is necessary  to do so. Ive looked  at the overall  pattern  of LAHs lending  history with 
Mrs R, with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which  LAH should reasonably have  seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so LAH should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Ref: DRN94644103Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 5. I say this because:
At this point LAH ought to have realised  Mrs R was not managing  to repay her loans 
sustainably. Mrs R had been indebted to LAH for around a year and a half. So LAH 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mrs R was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying her previous borrowing was leaving in her finances and 
that Mrs Rs indebtedness was unsustainable.
Right from the start Mrs R was provided  with a new loan a very short time after 
settling a previous  one. And at times she had more than one loan running at the 
same time.
Mrs R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed LAH. Loan 14 was 
taken out over four years after Mrs Rs first. So Mrs R had paid large  amounts  of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to LAH over an extended period.
I think that Mrs R lost out because LAH continued  to provide borrowing from loan 4 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Rs indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time.
the length of time over which Mrs R borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mrs Rs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 14 and LAH should put things right.
putting things right  what LAH needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs R paid on loans 5 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 14 should be removed from 
Mrs Rs credit file.
If Mrs R still owes  LAH any of the principal balance she borrowed on her final loan, then 
instead of the above, LAH should remove all the interest and charges applied  to the 
outstanding balance. LAH should then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Mrs R 
went to towards the principal. But importantly, LAH needs to make sure that Mrs R doesnt 
repay more  than the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Mrs R hasnt repaid  the principal she borrowed LAH can deduct this from 
the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mrs R has already paid enough to repay the principal 
then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple* interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement
And if LAH no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Mrs R.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to take off tax from this interest. LAH must  give 
Mrs R a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN94644104my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mrs Rs complaint.
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things  right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs R to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 August 2020.
