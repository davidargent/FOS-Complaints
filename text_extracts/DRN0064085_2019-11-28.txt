K821x#15complaint
Mr B says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. 
Mr B says he couldnt afford the loans and he struggled to repay them. He thinks Sunny 
shouldve seen this and not lent to him. 
background
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be partially upheld. Sunny disagreed with the 
adjudicators opinion. The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Mr Bs complaint should be upheld  in part. A 
copy of the background to the complaint  and my provisional findings are attached and form 
part of this final decision. 
Sunny, and Mr B received  my provisional decision. And no one had anything  to add after 
theyd seen it.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Sunny and Mr B didnt  raise any new points after receiving my provisional decision.  So Ive 
reached the same conclusions I reached before, for the same reasons.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 4 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 to 9;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr B a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Bs complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 December  2019.

Loans 1 to 3 had weekly  repayments, and loans 4 to 9 had repayments due every two weeks. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. Sunny  disagreed with the adjudicators opinion so the 
complaint has been passed  to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to provisionally decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints 
about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry  practice - on 
our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr B could repay the loans  
in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN00640853And the loan payments  being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an 
indication a consumer  could sustainably  make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically  follow 
this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Ive provisionally decided  to uphold Mr Bs complaint  in part 
and have explained why below.
why I think Sunnys checks were proportionate  for loans 1 to 3
Mr B borrowed reasonably high amount for loan 1. And he started loans 2 and 3 while loan one was 
still active. This means that he had borrowed £750 in around 3 weeks. I think this was concerning as it 
was a significant  amount, at over 40% of Mr Bs recorded income of just over £1,700. 
But I dont think its enough  to uphold  the complaint on this basis alone. And it wouldve been 
reasonable for Sunny to think the weekly  repayments were affordable when compared to Mr Bs 
declared disposable  income. And whilst  Mr B clearly  did have a short  term need for money  I dont  
think it wouldve been apparent at this early stage of the lending that he was having  longer term 
problems with his finances.  
So, overall,  I think the checks Sunny  did for these three earlier loans  were reasonable and Im not 
intending to uphold Mr Bs complaint about them. 
why I dont think Sunnys  checks were  proportionate  for loans  4 to 9 and what  proportionate 
checks wouldve  shown
Loan 4 was Mr Bs second  largest  loan so far at £300. And he hadnt been able to repay  loans 1 and 
3 which meant the total loans he had outstanding were £850. Mr B had now been borrowing from 
Sunny for over two months and his indebtedness had increased overall. He had committed  to make 
repayments to Sunny for around another 6 months. 
I think  Sunny couldve realised at that time that Mr B may have some longer  term financial  problems 
rather than just using the loans to help with a temporary cash  flow problem. Sunny shouldve  also 
become concerned about whether it knew enough about Mr Bs true financial situation.
So I think that it wouldve  been proportionate to fully review Mr Bs financial situation. And I think  that 
Sunny needed to verify the information it found out where possible. This is to make sure Mr B was in 
position to make the repayments sustainably.
I dont think Sunny did this. So I need to think about what Sunny wouldve seen if it had carried  out 
proportionate checks. 
Mr B has provided  some information about his financial circumstances which  includes details  about 
his other short term lending. I accept that this might not be exactly  what  Sunny wouldve  seen at the 
time. But I think it wouldve found out similar information if it had made proportionate checks, so I think 
its reasonable  to rely on it.
This shows that Mr B had some problems  managing his money.  He had been borrowing and repaying 
significant amounts to another short term lender.  And hed been doing  this over the time he had been  
lending from Sunny. And he continued to do this going forward. 
Ref: DRN00640854I think  Sunny wouldve seen Mr B wouldnt have  been  able repay  the loans in a sustainable way, that 
is without  borrowing further. So I think that Sunny shouldnt have given loans 4 to 9 to Mr B and I think 
he lost out as a result  of this. So Im provisionally  upholding Mr Bs complaint about  loans 4 to 9. 
was the pattern of lending  unsustainable
Mr B took loans 1 to 9 in just over a three month period. And whilst he did have more  than one loan 
running at the same  time and borrowed again having just repaid a previous loan this wasnt always 
the case. So, on balance,  I dont  think its fair to say that this pattern of lending itself showed that the 
lending had become unsustainable in this case, given the length of time over which he took out these 
loans.
