K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA treated him unfairly in respect of 
payments he was expecting to receive  for his business that were intercepted by a third party.
background
Mr S is a sole trader, running  a retail business  Ill refer to as B. Much of Bs economic activity 
is conducted through an online retail  platform operated by a third party, C. B receives 
payment for goods sold via C, usually by means  of electronic money (e-money) transfers 
made using  PayPal.
In 2018 Mr S was alerted to the fact that the PayPal  account B used to receive customer  
payments had been replaced by another PayPal  account operated by an unknown party (or 
parties). As a result, while  Bs customers had paid for their orders, and B had received and 
fulfilled those orders, B hadnt  received  their payments and was significantly  out of pocket.
Mr S notified  PayPal and C to prevent  any further  loss. He was also able to establish  that the 
problem had been occurring for around  three months, using other  PayPal accounts. He says 
that C told him it couldnt assist. When Mr S approached  PayPal, it told him that its Seller  
Protection policy didnt  cover the issue,  and that whatever funds it had been able to locate in 
the receiving accounts would  be returned  to the sending customers. PayPal suggested  Mr S 
could then contact  his customers to let them know what had happened, and to arrange 
further payment.
Mr S was unhappy with PayPals approach.  He noted that it would mean his customers 
would be in possession  of both the goods  and the payment. He also felt that this would 
cause him a great amount  of difficulty and reputational damage to B, as he didnt  have 
details of which of Bs customers PayPal  had refunded. Mr S had a further concern over the 
way the situation had been allowed to develop and enable  a fraudster to intercept his 
payments. He estimates his overall loss to be in the region of £8-10,000 and wants PayPal 
(or C) to reimburse him; however, each of them appears to attribute responsibility to the 
other.
my provisional findings
I recently issued my provisional  decision to both parties, setting out my thoughts on the key 
complaint points and how best I thought matters should be resolved. In my provisional 
findings, I said:
Based on what Mr S has said in his complaint correspondence, it seems to me the 
key strands of Mr Ss complaint are:
He is concerned about the compromise  of the trading platform with C, and it 
isnt clear how this happened. He thinks its possible the point of compromise 
could have been through PayPal. PayPal considers the breach to have  
happened at C
PayPal treated him unfairly by deciding to return Bs customers  money 
despite B having sent goods.  This has left him significantly out of pocket, and 
following PayPals suggestion  that he approach Bs customers  to resend 
payment would cause  B reputational damage.
Ref: DRN40554872was PayPal responsible for the compromise  of the trading platform?
Bs account with Cs trading platform was accessed by an unknown third party  (or 
parties). Whoever accessed it then amended the details  for receiving payments, 
using several PayPal accounts held in different names.
Ive not seen anything that leads me to conclude that whoever accessed the trading 
platform was able to do so because of a security failure, or indeed  any other action, 
on PayPals part. It also seems to me more  likely  that, if Mr Ss PayPal account  had 
been compromised, there might have been  some transactional  activity  there. 
However, theres nothing  to suggest  that was the case. My provisional finding here is 
that PayPal wasnt  responsible for the compromise  of the trading  platform.  I make  no 
finding about any other party involved in the activity.
did PayPal treat Mr S unfairly?
At the outset, I think its important to say that Mr S brings his complaint  as a customer 
of PayPal, rather than as a payment services user. While  I dont doubt  Bs customers  
thought they were sending payment to B when they bought their goods,  it couldnt 
properly be said that B (or by extension,  Mr S) was the payee as the payment service 
user definition requires.  However, Mr S doesnt  seek to complain that PayPal failed to 
apply the payments in line with the instruction  it received. Rather, his issue  is with 
PayPals actions towards him as its customer, who was seeking to have money 
PayPal controlled  applied to his account.
Im currently  minded to conclude that the circumstances  at play in this case mean  the 
funds PayPal was able to recover from the third party accounts were held on 
constructive trust. PayPal  controlled  that trust, and in doing so it decided  to return the 
money to the original  senders, although  Mr S had made PayPal aware that B had 
fulfilled their orders.
Ive thought carefully about the reasons  PayPal  has given for doing  so. The User  
Agreement and Seller Protection Policy PayPal cited in its responses to Mr S, and 
later to us, doesnt seem  to offer any persuasive  evidence in this respect, as it 
doesnt cover the matter  at hand.  However, PayPal has since  stated its view that it 
was obliged to return the payments due to provisions  of the Payment Services 
Regulations 2017 (PSR2017)  that deal with unauthorised  payments.  I accept  the 
point that the PSR2017  make such a provision for unauthorised payments. So its 
necessary for me to consider whether PayPal is correct in its assertion that the 
payments were unauthorised.
PayPals foundation for its view that the payments were unauthorised is that Owing 
to the fact that the funds  were transferred due to unauthorised activity on the [C] 
platform (which  has been  acknowledged and accepted  by [C]), it follows that the 
payments from the buyers were not properly authorised by the buyers/payers.  This 
position appears to me somewhat flawed. It effectively argues that, as there was 
some sort of unauthorised activity going  on, all connected activity  must also be 
considered unauthorised. I dont think that does automatically follow, and in my view 
its more relevant to consider what the PSR2017 cited by PayPal says about 
authorised payments:
Ref: DRN4055487367.(1)  A payment  transaction  is to be regarded as having been authorised 
by the payer  for the purposes of this Part only if the payer has given its 
consent to
(a)the execution of the payment transaction
I dont believe theres any question here over whether Bs customers  consented to 
the execution  of their payment transactions. They might not have done so if theyd 
known their money was instead being sent to a fraudster and there was a chance 
they wouldnt receive what theyd bought. But I dont understand any of Bs 
customers to have  either disputed receiving  the goods theyd ordered or to 
consenting to make payment. Nor has PayPal sought to provide evidence of either  of 
those things occurring.
Based on the definition  set out in PSR2017 Regulation 67(1)(a) then, Im minded to 
conclude that the payment transactions should  be regarded  as authorised. So I cant 
rightly accept PayPals assertions that the payments were unauthorised and that they 
were under a PSR2017  obligation to return them to the senders.
So how should  PayPal  have exercised its control over the funds in the trust? It had, 
in Mr S, a genuine account holder who was apparently able to provide  evidence to 
support his claim on the funds in question. Ive asked PayPal whether it had any 
competing claims from the senders of the money, or from any other parties who had 
similarly fallen  victim to the third party users who accessed Mr Ss trading platform. It 
hasnt offered anything  to suggest that it received  any such  claims.
If PayPal wasnt satisfied  that it should  pay the money over to Mr S, or that it wasnt 
able to do so because it didnt possess the appropriate authority, then at best, it 
should have retained control of the funds until such point as ownership  was properly 
determined. Instead,  it elected to return money  to the senders and doesnt appear to 
have had good reason  for this course  of action. Im currently satisfied that by doing 
so, it interfered with Mr Ss ability to receive  payment  for the goods  B had 
despatched, making  it more difficult for him to recover the money  and potentially  
exposing his business to reputational damage. My provisional conclusion, therefore,  
is that PayPal failed to treat Mr S fairly  in this respect.
Mr S has estimated Bs lost revenue in the region of £8-10,000.  It would seem that 
the third party  activity had been ongoing for quite some time before Mr S became 
aware of it. He has been able to provide  in confidence  information  from 2018 
relating to around 500 of Bs customer transactions totalling £4,910. PayPal has said 
that by the time it was alerted to the transaction activity, it was able to retrieve US$ 
1,286.23 (about £980 at the time), which it returned to the senders.
While I dont doubt that B has lost a significant  amount due to the actions of the third 
party, the available evidence doesnt  suggest  to me it would be fair to hold PayPal 
liable for much of that loss. As Ive said, Ive seen  nothing  that leads me to conclude 
PayPal was responsible for the way in which the third party was able to access Bs 
trading platform.  Mr S might be able to seek recovery  from C, but C isnt subject to 
my jurisdiction and its not for me to suggest  how such a claim might be pursued.  Mr 
S might wish to seek legal opinion on any steps  he can take in this regard.
Ref: DRN40554874Nor am I persuaded  that it would be fair for me to say PayPal should contribute  
towards the business loan Mr S says he took out to assist with business cashflow. I 
accept Bs cashflow was adversely affected  by the loss. But the amount to which  
PayPal could fairly be held responsible for that overall loss, combined with the delay 
between the events in question and the point at which Mr S entered into the loan, 
dont suggest  to me theyre sufficiently closely connected to propose an award  
relating to this borrowing.
But I dont think PayPal  dealt with Mr S fairly when it took the decision to return  the 
money to the senders, or in the way it suggested  he deal with the problems that 
action prompted.  PayPal hasnt provided Mr S or me with details of the customers to 
whom it returned money. That leaves  Mr S with the options of either not pursuing the 
money, or of contacting several hundred of Bs customers to ask whether theyd 
received a refund of money,  and theyd mind  paying again. I can readily  accept Mr 
Ss point  that this is likely  to lead to a degree  of reputational damage to B, and that 
its perhaps rather less than likely that it will result in the recovery of his money.
I consider that the way PayPal dealt  with the money  it had recovered  and was 
holding in trust, and the surrounding  circumstances, suggest that it would be 
appropriate for PayPal  to pay Mr S £980, representing the amount it returned  to the 
senders. Given the passage of time since Mr S has been deprived  of the use of those  
funds, I think it appropriate that PayPal also pays interest on this sum,  calculated at 
8% simple  per year, from August 2018 when it refunded  the senders, to the date it 
settles this complaint. If PayPal later wishes to contact those senders it has refunded  
to ask them to pay again, it at least has the key information to enable it to do so. But 
for the avoidance  of doubt,  I make  no requirement  of PayPal to make such a request.
Im further minded  to require PayPal to pay Mr S an appropriate sum to reflect the 
distress and inconvenience hes been  caused  by the way its dealt with matters.  Mr 
S, a victim of fraud, has been caused  frustration by PayPals  stance  and its refusal to 
provide him with meaningful information  to assist in recovery. I appreciate PayPal 
considers it has its own obligations of confidentiality that prevent it from sharing key 
information. In my view,  it was open  to PayPal  to reconcile that apparent  difficulty  
without transferring the problem to Mr S.
Mr S has described the impact the situation  had on him and his business.  I dont 
doubt its been a highly  stressful  time. Mr S is a small business owner, and its easy  
to see how these problems have caused  difficulty in both his business  and personal 
life. With this in mind,  I propose  suitable compensation as £800.
I invited both parties to let me have any further  comments they wished to make in response.
response to my provisional  decision
Mr S responded to my provisional findings.  He said, in summary:
His loss was much more than £4,910. The transaction records hed submitted totalled  
more than this, and didnt include multiple item postage costs
It was irrelevant how much PayPal was able to recover. It could retrieve only that 
amount because it had allowed  the third party so much  time to be active on its 
platform. Unlike other payment service providers,  PayPal had allowed the third party 
Ref: DRN40554875to use a merchant  account without any verification. It had failed to protect Mr S as a 
customer, and to prevent misuse of his accounts,  facilitating the third partys actions
PayPal told him it had to refund Bs customers and could not send the identified 
funds to him in case those customers raised  a dispute. However, Bs customers had 
already received their orders and tracking  was provided to PayPal  to prove delivery.  
Further, given the timescale since orders were placed and despatched,  most of those 
customers would have  been  out of time to raise a dispute anyway
He nearly lost his house and went through a depression at the same time as having a 
young family. The amount in question was a drop in the ocean  to PayPal, but a huge 
amount of money to him and his family
PayPal also expressed  disappointment with my provisional decision, albeit for markedly 
different reasons. It said,  again in summary:
Despite the information it had provided to us defending its position, it was evident I 
was putting the emphasis of the blame  and liability on PayPal due to C not being 
within my jurisdiction.  I had stated and agreed that "PayPal wasnt responsible for the 
compromise of the trading platform"
My redress proposals (points  2 & 3) award  for the same item. In point 2 I suggested 
8% simple interest  "to recognise the difficulty caused to Mr S". In point 3 I suggested 
an award of £800 "in recognition of the distress and inconvenience hes been caused 
by PayPals handling of matters".  PayPal considers  I have separated  these into two 
discrete items in an effort  to recover a compensation award  from PayPal and recoup 
some of that from C by separating it into a separate customer  service  related issue  
for stress  and inconvenience
At the outset I stated  it was important to say that Mr S brought his complaint as a 
customer of PayPal,  rather  than as a payment services user. PayPal says we must  
consider first and foremost its role is that of a payment  service  provider of which Mr S 
agreed to use its service when creating his PayPal  account and agreeing  to its terms 
of use
As the funds in question were transferred due to unauthorised activity  on the C 
platform (which  has also been acknowledged  and accepted  by C), it follows that the 
payments from the buyers were not properly authorised by the buyers/ payers. 
PayPal interprets my argument as based  on section 67 of the PSR2017  the 
execution of the payment transaction would therefore between  the buyer and Mr S, 
however, in this instance the funds  were transferred to a third party account but their 
business was with Mr S and not the third party account. PayPal complied with its 
legal obligations  in this case by returning  the funds to the buyers in line with the 
provision of Article 73 of the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2)  which  has 
been transposed  into national  law by the PSR2017. 
It had previously explained that it was not possible to provide Mr S with the 
personally identifiable information  of the payers as to do so would amount to a 
breach of the [General  Data  Protection Regulations] and Data  Protection Act. There 
was no legal basis on which PayPal  could validly share with Mr S a list of refunded 
customers. The obvious avenue was for Mr S to check his own records of the orders  
which had been placed against the payments which  he had received together  with 
his trading history  on C, and to identify impacted customers and to contact his 
customers directly  using  the information in his possession and to which he was 
lawfully entitled to rely on.
Ref: DRN40554876PayPal accounts  are user-initiated, meaning that Mr S would have  had access  to his 
own account in order to see his activity and any payments he was (or wasnt) 
receiving into his account. A reasonable argument could  be made that Mr S could 
have identified this sooner to prevent further losses and identify the unauthorised 
access on his trading platform with C but there  is no evidence to support that he took 
such steps
I thank both parties for providing their responses  in a timely fashion,  enabling  me to move 
forward with my decision.
my findings
Having received a response from both parties, Ive reconsidered all the available evidence 
and arguments  to decide whats  fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I cant agree  with Mr S when he says the amount PayPal was able to recover is irrelevant. 
The amount  of identified funds, and what PayPal did with them, is at the very heart of my 
decision.
As I said in my provisional decision,  Mr S was not, for the purposes of the original  payments, 
the payment services  user in the transactions. So there is no clear mechanism within our 
rules for me to consider,  in the context of a complaint he seeks to bring, whether PayPal was 
in some way remiss in its security processes when allowing third parties to set up accounts 
that they subsequently used to receive  money  from Bs customers. I understand why hes 
unhappy with this position, but that doesnt  enable me to change  it.
Similarly, it would be wrong for me to take into account the relative financial strengths of Mr 
S and PayPal when  deciding  appropriate redress. The fact PayPal might  have sufficient  
reserves to cover his loss doesnt mean  its fair that I require it to do so. For the reasons Ive 
previously explained,  I think its right that PayPal takes responsibility for the fact the money it 
was able to recover  was returned to Bs customers rather than being  held on trust until the 
genuine owner was established.  But while  recognising Mr S has lost a far greater  sum,  I 
cant fairly hold PayPal responsible for the money  it wasnt able to recover and was unaware  
had been misappropriated. In this respect,  I take PayPals point that Mr S would  have been  
better placed than it to identify any earlier money going missing and alert PayPal to the 
situation. However, I dont  share PayPals view that this mitigates  its responsibility  for what  it 
did with the funds it did recover, as that began a separate chain of events.
I have read PayPals comments in respect of my findings  on whether the payments should 
be treated as unauthorised.  I fear PayPal  has misunderstood this point; at no stage have I 
suggested that Mr S was involved  in the execution of the payment transactions.  Indeed,  I 
expressly described why I had concluded that he was not. The purpose of referencing  
Regulation 67 was because it affords a clear and objective definition of when a payment 
transaction is to be treated as authorised by the payer, which I prefer  to the reasoning 
PayPal gave to support  its view that they should be deemed unauthorised and trigger  any 
legal duty to return the payments to the payer. Rather than repeat myself, I will simply refer 
PayPal back to the reasoning given in my provisional decision as to why I dont  accept that 
duty was triggered.
Ref: DRN40554877PayPal also appears  to have failed to understand the redress proposal.  I find its confusion 
disappointing, given  that I set out in clear  terms what each aspect of the proposed remedy 
was intended  to address. In point 2, I specifically stated that the interest element of my 
proposed award  was to reflect the difficulty caused to Mr S from being  deprived of access to 
the money in question. Point 3 references Mr Ss personal distress and inconvenience, 
described in further  detail  in the text of my provisional decision (and here, by Mr Ss own 
further submissions). There is a distinction between  the two, which I dont think  its 
necessary for me to further clarify.
PayPal has further  sought to remind me that it has certain legal obligations relating to 
sharing of customer information, and that providing Mr S with a list of refunded customers 
would potentially breach those obligations. I dont believe that was something I proposed 
requiring PayPal to do, but if it has read my provisional decision in that way then Im happy  
to clarify that I do not require this. My comment was merely that it was for PayPal to find a 
way of reconciling its obligations of confidentiality with treating Mr S fairly.
I dont accept PayPals  contention that the obvious avenue  was for Mr S to undertake an 
audit of all his customers, establishing  those  from which hed received payment and those 
he hadnt, and then contact all of the latter group  to try to ascertain who had received their 
payments back from PayPal. The difficulties that was likely to pose  in recovering funds  
funds that were previously  readily  identifiable  and accessible, had PayPal administered  the 
constructive trust appropriately  along  with the potential reputational damage B could  well 
suffer as a result, suggest to me this was not the most obvious or appropriate way to deal 
with the situation.
PayPals primary  role might be that of a payment services provider. But that isnt where its 
obligations to its customers  start and end, and neither is the user agreement between the 
parties. Mr S is a customer  of PayPal. Relevant law, regulations and matter of good  practice  
also apply to the relationship between the parties. One of the key regulatory principles is that 
customers are treated fairly by their financial service  provider. In this instance, I dont 
consider PayPal has acted in line with that principle.
I make  a final comment on PayPals submissions. The tone of its correspondence, 
particularly in response to my provisional decision, doesnt strike  me as appropriate or 
particularly conducive towards resolving this dispute. Rather  than seeking to suggest I have 
held it liable because  I dont have jurisdiction over other parties involved, PayPal might do 
better to learn from the findings I did reach and have explained both here and in my 
provisional decision.
Ive thought carefully about everything both parties have said in response to my provisional 
decision. I find much of what the parties  have said in response deals with ground already 
covered in their earlier submissions. And I dont find the further arguments they have put 
forward about my proposed conclusions provide me with sufficiently persuasive reasons to 
reach a different outcome.  I remain of the opinion  that what Ive previously proposed  is a fair 
and reasonable way to resolve  Mr Ss complaint. 
Ref: DRN40554878my final decision
For the reasons  set out here, Ive decided to uphold this complaint. To settle it, on receipt of 
Mr Ss acceptance of my decision PayPal  Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must take the following 
steps:
1.pay Mr S £980, representing the amount of the transactions it unfairly returned to the 
payment senders;
2.pay Mr S interest on this amount at a rate of 8% simple per year,  from the date that 
the payments were returned  to the senders (which I understand to be August 2018) 
to the date of settlement. This is intended  to recognise the difficulty  caused to Mr S 
from being deprived of access to the money in question. If PayPal deducts tax from 
the interest element  of this award, it should provide  Mr S with the appropriate tax 
deduction certificate; and
3.pay Mr S £800 in recognition of the distress and inconvenience hes been caused by 
PayPals handling  of matters
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 31 July 2021.
