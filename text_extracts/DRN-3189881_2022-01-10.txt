The complaint
Mr W complains about an over-50s life assurance policy hes been paying into since 2000. 
The policy is now handled by Phoenix Life Limited. Reference to Phoenix Life in my 
decision will mean them, and any predecessor businesses that handled the policy. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts arent in dispute so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Theres no evidence that Mr W was expecting advice from Phoenix Life in 2000 
about whether this policy was suitable for him and his circumstances. 
As an unadvised sale, Phoenix Life just needed to be clear about the key details of 
the policy, when offering it to Mr W.
The key features documents Phoenix Life sent to customers at that time explained 
that a policyholder could end up paying more in premiums than the policy would pay 
out, if the policy was held for a long time. 
This information was quite clear on the key features document, so I find Phoenix Life 
did enough to provide a fair and reasonable service when offering the policy to Mr W. 
For these reasons Im not going to uphold this complaint. That means Im not going to direct 
Phoenix Life to take any further action in this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 February 2022.
