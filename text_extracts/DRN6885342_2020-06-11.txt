K820x#14complaint
Mr Rs complaint against MoneyNetInt Ltd (MoneyNet)  is that it wont  refund him money he
asked it to pay to a third party on his behalf.
background
Mr R is represented by Mr B but for the purposes  of ease and consistency, Ill refer to Mr R 
throughout this decision. 
From February to August 2016, Mr R made payments totalling over â‚¬900,000  to a third party 
via MoneyNet. Mr R says that the money  was transferred for investment purposes  but that 
the promised yield wasnt achieved; he feared hed been scammed.  Mr R attempted to raise 
a complaint with the third party and says that he was threatened to send further  payments 
otherwise his familys safety would be at risk. Because of this, Mr R approached MoneyNet 
to intervene and retrieve his money.  
MoneyNet said it only provided  a payment  processing service and any dispute Mr R had 
regarding the service provided  by the third party fell outside of the remit of its instruction. For 
this reason, it wasnt going to intervene or refund any of the transactions to Mr R. 
Mr R wasnt happy with MoneyNets response and so brought his complaint to our service. 
Mr R says that the third party is a fraudulent  entity which no longer exists.  He says that 
MoneyNet should  have  known this through its own due diligence and because it was 
unwilling to intervene  in the dispute or refund  his money, Mr R has questioned  its 
relationship with the third party.
Our investigator told Mr R that all we could  look at was the payment service MoneyNet had 
provided to him, and whether it did this correctly and in accordance with his instructions. She 
concluded that Mr R had authorised the payment to the third party,  and that MoneyNet made 
the transfer in accordance with Mr Rs instructions. So she told him she couldnt uphold  his 
complaint. 
Mr R didnt accept this explanation. He maintained that he felt MoneyNet was complicit with
the third party  in causing his loss. So he asked for an ombudsmans review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the outcome 
reached by our investigator and Ill explain why. 
At the outset, I should explain that this complaint  has been brought  against  MoneyNet and 
so the remit of my decision  is confined  to the actions  of MoneyNet and whether Mr R has 
suffered a detriment because of something  it has done. It is not for me to make findings on 
how the third party  has utilised Mr Rs money, here. 
Our investigator correctly  advised Mr R that MoneyNets  role was to transfer  his money  in 
accordance with his payment instruction and so the remit of our findings extend  to whether 
MoneyNet did this or not. Its not in dispute that MoneyNet transferred Mr Rs money  to the 
third party as instructed.  The investigator went on to assess whether MoneyNet did enough  
to raise Mr Rs dispute with the third party  and she concluded that it did. Ive also seen 
evidence that it did this.
Ref: DRN68853422Ive looked at MoneyNets involvement  in the transfer of Mr Rs money. Ive seen the 
screenshots detailing the transfers  made by Mr R to the third party via MoneyNet. Ive seen 
no evidence to suggest that Mr R hadnt authorised  the payments  to the third party nor that 
MoneyNet made a mistake in carrying out his instructions. So for this reason, I cant say that 
MoneyNet did anything wrong  when it made  the payment to the third party  and so I cant ask 
it to reimburse Mr R.  
I can see that Mr R is very concerned about  MoneyNet,  and the third party, and believes 
theres more going on than meets  the eye. But we cant investigate  those  issues for him 
because its beyond the remit of this service.
So, notwithstanding what Mr R might suspects  going on in the background, I can only
conclude from the evidence Ive seen, that the payment  service  was provided properly by 
MoneyNet.
I dont have any authority  to consider  a complaint  made by Mr R against the third party as it 
is not regulated  by the Financial Conduct  Authority. I can only look at the payment service 
MoneyNet gave him. Mr R authorised MoneyNet to transfer funds  to the third partys account 
and MoneyNet made the transfers in accordance with his instructions.
I appreciate Mr R is very concerned about  the activities  of the third party.  But I cant say that 
MoneyNet could be held responsible for any loss caused to Mr R as a result of those 
activities simply because it transferred the money  to the third party  when he asked it to do 
so.
For these reasons, I wont be upholding Mr Rs complaint. I understand that this will be 
disappointing for Mr R - especially given how long he has waited for this decision - but Ive 
set out my reasons for reaching this conclusion  above. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint and I make no award  against  
MoneyNetInt Ltd.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 July 2020.
