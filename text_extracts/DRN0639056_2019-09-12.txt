K821x#15complaint
Mrs E complains about the amount that shes been charged by LeasePlan UK Limited for 
damage to a car that she returned  when her conditional sale agreement  ended.  
background
A new car was supplied  to Mrs E under a conditional sale agreement with LeasePlan that 
she signed in March 2016. She returned the car in February 2019 and it was inspected  on 
behalf of LeasePlan. The inspection report recorded  that the car had been driven for 47,588 
miles and listed damage  to the car and a missing key for which a total charge of £1,635 was 
recommended. LeasePlan charged Mrs E £1,635 for the damage. She complained to 
LeasePlan about the amount of the charge and it agreed to remove charges totalling  £453. 
But it said that the charges for the other damage  totalling £1,183  had been correctly  applied. 
Mrs E wasnt  satisfied  with its response so complained to this service.
The investigator recommended  that this complaint should be upheld.  She said that 
LeasePlan hadnt demonstrated that its loss amounted to £1,182 and she recommended that 
it reduce the invoice  to £500.  And she said that Mrs E had paid £150  towards  it so 
LeasePlan should issue a new invoice for the outstanding balance.
LeasePlan has asked for this complaint to be considered  by an ombudsman.  It says, in 
summary, that the damage noted on return of the car and the associated charges  have  been  
applied correctly and are not in dispute  and that the investigators recommendation ignores 
any fluctuations  in valuations, any administrative costs incurred for processing the return of 
the car and is an impractical approach for the volume of returns  with which it deals. But it 
says that it will reduce the charge  to £833  representing the difference in the net book value 
of the car and the sales price achieved  at auction.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs E returned the car to LeasePlan  in February  2019 and it was inspected. The inspection  
report identified damage to the car and a missing key for which  a charge  of £1,635 was 
recommended. LeasePlan charged that amount to Mrs E but reduced  the charge  by £453 to 
£1,182 when she complained to it. 
LeasePlan received a further monthly payment of £299 from Mrs E under the agreement  
which was credited to her account and reduced the outstanding balance for the damage to 
£883. LeasePlan collected the £883  from Mrs Es account but she made a successful 
indemnity claim for that amount. She also tried to make two payments of £350 to LeasePlan 
but those payments either werent made  successfully or were refunded to her.
LeasePlan has provided evidence to show that it valued the car at £9,900 (which is 
consistent with other  valuations  for this model of car with a similar age and mileage) and that 
the car sold at auction for £9,400. And that is the basis on which the investigator  
recommended that the charge for the damage  be reduced to £500  (less the amount paid to 
LeasePlan by Mrs E).
Ref: DRN06390562Its clear from the inspection report that there  is damage to the car. And I consider that 
LeasePlan is entitled to charge for any damage  that isnt fair wear and tear  but only to the 
extent that it has suffered  a loss as a result of that damage. But the loss that it has suffered 
on the car is only £500. So I find that it would only be fair and reasonable in these 
circumstances for Mrs E to be required  to contribute a total of £500 towards the cost of the 
damage. And shes already paid £299 to LeasePlan so if I find that it would be fair and 
reasonable for it to only ask her for a further £201  for the damage.
LeasePlan says that this ignores any fluctuations in valuations, any administrative costs 
incurred for processing  the return of the car and is an impractical  approach  for the volume of 
returns with which it deals. But I dont  consider  that a consumer should be liable  for 
fluctuations in valuations and LeasePlans administrative costs  for processing the return of 
the car should  already  have been  allowed for when it calculated the figures  for supplying the 
car to Mrs E under a conditional sale agreement.  
I accept that it isnt practical  for this approach  to be taken  on all cars that are returned  to a 
credit provider  but where there  is information to show the loss that it has incurred on a car 
(as there is in this case)  I dont consider it to be fair or reasonable for a credit provider to 
charge the consumer more than that amount  for damage to the car. That would result in it 
profiting from the damage charge  which wouldnt be fair or reasonable.
my final decision 
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mrs Es complaint. And I order  LeasePlan UK 
Limited to reduce the outstanding balance on Mrs Es account for the damage charge to 
£201.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 October  2019.
