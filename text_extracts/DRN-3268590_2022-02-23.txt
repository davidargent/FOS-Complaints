The complaint
Mr H complained that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money acted 
irresponsibly when it gave him unaffordable loans.
What happened
Mr H took out three loans with 118 118 Money as follows:

paid by loan 3
3 19.2.2020 £3,546.24 24 months £197.51 £4,740.24 Outstanding 
Mr H has brought his complaint to us through his representative, but to keep things 
simpler, Ill just refer to Mr H.
Our adjudicator assessed the complaint and whilst he didnt think that we could uphold 
Mr Hs complaint about loans 1 and 2, he did think that loan 3 shouldnt have been provided. 
He set out his findings in a letter explaining how hed come to his view. 118 118 Money said 
it accepted what our adjudicator said and agreed to pay the recommended redress in 
respect of loan 3 to put things right. Mr H also agreed with our adjudicator about loan 3 but 
felt that his complaint about both the other loans should be upheld as well. 
Mr H mainly said that his bank statements showed a true reflection of his actual financial 
situation at the time and that the extent of his spending on gambling meant none of these 
loans was likely to be sustainably affordable. So 118 118 Money shouldnt have provided 
any of them. 
As Mr H disagreed with our adjudicators view, it has come to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry 
practice at the time. Id like to reassure Mr H that Ive looked at the complaint afresh  and 
Ive independently reached the same conclusions as our adjudicator. Ill explain why I say 
this.
The rules dont say what a lender should look at before agreeing to lend. But reasonable and 
proportionate checks should be carried out. Lenders must work out if a borrower can 
sustainably afford the loan repayments alongside other reasonable expenses the borrower 
also has to pay. This should include more than just checking that the loan payments look 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation  a proportionate check might also 
require the lender to find out the borrowers credit history and/or take further steps to verify 
the borrowers overall financial situation.  
If reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out, I need to consider if a loan 
wouldve been approved if the checks had been done. If proportionate checks were done 
and a loan looks affordable, a lender still needs to think about whether theres any other 
reason why it would be irresponsible or unfair to lend. For example, if the lender shouldve 
realised that the loan was likely to lead to significant adverse consequences or more money 
problems for a borrower who is already struggling with debt that cant be repaid in a 
sustainable way. 
As 118 118 Money has agreed to uphold Mr Hs complaint about loan 3 and do what is 
needed to put things right in line with our adjudicators recommendation, then I dont need to 
consider this loan further save to include it in the redress. So Ill concentrate on looking into 
loans 1 and 2.
118 118 Money asked Mr H about his income and expenditure and also carried out credit 
checks. He said he was earning around £2,000 per month when he took out these loans and 
his monthly expenditure was approximately £480. 118 118 Money checked Mr Hs declared 
income using third party data. 
After allowing for the cost of the repayments he would have to make for these loans on 
top of his other monthly outgoings, 118 118 Money worked out that the repayments 
should still have been affordable for Mr H. 
I cant see that there was anything in the information Mr H provided or the other 
information 118 118 Money had recorded, which meant that 118 118 Money shouldve 
taken more steps to check the information Mr H had declared. He had available unused 
credit shown on the credit report 118 118 Money acquired, his accounts looked to be well 
managed and his overall amount of debt wasnt excessive or concerning. I think the 
checks were enough for 118 118 Money to agree to lend loan 1 and the information 118 
118 Money had gathered reasonably supported its lending decision.
When he applied for loan 2, Mr H hadnt shown 118 118 Money any signs that he was 
finding it hard to pay for his borrowing and the figures hed declared, and the information 
118 118 Money had collected, still seemed to support 118 118 Moneys lending decision. 
Ive taken into account everything Mr H has said, including his comments in response to our 
adjudicators opinion and his view that 118 118 Money shouldve found out the information 
thats on his bank statements before agreeing to lend to him. 
But at this stage of the lending relationship, I dont think proportionate checks wouldve 
required 118 118 Money to ask Mr H to prove what he was declaring or check other 
information sources (like his bank statements for instance) to verify what he had told them 
(or omitted to say) about his financial circumstances. To sum up, I think the checks that 118 118 Money carried out before it agreed to provide 
loans 1 and 2 were proportionate and it was entitled to rely on the information it acquired 
which showed that these loans looked sustainably affordable for Mr H. 
So I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint about loans 1 and 2.
Im sorry that Mr H finds himself in financial difficulty. I accept that Mr Hs financial situation 
possibly wasnt fully reflected either in the information he provided or the other information 
118 118 Money obtained.
But in order to uphold a complaint I have to be able to say a lender acted unfairly or 
unreasonably in some way. And, in this case, I dont think that 118 118 Money did 
anything wrong in deciding to lend loans 1 and 2 to Mr H. It did sufficient checks in the 
particular circumstances of these loan applications and made fair lending decisions based 
on the information it obtained. 
So I havent seen enough to be able to uphold his irresponsible lending complaint in 
respect of the first two loans.
I appreciate that my decision is going to disappoint Mr H. But I hope that setting out the 
reasons as Ive done will help explain how Ive reached my decision.
Putting things right
Our adjudicator didnt recommend that 118 118 Money should pay any additional redress. 
Mr H hasnt commented on that and I havent seen anything which makes me think 118 118 
Money acted unfairly towards Mr H in any other way. 
So Im not awarding any additional redress. 
And I think it is fair and reasonable for Mr H to repay the capital amount that he borrowed 
when he took out loan 3, because he had the benefit of that lending. 
But he has been charged extra for a loan that should not have been provided to him and 
thats unfair. In line with this Services approach, Mr H shouldnt repay more than the capital 
amount he borrowed. 
So, if it hasnt already, 118 118 Money should do the following:
add up the total amount of money Mr H received as a result of having been given 
loan 3. The repayments Mr H made should be deducted from this amount.
If this results in Mr H having paid more than he received, then any overpayments 
should be refunded along with 8% simple interest* (calculated from the date the 
overpayments were made until the date of settlement).
If any capital balance remains outstanding, then 118 118 Money should attempt to 
arrange an affordable/suitable payment plan with Mr H.
Whilst its fair that Mr Hs credit file is an accurate reflection of his financial history, its 
unfair that he should be disadvantaged by any adverse information recorded about a 
loan that was unfairly provided. So 118 118 Money should remove any negative 
information recorded on Mr Hs credit file regarding loan 3.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to deduct tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money should give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted if he asks 
for one.My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, I uphold Mr Hs complaint about loan 3 and Madison CF UK 
Limited trading as 118 118 Money should take the steps Ive set out above to put things 
right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 March 2022.
