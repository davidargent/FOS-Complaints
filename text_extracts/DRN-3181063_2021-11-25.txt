The complaint
The trustees of a charity, T, complain on its behalf that National Westminster Bank Plc 
repeatedly failed to update the mandate for Ts bank account.  They say NatWests failures 
caused T to suffer losses of more than £370,000.
What happened
I understand that all parties agree:
As at March 2015, T had banked with NatWest for some years. There had been 
previous issues, for example with a lost application form and outdated proof of 
address, but Ts understanding in March 2015 was that all issues had been resolved. 
T and its trustees did not know that there were any difficulties with the mandate on its 
bank account.
In April 2015, NatWest suspended Ts access to its account. That meant T could not 
receive payments to its account, and the cheques it issued could not be cashed.
T did not regain full access to its banking facilities until January 2018.
T complained to NatWest in August 2019. In response, NatWest accepted that it 
made two errors: it lost documents in 2012, and it sent T the wrong forms to update 
signatories in 2016. But NatWest did not accept that those errors had caused the 
losses T claimed. 
NatWest later paid £750 to Ts account in recognition of the inconvenience caused by 
the loss of the 2012 documents and the 2016 issue with the forms. T did not accept 
that £750 represented fair compensation, and referred its complaint to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. Briefly, he said:
He thought NatWest did make errors in relation to the mandate  in particular, it 
failed to take any action when T requested a mandate change in 2012, it suspended 
Ts account without any communication with T, and it sent the wrong forms in 2016. If 
NatWest had acted as it should, he thought T would have suffered less 
inconvenience and paid less in bank charges.
However, he also thought that some of the delays were the result of Ts actions 
rather than NatWests. He noted that T took over a year to complete and return the 
forms NatWest supplied in 2016.
He didnt think it would be fair for the ombudsman service to order NatWest to make 
a payment to T in respect of lost donations, lost profit, Companies House penalties or 
accountancy fees. He thought T could and should have arranged an alternative way 
to receive donations, and he didnt think T had demonstrated that NatWests errors 
had caused the losses it claimed.
Overall, he said that a fair outcome to the complaint would be for NatWest to refund 
£194.95 in bank charges, and pay an additional £750 to compensate T for the 
inconvenience the banks errors had caused.
NatWest accepted our investigators conclusions, but T did not. Ts complaint was therefore 
referred to me, as an ombudsman at the Financial Ombudsman Service.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
T and its representatives have provided detailed submissions, which I confirm I have read in 
their entirety. I thank them for those submissions, and I hope that they dont consider it a 
discourtesy that my decision will not contain a similar level of detail. Instead, Ive focused on 
what I consider to be the key aspects of this complaint, in line with this services role as an 
informal dispute resolution service. I have also been careful to preserve Ts anonymity in this 
decision  which will be published on our website. That means I have not named any people 
or organisations other than the bank. 
It is clear that NatWest has made a number of errors here, and that some compensation is 
appropriate as a result. But I am not satisfied that the banks errors were the cause of all the 
losses T claims. In addition, I consider that T could have done much more than it did to 
mitigate the impact of NatWests errors. Overall, I am satisfied that NatWests offer to pay T 
£194.95 in respect of bank charges and a further £750 in respect of inconvenience does 
represent a fair and reasonable outcome to Ts complaint. I explain why below.
The underlying cause of the April 2015 suspension of Ts bank account appears to be 
NatWests failure to process the mandate change T attempted to put in place in 2012. I am 
aware that there were earlier difficulties between T and the bank, but the failed attempt at a 
mandate change in 2012 appears to be the reason for NatWests April 2015 confusion about 
who was  or should have been  entitled to operate Ts bank account.
I dont know exactly what happened in 2012, but on balance I think it is more likely than not 
that NatWest misplaced the documents T provided, then failed to make the requested 
changes to the mandate on Ts bank account. That meant that when NatWest reviewed 
matters in 2015 it discovered that the people named on the mandate for Ts bank account 
were no longer associated with T. In the circumstances, I consider that NatWest did need to 
take action in 2015  but I agree with our investigator that the bank could have initially done 
something that would be less immediately disruptive to the charity. 
However, I dont think NatWests mistakes mean that it would be fair for me to order 
NatWest to reimburse the losses T claims. I say that because:
T took a very long time  around a year  to respond to some of NatWests 
correspondence. Some of that delay was in no way Ts fault; I can see that some of 
the emails NatWest sent were to former trustees or to email addresses that did not 
exist. But despite those mistakes on NatWests part, given the importance of this 
issue to T I think its trustees should have been much more proactive about 
contacting NatWest.
T did not open an alternative bank account with another bank. I accept that its 
representatives have said it was not legally possible to open an alternative bank 
account, but I am not persuaded that NatWests actions were the reason T could not open an account elsewhere.  I also note that whilst Ts representatives have said that 
other banks would have declined an application, they have not provided any 
evidence from those other banks.
If T had opened a bank account elsewhere, it would have been able to receive 
donations. I am therefore not persuaded that NatWests actions prevented T from 
receiving the donations mentioned in Ts submissions.
Ts representatives say that it was unable to carry out the contracts it described in its 
correspondence with our service unless it had access to a bank account. I accept 
that. But as above, I am not persuaded that NatWests errors were the reason T 
could not open a bank account elsewhere. As a result, I do not think it would be fair 
for me to order NatWest to compensate T for any loss of profit or reputational 
damage resulting from Ts inability to enter into those contracts.
Finally, I am not persuaded that NatWests errors were the cause of Ts failure to 
submit accounts to Companies House or to any other party, and so I do not think it 
would be fair for me to order NatWest to reimburse any of the penalties or 
accountancy fees T was required to pay.
Putting things right
I understand there is no longer any dispute about bank charges. T and NatWest agree that 
NatWest applied £194.95 of bank charges over the relevant period, and NatWest has agreed 
to refund those charges. That leaves the issue of compensation for inconvenience.
I accept that if everything had happened as it should  and both NatWest and T had acted 
promptly  it is likely that T would now be in a better financial position than it is. But for the 
reasons Ive given, I dont think it would be fair for me to order NatWest to reimburse T for 
any financial losses over and above the bank charges.
I have also considered non-financial loss, and in particular the inconvenience NatWests 
errors caused to T. NatWest has already paid T £750 in recognition of that inconvenience, 
and our investigator recommended it pay a further £750 (making a total of £1,500). I 
acknowledge that Ts representatives will strongly disagree, but in the overall circumstances 
here I think NatWests offer does fairly compensate T for the very substantial inconvenience 
caused by NatWests repeated errors over a long period.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ts complaint about National Westminster Bank Plc in part. 
NatWest should compensate T in respect of bank charges and inconvenience only. 
If it has not already done so, I order NatWest to pay T:
£194.95 in respect of bank charges; and
A further £750 in respect of inconvenience (making a total of £1,500 for 
inconvenience).
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 December 2021.
