The complaint
Mr A complains that Santander UK Plc is refusing to refund him the amount he lost as the 
result of a scam. 
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to all parties, so I wont repeat what 
happened in detail.
In summary Mr A was introduced to a business called ICD Cloud Mining (X) by his boss at 
work who had been trading with X for several years and had seen good returns. Mr As boss 
explained how an investment worked and Mr A did some of his own research on X before 
deciding to invest himself.
After investing some relatively small amounts with X Mr A decided to make sure he could 
withdraw funds from the investment. Mr A was able to make a withdrawal.
Confident he was dealing with a legitimate business Mr A went on to make further payments 
to X. Mr A tested the withdrawal process again, and again he was able to make a 
withdrawal. Seeing his investments grow Mr A continued to make further payments to X.
Mr A was in communication with X via WhatsApp and was in group conversations with other 
investors. Some of the people in the groups Mr A knew personally and they also persuaded 
Mr A that his investment was safe.
Eventually X started to ask for larger payments so that Mr A could withdraw funds and it 
became apparent Mr A had fallen victim to a scam.
Mr A made the following payments to X using his debit card and via transfer to the legitimate 
cryptocurrency exchange Binance:
1. 23 April 2021 - £1,000
2. 5 May 2021 - £500
3. 6 May 2021 - £1,000
4. 6 May 2021 - £550.23 credit
5. 7 May 2021 - £1,500
6. 26 May 2021 - £2,500
7. 29 May 2021 - £2,500
8. 3 June 2021 - £4,935.38 credit
9. 4 June 2021 - £2,500
10. 4 June 2021 - £7,500
11. 10 June 2021  10,000
12. 13 June 2021 - £5,000
13. 13 June 2021 - £5,000
14. 14 June 2021 - £5,000
15. 1 July 2021 - £5,000 credit
16. 2 July 2021 - £12,000
17. 8 July 2021 - £10,500
Mr A has been unable to recover anything more from X.
Our Investigator considered Mr As complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. As Mr A 
disagreed this complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Santander was unable to process a chargeback for the payments Mr A made in relation to 
this scam to Binance via his debit card.
The chargeback scheme is a voluntary scheme set up to resolve card payment disputes
between merchants and cardholders. The card scheme operator ultimately helps settle 
disputes that cant be resolved between the merchant and the cardholder.
Such arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme, meaning there are only limited
grounds and limited forms of evidence that will be accepted for a chargeback to be
considered valid, and potentially succeed. Time limits also apply.
Mr A was dealing with X, which was the business that instigated the scam. But Mr A didnt 
make the debit card payments to X directly, he paid a separate cryptocurrency exchange 
(Binance). This is important because Santander was only able to process chargeback claims 
against the merchant he paid (Binance), not another party (such as X).
The service provided by Binance would have been to convert or facilitate conversion of
Mr As payments into cryptocurrency. Therefore, Binance provided the service that was 
requested; that being the purchase of the cryptocurrency.
The fact that the cryptocurrency was later transferred elsewhere  to the scammer  doesnt
give rise to a valid chargeback claim against the merchant Mr A paid. As Binance provided 
the requested service to Mr A any chargeback attempt would likely fail.
The payments Mr A made from his Santander account by transfer were also unable to be 
refunded in accordance with the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM) because the 
CRM code does not apply to payments made to and from accounts in the same persons 
name, as was the case in this scenario. 
Mr A has accepted he authorised the payments he made to Binance, so the starting point 
here is that Mr A is responsible. However, banks and other Payment Services Providers 
(PSPs) do have a duty to protect against the risk of financial loss due to fraud and/or to 
undertake due diligence on large transactions to guard against money laundering.
The question here is whether Santander should have been aware of the scam, and if it 
should have been aware, and stepped in, would it have been able to prevent the scam from 
taking place.
The payments Mr A made into the scam started at relatively low amounts that I wouldnt 
have expected to trigger Santanders fraud prevention systems, especially as the business 
Mr A was paying was a legitimate business and he was also receiving credits from the same 
business.However, on 4 June 2021 Mr A made two payments of £2,500 and £7,500. Considering Mr A 
was making two payments in the same day totalling £10,000 I think this should have 
triggered Santanders fraud prevention systems and a conversation should have taken 
place. 
I have thought about whether a conversation between Mr A and Santander would have 
prevented any further payments being made in relation to the scam and I dont think it would 
have. I will explain why.
A payment Mr A tried to make later for £12,000 was stopped and a conversation took place 
between Mr A and Santander. Mr A explained that he had to pay Binance a withdrawal fee to 
release the profit from Binance to avoid further fees. I dont think a fee payable to Binance 
would be seen as a potential scam by Santander.
Had Santander spoken to Mr A sooner, and he had given an accurate account of what the 
payments were for, he would have told Santander that he was investing with X via Binance, 
that he had previously made payments to X and realised a profit that he was able to 
withdraw. Mr A would also have said that X was recommended to him by his boss who he 
knew personally and that his boss had also made investments with X that had realised a 
profit that he was able to withdraw. Mr A would also have said he had researched X himself.
I dont think the information Santander would have gathered had it spoken to Mr A from 4 
June 2021 onwards would have uncovered the scam that was taking place or put Santander 
in a position to prevent Mr A from incurring any further loss.
So, I dont think Santander is responsible for Mr As loss and I dont require it to refund any 
of the payments he made.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 April 2023.
