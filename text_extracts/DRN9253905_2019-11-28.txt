Mr L complains  that Madison CF UK Limited  trading as 118 118 Money  was irresponsible 
when it provided  him with three loans between  October 2015  and August 2017. 
background
Mr L took three loans  with 118 118 Money. Each  of them was due to be repaid through  24 
monthly instalments.  The first was for £3,500.  Mr L repaid  Loan  1 early using some  of the 
proceeds of the second loan to repay the first. And similarly, he used some of the third loan 
to repay  the second.
This table  includes  some  of the information provided to us by 118 118 Money about Mr Ls 
loans.

When Mr L complained  to 118 118 Money, it didnt agree that it had been irresponsible.  So 
he brought his complaint to this Service. One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Ls 
complaint and recommended that it be upheld  and that 118 118 Money  put things right. It 
doesnt agree and so the complaint has come to me  an ombudsman  for a decision. If 
Mr L accepts my decision it will be binding on the parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
118 118 Money provided the loans in question while it was authorised and regulated  by the 
Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA).
The FCAs Principles for Business  set out the overarching requirements which all authorised  
firms are required to comply with. These  included  PRIN 2.1.1 R (6) which says: A firm must 
pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.
The Consumer Credit  sourcebook (CONC)  sets out the rules  and guidance which  apply to 
loan providers like 118 118 Money  when providing  loans. CONC 5 sets out a firms 
obligations in relation  to responsible lending.  
Ref: DRN92539052Section 5.2.1R of CONC set out what a lender needed to do before agreeing to give a 
borrower a loan saying:
(1) Before making a regulated credit agreement the firm must undertake
an assessment of the creditworthiness of the customer.
And at Section  5.2.1(2), a firm must consider:
(a) the potential  for the commitments  under the regulated credit agreement  to 
adversely impact the customers  financial situation, taking into account  the 
information of which the firm is aware at the time the regulated credit agreement  is to 
be made; and
(b) the ability of the customer to make repayments as they fall due over the life of 
the regulated  credit  agreement, or for such an agreement which is an open-end 
agreement, to make repayments within a reasonable  period.
CONC also included guidance about proportionality of assessments. CONC 5.2.4G(2) 
saying:
A firm should consider  what  is appropriate  in any particular circumstances dependent  
on, for example, the type and amount of credit  being  sought  and the potential  risks to 
the customer. The risk of credit not being  sustainable directly  relates  to the amount  of 
credit granted and the total charge for credit  relative  to the customers  financial 
situation.
CONC 5.3 contained further  guidance on what a lender should bear in mind when thinking 
about affordability. CONC 5.3.1G(1) saying:
In making the creditworthiness assessment  or the assessment required by CONC 
5.2.2R (1), a firm should  take into account  more than assessing the customers ability 
to repay  the credit.
CONC 5.3.1G(2) then added:
The creditworthiness assessment and the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R (1) 
should include the firm taking reasonable steps  to assess the customers  ability to 
meet repayments under  a regulated credit  agreement  in a sustainable manner 
without the customer  incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant adverse  
consequences.
CONC 5.3.1G(6) clarified  what is meant  by sustainable:
 
For the purposes of CONC  sustainable means  the repayments under  the regulated 
credit agreement can be made by the customer:
(a) without undue  difficulties, in particular:
(i) the customer should be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; and
(ii) without having to borrow  to meet the repayments;
Ref: DRN92539053(b) over the life of the agreement, or for such an agreement which  is an open-end 
agreement, within  a reasonable period; and
(c)  out of income and savings without having to realise security or assets; and 
unsustainable has the opposite meaning.
CONC 5.3.1G (4) added that if a firm does take account of income and expenditure in its 
credit worthiness assessment:
(b) it is not generally sufficient for a firm to rely solely for its assessment of the  
customers income and expenditure on a statement of those matters  made  by the 
customer.
(c) its assessment should be based  on what  the firm knows at the time of the 
assessment
Whilst CONC sets out the regulatory framework that authorised consumer credit providers 
have to adhere to it represents a minimum standard for firms. And - as an ombudsman - Im 
also required  to take into account any other guidance, standards, relevant codes of practice, 
and, where appropriate, what I consider to have  been good  industry  practice.
Taking into account the relevant rules,  guidance,  good industry  practice and law, I think 
there are some overarching  questions  I need  to consider in order  to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of Mr Ls complaint:  
Did 118 118 Money  complete  reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that Mr L 
would be able to repay this loan in a sustainable way?  
If so, did it make  a fair lending decision?
If not, would  those checks have shown that Mr L wouldve been able to do so?
Ive outlined above some  of the regulations in place at the time 118 118 Money provided the 
loans to Mr L. It had to carry out a reasonable and proportionate assessments of whether he 
could afford  to repay his loans in a sustainable  way. 
The checks  118 118 Money did, had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances  of the 
loan.  And  what is proportionate  will depend on a number  of factors  including  things like the 
consumers financial history and current situation as well as things such  as the amount, type, 
cost of the credit being sought.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have  
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income); 
Ref: DRN92539054the longer  the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit  is likely 
to be greater and the customer is required to make  payments for an extended period); 
Ive carefully considered  what a reasonable and proportionate check  shouldve  looked like 
when 118 118 Money was in the process  of approving the three loans for Mr L. 
I note that Mr L applied for a loan of £5,000 when he first approached 118 118 Money  for 
credit. But he was only approved for a loan of £3,500. Our adjudicator  asked 118 118 Money 
about this. It said: If a customer is granted  an APR of 99.9%  then the maximum loan 
amount we can offer is £3,500 (as long as affordability fits). Loans of £5,000 were given to 
customers who were granted the APR of 35.9%.  
But 118 118 Money hasnt explained  what it was about Mr L that meant  that it wasnt  minded 
to approve a loan of £5,000. From  what I can tell it looks  to me that the monthly  cost of a 
£5,000 loan over 2 years at 35.9% was likely to be only around £5 per month more for Mr L. 
In other  words by granting him a loan of only £3,500 at 99.9% he was going  to have to pay 
over £3,200 in interest: whereas had he been granted  a loan of £5,000  at 35.9% the total 
interest payable wouldve  been closer to £1,800.  
In these circumstances I have some concerns that affordability for Mr L may not have been  
paramount consideration for 118 118 Money  after all the monthly repayments for the two 
options were virtually the same.  And as Ive said above, 118 118 Money had to consider the 
risk of credit not being sustainable  for Mr L and this directly relates to the amount of credit  
granted and the total charge for credit relative to the customers financial situation  not the 
risk to itself of not getting back its money. 
But, whatever  the reasons behind 118 118 Moneys  decision  (and the practical impact 
meaning Mr L would pay significantly  more interest for the smaller loan with the higher 
interest rate) it seems 118 118 Money had enough  concerns about Mr Ls creditworthiness 
to decline his application for the higher loan of £5,000.  And given the information it had  
which Ill refer to below - I think it was right to be concerned.
Ref: DRN92539055118 118 Money obtained details of Mr Ls income and outgoings through  an on-line 
application form he had completed - and it did a credit file check.  There was also a welcome 
call between  118 118 Money and Mr L. It adds that it built an internal credit score for Mr L 
but its unwilling  to share this with us, saying that its commercially sensitive.
Loan 1 was for a relatively significant  sum - £3,500 - and was going  to take Mr L two years to 
repay it at a cost of over £280  per month. In total Mr L was going to repay over £6,730. He 
declared a monthly  income of £1,800. Mr L also declared some expenditure - totalling £370. 
He stated that his housing  cost £130  per month,  utilities £20, food £20, insurance £100 and 
card payments £100. He declared  zero for loans.  
It seems  to me that the amounts declared  by Mr L appear very low: for example £20 for food, 
for a month, is exceptionally low in my experience  and as such  ought to have alerted 
118 118 Money to question  these figures in more detail. It says that its entitled to rely on the 
information provided by the consumer. I dont generally disagree, but of course the 
regulations required  118 118 Money to carry out a proportionate assessment  and it 
couldnt ignore  information it had. CONC says  as I've mentioned above  - it is not generally 
sufficient for a firm to rely solely for its assessment of the  customers income and 
expenditure on a statement of those  matters made by the customer  its assessment 
should be based on what the firm knows at the time of the assessment
As such,  these expenditure figures  alone shouldve led 118 118 Money to carry out some  
further checks of was being  declared  by Mr L  given that it put such  store on what he was 
telling it in making its assessment.
I accept that 118 118 Money asked Mr L for the front sheet of his bank statements but it 
seems to me  having listened to the welcome  call  that this was to verify Mr Ls 
identification and to confirm the details hed provided about his bank account. But as 
118 118 Money had the front page, I dont think it could fairly ignore what  it showed.
I can see that on the front sheet of the bank statement  which Mr L provided, theres a 
transaction for overdraft fees of £76. This is because, based  on this one page  of his bank 
statement, Mr Ls account was significantly overdrawn. The amounts varied  between  around 
£2,585 and £3291 overdrawn. If this was the general state of Mr Ls account it would 
suggest that that even when Mr Ls monthly wage was paid into his account,  it was likely to 
remain overdrawn by several  hundred  pounds. I think  this is something which ought to have 
caused at least  some concern to a responsible lender.
118 118 Money has provided a copy of the credit report information it obtained for Mr L 
before it approved Loan 1. From  this report 118 118 Money  was aware that Mr L had 11 
active accounts and an outstanding balance  of £21,956.  As an aside  I note that Mr L had 
declared that the purpose of this loan was to consolidate borrowing (even though  hed 
declared zero for loans  in his expenditure form).  Given the high amount of outstanding credit 
he had (according to the report obtained by 118 118 Money), this loan was unlikely to 
alleviate his debt situation. If he used the whole £3,500 towards other debts,  hed still be left 
with a balance  of close to £18,500. But there  was much more in this credit  file report  which 
shouldve alerted 118 118 Money to the fact that Mr L was struggling financially.
For example:
On a mail order account Mr Ls balance was £903 when  his credit limit was £1,000. 
His balance had been creeping up over the previous  months.
Ref: DRN92539056His current account had an overdraft facility of £3,200   and generally it was 
overdrawn by around £2,900: this ties in with the front page of the bank statement 
which 118 118 Money had in its possession  and to which  Ive referred above.
A credit card account with a credit  limit of £500  had a balance of £500 and had 
exceeded that limit two months  before. Over the previous  seven months the amount 
Mr L repaid  varied between £17 and £30, which is likely to be close to the minimum 
amount he was allowed to pay.
A credit card account with a credit  limit of £650  had a balance of £677. In the 
previous eight months Mr L had exceeded  his credit limit six times. The amount he 
repaid varied  but I note that in June 2015  he doesnt  appear  to have repaid anything. 
He was also making small cash withdrawals on this credit  card- an expensive  form of 
credit and often an indication of financial difficulties
In June 2015 (four months  before Loan 1) Mr L had committed to a hire purchase 
agreement of over £17,300  which  was being  repaid at £259 per month. 
In March 2015 Mr L had taken a loan of £619  which he was repaying at £29 per 
month
118 118 Money had all this information and so it was aware that Mr Ls declared expenses  
were significantly  below  his actual commitments. 
118 118 Money also says it TAC  checked  Mr L to verify some of the information he had 
provided. But I note that even  on that - in terms of a red, amber, green  status  - there were a 
number of amber results. 
With all this information in its possession, 118 118 Money shouldve done  a much fuller  
review of Mr Ls financial circumstances  before approving a loan of this size for this length  of 
time and for this cost.
A good opportunity to undertake a more  thorough  interrogation of Mr Ls situation  wouldve 
been during the welcome call. But the questions were generally high level and not really  
specific. Ive listened  to some later calls when  Mr L was struggling to repay Loan 3. During  
one of those calls 118 118 Money asked  him specifically about his monthly expenditure for 
around 40 different  things  - as far apart as the hairdresser and dog-related  expenses  to how 
much he paid on payday loans and catalogues. I think  118 118 Money missed an 
opportunity, in its welcome  call before Loan 1, to clarify the concerns Ive identified.  
As I'm not persuaded 118 118 Money  did a sufficient  check  before approving  Loan  1 Ive 
thought about what a proportionate assessment wouldve shown about the sustainability of 
this credit for Mr L.
Ive had the benefit of seeing Mr Ls bank statements, so Ive used  them to help me 
understand his financial  situation  before he took Loan 1. I accept  that 118 118 Money didnt 
have sight of these,  but it was open to it to ask for them (after all it asked for the front page). 
Bank statements can provide a snapshot  of a borrowers broad financial situation and how 
they manage their money. Had 118 118 Money considered Mr Ls financial situation more 
thoroughly  as I think it should  it wouldve learnt that he was spending significant sums 
through on-line  gambling websites - very frequently. On some  days,  through these websites, 
he spent as much as £487,  on others  it was closer  to £250. I accept that there were 
occasional credits from these websites, but they fell well - short of the sums Mr L was 
spending.
Ref: DRN92539057Im satisfied that had 118 118 Money done proportionate checks  it wouldve realised that 
Mr L was spending  significant sums through a number of gambling websites. And, given  the 
sums involved, I think its clear that Mr L was unlikely to be able to repay Loan 1 in a 
sustainable way. As a responsible lender, had it done proportionate checks,  I think  
118 118 Money wouldve declined Mr Ls application. So I'm upholding Mr Ls complaint 
about Loan 1.
Less than eight months into Loan 1 Mr L applied for Loan 2. As Loan 1 was still outstanding 
he used some of the advance to clear Loan 1. The total amount of the loan was £3,994.17, 
of which  £2,994.17 went to repay Loan 1. So, Mr L received £1,000  into his bank account.  
The loan term was again 24 months  and the monthly repayments were increased to 
£312.07.  
This time Mr L declared an income of £1,950.  He said he spent £100 on housing, £50 on 
utilities, £50 on food,  £100 on card payments, zero on loans and £150 on insurance.  He said 
he was using the loan for car related expenses.
118 118 Money didnt carry out a welcome call on this occasion,  but it did a credit file check 
again. His active account balance was now over £25,500. I accept that part of this increase 
is likely  to be down to the fact that Loan  1 was still outstanding but what  is clear is that Mr Ls 
overall credit situation hadnt really improved. His current  account  overdraft  limit had been 
reduced to £1,450 but he was generally around  £1,300 overdrawn. On one of his credit  
cards the credit limit had been  increased  from £650 in March  2016 to £1,950. And the 
balance on that was now £1,462. Another  credit card had a limit of £1,000.  The current 
balance was £931 and although  before  February  2016 the balance had been around £500,  
since then it had increased in March and April to £931. And it seems Mr L hadnt repaid 
anything on that card since November 2015.  It also seems Mr L took another loan from a 
different provider for £619 a month before he took Loan 2. The overall picture   from this 
credit report  - is that Mr Ls financial circumstances were deteriorating.  
And given  this  as with Loan  1  I'm not persuaded that 118 118 Money did enough  to 
check that Mr L would be in a position  to repay this loan sustainably. I should  add that I 
accept that Mr L repaid  Loan 1 in line with his agreement. But I think  its important to note 
that just because someone  keeps up their repayments, it doesnt necessarily mean that they 
are doing  so from sustainable means.  So, Ive again  looked at his bank statements to help 
me understand his broader financial situation. Although it seems that the transactions to the 
gambling websites  had reduced  in April and May 2016 they were still relatively significant. 
And over this period, he was still spending several hundred  pounds  on these websites with 
no credits into his account from those gambling businesses.   
I think  like our adjudicator - that Loan 2 was in effect a top-up to Loan  1. 118 118 Money 
says this wasnt a top up but elsewhere told us that As the second and third agreement 
were additional  borrowing, the welcome  call is only completed on the first.   I accept that 
when Mr L  took Loan  2, Loan 1 was cleared  and a new credit agreement  signed. But 
practically speaking,  I dont think it matters whether technically this was a top up, a 
refinance or a simply  a new loan: Loan  1 was repaid,  Mr L received  some additional capital 
and his monthly repayments increased.  In these  circumstances - as Loan 1 shouldnt  have 
been given - it follows that Loan  2 shouldve been  declined too. But I should add that even if 
this was a wholly fresh loan, from the information 118 118 Money had available  and what  it 
wouldve learnt had it done proportionate checks, it shouldve realised that Loan 2 wasnt 
sustainable for Mr L. So it shouldve declined his application  and I uphold  Mr Ls complaint 
about it.
Ref: DRN92539058In February 2017  Mr L contacted 118 118 Money  to ask for a repayment holiday as hed 
recently changed address and was struggling to catch-up with his finances.  He explained 
that hed had to pay a deposit for his new home  and his previous deposit hadnt  yet been 
refunded. The 118 118 Money  advisor  told him that it could set up a temporary arrangement  
but that this would affect his credit  file. Mr L explained that he didnt  want  to do anything to 
jeopardise his credit score. He asked if the term of the loan could be extended. The advisor  
responded that this was not something  118 118 Money would do. The call ended  with Mr L 
indicating that he would  try something  else to get him out of his difficulties.
Six months  later Mr L returned for Loan 3. Again, he used a significant chunk of the loan to 
clear the outstanding balance on his previous loan. This meant  that £2,250 was paid into his 
account. From what Ive seen 118 118 Money  didnt  clarify with Mr L that hed recovered  
from the problems  hed told it about  just six months  before.  This was Mr Ls third advance  
from 118 118 Money. And he had now been  indebted to it for almost two years   with no 
breaks (and they were aware of his earlier struggles). He was borrowing higher and higher 
amounts and he wasnt making  any significant  inroad into the amount he owed 
118 118 Money. Overall  his indebtedness  was increasing. This pattern of lending was 
suggestive of someone dependent on ever higher amounts of credit to make ends meet.  And 
indeed, the credit report obtained by 118 118 Money  indicated that Mr L was in a worse 
situation than previously.
118 118 Money was aware that Mr L now had 41 active accounts with total credit balances  
of almost £30,000. There were also some  negative markers on his repayment history. 
In these circumstances I'm satisfied that a responsible lender shouldve realised that 
repayment of Loan  3 wasnt going to be sustainable  for Mr L. I think  he lost out because 
118 118 Money continued to provide him with expensive credit which was unfairly prolonging 
his indebtedness  and likely to have implications for him in accessing cheaper credit. 
In summary,  I'm upholding Mr Ls complaint and require 118 118 Money to put things right.  
putting things right
As Im satisfied that 118 118 Money wasnt responsible when it provided the three loans in 
question to Mr L, I require  it to do the following:
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on the three loans (taken  between  and 
including October 2015  and August 2017) 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse information  in Mr Ls credit  file as regards the three loans
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest.  118 118 Money  
must give Mr L a certificate showing how much  tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN92539059my final decision
For the reasons  given  above I'm upholding Mr Ls complaint and I require 
Madison CF UK Limited to put things right in the way I've outlined.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 December  2019.
