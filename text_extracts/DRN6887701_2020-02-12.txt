K821x#15complaint
Mr W is unhappy that NewDay  Ltd has refused to provide him with a refund through Section 
75 or via the chargeback scheme. He also complains that NewDay  has negatively impacted 
his credit file.
background
In June 2018 Mr W purchased a car engine for £3400 using a credit  card supplied by 
NewDay. The supplier agreed to source and fit the engine.
Mr W subsequently contacted NewDay to raise a dispute against the supplier. He said that 
the engine hadnt been fitted correctly and that the engine  warning  light was on. Mr W said 
he was awaiting an independent report. When he received the report  Mr W contacted 
NewDay again. He said the report diagnosed an engine oil leak, battery  issues and an 
engine misfire which would cost £2800 to repair. NewDay logged a chargeback  claim.  
Mr Ws account was credited with the funds in dispute and a dispute was raised with the 
merchant.
The merchant defended the claim. Mr W was told by NewDay  that it would send on the 
merchants response  and any evidence in support. Its not clear whether  the merchants 
repose was sent to Mr W, however, on 17 October  2018 Mr W noticed that £3400 had been  
debited to his account. He contacted NewDay and was advised that hed been found  liable 
for the chargeback claim because the transaction was made face to face and hed had the 
opportunity to check the goods before payment.
Mr W was unhappy about this. He raised a Section 75 claim. NewDay rejected the claim on 
the basis that the invoice  for the goods wasnt in his name, so the debtor-creditor-supplier 
(DCS) link was broken. Mr W wasnt happy  with the way NewDay had dealt with either  the 
Section 75 or the chargeback claim so he complained to this service.
Our investigator felt that in relation to the Section 75 claim, the contracting party was Mr Ws 
brother, so the DCS link was broken.  He didnt think NewDay had acted unfairly in declining  
the section 75 claim.  In relation to the chargeback claim, the investigator  had some 
concerns. He said the merchants defence wasnt  applicable  to the circumstances of the 
transaction and he felt there were  grounds  on which NewDay couldve re-presented the 
chargeback and that it might have succeeded. The investigator felt that New Day shouldve 
done more to support Mr W in the chargeback claim and said it should  refund the price  of the 
goods.
The investigator also felt that NewDay had unnecessarily recorded  information relating to the 
chargeback claim on Mr Ws credit  file. He said NewDay should  amend Mr Ws credit file to 
show that the account was up to date and pay compensation.
NewDay accepted  the investigators view and has since refunded the purchase price of the 
goods and paid compensation of £150.  However,  it hasnt updated Mr Ws credit  report.  
Mr W says that the entries on his credit file are negatively impacting his credit score and 
therefore his ability to obtain credit. NewDay has said that the entries arent negative.  
Because Mr Ws credit file hasnt been  updated  Ive been asked to make  a final decision.

Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Because the original subject matter of this complaint has been resolved and payment made 
to Mr W, Im only focussing on the issues relating to Mr Ws credit file.
Ive looked at the copies  of Mr Ws credit file which hes provided at different intervals  during 
the investigation of this complaint. I can see that on the credit  report  dated January  2019,  
NewDay has registered an outstanding query. A query is usually  registered  by a lender  when  
a consumer challenges the information registered  against him or her. But in this case, Mr W 
has never challenged anything registered by NewDay  on his credit file. Instead,  he disputed 
the decision made by NewDay  about  his Section 75 and chargeback claims.
NewDay has said that the entry it registered when Mr W disputed the chargeback decision 
isnt adverse. However, Im persuaded, having reviewed Mr Ws credit  reports,  that his credit  
score was impacted  by this entry. I dont think NewDay should have registered the query in 
any event. The purposes of a query marker is to ensure that missed or late payments arent 
recorded whilst a dispute is ongoing. This doesnt  apply to Mr Ws circumstances.
I can see that NewDay eventually removed the query marker in response to the 
investigators view. But its apparent  from looking  at the credit file that in the course of doing  
so, NewDay has removed  the history of payments  and balances. This means that the correct  
information isnt being recorded, which is continuing  to affect Mr Ws credit score. NewDay 
should take steps to correct this.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint.  NewDay Ltd must:
Amend Mr Ws credit file to ensure  that the account is recorded as up to date 
Amend Mr Ws credit file by re-instating  the history  of payments and balances
Pay further compensation  of £250
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 March  2020.
