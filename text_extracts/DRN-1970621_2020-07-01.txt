The complaint
Miss K was contacted by a seller inviting her to make an offer for some items. She bought 
the items for £200 but then, on receipt, realised the items were defective. She contacted 
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) to make a claim but they didnt offer what Miss K 
wanted. She wants PayPal to reopen and review her claim and demand the seller pays for 
the return costs of the items, to refund the collection costs and the £200 she has paid.    
What happened
On 10 April 2019, Miss K was contacted by a seller inviting her to make an offer for items. 
Miss K agreed to buy 1798 of these items at a cost of £200, she paid for these through 
PayPal on 11 April. 
The seller explained to Miss K that she would need to arrange for collection, she did this at a 
cost of £112.42. When Miss K received the items she found them to be defective and not in 
line with the description given by the seller. She contacted the seller and tried to arrange for 
a refund but when this didnt work, she opened a claim with PayPal and asked for a refund of 
the £200 and also the £112.42 paid for collection. She also wanted the seller to arrange to 
collect the items.  
PayPal looked into Miss Ks claim and originally denied her claim on the basis she hadnt 
provided evidence of the items being returned to the seller. Following further discussions, 
PayPal offered to refund the £200 and also offered to meet half the shipping costs at £56.21. 
PayPal didnt agree to arrange for the seller to pay the return costs. Miss K rejected this 
offer. 
Our investigator didnt feel PayPal had acted unfairly. They felt the offer to refund the cost of 
the items was fair and the offer to meet half of the shipping cost went above and beyond 
what would be expected of PayPal. 
Miss K disagreed and so the matter has been passed to me to decide.     
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same outcome as our investigator and for largely the same 
reasons. I know this will be disappointing for Miss K but I will explain my reasons. 
In instances where the item received isnt what was ordered, PayPal can reimburse the 
buyer through their Buyer Protection policy (policy). This protection however doesnt cover 
every eventuality. And so, Ive considered whether PayPal has applied their policy fairly 
when declining part of Miss Ks claim. 
Section eight of the policy, What is Significantly Not as Described (SNAD)?, says: 
a.Your purchase is Significantly Not as Described if it is materially different from the   
last description of it that you received from the payment recipient before you paid for 
it
Miss K says that the items she received did not meet the description given by the seller. 
PayPal accept that Miss Ks purchase does fall within their policy and offered a refund of the 
cost of the items. I have seen that PayPal did, in line with their policy, set out the steps Miss 
K needed to take to claim a refund. 
I have seen the email exchanges between Miss K and the seller and, given how promptly 
Miss K complained to the seller together with the problems she describes, I agree her 
purchase was significantly not as described. Section six of the policy, Cooperating with 
PayPal to resolve the problem, says: 
Whether you are the buyer or the payment recipient, for the purpose of resolving the 
problem, PayPal may request and require you to (and you shall in a timely manner): (i) 
provide documentary evidence (at your own expense, unless PayPal agrees otherwise) to 
support your position (including, without limitation, proof of delivery, receipts, third party 
evaluations and police reports); and (ii) take any other action that PayPal specifies. If you 
refuse to comply with PayPals requests, PayPal may make a final decision in favour of the 
other party. 
As a non-exhaustive guide, PayPal may request and require: 
a. the buyer to post back to the payment recipient, to PayPal or to a third party (as 
PayPal may direct) an item that the buyer claims is SNAD and to provide Proof of 
Delivery. 
Ive carefully considered the above and, while Im understanding as to the reason why Miss 
K feels she shouldnt be responsible for the cost of returning the items, the policy clearly 
says in circumstances of an item(s) being significantly not as described that PayPal may 
require the buyer to return such item(s) and provide proof of delivery. 
I believe PayPal acted in line with their policy by requesting Miss K return the item to the 
seller to receive a full refund. I have however thought about whether it was fair for them to do 
this as Miss K feels the items were defective so she says PayPal should have directed the 
seller to pay for this.  
PayPal say their policy only covers the amount of the item and does not include the cost of 
return postage. I have seen the policy and this supports PayPals comment. And this could 
bring instances of the seller disagreeing with the claim and thereby finding themselves in a 
position where they are required to pay for the return of items which they feel arent 
defective. So, given PayPal must act fairly to both the buyer and the seller when considering 
disputes over purchased items, I think its understandable that they have processes in place 
to avoid disputes arising from the seller in situations like this. 
I therefore dont consider it unreasonable for PayPal to request items that are significantly 
not as described to be returned to the seller to receive a refund and for the buyer to be 
responsible for the return costs. 
I acknowledge that Miss K has been left in a difficult situation now, she has items she 
doesnt want and will now be faced with a cost to either return the items to the seller or 
arrange for them to be disposed. I understand this isnt a position any buyer would want to 
be in but PayPal have shown they have acted in line with their policy by asking Miss K to 
return the items at her own cost. I feel PayPal have acted fairly in not agreeing to arrange for 
the seller to pay for the return costs.      
I have seen that Paypal didnt agree to meet the full collection costs of the items. They say 
this doesnt fall within the terms of the Buyer Protection policy. They also say that this 
transaction was separate to the purchase of the items as Miss K arranged, and paid for, 
collection of the items through a separate company. 
Miss K was told by the seller to arrange collection herself. I have seen an invoice which 
shows Miss K paid £112.42 to a collection company for the items to be collected. Section 
three of the policy, What happens when PayPal makes a final decision in favour of the 
buyer, says:
If Paypal makes a final decision on your problemin your favour, PayPal may (but 
shall not be obliged to) reimburse you for the amount of the payment made through 
PayPal for the purchase (up to the full price of the purchase and (where applicable) 
original postage costs).      
The policy doesnt go into any more detail about the circumstances where postage costs 
would be reimbursed. Our investigator asked PayPal for their comments on this and they 
explained that it applies to cases where the postage costs are included in the original 
transaction. The example PayPal has given is, if a buyer makes a purchase for £100 which 
is made up of £90 for the item and £10 shipping fees, then they would reimburse the full 
£100 if the claim was found in the buyers favour.
Section four of the policy, Conditions for reimbursement says that the problem must be 
related to either the purchase not being received or the purchase is significantly not as 
described. I am of the view that Miss Ks claim for the collection costs do not meet either of 
these conditions. While I accept the collection was arranged as a direct result of the 
purchase, it was still a separate transaction and must be considered on its own. The 
collection was carried out by the collection company and Miss K received the service she 
had paid for. It is my view that it was fair and reasonable for PayPal to refuse to reimburse 
the full cost of the collection. In any event, I have seen that PayPal agreed to reimburse half 
of these costs.   
I have taken account of Miss Ks comments and will address those points which I feel are 
relevant to my decision. Thats not to say that I havent considered all of her comments, as I 
know the points raised by her are important to her. Miss K feels that PayPal should have 
done more to prevent the position she found herself in. In particular, she says that PayPal 
shouldve fully investigated the items and shouldve known the items being sold werent of 
suitable quality.
In this case, PayPals involvement was limited to one of a payment platform, one where a 
buyer pays and a seller receives funds. It is reasonable to say that many transactions take 
place every day using PayPal so they cant be expected to know, or carry out checks on, all 
items and products being bought and sold using their payment service. I have not seen any 
information which shows that PayPal had any reason to doubt the authenticity of the items 
bought by Miss K or that any action should have been taken by them to stop the transfer of 
funds to the seller. 
I understand Miss K is upset at the thought the seller has walked away with £200 for items 
which she says they knew were defective. My role is to look at the actions of PayPal and, 
while the seller has received £200, this doesnt mean that PayPal havent applied their policy 
fairly or reasonably when dealing with Miss Ks claim.  
I realise this isnt the outcome Miss K was hoping for and that she feels PayPal should 
protect buyers in instances like this by taking action to prevent fraudulent sales. But as Ive explained, PayPals Buyer Protection policy doesnt cover every eventuality and, in this case, 
I dont think theyve acted unfairly.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should refund the £200 paid for the 
items and to refund half of the collection costs, as it has already offered to do. I wont be 
asking PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to take any further steps. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 July 2020.
