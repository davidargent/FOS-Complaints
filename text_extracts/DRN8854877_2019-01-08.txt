Mr B complains PDL Finance Limited (trading  at the time of sale as Mr Lender) lent him 
money he couldnt afford to repay.

Mr B deferred payment  on loans 2,4,7,9 and 10 by paying additional interest.  Mr B entered 
into a repayment  plan to repay the balance on his last loan.
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Bs complaint be upheld. She said Mr Lender should  
have carried out further checks on all loans after loan 3 and if it had, it would  have seen that 
Mr B wouldnt have  been able to afford the repayments on any of those loans. So she upheld      
Mr Bs complaint.
Mr Lender did not agree  with the adjudicators view. It said that it did not have to carry out 
the sort of checks the adjudicator suggested and for the amounts of loans 4, 5, 7 and 8 and 
the duration of those  loans there  was no need for such  enhanced checks. It offered to refund 
the interest on loans  6, 9 and 10. Mr B did not accept this offer.
As both parties are still not in agreement,  the complaint has come  to me to make  a decision.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loan was offered.
I think the overarching  questions I need  to consider  in deciding  whats  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint are:
Did Mr Lender, at the time it lent, complete  reasonable and proportionate checks  to 
satisfy itself that Mr B would be able to repay in a sustainable  way?
oIf not, would  those checks have shown that Mr B would have been 
able to do so.
Ref: DRN88548772Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Bs indebtedness in a way that was otherwise 
unsustainable or harmful?
Did Mr Lender act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
If I determine that Mr Lender did not act fairly and reasonably in its dealings  with Mr B and 
that he has lost out as a result, I will go on to consider  what  is fair compensation.
Mr Lender was required to lend responsibly. It needed  to make checks to see whether Mr B 
could afford  to pay back the loans before it lent to him. Those  checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr B was borrowing and the length of the 
agreement. But there was no set list of checks Mr Lender had to do.
Mr Lender says it asked about  Mr Bs income and carried  out a credit  check on each 
occasion. It says the checks it carried out were proportionate.
For loans 1 to 3 inclusive I agree with the adjudicator that the checks carried out by Mr 
Lender were enough. I say this because the amounts Mr B needed to repay compared to his 
declared monthly income were relatively  modest.  The credit check didnt reveal  anything  that 
would suggest  further checks were needed  and Mr B repaid his first three loans on time and 
without apparent difficulty.
At the point of loan 4 I think Mr Lender should have been doing more  to find out why Mr B 
needed to borrow  so often and to check he wasnt reliant on this sort of credit.  This was his 
fourth loan without a significant break  in the borrowing. I think Mr Lender should  have  seen 
this and sought further information about Mr Bs monthly expenditure and regular financial 
commitments. If it had done  this, it would have seen  that Mr B had no disposable  income at 
the time of this loan to be able to meet the repayments. So I dont think Mr Lender should 
have agreed to lend Mr B loan 4. 
By the time Mr B applied  for loan 5, I think  Mr Lender should have been  asking  for further  
information about his expenditure, financial commitments and also any other short  term 
lending he may have had at this time.  This was a significant increase in the amount 
borrowed and I think that by this stage it wasnt safe to rely on what  Mr B was saying about 
his finances. So in addition to asking  about  Mr Bs income and outgoings I think  Mr Lender 
should have been looking to carry out a complete review of Mr Bs finances from loan 5 
onwards. One way it could have done this would be to look at his bank statements. If it had 
done this, it would have seen he had a high amount of financial commitments. When  these  
additional amounts are considered alongside  Mr Bs normal living  costs,  he had no 
disposable income for loans 5 to 10 and didnt have enough to afford  the loan repayments. It 
follows that Mr Bs loans from loan 5-10 werent  sustainable. 
Taking everything into account  I dont think Mr Lender has shown its checks  for loans 4-10 
were sufficient or proportionate  given Mr Bs borrowing  history  or, the amounts borrowed. I 
consider proportionate  checks would  have shown Mr Lender that Mr B couldnt afford to 
repay loans  4-10. On balance I dont think these loans shouldve  been granted. It should  put 
right what  it did wrong.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. PDL Finance Limited should:
Ref: DRN88548773Refund all interest  and charges that Mr B paid on loans 4-10;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loans 4-10 from Mr Bs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires PDL Finance Limited to take off tax from this interest. 
PDL Finance  Limited must  give Mr B a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he 
asks for one. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 February  2019.
