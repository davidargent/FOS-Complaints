K820x#14complaint
Miss M complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc prematurely curtailed her borrowing  
facility and forced her to sell her house  for less than it was worth.
To resolve  her complaint  she wants RBS to come back with a more realistic offer than the 
one it has made.
background
This complaint is brought by Miss M, the estate of her partner Mr H who died in January 
2017, and their son Mr H2. All are represented  by Miss M.
In May 2005  Miss M and Mr H took out a 14-year  capital  repayment mortgage with RBS 
pursuant to an offer dated  31 March 2005.  The offer involved opening a particular  account  
called the One account which was a special type of mortgage account also used  as a 
current account. It allowed the borrower  to pay in and draw  out as much as they wanted  at 
any time, up to an agreed facility limit. This facility was initially  £125,664 and the amount 
actually borrowed at that time was £123,664. 
There were terms  and conditions which included at condition 6f:
Where your Offer  specifies  that you are making full or partial  capital payments, we will apply 
an annual reduction  in the amount of your Facility so as to keep you on track in order to 
reduce the Facility to zero or to the amount agreed  with you by the end of the Term. If at any 
time the annual reduction in the Facility results  in your borrowing on the Account being  in 
excess of the Facility as reduced,  we may specify increased Monthly Payments, after 
discussing this with you, and may impose  special  conditions.
There was also a repayment guide  which included:
Your One account  borrowing should  be repaid  by your planned repayment date of March  
2019.
This is how your balance should  decrease over the next 14 years.
After year 1 your balance  should be £119,732.26
After year 5 your balance  should be £92,149.38
After year 10 your balance should be £47,055.48.
However those balance figures  were based  on the original facility  of £125,664. In fact the 
facility could be (and was) increased from time to time as follows:
date increase new facility
30 September 2005 4,336 £130,000
24 July 2006 5,000 £135,000
7 March 2008 1,500 £136,500
In July 2007 it was changed from a reducing facility to a level facility.  This was explained as 
follows in RBSs letter to Miss M and Mr H dated  15 July 2007:
Ref: DRN94100302Were pleased to let you know that weve altered your One account as you requested.  Your 
facility has been  changed from reducing to level.
Here are the details:-
Your facility £130,000.00
.Unless you ask us to alter it, your facility  will remain  at this level until your One account  is 
repaid. To help you repay your borrowings  on time and stay within  your new borrowing limit, 
weve enclosed your new repayment guide.
The new repayment  guide said:
Your One account  borrowing should  be repaid  by your planned repayment date of April 
2019.
If you borrow up to your facility immediately, this is how your balance should decrease  over 
the next 12 years:
After 01/08/2008 your balance should be £127,294.02
After 01/08/2012 your balance should be £90,529.30
After 01/08/2017 your balance should be £27,643.01
On 20 May 2014 RBS wrote to Miss M and Mr H:
Were pleased to let you know that weve altered your One account as you requested.  Your 
facility has been  changed from level to reducing.
Here are the details:-
Your facility £136,499.00
Your facility will reduce  to £111,000.00  on 01/06/2015. We expect your facility to reduce 
each year on 01 June,  or on the next banking  day. If this is likely to change, well let you 
know.
To help you repay your borrowings on time and stay within  your borrowing  limit, weve 
enclosed your new repayment guide.
The statement  dated 18 June 2014  showed borrowing of £136,902.72 against a facility of 
£136,499.
In May 2015  Miss M and Mr H sold the house  and repaid  the borrowing in full, and the 
account was closed.
In December 2018 Miss M made  a complaint  to RBS. RBS responded on 10 January 2019:
You have explained  that you are unhappy  that the facility reduced  on your One Account and 
this led to you having to sell your property.The One Account that you held was on a level 
term basis. This meant that the facility  would stay the same  until the end of your term and 
then be repaid in full. We made a decision to convert your One Account  to a reducing facility  
in 2014 in order to help you repay the One Account. We wrote to you to advise that as of 
01 June 2015  your facility would  reduce from £136,499 to £111,000. The facility would 
Ref: DRN94100303reduce by a similar  amount each year until the end of your term to ensure that it was fully 
repaid at the end of term.
Please be assured that the bank made this decision considering your best interests. This 
policy was designed  to help customers such as yourself who had no formal repayment  plan 
to ensure that your mortgage would  be fully paid off at the end of your term. I understand 
that when you received  this notification from us you believed you had no choice but to sell 
the property as soon as possible  in order to meet the facility reduction.  You did not seek  the 
advice of our Debt Management department. I am sorry for the pressure  that you felt we 
placed you under in selling the property. Please be assured  that this was never our 
intention.
Taking all of the above into consideration I agree  with your complaint.  The service you 
received from the bank  was not what you should expect and are entitled to.I  am genuinely 
sorry for the trouble and upset you have  faced. In recognition of this and the fact that you felt 
compelled to sell the property there are certain costs I will cover. I have reimbursed you the 
following:
- Estate Agents Fees. These are calculated as 1.3% of the sale price. You sold your 
property for £190,000  1.3%  of this is £2470.
- Solicitors fees - £1350.
- Removal Costs - £450
I have also reimbursed  you with a compensatory 8% interest of this amount in respect of 
the time you were without  these funds.
In addition to the above  costs I have also awarded you £1000 compensation. As previously 
stated it was never the banks intention to make  you feel like you had to sell the property. I 
am so sorry that this took place and for the loss and upheaval you encountered in your 
personal life because of this.
Miss M wasnt  happy with this and brought the complaint to our service. She said RBS had 
required the facility  to be reduced  by £25,000  by June 2015. There was no way they could 
have found this money. The mortgage was on a level term basis  meaning  they had to repay  
the facility by June 2019.  Shed spoken to RBS and it said that if they didnt  reduce  their 
borrowing then it would  be looking at repossession. 
She said their plan had been to put the house  on the market in December 2018 which  would 
have left them with enough money  to buy another house. She now lived in a council house 
having sold their house  for less than the market value as they were desperate to avoid 
repossession. She said RBS had admitted it was in the wrong  but the compensation it had 
offered was nowhere near enough for its actions.
Our investigator thought RBS was within its rights  to reduce the facility and that Miss M 
should reasonably have  been aware the facility would decrease in the future. Shed regularly 
exceeded the facility and was in arrears before the reduction. The account remained 
regularly in arrears  which  hadnt been  cleared  by 21 May 2013 and RBS cancelled  the 
banking facilities on the account. The account  was regularly  in arrears after this.
Ref: DRN94100304The investigator couldnt say RBS had acted unreasonably. Miss M was struggling with her 
payments and the account balance was regularly in excess of the agreed facility. As RBS 
had concerns about Miss Ms ability to maintain  her payments, it chose to reduce  her 
borrowing - which it was entitled to do.
Miss M didnt agree. She said she would  like the case to be looked  at again. RBS had said 
that it accepted  it didnt  handle the case well, hence  the cheque for £6500.  She didnt feel 
this was enough for the trauma and loss that she and Mr H2 had suffered.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my view condition 6f of the terms and conditions, which provided for an annual reduction  
in the facility, was removed  by RBSs letter of 15 July 2007  which  I have quoted above. This 
letter said the facility  would remain at the existing level until repayment. This wasnt  made  
conditional upon Miss Ms keeping within the facility. Therefore it wasnt open  to RBS, by 
means of condition 6f, to unilaterally revert to a reducing level as it purported to do by its 
letter of 20 May 2014.
However, the terms and conditions  also provided  at condition 14:
We may write to you  (i) to forbid  any further withdrawals from the Account; (ii) to reduce 
your facility; and/or (iii) to require immediate repayment of all or part of the borrowing on your 
Accountif.without our prior agreement, you exceed the Facility.
Miss Ms balance stayed within the facility until the December 2008 statement which showed 
a balance of -£136,779.54  against a facility  of £136,500. After that the following statements 
also showed balances  in excess of the facility:
statement date facility balance
17 December 2010 136,500 136,929.15
17 June 2011 136,500 138,186.57
16 December 2011 136,500 137,094.63
18 June 2012 136,500 136,963.77
18 June 2013 136,500 137,937.52
18 December 2013 136,500 136,876.02
18 June 2014 136,499 136,902.72
18 December 2014 136,499 137,833.78
17 April 2015 136,499 139,655.33
Therefore although  RBS didnt expressly rely on condition 14 in its letter  of 20 May 2014,  it 
was in fact entitled to reduce the facility.
Miss M says she was paying only the interest, as she was entitled  to do, and intended  to 
repay the loan by selling  the house  at the end of the term.  She complains that she had to sell 
the house earlier than expected and below the value she would have wanted. But in order to 
retain the right not to repay capital until the end of the term, Miss M had to stay within  the 
facility, which she didnt.
Ref: DRN94100305Miss M says in an email  to our service that the repayments were never behind and that the 
mortgage was the first thing to be met for payment. But that isnt correct, as the statements  
show. Theres also relevant correspondence: on 25 June 2013 RBS wrote  to Miss M and 
Mr H:
We refer to our previous correspondence  and note that you have not provided funds to 
correct the excess on your account.
Furthermore, should you continue to maintain  the excess  on your account,  we will not be 
able to pay further items as they are presented. The cost of this to you will be £15 per item 
and will be applied to all items that we return unpaid. You should also be aware that this 
charge will also be applied to any guaranteed cheques and any debit or VISA card 
transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Your credit  rating will be adversely affected by maintaining the excess on your account.
We cannot offer any assistance in the absence of an open dialogue between us. We would 
urge you therefore to contact us within the next 7 days so that we can discuss a satisfactory 
solution to this issue. This will ensure that we can make  an appropriate decision regarding 
the way your account will be managed in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Miss M also says RBS told her that it would repossess  if the reduction were  not made. But 
Ive seen no evidence  of that. Repossession was discussed in a phone  conversation  on 
17 April 2014. RBSs  note of that call says:
Mrs said is worried about being repossessed, I confirmed  that it is a mortgage, and this is 
always a possibility if a customer  cannot afford to make payments, but stressed that she has 
13 months to get all the help and advice that she needs in order  to work a way forwards with 
her financial  position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
This falls far short of a threat to repossess. The note also records that RBS offered to 
transfer Miss M to its team which dealt  with consumers in financial difficulty, but she declined  
and said she wished  to get her own advice.  In fact, it appears  she proceeded to put the 
house on the market without further  discussion with RBS. This was a pity as its file notes of 
20 May 2014 indicate that a postponement  might have been possible if Miss M could afford  
the minimum monthly repayments  needed  to repay the mortgage  by the end of the term. It 
seems likely, however, that she couldnt have afforded  to do this.
I havent seen  any evidence to persuade me that Miss M had to (or did) sell the house for 
less than it was worth.
RBS maintains that it was entitled to reduce  the facility. Thats correct in my view.  But it still 
had an obligation  to treat Miss M fairly.  It says it was never  its intention  to pressurise Miss M 
into selling. But it does  accept that she felt compelled to sell and that this caused a severe  
impact on her personal life. In recognition of the fact that Miss M felt compelled to sell her 
house, RBS offered the following compensation:
Estate agents  fees: £2,470
Solicitors fees: £1,350
Removal costs: £450
8% interest on above: £1,284.04
Trouble and upset:  £1,000
Total Compensation: £6,554.04
Ref: DRN94100306 
The fees are average prices but Miss M hasnt sought to say the actual expenditure was 
higher. I think its debatable whether  RBS is liable to pay the selling costs, which would also 
have been incurred on a sale at the end of the term, but Im satisfied that the total payment 
of £6,554.04 is a fair and reasonable outcome of this complaint.
RBS sent a cheque for that amount to Miss M on 21 January 2019. If she didnt pay it in (I 
think she didnt) then it will have expired and RBS should issue a new cheque  for the same 
amount if Miss M accepts this decision.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint  because Im satisfied  that The Royal  Bank of 
Scotland Plc has offered  compensation of £6,554.04 which  is fair and reasonable. I leave it 
to Miss M, the estate of Mr H and Mr H2 to decide whether or not to accept this offer.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M, the estate 
of Mr H and Mr H2 to accept or reject  my decision before 21 August 2020.
