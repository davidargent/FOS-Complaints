The complaint
Miss A complains about problems with National Westminster Bank Plcs systems and delays
in amending her credit file.  
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. In my provisional decision I said: 
In February 2020 Miss A applied online for a new account with NatWest but there was a
systems problem. As a result, the application didnt go through and Miss A reapplied the
following day.
A short time later, Miss A says she noticed two credit searches from NatWest showing on
her credit file. Miss A complained to NatWest and it agreed to remove one of the searches
reported.
In July 2020 Miss A complained again because NatWests searches were still showing on
her credit file. Miss A has told us the issue caused problems as she was hoping to apply for
a mortgage.
NatWest issued two further responses to Miss As complaint. NatWest said it had taken the
necessary steps to amend Miss As credit file when she first complained and that it would
contact the credit reference agency again to remove the search. NatWest also paid Miss A
£100 to apologise for failing to clearly explain the processes involved.
Miss A referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They
asked NatWest for evidence of its request in May 2020 but none was supplied. But the
investigator said they thought £100 was a fair way to resolve the complaint so didnt ask
NatWest to do anything else. Miss A asked to appeal and repeated her concern that
NatWest hadnt shown it took action to remove the search in May 2020 as claimed.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When I was passed Miss As complaint I asked the case handler at NatWest to provide
evidence that a request was made for the relevant credit search to be removed from her
credit file. Like Miss A and the investigator, I felt this was key information required to answer
the complaint. I also asked the investigator to contact the relevant credit reference agency
and check when NatWest made its request.
NatWest responded with an email it says shows the credit file update was requested. But the
information provided is an internal email between staff at NatWest. It isnt a message to the
credit reference agency or evidence from NatWests systems that shows the amendment
was requested as claimed. NatWest hasnt supplied evidence that shows it asked the
relevant credit reference agency to make a change in May 2020.
We also got a response from the credit reference agency that says NatWests request was
made in July 2020. The credit reference agency didnt confirm NatWests claim it had asked
for the amendment in May 2020 as claimed.
Im satisfied NatWest has been given a fair opportunity to verify what its said about
amending Miss As credit file. Im also satisfied that the information Ive seen doesnt show
NatWest made amendments in line with its final responses.
I need to decide how to fairly resolve Miss As complaint. Miss A has told us the credit
search caused problems as she wanted to apply for a mortgage. I take Miss As point, but
theres nothing to show an application was declined because of the additional search noted
on her credit file. And its unclear whether Miss As chances of obtaining a mortgage
wouldve been unreasonably impacted by having two credit searches recorded instead of
one. I appreciate Miss A sought advice from a professional, but Im not persuaded that the
second search in itself led to a property being lost.
I agree that Miss A went through unnecessary trouble and upset when trying to get the
additional search removed and that £100 doesnt fairly reflect what happened. In my view,
NatWests delay in amending Miss As credit file meant she went through a reasonable level
of inconvenience to resolve the matter. In addition, the additional search on Miss As credit
file clearly caused her distress during the period in question. I think an increase from £100 to
£200 fairly reflects the impact of NatWests error on Miss A. As a result, I intend to uphold
this complaint and increase the level of compensation.  
In my provisional decision I invited both parties to provide any new comments or information 
they wanted me to consider. We didnt hear back from NatWest. Miss A responded to 
confirm she accepts. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As NatWest didnt respond and Miss A has told us she accepts the resolution I set out, I see 
no reason to change the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. I still think Miss 
As complaint should be upheld and that NatWest should pay her a total of £200 in 
recognition of the trouble and upset caused.   
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
Miss A £200 (less any compensation already paid) to reflect the distress and inconvenience 
caused. 
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 July 2021.
