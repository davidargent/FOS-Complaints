The complaint
Ms J complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have unfairly registered a default with 
the Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs).
What happened
Ms J says her PayPal credit account was linked to her parents address, but she was 
unaware that PayPal had sent letters to this address informing her that she owed them 
money. She says she could not access her PayPal account and she didnt have a phone as 
this was being repaired by a third party company, so she was unaware PayPal credit had 
been trying to contact her and they registered a default when she didnt pay them the funds 
owed. Ms J says she had the funds to make the payment in her bank account, but she 
wasnt aware that any payments were outstanding. Ms J made a complaint to PayPal.
PayPal did not uphold Ms Js complaint. They said she had missed payments to her PayPal 
credit account for the months of May, June, July, and August 2022. As a result, her account 
went into default in September 2022. Ms J brought her complaint to our service.
Our investigator did not uphold Ms Js complaint. He said multiple emails were issued by 
PayPal to Ms J from 10 May to 6 September 2022 notifying her that her payment was
overdue and hadnt been received. He said although Ms J says she didnt have access to 
her emails, this wasnt PayPals fault and they confirmed they hadnt received emails 
returned undelivered. He said Ms J scheduled a repayment on 27 June 2022 using her bank 
card but when PayPal attempted to debit the payment, it was rejected by her bank, and 
PayPal emailed Ms J notifying her that the payment had been unsuccessful on the same 
day.
Our investigator said PayPal issued a default notice by post to the address they held for Ms 
J but as they didnt receive the arrears by the deadline given then they registered the default. 
Our investigator said Ms J made a payment of Â£1,000 to bring her account up to date on 10 
September 2022, but the default had already been registered, and no error had been made 
by PayPal. Ms J asked for an ombudsman to review her complaint. She said she was unsure 
what prevented the payment being made and she had enough funds in the account to make 
the payment.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at an example of the PayPal credit agreement online as this is what Ms J would 
have needed to have agreed to when she opened her account. The agreement states that 
We will send notices to the latest email or postal address we hold for you. You must tell us 
as soon as possible if you change your email or postal address or your name, and confirm 
any such change in writing if we ask you to do so. But it appears that Ms J didnt inform 
PayPal of her address change as this was registered at her parents address as opposed to 
the address she was living at. 
The PayPal credit example agreement shows If you cannot view your statement online, 
please contact our Customer Services team using the address or telephone number in 
Condition 12.3. If you are unable to access your statement, it is important that you contact us 
as you will still have to pay interest. Please also contact us if you think any amount shown on 
your statement is incorrect. Ms J has documented that she was without her phone for 
months. But Ive seen no evidence that she notified PayPal about this and couldnt see her 
statements online. If she had done this, then PayPal would have been able to change her 
address on the system and she would have been able to request paper statements.
As PayPal were unaware that Ms J was living at a different address and didnt have access 
to her email address, they notified her via these methods in line with the agreement. This is 
what I would expect them to do. PayPal appear to have kept Ms J up to date with the 
account status and the arrears on the account. Although she tried to make a payment to the 
account in June 2022, this was not successful, and PayPal informed her about this the 
following day. 
A default can only be registered when a customer has been in arrears for at least three
months. Ms J appears to have missed her payments due on her PayPal credit account 
between May-August 2022. So they sent a default notice to the registered address on the 
account giving her until 23 August 2022 to clear the arrears. But when this didnt happen, 
PayPal registered the default. Although Ms J made a payment on 10 September 2022, this 
was after the deadline given. PayPal have a responsibility to accurately report the account 
status to the CRAs. As the account defaulted when Ms J didnt clear the arrears by 23 
August 2022, then PayPal made no error in reporting the account status as defaulted. And 
as a result of this, Im unable to ask them to remove the default.
Im sorry to hear about the effect the default is having on Ms J. She may wish to consider 
registering a notice of correction with the CRAs to explain what happened here. This is a 
short explanatory note that she can add to an entry on her credit file, to explain the 
background to that entry. So anyone who searches her credit report, would see the notice of 
correction and take the notice into account if they viewed her credit file. Prospective lenders 
will each consider a notice like this differently and it isn't a guarantee that they will put the 
underlying payment information to one side. But given how strongly Ms J feels here - it is an 
option that is open to her. She would need to contact the CRAs to do this. But as PayPal are 
obliged to report the default to the CRAs, it follows I dont require PayPal to do anything 
further.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms J to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 August 2023.
