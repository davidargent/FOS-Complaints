K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA wont compensate him enough for a 
purchase he didnt  receive.
background
Mr S says he ordered merchandise and paid for it through his PayPal account. But it wasnt 
delivered to him. PayPal  said the merchant provided proof it was. So he says the delivery 
driver must  have forged his signature. This has caused him a lot of stress  particularly  in light 
of his own personal problems.
PayPal said itd verified the tracking information provided by the merchant  and so it didnt 
uphold his claim. But it went on to say in the light of his long standing relationship with 
PayPal it was willing to offer him a full credit for the cost of the goods.
Our investigator could  see the merchant sent PayPal a valid tracking history which showed 
the goods had been delivered to the correct address and signed for. So he thought it was 
reasonable for PayPal to think it was more  likely  than not the goods had been  delivered to 
Mr S. He noted section  13.6 of PayPals terms and conditions which  said if the Payment 
Recipient presents  such  evidence in a timely manner, PayPal may find in favour of the 
Payment Recipient even  if the buyer  claims to have not received the purchase. So he didnt 
think PayPal had done anything wrong.
 
Mr S said it wasnt right that PayPal didnt  accept his evidence that the signature wasnt  his. 
And he thought  itd been obstructive throughout this process.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry  to hear about  Mr Ss problems so I know he will be disappointed when I say that 
Ive come to the same  conclusion as our investigator  for very similar reasons.
Its not for me to decide the merits of Mr Ss claim for a refund. My role is to look at how 
PayPal has acted towards Mr Ss claim under the terms  of its user agreement. Part of that 
agreement covers the PayPal Buyer Protection. This gives  PayPal a wide discretion when 
making a decision  about problems with the purchase of goods or services.  And as our 
investigator said we cant  tell PayPal what discretionary decisions  it should  make on dispute 
claims. But it has to make  those decisions fairly and reasonably based on the evidence it 
has at the time. 
I can see how strongly Mr S feels about this. And I appreciate  he says he never took delivery 
of the merchandise. But thats not for me to decide.  I have to look at how PayPal dealt with 
his claim.  And I agree with our investigator  that it was reasonably entitled to rely on the 
delivery confirmation the merchant provided. So I cant fairly find it did anything  wrong.
In light of his history with PayPal, it decided to refund the cost of the goods  to Mr S even 
though it didnt uphold his claim. I think thats  fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. If 
he would  like to accept  its offer our investigator will help him to do so.
