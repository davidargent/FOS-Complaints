The complaint
Miss X complains about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA and their decision to decline the 
claim she made under their Buyer Protection Policy (BPP).
What happened
On 14 July 2020, Miss X made purchased items from an online retailer, who Ill refer to as 
N, for a total of $233.50 USD. Miss X says she didnt receive the items she paid for. So, 
she raised a dispute under PayPals BPP in December of the same year.
On 8 January 2021, PayPal declined Miss Xs dispute, as they felt theyd received evidence 
from N that showed the items had been delivered to Miss Xs address. Miss X was unhappy 
about this, so she raised a complaint.
Miss X didnt think PayPals decision to decline the claim was fair. She felt an e-mail she 
provided from the delivery service used by N showed the items had been lost. And so, she 
thought PayPal should accept her claim and refund her the amount she paid.
PayPal responded to the complaint and didnt agree. They thought they had declined Miss 
Xs claim fairly, in line with the terms of the BPP and the accounts user agreement. But they 
offered to refund Miss X the full amount she paid as a gesture of good will. Miss X remained 
unhappy with this response, so she referred her complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They recognised Miss X had 
provided an e-mail where the delivery service confirmed the delivery driver couldnt 
remember where the parcel had been delivered. But they didnt think this e-mail meant 
PayPal had acted unfairly when declining the claim. They thought PayPal were fair to rely on 
the evidence provided by N, which showed the delivery services website listing the items as 
delivered and signed for at Miss Xs address. So, our investigator didnt think PayPal needed 
to do anything more.
Miss X didnt agree. She maintained her view that the email she provided was evidence she 
hadnt received the items. And she thought our service, and PayPal, should call the delivery 
service who would support her claims that the items had been lost and not delivered to her. 
Our investigator considered Miss Xs comments, but their view remained the same. Miss X 
remained unhappy, so the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Miss X. I understand Miss X 
disputes receiving the items she paid for. And I appreciate how upsetting this would be, as in 
this situation Miss X is left without the items and her money. So, I understand why Miss X 
would turn to PayPal, who she used to process the transaction to N, and look to reclaim the 
money she spent through the BPP they offer. And when this claim was declined by PayPal, I 
can appreciate the upset this would cause.
But for me to say PayPal have done something wrong, and so should refund Miss Xs money 
through an accepted claim, Id need to be satisfied PayPal failed to act within of the terms of 
the BPP when declining the claim originally. Or, if I think they did act within these terms, that 
it was unfair of PayPal to do so. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
I think its important for me to make clear from the outset that any customer making a 
purchase through PayPal doesnt have an automatic right for any payment they make to be 
refunded through PayPals BPP if things go wrong. For any claim to be upheld by PayPal, 
and any refund to be processed, a customers claim must first qualify under the terms of the 
BPP.
So, Ive focused on the terms of the BPP and PayPals user agreement that it sits within. The 
terms explain that, for claims made by customers regarding items that havent been 
received, your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPals BPP if the seller has 
provided proof of delivery. 
In this situation, N provided PayPal with a tracking number for the delivery service they used. 
And I can see on the delivery service website, this tracking number lists the items Miss X 
ordered as delivered and signed for, to the shipping address Miss X provided.  So, I think N 
provided PayPal with reasonable proof of delivery. And because of this, I think PayPal acted 
within the terms of the BPP when declining the claim, as it failed to qualify under the term 
Ive quoted above.
But as Ive explained, as well as considering whether PayPal acted in line with the terms of 
the BPP, I must also be satisfied they acted fairly when doing so.
I understand Miss X believes the delivery service have admitted losing the items. And Ive 
carefully considered the e-mail Miss X had provided from the delivery service, dated 30 
December 2020. This e-mail sent to Miss X explains the delivery driver didnt remember the 
delivery. And so, the delivery service say they were unable to prove where the package was 
delivered. Because of this, they refunded the tax element of the delivery to Miss X. So, Ive 
thought about whether PayPal were unfair to decline the claim, when they had this e-mail to 
consider. And I dont think they were.
I think the e-mail shows the delivery service admitting they were unable to confirm where the 
package was delivered. Not that it wasnt delivered at all. And within the e-mail, this 
admittance is due to the delivery driver being unable to remember that specific delivery itself. 
But I think its important to note that almost five months had passed by this point and so, I 
dont think it would be reasonable to expect a delivery driver to remember a specific single 
delivery from so long ago. Because of this, I dont think this e-mail states categorically that 
the items hadnt been delivered or that they had been lost.
I appreciate Miss X thinks this e-mail could be validated by calling the delivery service and 
confirming the items had been lost. But this isnt something I would expect PayPal, or our 
service to do. And I dont think its likely this would add any validation to the e-mail PayPal 
have already seen, as I think its most likely the information provided would remain the same 
in that the delivery service were unable to confirm where the items were delivered due to the 
amount of time that has passed.So, when I consider this e-mail against the fact the tracking number N provided from the 
delivery service shows the items as delivered and signed for to Miss Xs address, I dont 
think Im able to say PayPal acted unfairly when deciding to decline the claim. And because 
of this, I dont think they need to do anything more.
I understand this isnt the outcome Miss X was hoping. And I want to make it clear this 
decision isnt intended to reflect whether or not I think the items were or were not delivered 
as I have no way of knowing for certain whether they were. This decision is focused solely 
on the actions of PayPal, and whether I think they acted fairly based on the information they 
had available to them. And I think they have on this occasion.
I note PayPal initially offered to refund Miss X the amount she paid N as a gesture of 
goodwill. It is up to Miss X to decide whether she now wishes to accept this offer.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Miss Xs complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl 
& Cie, SCA. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss X to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 July 2022.
