K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited trading as Sunny, was irresponsible  
when it approved a number  of loans for him in 2014 and 2015. He says that Sunnys failures  
led to his debt spiralling  out of control.
background
Sunny approved an open-ended  credit agreement for Mr G in April 2014. This allowed him to 
flexibly draw-down sums of capital up to an agreed  credit limit. After twenty draw-downs the 
open-ended credit facility  was closed, and Mr G took a series of six high-cost short-term 
instalment loans. Ive prepared  two tables which can be found in the annexes to this decision 
 these show some of the information  Sunny has provided to us about Mr Gs borrowing. 
The table at Annex  A provides an overview  of the credit agreements approved by Sunny. I 
refer to these as Loans 1 to 7. Annex B shows the draw-downs of capital made by Mr G on 
the open-ended credit facility which Ive called  Loan 1.
When Mr G first complained to Sunny, it didnt agree it had done anything wrong. Our 
adjudicator disagreed and recommended that his complaint be upheld  from the point  Mr G 
made his seventh  draw-down on the open-ended credit facility.  Recently Sunny has 
confirmed that it accepts that it wouldve  been  prudent to have discussed  Mr Gs financial 
situation with him in more detail at the point he took Loan 3. It doesnt  accept  that it did 
anything wrong  when providing  the open-ended credit facility or Loan  2. It made an offer to 
refund the interest and charges Mr G had paid on Loan 3 onwards (together with some 
additional interest). But Mr G didnt accept the offer.
As the complaint hasnt been resolved informally  it has come  to me  an ombudsman  for a 
final decision. If Mr G accepts my decision it will be binding on the parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  As Sunny accepts that it failed to do 
enough from the point it approved Loan  3 - and has made an offer - I dont need  to consider 
further whether  it acted  unfairly in relation to those loans. Although I will later address how 
Sunny should  put that right. So, in most of this decision Ill be looking at whether Sunny 
acted unfairly when it provided  the open-ended credit facility  and Loan 2.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny provided  the loans in question  while  it was authorised and regulated by the Financial 
Conduct Authority  (FCA).
The FCAs Principles for Business  set out the overarching requirements which all authorised  
firms are required to comply with. These  included  PRIN 2.1.1 R (6) which says: A firm must 
pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.
The Consumer Credit  sourcebook (CONC)  set out the rules  and guidance which  apply to 
credit providers like Sunny when providing  loans. CONC 5 sets out a firms obligations in 
relation to responsible lending.  
Ref: DRN87514272Section 5.2.1R of CONC set out what a lender needed to do before agreeing to give a 
borrower a loan saying:
(1) Before making a regulated credit agreement the firm must undertake
an assessment of the creditworthiness of the customer.
And at Section  5.2.1(2) a lender had to consider:
(a) the potential  for the commitments  under the regulated credit agreement  to 
adversely impact the customers  financial situation, taking into account  the 
information of which the firm is aware at the time the regulated credit agreement  is to 
be made; and
(b) the ability of the customer to make repayments as they fall due over the life of 
the regulated  credit  agreement, or for such an agreement which is an open-end 
agreement, to make repayments within a reasonable  period.
CONC 5.3 contained further  guidance on what a lender should bear in mind when thinking 
about affordability. CONC 5.3.1G(1) saying:
In making the creditworthiness assessment  or the assessment required by CONC 
5.2.2R (1), a firm should  take into account  more than assessing the customers ability 
to repay  the credit.
CONC 5.3.1G(2) then added:
The creditworthiness assessment and the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R (1) 
should include the firm taking reasonable steps  to assess the customers  ability to 
meet repayments under  a regulated credit  agreement  in a sustainable manner 
without the customer  incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant adverse  
consequences.
CONC 5.3.1G(6) clarified  what is meant  by sustainable:
 
For the purposes of CONC  sustainable means  the repayments under  the regulated 
credit agreement can be made by the customer:
(a) without undue  difficulties, in particular:
(i) the customer should be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; and
(ii) without having to borrow  to meet the repayments;
(b) over the life of the agreement, or for such an agreement which  is an open-end 
agreement, within  a reasonable period; and
(c)  out of income and savings without having to realise security or assets; and 
unsustainable has the opposite meaning.
Ref: DRN87514273To begin with Ive thought  about whether Sunny completed reasonable and proportionate 
checks to satisfy itself that Mr G would be able to repay his credit in a sustainable way. And 
if it did, was its decision  to lend,  fair? If it didnt, would proportionate checks  have shown that 
hed have been able to afford the repayments  when they fell due  in a sustainable way?
I think its important to remember  that any assessment done by Sunny  needed  to be 
borrower-focussed. It wasnt  an assessment of the risk to the Sunny that it wouldnt get back  
its money, but of the risk to Mr G of incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant 
adverse consequence as a result of Sunnys decision to lend.
As set out in CONC,  the risk to the borrower directly relates to the particulars of the lending  
and the circumstances of the borrower.  Therefore, a lenders assessment of creditworthiness  
would likely  need  to be flexible. That is to say, what is sufficient for one borrower might not 
be for another, or indeed  what might be sufficient for a borrower  in one situation  might not be 
so for the same borrower in other  circumstances.
Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment  of creditworthiness  to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect  a lender to require more  assurance, the greater the 
potential risk to the borrower of not being  able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. 
Certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr G. These  factors  include, but are 
not limited to:
the lower a borrowers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. CONC 6.7.21 stated A firm should not 
refinance high-cost  short-term credit where  to do so is unsustainable or otherwise  harmful.
[Note: paragraph 6.25 of ILG]
The ILG is the Office  of Fair Tradings (OFT) Irresponsible Lending Guidance.  And 
paragraph 6.25 of the ILG stated Repeatedly  refinancing (or 'rolling over') a borrower's 
existing credit commitment for a short-term credit product in a way that is unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful. 
The OFT considers that this would include a creditor allowing a borrower to sequentially 
enter into a number of separate  agreements  for short-term loan products, one after another,  
where the overall effect is to increase  the borrower's indebtedness in an unsustainable  
manner.
So, broadly  speaking Sunny was required to establish, through  proportionate checks, 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
Ref: DRN87514274affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. The loan payments being affordable on 
this basis might be an indication a borrower could  sustainably make their repayments. But it 
doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is because  as I've set out above  CONC 
defines sustainable as being  without undue difficulties and, in particular, the customer  should  
be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well 
as without having to borrow to meet the repayments.  
It follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make them without borrowing further.
I can see that when  Mr G was approved for Loan  1  the open-ended credit facility - Sunny 
obtained details  of his monthly income  which he said was £1,800. His first draw-down was 
for £175 and a hypothetical repayment schedule for that amount (with no further 
withdrawals) suggested it be repaid through five monthly amounts of £60.39. But from what  I 
can see it seems  that Mr Gs credit limit was £500  - so the five hypothetical monthly  
instalments wouldve likely been  closer £170, had he drawn-down  to that limit. Even so, I 
dont think I can safely conclude that Sunny was wrong in its assessment that Mr G would be 
able to afford Loan 1 even if he did draw-down to his credit  limit  at the point he opened the 
account in April 2014. But Mr G didnt simply draw down once. He did so numerous  times. 
Two days after Mr G opened Loan 1 (and drew down £175) he drew down again  this time 
£325. This took his balance up to £546.87  (including interest) on 15 April 2014. He then 
repaid that sum the following day.  And later that same day he drew down for a third time  
again up to the limit of £500.  Even at this very early stage this pattern might suggest that 
Mr G was drawing-down capital to repay an earlier withdrawal and it associated  interest.  And 
indeed, this pattern  continued. 
On 27 April 2014 Mr G repaid £553.16 but he drew-down £400 within the week   on 3 May 
2014 (draw-down  4). He repaid that sum plus over £50 of interest  on 16 May and borrowed 
£500 later that same  day (draw-down 5). Having repaid £350 on 1 June and £254.75 on 16 
June, Mr G drew-down the maximum amount  he could  within his credit limit (£494.46)  later 
on 16 June- draw-down  6.
On 16 July Mr G repaid £644.99  to bring his balance down  to zero but a couple  of hours later 
he again drew  down £500 (draw-down  7). A pattern had developed  by this point which 
suggested that Mr G was drawing down further sums immediately - or very soon -  fter 
having repaid  earlier  borrowing. 
CONC 6.7.2 states: 
A firm must monitor a customer's repayment record and take appropriate action where  there 
are signs  of actual or possible  repayment  difficulties.
I think that by Mr Gs seventh withdrawal on Loan 1 (of £500) his behaviour of borrowing- 
repaying-borrowing was signalling that he was having problems managing his money. And I 
dont think Sunny acted  fairly in allowing him to continue borrowing as it was most likely the 
wasnt able to afford further credit in a sustainable way. So, Im upholding his complaint 
about all the draw-downs he made  on the open-ended credit agreement  (Loan 1) from, and 
including, the seventh one on 16 July 2014.
Sunny allowed Mr G to continue to draw-down on Loan 1 in a similar pattern until it ceased 
to offer its open-ended credit  facility. On 16 January 2015 - the day Mr G cleared Loan 1 with 
Ref: DRN87514275a repayment of £624, he immediately borrowed Loan 2: a sum of £500  to be repaid over six 
months at around £166 per month.  Although this was a different kind of product, the pattern 
was similar. And Im satisfied that in these circumstances, Mr Gs complaint about  Loan 2 
should also be upheld.
Sunny agrees to uphold Mr Gs complaint from the point Mr G took Loan 3. But I think  its 
important to note that the pattern of repeat lending, which had developed, continued. 
Loan 3 was taken whilst  Mr G still had Loan 2. Those two loans were repaid  on 16 and 
13 March  repayments totalling over £580.  Just over a week  later he borrowed Loan 4 - 
£500.
Loan 5 was taken whilst  Loan  4 was still live  meaning Mr Gs monthly repayments were  
now close to £220. He wasnt making  any real inroads into the amount  he owed Sunny. And, 
as before, he was tending  to borrow relatively  large sums of money  shortly  after hed repaid 
Sunny a higher amount. 
I agree  with our adjudicator that by the time Mr G took Loan 5 on 27 April 2015 the pattern of 
repeatedly borrowing one loan after another, sometimes with loans overlapping, meant that 
Sunny shouldve realised  that further lending was unsustainable and potentially harmful. 
  
In summary,  I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny continued to provide him with credit 
from the point it allowed  him to take the seventh draw-down on Loan 1. In particular, I think  
that the pattern of borrowing from Loan 5, meant  that Sunnys loans had the effect  of unfairly  
prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing him to take expensive credit intended for short-
term use. The sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Gs 
ability to access mainstream (and cheaper) credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Gs complaint about  all the advances  provided to him by Sunny from 
the point it allowed him to draw-down for the seventh time on the open-ended credit  facility 
on 16 July 2014.   And  Sunny should  put things right in the way Ive set out below.
Ref: DRN87514276Putting things  right
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr G the seventh draw-down on the open-ended credit 
agreement (Loan 1 in my table)  or any further advances  and should  put things right as 
follows:
a)Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr G towards  interest, fees and 
charges on all the advances provided to him from (and including)  the seventh  
advance on the open-ended credit on 17 July 2014 
b)Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr G which were 
considered as part of a), calculated from the date he originally  made the payments, 
to the date the complaint is settled.
c)Pay Mr G the total of a) plus b).
d)Remove any adverse  information Sunny has recorded on Mr Gs credit file in relation 
to the advances provided to him between  16 July 2014 and 25 March  2015 (the 
seventh draw-down  on Loan 1 and Loan  4). The overall pattern of Mr Gs borrowing 
for Loan 5 (27 April 2015) onwards  means any information recorded about them is 
adverse, so Sunny should remove these  loans entirely from Mr Gs credit  file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny  to deduct tax from this interest.  It should give Mr G a certificate 
showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  I uphold Mr Gs complaint  against Elevate Credit International 
Limited in part and require it to put things right in the way Ive explained.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 April 2020.
