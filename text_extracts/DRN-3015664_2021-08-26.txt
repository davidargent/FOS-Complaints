The complaint
Mr P complained that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua offered him a refund of fees, but didnt
pay that, and instead kept charging him additional fees. He said he complained, but NewDay
never responded, it just applied a default to his account without warning.
What happened
Mr P said that hed used his card to get cash in an emergency in September 2020, and he
was charged fees. He said he was then charged more fees in October. Mr P said NewDay
had agreed to waive these fees, but it didnt. He called again, and NewDay said he had to
make a payment first so he did that. Mr P said that the amount he paid wouldve been fine if
NewDay had waived its fees as it said it would, but the fees werent waived. Mr P said he
was just charged more fees. 
Mr P said he complained about all this in early November, but NewDay didnt do anything. 
He said it eventually just wrote to him saying that it still hadnt sorted things out, and he 
could ask our service to look at this now if he wanted to.
Mr P said in late December he got a default notice from NewDay. He didnt think NewDay
should apply a default without any warning, and he thought it should always be a last resort.
He said a default would not be appropriate, because hed been making payments.
NewDay said it had offered to make a refund of £76.15 in fees and interest which had been
charged on Mr Ps account, but only if he paid £40 first. And it said he never made that
payment. NewDay said it sent Mr P a default notice on 26 December, telling Mr P that he
needed to pay £50.69 by 15 January 2021.
NewDay had since made some refunds and goodwill payments to Mr P, and in March it told
him it had updated his credit file to remove a late payment marker made while his complaint
was being investigated.
Our investigator said she couldnt look at how NewDay had handled Mr Ps complaint. But
she said she could look at the overall service hed received, and whether it was fair for
NewDay to apply charges from September 2020 onwards. Our investigator set out the
history of Mr Ps account during this time. She said NewDays contact notes said it would
refund £76.15 in interest and charges if Mr P paid £40, but he hadnt made this payment, so
she didnt think NewDay had to make this refund.
Our investigator thought that NewDay had applied interest and charges properly, and the
problem was that Mr Ps account wasnt repaid from September 2020 onwards. The
subsequent repayments to the account didnt clear the minimum repayment due each
month, which meant arrears continued to build up as interest and charges were added, and
that often took the account over its limit.
Our investigator thought NewDay had notified Mr P about everything which was happening
on his account, and she thought it was sensible for NewDay to put a suspension on Mr Ps
account, to prevent further arrears from accruing. She said that it wasnt unfair for a notice of
default to be issued in late December, given the arrears on Mr Ps account.
Our investigator said that NewDay had since removed negative markers from Mr Ps
account, and made refunds. She didnt think it had to do any more.
Mr P didnt agree. He said that our investigator had gone into too much detail, and hadnt
looked at the key issues. He said his credit file still hadnt been updated. And he thought
wed been nave to just believe that NewDay hadnt promised him a refund. He stressed that
he wanted us to listen to the calls, where he said this refund was offered. He also said that
there were negative marks on his credit file for April and May 2021.
Our investigator double-checked with NewDay that it had already supplied everything it
could to cover the calls Mr P made to it in October and November. It said it had.
Mr P wanted his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman, so it was passed to me for a
final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did not propose to 
uphold it. This is what I said then: 
I can see from statements preceding Mr Ps latest complaint, that he has previously 
received refunds of fees from NewDay, including in August 2020.
In September 2020, Mr P paid late, so he incurred a fee of £12. He paid only £10, 
which was more than the minimum for the previous month, but not enough to cover 
the late fee he was also charged. Mr P was also charged a fee that month for a cash 
advance he took. And because this cash advance took Mr P over his credit limit, he 
was charged an overlimit fee. I think that all these fees were correctly applied.
Mr Ps September statement shows he needed to pay £39.91 immediately to bring 
him back under his credit limit, and he also needed make his minimum payment of 
£42.32 by 7 October.
Mr P didnt pay at all that month.
Mr Ps October statement includes a £12 overlimit fee, a £12 late payment fee, as 
well as interest. Again, I think these fees were correctly applied.
Mr Ps October statement shows no payment had been made. It says he needs to 
pay £76.15 immediately, to bring his account back within his limit. And he needs to 
pay the contractual minimum payment of £41.50 plus arrears of £42.32 by 4 
November.
Mr P paid £30 on the due date. He said NewDay was also supposed to make a 
payment onto his account, a refund of £76.15 which was the amount he was over his 
credit limit. And he said what he paid would have been enough to cover his minimum 
payment, if the refund had also been made, so his account had been within the limit.
But even if NewDay had made the refund Mr P says he was promised, and that had 
placed his account back under the credit limit, Mr P would still not have covered the 
arrears on his account plus the minimum monthly payment for November, which 
were both due by that date. I do understand that Mr P considers his minimum 
payment wouldve been smaller that month if a refund had been made, but I dont agree that a refund of £76.15 plus a payment of £30 would have been enough to 
cover everything that Mr P owed at this point.
So I have to bear in mind that Mr Ps account would still not have been in good order 
in November, if NewDay had made the refund he says it promised.
I also need to think about whether NewDay did promise Mr P that it would make a 
refund. And if it offered a refund, was this conditional on a payment of £40?
NewDay says it did make this offer, but only if Mr P made a payment of £40 too. Mr P 
said there were no conditions on the refund offer, and hed paid a reasonable amount 
that month.
Mr P wanted our service to listen to the calls he had with NewDay, so that we could 
hear what was said. But NewDay told us it doesnt have these call recordings, so I 
cant do that.
I can see that when Mr P received a series of refunds, and a credit as a goodwill 
gesture, in August 2020, he had paid £45. And it is consistent with my previous 
experience of this business, that it will offer refunds or goodwill payments if 
customers also make a payment themselves. So I think it is more likely that Mr P was 
told that NewDay would make a refund to him, if he did make a payment of £40. As 
he didnt make that payment, I dont think NewDay did have to make a refund to him 
at that time.
Mr Ps statement of 18 November said that he was £84.18 over his credit limit, which 
needed to be paid immediately. And he needed to make a payment of £43.37 for his 
monthly minimum payment and £12.32 for arrears, by 7 December.
Mr Ps statement of 20 December records that he paid only £5. By this time, Mr P 
had either missed payments or paid less than the requested amount for some 
months, and his account continued to be considerably over its limit. So I dont think 
that NewDay made a mistake when it issued a warning of a default on Mr Ps 
account, on 26 December.
Mr P also said that NewDay didnt respond to his complaint. I note that NewDay has
accepted that it shouldve treated Mr Ps contact with it, from October or November 
onwards, as a complaint, and it didnt do that.
NewDay refunded £28.95 in interest charges, £36 in fees, and paid compensation of 
£45, which all show on Mr Ps January 2021 statement.
NewDay said Mr P complained again, and when Mr P asked for a call back in 
February 2021, that wasnt actioned for him. So NewDay wrote to him in March 2021, 
and said it had removed late payment fees totalling £36, and £26.60 of interest. It 
had also credited his account with £50 in compensation. These payments show on 
his March 2021 statement.
NewDay has now also removed adverse markers on Mr Ps credit file between 
November 2020 and March 2021. Although Mr P was concerned that this 
amendment hadnt actually been done, I can see this is what is reporting to Mr Ps 
credit file.
Our investigator didnt think our service could consider the way that Mr Ps complaint 
was dealt with by NewDay. I dont agree with that, I think this was all part of resolving the original issue Mr P raised, so I do think we can consider it. And I can see that 
NewDay has accepted that it provided poor service, by not recording Mr Ps 
complaint straight away, then failing to provide a prompt response. But I also think 
that what NewDay has done provides a fair and reasonable outcome to this 
complaint.
I know that Mr P will be disappointed, but I dont think NewDay has to do more than 
this. And that means I dont think his complaint should be upheld.
Mr P wanted to complain about more recent markers on his credit file, in April and 
May 2021. But I dont think NewDay has yet had a chance to consider or respond to 
any complaint about this. Our service wont be able to look at this point for Mr P until 
NewDay has had the chance to do that.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay said it accepted my decision, and it wanted to reassure Mr P that it hadnt placed 
any negative markers on his credit file for April or May 2021. Although I remain of the view 
that this issue falls outside of this complaint, Im happy to pass on this information to Mr P.
Mr P said that we hadnt investigated properly, and he resent some emails he had previously 
sent to our service. Id like to reassure Mr P that I read these and considered them carefully 
before reaching my provisional decision. Ive read these emails again now, as part of 
reviewing this case. 
Mr P also sent us a further email, setting out his case. He said that the key call, when he 
was offered a refund, happened in October, and hed sent us proof that he spoke to NewDay 
then. But it doesnt appear to me that NewDay disputes that it spoke to Mr P. The issue is 
what was said. 
Mr P said that a figure of £40 wasnt mentioned on the calls. He paid £30 as promised on 4 
November. He said that if exactly £40 was required then NewDay could have called him.
Ive explained in my provisional decision that the evidence about what happened on this call 
from NewDay is different. It says that it offered to make a refund only if Mr P paid £40.There 
is no call recording available for our service to listen to, so I have to weigh the evidence I do 
have, and also to bear in mind my previous experience of this business. And, with all that in 
mind, I still dont think it was likely that Mr P was offered a refund without a commitment to 
make a payment of £40. I also dont think NewDay had to call Mr P, if he didnt pay the 
amount it understood hed offered.
Mr P also said that putting a default notice against someone is a last resort, and businesses 
must at least give the person pre warning. And Mr P said he never got that. No prior notice 
was sent before the notice dated 26 December 2020. He said if there was he would have 
contacted NewDay to work something out. And he repeated that there would have been no 
need for any notices if the credit had been applied as that would have brought him back into 
credit and all payment following the £30 would have been over the minimum required.No default was placed on Mr Ps credit file on 26 December. The letter that was sent to him 
then was a warning of an upcoming default. This default wasnt, in fact, applied to Mr Ps 
account. This appears to have been because of refunds and credits applied to his account 
by NewDay in January.
Mr P has disagreed strongly with our investigator, and with myself. He continues to argue 
that no fees would have been added nor any sort of default notice thought about if a credit of 
£76.15 had been put on his account. 
I understand that this is an emotive issue for Mr P. But Ive set out in my provisional decision 
why I dont agree with that. The £30 Mr P paid on 4 November wasnt enough to cover what 
he owed, even setting aside the payment NewDay requested to bring the account back 
within its limits. Mr P may have overlooked that hed made no payment for the previous 
month, so he still owed for that too. And Mr Ps next payment after this was only £5. Again, 
that wasnt enough either to cover his monthly minimum, or to contribute to paying down his 
arrears.
So I still dont think that what went wrong on Mr Ps card is solely a result of a credit that he 
believed he was going to receive, not being paid. 
Mr P has asked us a number of times to listen to the relevant calls. And I know that Mr P 
feels strongly that NewDay would have recorded his calls. But our service has asked 
NewDay, and it says it doesnt have these calls now. 
Mr P has said that we are nave to believe what we are told about this. But it would be very 
serious indeed, if NewDay were to seek to deceive our service. And I havent seen anything 
to suggest to me that NewDay isnt telling the truth.
So I have reconsidered the evidence available to me, including what Mr P has said now. But 
I havent changed my mind. I know Mr P will be very disappointed, but I still dont think his 
complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 September 2021.
