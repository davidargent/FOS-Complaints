K821x#15complaint
Mr L says CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) irresponsibly  lent to him.
background
This complaint is about eleven payday loans QuickQuid provided to Mr L between  
September 2015 and May 2018. Some of the information Quick Quid provided about these 
loans is shown in a table attached as an appendix  to this decision.  
Mr L asked for additional credit advances or top-ups  when he borrowed loans 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 
9, 10 and 11 and these are shown in the table as 3a, 5a etc. The repayment dates for loans 
7, 7a and 9 were also deferred.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ls complaint  and thought  the loans  from loan three onwards 
shouldnt have been given. QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN27402612Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan three would most likely have 
shown that Mr L would need to use almost 40% of his declared  income  to repay  the loan. I 
consider that to be a significant  proportion of the income that was available to Mr L. He also 
topped up loan three the following day, which made his repayments even higher. I think  this 
shouldve indicated to QuickQuid that Mr L was unlikely to be able to make  his repayments 
sustainably.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr L, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
four. I say this because:
When he asked for loan four Mr L had been  borrowing from QuickQuid for over nine 
months. And he was provided with a new loan within a few weeks  of settling a 
previous one. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr L 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed QuickQuid. Loan 11a 
was taken out more than two and a half years  after Mr Ls first. And combined with 
his initial  borrowing for loan 11, it was for a larger amount. Mr L had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended 
period.
Mr L incurred late fees on loans three, seven, nine and eleven. I think  this showed he 
was having difficulty  managing his finances.
I think that Mr L lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan four 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN27402613the sheer number  of loans, top ups and deferrals was likely to have  had negative  
implications on Mr Ls ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 onwards, and QuickQuid should put 
things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 3 to 11a;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 and 3a from Mr Ls credit file;
the number  of loans taken from 4 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  4 to 11a should be removed  from Mr Ls 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr L a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  CashEuroNet UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) should pay Mr L compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 August 2019.
