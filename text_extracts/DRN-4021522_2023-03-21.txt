The complaint
Ms W complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to her the money that she and her partner paid for some holiday club 
membership points. Shes being represented in her complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Ms W and her partner had bought a trial membership of a holiday club in June 2010 and 
they entered into an acquisition agreement to upgrade their membership in July 2010 by 
buying some membership points. The purchase price of the points was £15,034 and they 
traded in their trial membership which was given a value of £5,795 so the balance due from 
them was £9,239. Ms Ws partner entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance for a loan of £11,439 (which included £2,200 to consolidate the finance that 
had been taken out with another finance provider to pay for part of the cost of the trial 
membership). Ms Ws partner agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £171.53 to 
Barclays Partner Finance. 
Ms W and her partner upgraded their membership again in September 2010 when they 
entered into another acquisition to buy some more membership points. The purchase price 
of those points was £6,610 and Ms W entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance for a loan of that amount. She agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of 
£99.53 to Barclays Partner Finance.
Both loans were repaid in February 2013 and I understand that Ms W and her partner then 
bought a different type of membership from the holiday company in September 2014. 
Ms Ws and her partners representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in March 
2018 about the July 2010 purchase under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It 
said that the points were mis-sold and, but for the misrepresentations made, Ms W and her 
partner wouldnt have purchased the points nor entered into a loan agreement. It said that 
the terms of the agreement were unfair as an undisclosed commission was paid and they 
were pressured into entering the loan agreement. A statement from Ms Ws partner was 
provided. Ms W and her partner have also made a complaint to the other finance provider 
relating to the trial membership agreement and that complaint is being considered 
separately.
Barclays Partner Finance issued two final response letters  one dealing with the loan made 
to Ms Ws partner and the other dealing with the loan made to Ms W. It said that Ms W and 
her partner were out of time to bring any claim in respect of the acquisition agreements but it 
also set out the reasons that it didnt consider that theyd been mis-sold to them or that there 
were unfair relationships. Ms W and her partner werent satisfied with its responses so a 
complaint was made to this service. Their complaint form says that Barclays Partner Finance 
paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to them, the holiday 
company failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan, unduly 
pressured them into entering the agreements and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure them and the membership was misrepresented. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Ms Ws and her partners complaint should be 
upheld. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between 
Ms W and her partner and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded 
that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. 
Ms Ws and her partners representative, on their behalf, has asked for their complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It has responded to our investigators recommendations in 
detail and sets out further reasons that it considers that there was an unfair relationship. Our 
investigator then said that she hadnt seen anything to persuade her that the lending was 
unaffordable at the time of the loans and she explained why she didnt consider that 
Barclays Partner Finance had acted incorrectly in connection with any commission that it 
paid to the holiday company.
The July 2010 loan was made to Ms Ws partner and he is an eligible complainant to make a 
complaint relating to that loan agreement. The September 2010 loan was made to Ms W and 
she is an eligible complainant to make a complaint relating to that loan agreement. There are 
two separate complaints and in this decision Im only considering Ms Ws complaint about 
Barclays Partner Finance. Ms Ws partners complaint about Barclays Partner Finance will 
be considered in a separate decision. Ms Ws and her partners representatives letter to 
Barclays Partner Finance in March 2018 made a claim about the July 2010 purchase but 
Barclays Partner Finances final response letter to Ms W responded to the claim on the basis 
that the claim was made about the September 2010 purchase. In this decision, Ive set out 
my findings as if Ms W had made a complaint to this service about Barclays Partners 
Finances response to a claim that she made to it under section 140A about the September 
2010 purchase.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Ms Ws complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Ms Ws complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claim that shed 
made to it and I accept that she referred her complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to 
her claim;
Ms Ws claim was made under section 140A but Im not determining the outcome of 
that claim in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im considering 
whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to that claim was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
I consider it to be clear from Ms Ws and her partners representatives letter to 
Barclays Partner Finance in March 2018 and the complaint form that was sent to this 
service that the claim was made under section 140A and that no claim was made 
under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act so I havent considered any complaint 
about Barclays Partner Finances response to a claim under section 75;section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner has provided evidence to show that the loan that it made to Ms W 
was repaid in February 2013, less than six years before her section 140A claim was 
made to Barclays Partner Finance, so I dont consider that Ms Ws section 140A 
claim is time-barred;
Ms Ws and her partners representative described in the letter that it sent to Barclays 
Partner Finance in March 2018 the ways that it says that the membership was mis-
sold to Ms W and her partner in July 2010 and the ways that it was misrepresented to 
them;
Ms Ws partner provided a witness statement in which he describes what he says 
happened  he says that they were told that the more points they had, the less 
ground rent they would have to pay and there would be more availability (but he says 
that isn't the case) and that buying more points would solve all of the issues that they 
had;
Ms Ws and her partners complaint form says that: Barclays Partner Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to them; the holiday 
company failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan, 
unduly pressured them into entering the agreements and used aggressive 
commercial practices to pressure them; and the membership was misrepresented;
Ms W and her partner bought a trial membership in March 2010, they upgraded their 
membership in July 2010 when they bought some membership points, they bought 
more membership points in September 2010 and they upgraded again in September 
2014 when they bought a different type of membership;
in September 2010, Ms W and her partner signed the acquisition agreement (which 
included its terms and conditions) and a membership declaration and the evidence 
shows that between July 2010 and September 2014 they completed eleven bookings 
with the holiday club (and made but cancelled seven more bookings);
Ive carefully considered what Ms Ws partner has said in his statement and the other 
information that Mr Ws and her partners representative has provided (including its 
detailed response to our investigators recommendations) but Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the membership points were misrepresented to 
Ms W and her partner by the holiday company in September 2010 or that they were 
induced into entering into the acquisition agreement by any misrepresentations;
nor am I persuaded that the terms of the acquisition agreement are unfair or that the 
membership points were mis-sold to Ms W and her partner;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms W and her partner complained to the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance about any of those issues until March 2018  
more than seven years later and in that time they entered into another agreement 
with the holiday company  if they considered that the membership points had been 
misrepresented or mis-sold to them in September 2010, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them not to have entered into a further agreement with the 
holiday company;Ms Ws and her partners representative says that Barclays Partner Finance paid an 
undisclosed commission to the holiday company  but Ive not been provided with 
any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by Barclays Partner 
Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to 
Ms W and her partner risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Ms Ws and her partners representative says the holiday company failed to conduct 
a proper assessment of Ms W and her partners ability to afford the loan  Ive seen 
no evidence to show what if any affordability assessment was made before Barclays 
Partner Finance made the loan to Ms W in September 2010 but they completed an 
application for a loan from another finance provider in March 2010 and provided the 
holiday company with information about their employment, income and home 
ownership and Ive seen no evidence to show that their circumstances changed 
significantly between then and September 2010;
Ms W repaid the September 2010 loan in February 2013 and at about the same time 
her partner repaid the loan that had been made to him in July 2010 and Ive seen no 
evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Ms W when it was made to her 
in September 2010;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms W asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its affordability assessment before March 2018  as the loan was 
made to her in September 2010 and was repaid in February 2013, I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect her to have raised any concerns about the 
affordability of the loan before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Ms W and her partner 
were unduly pressured into buying the membership points in September 2010, that 
Ms W was unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable commercial practices against them  Ive seen no 
evidence to show that Ms W complained to Barclays Partner Finance about those 
issues until March 2018 (more than seven years after the loan had been made to 
her) and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have complained to 
Barclays Partner Finance about any such issues before then;
Ms Ws and her partners representatives response to our investigators 
recommendations includes claims about the unfairness of the management charges 
and other claims which werent included in the claim that was made to Barclays 
Partner Finance in March 2018 or in the complaint form that was provided to this 
service  as those claims havent been made to Barclays Partner Finance Im unable 
to make any finding about them in this decision;
Im not persuaded that Ms W has provided enough evidence to show that her 
relationship with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be 
likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Ms W 
and Barclays Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance said that Ms Ws claims were time-barred under the 
Limitation Act but it also set out the reasons that it didnt consider that the 
membership points had been mis-sold to her or that there was an unfair relationship and I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it not to uphold Ms Ws claim under 
section 140A; and
I sympathise with Ms W for the issues that she and her partner have had with their 
memberships, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Ms W any of the money that 
shes paid under the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 April 2023.
