The complaint
Mr S complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to him the 
money that he paid for some holiday club membership points. Hes being represented in his 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr S and his partner entered into a purchase agreement in October 2015 to buy 4,000 
holiday club membership points. The total price payable under the agreement was £3,000 
and Mr S paid £600 of that amount using his Barclaycard credit card in October 2015 and 
the balance of £2,400, also using his Barclaycard credit card, in November 2015. 
Mr Ss representative made a claim to Barclaycard in June 2017 under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the membership points were mis-sold to Mr S and his 
partner and that, but for the misrepresentations made to them, they wouldnt have purchased 
the points.
Barclaycard apologised for the poor way in which it had handled Mr Ss claim and the time 
that it had taken to respond to it and it credited his account with £25. It said that Mr Ss 
account was charged by a third party that acted as an intermediary between Mr S and the 
holiday company so the debtor-creditor-supplier agreement required for a claim under 
section 75 was broken and it couldnt consider his claim under section 75. Mr S wasnt 
satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ss complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that it would have been unfair or unreasonable for Barclaycard to turn down his claim 
for misrepresentation. She wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time 
of sale and she said that, because there wasnt enough evidence to uphold Mr Ss 
complaint, she hadnt made a finding on the debtor-creditor-supplier relationship.
Mr Ss representative says that Mr S has rejected our investigators recommendation and 
has asked for his complaint to be referred to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ss complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Ss claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
Mr Ss claim under section 75 is that the membership points were misrepresented to 
him and his partner and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclaycards response to 
Mr Ss claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Ss representatives letter to Barclaycard in June 2017 says that Mr S and his 
partner had purchased points from another holiday company and were then advised 
by the holiday company that they were required to "clean up those points" and that 
the only way that they could benefit from them would be to clean them;
it also says the holiday company misrepresented the membership points and their 
benefits and pressured Mr S and his partner into purchasing them which was 
unsuitable and failed to provide the advantages promised;
Ive been provided with a copy of the purchase agreement that Mr S and his partner 
signed in October 2015 and also the terms and conditions and standard form of the 
withdrawal notice that could be given that they signed at the same time;
the purchase agreement also refers to the articles of association, a legal and 
governing documents booklet and a key information document but neither Mr S nor 
his representative has provided copies of those documents;
I consider it to be clear from the purchase agreement that Mr S and his partner were 
buying 4,000 points rights and membership of the holiday club on the terms and 
conditions that they had signed;
Mr S and his partner havent described in detail the conversations that took place 
with the holiday company or the circumstances in which the alleged 
misrepresentations were made to them and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the holiday company misrepresented the membership points 
or their benefits to Mr S and his partner;
Mr S and his partner had signed the separate standard form of the withdrawal notice 
that could be given which said that they had the right to withdraw from the contract 
within 14 days without giving any reason  so, if theyd been pressured into 
purchasing the points and didnt want to keep them, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have exercised their right to withdraw from the 
purchase agreement but Ive seen no evidence to show that they contacted the 
holiday company within the withdrawal period to do so;
if the holiday company had made promises to Mr S and his partner which werent 
contained in the documents that they were then signing, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have asked for the promises to be set out in writing - 
particularly as the terms and conditions that they signed say: The terms of this 
agreement and the documents incorporated in it form the entire agreement between 
us. We intend to rely on these written terms. If you require any changes or have 
relied on verbal promises please ask for these to be put in writing;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
were misrepresented to Mr S and his partner by the holiday company or that they 
were induced into entering into the purchase agreement by any such 
misrepresentations or that the membership points were mis-sold to them;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that there must be a debtor-creditor-
supplier agreement but, as Mr Ss credit card statement shows that the payments of 
£600 and £2,400 were made to a trustee, and not to the holiday company (even 
though the holiday company is also referred to on the statement), its now possible 
that there was no such agreement in place following the High Courts judgment last 
year in the case of Steiner v National Westminster Bank plc;but as Im not persuaded that theres been a misrepresentation for which Barclaycard 
would be liable under section 75, I consider that theres no need for me to make any 
finding as to whether or not there was a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement in these 
arrangements;
Barclaycard apologised for the poor way in which it had handled Mr Ss claim and the 
time that it had taken to respond to it and it credited his account with £25 - I consider 
that the £25 compensation that it credited to Mr Ss account was fair and reasonable 
compensation for those issues and that its response to his section 75 claim was fair 
and reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr S and his partner for the issues that theyve had with their 
holiday club membership points, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require Barclaycard to refund to Mr S any of the 
money that he paid for the membership points, to pay him any further compensation 
or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 July 2023.
