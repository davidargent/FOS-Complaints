K821x#15complaint
Mr P says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about an open-ended credit facility  and seven high-cost short-term credit  
instalment loans that Sunny provided to Mr P. Sunny provided the open-ended  credit facility 
in August 2013 and Mr Ps final instalment loan was provided in June 2016. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ps complaint and thought he shouldnt  have  been  provided with 
any further credit from the sixth drawdown on the facility  in December 2013. Sunny didnt 
agree with our adjudicators assessment. So the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the key relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided. Having 
looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr P, I think that Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that Mr P was unlikely  to have been  able to make his payments in a 
sustainable manner  by the time it provided the sixth drawdown on the open-ended  credit  
facility in December  2013. 
Ref: DRN04651492I say this because  by this stage, it ought to have  been  apparent to Sunny  that use of his 
open-ended facility suggested that there was no reasonable prospect of him clearing  the 
balance within a reasonable  period of time.  And it also ought to have been apparent  from his 
repayment history, which Sunny ought  to have been monitoring that Mr P may well have 
been relying on the facility and borrowing further  to make his payments. 
Sunny then transitioned Mr P from a facility which its own product literature said shouldnt be 
used for extended  periods to a series of instalment loans which had the same  effect. Mr P 
then exhibited a borrowing  pattern  of taking out further loans  not too long after repaying  
previous ones. Sunny continued lending to Mr P even when this pattern was repeated and in 
circumstances where  it ought reasonably to have  realised  that any further loans  were  more 
likely than not unsustainable for him. 
Mr P had to pay interest and charges on credit that Sunny shouldnt have provided him with. 
So I think that he lost out and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid from 23 December 2013 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges, should they 
have been paid, from the date they were  paid to the date of settlement;
remove all information relating to these loans  from Mr Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr P a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ps complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr P compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 May 2020.
