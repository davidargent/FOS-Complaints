K822xcomplaint
Mrs K complains about the amount that shes been charged by Volkswagen  Financial 
Services (UK) Limited, trading as Skoda Finance, for damage to a car that it had supplied to 
her under a hire purchase agreement.
background 
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus  on giving the reasons for 
my decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs K signed a hire purchase agreement with Skoda Finance in October 2015 for a 
new car to be supplied to her;
by signing the agreement she agreed  that she would:  keep the Vehicle in good  
repair and condition,  commensurate with its age and mileage; and that she would: 
 be responsible for any damage to or deterioration of the Vehicle which is in 
excess of fair wear and tear commensurate with the age and mileage of the Vehicle;
she voluntarily terminated  the agreement and returned the car which  was inspected 
by a third party on behalf of Skoda Finance in June 2018;
the inspection  report identified damage  to the car with an estimated  total cost of 
£257.40 and included photos  of the damage;
Skoda  Finance charged Mrs K for the damage, and also for excess  mileage, but its 
waived the excess  mileage charge and reduced the charge for the damage to 
£139.20;
our investigator thought that the charge for the scratches to the right rear door wasnt  
fair or reasonable  so she recommended  that Skoda Finance  should also waive  that 
charge  and it has agreed to do so;
Mrs K says Skoda Finance sent the car straight  to auction without repairing it so its 
charging for repairs that werent  made;
I consider it to be clear from the photos  in the inspection report that the cars rear 
bumper, left front and rear doors  and right front door were  all scratched when the car 
was returned by Mrs K  and I consider that the scratches are more than would 
reasonably be regarded as fair wear and tear in accordance with the British Vehicle 
Rental and Leasing  Association guide  on fair wear  and tear;
Mrs K had agreed that she would keep the car in good  repair  and condition and that 
she would be responsible for any damage  that was in excess  of wear and tear;
theres no requirement for Skoda Finance  to have the car repaired and I understand 
that the car was sold at auction in the condition  in which Mrs K had returned  it  but a 
car with damage will achieve a lower price at auction than a car without that damage 
so its more likely than not that Skoda  Finance will have suffered a loss because of 
the damage;
Ref: DRN13334582I consider that its fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Skoda Finance to 
charge Mrs K the amounts for the damage to the cars rear bumper, left front and 
rear doors and right front door that were  recommended in the inspection  report;  and
I find that Skoda Finance should  reduce the total amount that its charging Mrs K for 
the damage to the car to £118.20   but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require it to waive or further  reduce  those charges, to pay any 
compensation to Mrs K or to take any other action  in response to her complaint.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold Mrs Ks complaint in part and I order Volkswagen Financial 
Services (UK) Limited, trading as Skoda Finance, to reduce the amount that its charged 
Mrs K for the damage to the car to £118.20.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 October  2020.
