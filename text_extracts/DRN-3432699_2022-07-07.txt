The complaint
Mr T is unhappy PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA prevented him from using its services.
What happened
Mr T operated a PayPal account for a number of years. On 23 April 2020, PayPal restricted 
his use of the account. He says his account was one of a number restricted by PayPal 
because of links to someone Mr T occasionally works for and receives money from.
Mr T said PayPal lifted the restriction on another of those accounts after the account holder 
provided a letter from a major electronic companys legal team. He thinks that hes been 
treated unfairly, not only because PayPal has failed to explain what hes done wrong, but 
also because it has treated him inconsistently compared to other people in the same 
position.
One of our investigators didnt uphold Mr Ts complaint as they were of the view that 
PayPals actions were in line with its terms and conditions.
Mr T didnt agree. He said there was no legal basis for PayPal to block his personal account. 
So, the complaint was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand how frustrating these circumstances are for Mr T. I know he doesnt think hes 
done anything wrong. But PayPal dont need to establish that he has done so in order to 
permanently restrict his account. Its terms do not allow customers to: Control an account 
that is linked to another account that has engaged in any restricted activities.
Theres no dispute that Mr Ts account is linked to another account in the sense that hes 
regularly received payments from it. Im also satisfied based on the evidence Ive seen that 
the linked account was engaged in restricted activities. It follows that PayPal havent done 
anything wrong in restricting Mr Ts account.
But, PayPal, in any case, has no obligation to provide Mr T with an account. The section of 
its User Agreement entitled Closing Your Account, explains it may close an account at our 
convenience (i.e. whenever it chooses) by giving two months notice. 
So, even if I thought its reasons for immediately restricting the account were unfair, I 
wouldnt be able to compel it to provide an account to Mr T nor provide more information 
about its decision (in relation to his, or the linked account). 
Similarly, PayPal is entitled to use its discretion in deciding who it wants as a customer  just 
as it appears to have done in relation to Mr Ts friend (though Mr T hasnt provided any 
evidence of this). This doesnt mean it cant take the action it did in relation to his account.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 August 2022.
