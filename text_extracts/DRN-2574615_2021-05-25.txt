The complaint
Mrs B complains about the refund that etika Finance UK Limited, trading as Paybreak, has 
made to her for a package of beauty treatments and products that she didnt receive.
What happened
Mrs B entered in to a loan agreement with Paybreak in June 2018 to pay £1,500 for a 
package of beauty treatments and products  she also paid a deposit of £200 by other 
means. She received the products and three of the twelve treatments before the supplier 
stopped trading in January 2019. 
She claimed a refund from Paybreak under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It 
calculated that the value of the unredeemed treatments was £994.11 and the balance on 
Mrs Bs account was £187.50 so the refund due to her was £806.61. It then realised that it 
had made a mistake in its calculations and the value of the unredeemed treatments should 
have been £900 and the refund due to should have been £712.50 - but it refunded to Mrs B 
the higher amount of £806.61, with interest of £38.93.
Mrs B wasnt satisfied with the way that the refund had been calculated so complained to 
this service. Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He 
thought that the refund made by Paybreak was a fair and reasonable outcome.
Mrs B has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has responded 
in details and says, in summary, that:
the products were provided free of charge if she recommended them to friends  
which she did - so shouldnt be included in the calculation;
she should have been notified by Paybreak when the supplier stopped trading; and
it continued to collect direct debits from her and she was told that if she failed to pay 
she would have been charged a default late payment fee of £12 and it would have 
negatively impacted her credit score. 
Shes also provided an appointment card for two of her appointments and says that it refers 
to the offer for recommending friends.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs B used credit in the form of the loan agreement with Paybreak to pay for the 
package of beauty treatments and products;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Bs complaint about Paybreak, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that 
Paybreaks response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im 
not determining the outcome of Mrs Bs claim under section 75 as only a court would 
be able to do that;
theres clearly been a breach of contract by the supplier because it stopped trading 
before Mrs B had received all of the beauty treatments that it had agreed to provide 
her  and Paybreak has refunded £806.61 to Mrs B, plus interest, because of that 
breach of contract; 
Mrs B says that the way that it has calculated the refund is unfair and that she should 
only be paying for the three treatments that she received so the refund should be for 
£1,087.50;
the refund has been calculated by dividing the total cost of the package of £1,700 by 
the number of treatments and products that were to be received  and I consider that 
to be a fair and reasonable basis on which to make the calculation;
the calculation made by Paybreak was incorrect but the refund that it made to Mrs B 
was higher than it should have been  and it has honoured the higher, incorrect, 
refund;
the suppliers invoice shows that Mrs B received five free products  which had a 
value of £1,720  and that the price of the twelve treatments was reduced from 
£2,200 to £1,700;
Mrs B says that the free products were for recommending friends and that the 
suppliers appointment card says: If you recommend 10 friends you will receive a 
complimentary gift on us;
I dont consider it to be likely that the complimentary gift would have been products 
with a price of £1,720 and I consider it to be more likely than not that Mrs B received 
the five free products and the £500 discount on the price of the treatments because 
she was buying a package of products and treatments; 
Mrs B received the five products and three treatments and Im not persuaded that it 
would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for her to only pay for the three 
treatments; 
I sympathise with Mrs B for the difficulties that shes been caused by these events, 
including Paybreak not notifying her that the supplier had stopped trading and its 
delay in offering her a refund  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that it has acted incorrectly in its dealings with her, and the monthly loan 
repayments that she made to Paybreak have been accounted for in the calculation of 
the refund that was made to her;
I consider that Paybreak has responded to Mrs Bs complaint fairly and reasonably in 
these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Paybreak to refund to 
Mrs B any more of the amount that shes paid for the package of beauty treatments 
and products, to pay her any other compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decisionMy decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 June 2021.
