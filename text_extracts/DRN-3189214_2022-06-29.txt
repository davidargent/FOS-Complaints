DRN-3189214
The complaint
Mr W has complained that he was unsuitably advised by Central Markets Investment 
Management Ltd (CMIM), as a trustee of his Small Self-Administered Scheme (SSAS), to 
invest in a Cape Verde hotel development of The Resort Group (TRG) and a discretionary 
managed portfolio. Mr Ws complaint was originally broughy by a claims management 
company (CMC) but he is now acting alone.
What happened
In early 2014 Mr W was age 58 and working in the public sector on a salary of £24,000pa. 
He had an outstanding mortgage and other small debts, and two dependent children. With 
no savings or investments other than his Standard Life personal pension, he wasnt a 
sophisticated investor. He says he was cold called by an unregulated firm on the back of 
making a PPI claim and told they could make his pension of about £40,000 worth £100,000 
by age 65.
We know that CMIM had signed an introducer agreement with one unregulated firm (Your 
Choce Pensions or YCP), and that this firm also worked with other sister companies to 
attract clients to investments centring on TRG.  
As part of the arrangements to transfer Mr Ws pension, on 20 January 2014 a new 
employing company was incorporated; named after the road in which he lives. On 29 
January 2014 he signed terms of business agreeing that CMIM would provide a letter of 
advice in relation to TRG for the purposes of s.36 of the Pensions Act 1995 (PA95).
(For reference, s.36 of PA95 requires trustees of an occupational pension scheme such as 
a SSAS to obtain and consider written advice on the question whether the investment is 
satisfactory having regard to the requirements of regulations under subsection (1), so far as 
relating to the suitability of investments. s.36 also warns that the advice required under 
this section may constitute the carrying on of a regulated activity under the Financial 
Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA).)
CMIMs terms of business clarified the following:
- CMIM was a regulated firm, but that the service it would provide was not regulated, as it 
related to an unregulated investment.
- It was providing the service to trustees of a SSAS.
- No advice was being given on investments regulated under s.22 of FSMA and other 
than the Cape Verde investment.
- No individual suitability advicewhich takes into account your personal financial 
circumstances was being given.
Mr W also signed an undated indicative investment form at around this time, setting out that 
he was looking to invest around 75% of his pension in TRG and 25% in CMIMs 
discretionary fund management (DFM) service.
On 2 February 2014 a SSAS was established by trust deed for Mr Ws new employer with 
him as sole trustee, and Cantwell Grove Ltd (CGL) as SSAS administrator. The SSAS 
originally had an annual fee of £500+VAT which has since been reduced. 
In its response to the complaint, CMIM has agreed Mr W would have received a copy of its 
so-called dear Trustee letter, and its given us a copy as Mr W hasnt provided it. The letter 
doesnt refer to Mr W by name and mentions that the business has been introduced by YCP. 
It repeats that CMIM is providing the trustee with advice that it understands to be 
unregulated, because a SSAS is not regulated (and furthermore, the TRG investment 
involves direct ownership in property). It goes on:
We have researched the commercial property investment, The Resort Group, the hotel operator 
(Melia Hotels International), and the wider aspects of ownership and security; and our conclusion 
is that it is an appropriate investment albeit when considered in the light of sensible diversification 
of a portfolio of an investor's overall wealth and that an effective "exit" strategy is planned in order 
to coincide with the needs of the investor. The Resort Group have cooperated with our research.
In the letter CMIM explained the reference to diversification meant that its advice would be to 
consider other investments alongside the property investment that were low risk and 
unconnected with it. And the reference to an exit strategy was that the trustee needed to 
plan ahead if they wanted to draw benefits from the SSAS  in particular purchasing an 
annuity. 
CMIM went on to summarise its research and view on the suitability of the Cape Verde 
investment, some of which Ive quoted below (with my emphasis). The first three 
paragraphs below were extracted without much alteration from TRGs own key features 
document about the risks of the investment:
The investment is not suitable for a cautious investor who needs the protection of the UK investor 
compensation and regulatory environment, as both a SSAS and the overseas investment have no 
such regulatory protection. There are a range of risks that we have seen have been clearly 
documented to the investor and should be considered carefully: The value of any investment can 
fall as well as rise. Land or commercial property should not necessarily be considered as a liquid 
investment; it may therefore not be suitable should you need access to the capital at short notice 
or the timeframe desired by the trustee
Commercial property investments tend to incur ongoing costs and charges, which may not always 
be covered by any possible rental returns. The value of rental returns is dependent on occupancy 
demand, which cannot be guaranteed. 
Investments held overseas may have additional risks such as currency fluctuations, which may 
impact on any returns when converted back into sterling; political risk to ownership and title; and 
commercial risk to the delivery and management of a property/resort. You may wish to take 
independent legal advice to ensure you understand all these issues
Our view is that the investment is appropriate but only as part of a diversified holding according to 
an investor's attitude to risk and capacity for withstanding loss.
You should ensure that you only invest what you can afford to loseWe believe as core principles 
that where an investor is looking to retire within ten years then no more than 50% of their 
investment should be invested directly within commercial property, and the remainder should be 
held in liquid investments. Our advice to investors is to consider the need for diversification 
carefullyWe have not reviewed other overseas commercial property investment opportunities 
and accordingly are not providing you with advice as to the merits of the proposed investment as 
against other such investment opportunities. If you still have any doubts we recommend that you 
seek independent financial advice
The letter went on to propose CMIMs MVA Balanced Portfolio to provide the suggested 
diversification into other, lower risk investments. 
CGL would then have requested the transfer of Mr Ws existing pension policy using forms 
Mr W had signed, and on 29 April CGL received a transfer of £39,051 from Standard Life. 
On 28 May Mr W signed a letter confirming his instructions to invest in TRG and CMIM were based on advice from CMIM. His letter included the following:
Prior to issuing this letter I have obtained and considered the advice letter [CMIM] has produced in 
relation to the Cape Verde investment opportunity. I believe [CMIM] to be an appropriately 
qualified advisor for the purposes of section 36 of the Pensions Act 1995, in relation to the 
question of whether that investment opportunity is satisfactory in terms of:
( a ) its suitability as an investment in the SSAS, and
( b ) the need for diversification, in so far as is appropriate to the circumstances of the SSAS.
On 30 May £25,150 was invested into TRG, and shortly after £11,762 into CMIMs DFM 
service. The UK limited company via which Mr W invested into TRG had entered into 
contracts with developers to build the property, and to pay a third party to manage it. My 
understanding is that discounts were offered on the TRG purchase price, paid back to 
investors by monthly instalments at 7%pa until the resort opened. This correlates with Mr W 
receiving around £146 per month, but that became closer to the quarterly figure from mid-
2017 and has since reduced further. The resort was evidently unpofitable. 
In May 2015 the DFM arrangement was also sold for £11,571 and transferred to Avalon 
investments  to be managed by Organic Investment Management. Subsequent balances 
from the SSAS bank account were invested with Organic. Mr W specified a medium lower 
risk, growth objective for this portfolio with an intention of drawing the money out in 2025. 
CGL appears to be of the understanding that SSAS members had been introduced to 
Organic, who recommended this switch.
Mr Ws CMC originally complained in October 2019 about CMIMs advice on both the DFM 
arrangement and TRG. CMIM didnt give a full response to the complaint until it had been 
referred to our service (and Mr W had removed his CMC as representative). 
In summary, our investigator took the view that CMIM should have advised Mr W not to 
invest in TRG: firstly because it was unsuitable for him as an unsophisticated investor, but 
secondly because to do otherwise would constitute promotion of an unregulated collective 
investment scheme (UCIS) contrary to the restriction on such promotions.
As part of her investigation the investigator spoke to Mr W a number of times. He explained 
that the better returns being offered by the introducer were attractive - and whilst he was not 
pressured into making the investment as such, it was implied the sooner he made it the 
better. He understood CMIMs role was to advise him whether it was in his best interest to 
invest in TRG  so if CMIM had advised differently he believed he would have followed that 
alternative advice.
Accordingly, the investigator concluded that if CMIM had advised appropriately, Mr W would 
most likely not have instructed the transfer of his Standard Life pension or incurred the 
losses in TRG and (any) loss on the funds he invested in the DFM portfolio.
Mr W agreed with the investigators view. CMIM has made a number of submissions, both 
on this case and during the course of very similar complaints for other individuals. I 
summarise all of its points below:
Much of CMIMs data was lost or corrupted following its IT migration to a new system 
following the decentralisation from its FX trading company in 2017.
It accepts that TRG appears to meet the legal definition of a collective investment 
scheme, albeit an unregulated one, following Asset Land v FCA [2016] UKSC 17), 
although it didnt realise this at the time.
CMIM was first approached by YCP in mid-2013 and knew customers were in the 
process of establishing CGL SSASs to invest in TRG. CMIMs only financial benefit arose out of the opportunity to promote its DFM service for the residualfunds. It 
attended numerous meetings with the marketers of the SSAS, including YCP.
At no point did CMIM recommend or influence cautious investors to invest in TRG. It 
concluded that TRG was risky and only appropriate when considered as part of a 
diverse portfolio where an effective exit strategy was planned. It promoted its DFM 
services as an alternative and/or as diversification  as it was a low risk portfolio of 
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) of major, liquid, equity indices and bonds.
CMIM had no interaction with Mr W or physical handling of any investment, except 
when it received instructions to allocate funds to DFM (which did not happen in this 
case). To the best of its knowledge all communications were routed through CGL.
The dates trustees received their dear Trustee letter appeared to be very close to the 
Trust Deed to establish the SSAS. This suggests that no reliance was placed on this 
letter as the trustees had already decided to invest in TRG, and they also had their 
own statutory duties as a trustee to invest prudently.
CGL had told them it would accept the investment (after presumably carrying out its 
own due diligence into TRG), and required them to sign a letter stating they had relied 
on CMIMs advice - without CMIM's knowledge. It deliberately misrepresented CMIM 
as the provider of investment advice that was regulated as a personal 
recommendation and subject to COBS 9 (suitability) in the FCAhandbook.
If CMIM had been asked to provide such advice it would have declined, as it did not 
have an adviser suitably qualified to provide individual advice in relation to a SSAS. Its 
terms of business materially differed from those used in FCA-regulatedadvice.
YCP refers to CGL as its partner SSAS Administrator. [G]iven their declaration as 
experts in the field of SSAS pensions, Cantwell Groves lack of consideration of 
[inexperienced investors] as a suitable candidate for a SSAS Pension was both 
reckless and negligent.
The only client relationship was between CGL, its intermediaries and the trustees, who 
received the dear Trustee letters hand-delivered to them in their homes. Naming 
CMIM gave the pension advice they were giving the intended air ofcredibility.
The terms of business between CMIM and the trustees was to ensure that they 
understood the purpose of the dear Trustee letter. It plainly was not contracting to 
provide advice that was regulated by the FCA, and denied all liability in such respects. 
So it was not necessary for CMIM to make itself aware of the personal and financial 
circumstances of the trustees or their attitude to risk, except for the DFM investment.
It is a fundamental premise in law that an act of providing negligent advice or 
information is not, in itself, sufficient to determine the cause(s) of financial loss incurred 
by the recipient of that advice. The courts must consider whether such breaches of 
duty of care were the causes of the trustees loss.
As in its view Mr W did not rely upon the dear Trustee letter, it might just as well have 
not existed. That was a view taken by another investigator and so this service was not 
being consistent in its approach.
The dear Trustee letter was general in nature, not addressed to a named recipient 
and, most significantly, not specific as to the actual resort to be invested in or the 
amount of money involved. It contained ample warnings against investing. It was 
equally unreasonable to make a connection that anyone investing in TRG would not 
necessarily regard themselves as someone unneeding of easy access to liquidfunds.
Before CMIM became involved, the trustees had already taken a series of positive 
actions to establishing an employer and SSAS under trust deed, and executing all the 
necessary agreements for the SSAS to operate. It cannot be argued that they were induced to take any of these actions by CMIM.
The people that promoted TRG to Mr W were the original introducers, and that also 
extended to CGL given the correspondence it prepared for Mr W to authorise the 
investment. It did not extend to CMIM, as its dear Trustee letter did not amount to a 
significant step in him making the investment given the warnings it contained. It also 
encouraged Mr W to seek independent advice from an IFA.
Considering all of the above it was wholly unfair and unjust to attribute Mr Ws loss 
100% to CMIM. CGL described themselves as specialists in the field of SSAS 
pensions, and should be held responsible for Mr Ws losses. They were complicit in 
every step necessary for Mr W to make the investment, and granted their consent to it, 
which it was in their interest to do as they received remuneration from the SSAS.
CMIM also made some observations on redress, which Ill address later. We put some of 
CMIMs comments to CGL. It said the following:
- It disputes that it acted as a funnel for communications between CMIM and investors. 
It believes CMIMs involvement was co-ordinated from the outset by YCP.
-Prior to consenting to investments, as the scheme administrator, we would fully expect 
that the trustee would consider advice. The investment advice wouldnt necessarily 
need to be obtained from a regulated firm, however, it should be from a person or firm 
that has the relevant knowledge and experience.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Did CMIM make a personal recommendation for Mr W to invest in TRG?
I should start by saying Im satisfied that CMIM did carry out the regulated activity of 
advising on investments. This is defined in the FSMA 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 
2001 (amongst other things) as advice on buying, selling, subscribing for or underwriting a 
particular investment which is a security or a relevant investment. (my emphasis)
CMIM appears to be suggesting that the advice in this case was not specific enough 
because it didnt refer to the particular hotel, or the amount to be invested. But TRG had the 
characteristics of a UCIS  Mr W would be participating in a (named) pooled property 
scheme where the hotel resort (including shared facilities) would be operated as a whole.
CMIM accepts this was a UCIS. It wasnt necessary for CMIM to refer to the number of the 
apartment that TRG denoted Mr Ws investment by to meet that definition.
I dont think there is a plausible argument here that CMIM wasnt, at least, carrying out the 
regulated activity of advising on investments. As CMIM said, it attended numerous 
preliminary meetings with YCP or CGL and reviewed detailed documentation regarding the 
investment to ensure it was suitable for SSAS investment and as to risk. However, advice 
given in 2014 that wasnt a personal recommendation wasnt caught by chapter 9 of COBS  
the regulators rules governing suitability.
I agree CMIM didnt set out to make a personal recommendation. It said in the terms of 
business that it wasnt giving individual suitability advicewhich takes into account your 
personal financial circumstances. And its dear Trustee letter reminds Mr W that it hadnt 
assessed those circumstances. The FCA definition of a personal recommendation, with my 
emphasis, is:
a recommendation that is advice on investments, or advice on a home finance transaction and 
is presented as suitable for the person to whom it is made, or is based on a consideration of 
the circumstances of that person.
A recommendation is not a personal recommendation if it is issued exclusively through distribution channels or to the public.
So, the part of the definition before the word or indicates its possible to make a personal 
recommendation without considering that persons specific circumstances - if it is presented 
in such a way that the recipient reasonably believes the firm is endorsing the investment as 
being suitable for them in particular. But if I approach this from Mr Ws position I have to take 
into account that CMIM told him it wasnt making a personal recommendation; he knew he 
hadnt met anyone from CMIM; and no fact finding had been done by it.
On balance, I think Mr W ought to have realised that the dear Trustee letter was a prompt 
for him to consider if he met the circumstances of the person being described in that letter as 
an appropriate investor into TRG. It left him to some of the work: was he cautious or more 
tolerant of risk? Did he require access to the funds during the expected duration of the 
investment? If Mr W felt he met those criteria I can see why CMIMs advice would have 
carried more weight to him than one issued to the public at large: after all, he had personally 
contracted with CMIM for it to provide this advice. But that doesnt of itself mean it was truly 
a personal recommendation, and Im not persuaded that it was.
If theres no personal recommendation, COBS 9 doesnt apply. But that also isnt the end of 
this complaint. CMIM has still given advice in the dear Trustee letter, which isnt negated by 
it separately encouraging him to seek further independent advice. If it thought he was better 
off doing that then in my view it shouldnt have advised him at all. And its open to me to 
consider whether its advice is consistent with the regulators wider principles (set out at 
PRIN in the rulebook), and other COBS rules that arent in chapter 9.
Ill return to these later in my decision. But first, its important to note that as TRG was a 
UCIS, the restrictions to promotion at s.238 FSMA would also apply.
Did CMIM promote the TRG investment to Mr W, ancillary to its advice?
The glossary definition of promotion is the FCA handbook is an invitation or inducement
to engage in investment activity that is communicated in the course of business. The words 
invitation or inducement are not defined in the glossary or under the corresponding s.21 of 
FSMA. Under the guidance at PERG 8.4.5G Im not satisfied CMIMs dear Trustee letter 
had the characteristics of an invitation, essentially because it seems other third parties had 
already invited Mr W to consider TRG as an investment. But at PERG 8.4.7G the FCA went 
on to say this about inducements, with my emphasis:
An inducement may be described as a link in a chain where the chain is intended to lead 
ultimately to an agreement to engage in investment activity. But this does not mean that all the 
links in the chain will be an inducement or that every inducement will be one to engage in 
investment activity. Only those that are a significant step in persuading or inciting or seeking to 
persuade or incite a recipient to engage in investment activity will be inducements under s.21.
I appreciate CMIM is arguing that Mr W had already decided to invest in TRG  he had 
completed an indicative investment form  so the dear Trustee letter would not have been 
pivotal in his thinking. I dont necessarily agree with that, but more importantly I dont think 
its relevant to what CMIMs intent was, as highlighted above. The FCA clarified this further 
at PERG 8.4.4G, again with my emphasis:
The FCA considers that it is appropriate to apply an objective test to decide whether a 
communication is an invitation or an inducement. In the FCA's view, the essential elements of an 
invitation or an inducement under section 21 are that it must both have the purpose or intent of
leading a person to engage in investment activity and be promotional in nature. So it must seek, on 
its face, to persuade or incite the recipient to engage in investment activity. The objective test may 
be summarised as follows. Would a reasonable observer, taking account of all the circumstances 
at the time the communication was made:
( 1 ) consider that the communicator intended the communication to persuade or incite the 
recipient to engage in investment activity or that that was its purpose; and( 2 ) regard the communication as seeking to persuade or incite the recipient to engage in 
investment activity.
Its clear that the dear Trustee letter was intended to lead trustees to making an investment. 
A reasonable conclusion to be drawn was that only trustees who were cautious and/or 
needed short-term access to the money shouldnt invest. And I think CMIM would have 
known this was an unlikely conclusion for most of the recipients  and I count Mr W in that 
category  to draw. I say this in the context of:
- the advice being given on a pension, which is typically held for the longer term: there is 
some evidence that Mr W wasnt going to access these funds until age 65 or later;
- CMIM suggesting it was possible to mitigate the risks of TRG by diversifying: it 
recommended a DFM portfolio to achieve this;
- no indication being given to the trustee to understand whether they met this cautious 
definition.
In relation to the final point, CMIM says that was why it encouraged Mr W to take his own 
regulated advice. In my view that doesnt explain why it set out its letter in a way that allowed 
him to infer that he could go ahead without that advice if he wasnt cautious or needing
short-term access to funds. I also dont think its a coincidence that the dear Trustee letter 
was written in this way: CMIM stood to gain business from being able to provide DFM 
services, if a trustee went ahead with the TRG part of the investment.
It would have been apparent to CMIM at the time that third parties had quite a lot of influence 
over what the trustees did; this is the basis of much of its arguments now. So, it was unlikely 
to receive the DFM business if its advice tended to discourage the investment in TRG. I think 
that, given this clear intention, CMIMs dear Trustee letter was a significant step in 
persuading Mr W to make the investment. Mr W signed an instruction declaring that he had 
regard for it in making his investment decision. If CMIM didnt realise this is what would 
follow then it should have done: it knew it was giving its advice for the purposes of PA95.
Whether or not (in CMIMs view) Mr W was simply signing where a third party told him 
shouldnt have diminished that this was a highly significant step. It made CMIMs advice an 
inducement that meant it was promoting the investment. CMIM seems to have taken the 
view that both YCP and CGL were inducing Mr W to invest because of vested interests, yet it 
was not. That simply doesnt stand up to scrutiny.
My view that this was a promotion is underlined by the fact that on 1 January 2014 FCA 
revised the list of exemptions at COBS 4.12.4R to clarify that a personal recommendation 
on a non-mainstream pooled investment could, as a promotion, qualify for an exemption in 
certain specified (and limited) circumstances. This underlines that advising on (and not just 
personally recommending) an investment can also amount to a promotion: the very nature of 
promotion means that it does not have to be targeted to a specific individual.
That is what happened here: CMIM promoted and advised on the investment (even though 
YCP or its associated firms may also have promoted it originally, and even though it didnt 
make a personal recommendation).
Did Mr W qualify for a relevant exemption from the restrictions on UCIS promotion?
Mr W is unlikely to have qualified under the criteria set out in the FSMA (Promotion of 
Collective Investment Schemes) (Exemptions) Order 2001, because he didnt appear to be a 
high net worth or sophisticated investor. This was not established at the time by CMIM (as 
required under the regulations) and has not been suggested since. That then leaves the 
range of exemptions set out at COBS 4.12.1R. In this case Mr W likely received the dear 
Trustee letter after 1 January 2014, where there was an exemption for solicited advice that 
only allowed a promotion where the communication met all of the following requirements:(a) the communication only amounts to a financial promotion because it is a personal 
recommendation on a non-mainstream pooled investment;
(b) the personal recommendation is made following a specific request by that client for 
advice on the merits of investing in the non-mainstream pooled investment; and
(c) the client has not previously received a financial promotion or any other 
communication from the firm (or from a person connected to the firm) which is intended to 
influence the client in relation to that non-mainstream pooled investment. [See Note 3.]
Note 3 essentially said that anyone with a business relationship with the firm including an 
introducer or appointed representative, is connected to it. So its clear that the introducer 
agreement with CMIM by which YCP and its sister companies procured Mr Ws business 
would always have made this exclusion unavailable too. I also cant see that any of the other 
exemptions set out at COBS 4.12.1R were available either  not least because Mr W doesnt 
appear to have been a high net worth or sophisticated investor and didnt have any of the 
other professions or roles specified.
The only reasonable conclusion I can therefore draw from this is that CMIM unlawfully 
promoted the TRG investment to Mr W, in contravention of s.238 of FSMA. Moreover it 
ought reasonably to have been aware that other parties who promoted the investment to
Mr W previously were likely also in contravention of FSMA  because they were themselves 
unregulated and/or couldnt rely on a valid exemption either.
CMIMs position that Mr W paid no attention to or was misled by the dear Trustee letter
CMIM believes CGLs reference to the dear Trustee letter was intentionally misleading, as it 
encouraged Mr W to confirm that he believed CMIM to be an appropriately qualified adviser 
for the purposes of PA95  meaning that in effect Mr W thought hed received suitability 
advice. I dont find this misleading to the extent that it would materially alter CMIMs 
culpability, as this pre-supposes that Mr W would have understood the difference between 
advice and suitability advice.
Mr W was a lay-trustee, which CMIM knew, and unsophisticated in financial matters. So I 
think he the most he would have reasonably understood was that he was getting an 
appropriately qualified opinion on whether he should include TRG in his SSAS (or in 
laymans terms and as implied by s.36 of PA95, its suitability for his SSAS). I cant see that 
Mr W was misled if CMIM now considers it wasnt appropriately qualified to give that advice. 
And at a fundamental level, I dont think Mr Ws inclination (or otherwise) to read the dear 
Trustee letter materially alters the outcome because, as Ive set out above:
Whether something counts as an inducement depends in part on how it would be 
received by a reasonable person; not necessarily someone (Mr W) that CMIM 
considers wasnt inclined to read the letter.
Whether it was also a significant step in securing the investment is largely answered 
by the fact CGL required Mr W to take this advice, irrespective of the level of 
attention he paid to it.
So, its plainly wrong to say that this letter might just as well have not existed, as the 
investment in my view was promoted unlawfully - and that fundamentally affects the 
outcome of the complaint.
CMIM says its name was used to give the arrangements an air of credibility. But in my view 
it should have gone into this with its eyes open. It attended meetings with the other parties 
involved where a whole sales and marketing strategy was apparently discussed to attract 
new clients to invest in TRG. Yet it now says it should have been obvious to CGL that those 
clients were wholly inappropriate candidates for SSASs. These arguments actually serve to 
demonstrate very well why CMIM shouldnt have got involved in inducing Mr Ws investment 
into TRG at all. It knew that none of the other parties in the transaction were regulated by the FCA and it could not, as a result, expect them to share its duty of care to clients.
What should CMIM have done instead?
In addition to the FCA Principles, CMIM was bound by COBS 2.1.1R (the client's best 
interests rule) and COBS 4.2.1R (ensuring a communication or a financial promotion is fair, 
clear and not misleading). These COBS rules were not part of chapter 9 (suitability) and still 
applied if CMIM was advising on investments.
In any event, its just as difficult to see how it was possible for advice stated in the terms of 
business to enable a trustee to make investment decisions for his SSAS under s.36 of PA95 
not to be personalised to that trustee. PA95 itself makes references to suitability and 
diversification, and says other regulations may specify further criteria. Owing to its small 
size, most of the regulations in the secondary Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment) 
Regulations 2005 dont cover Mr Ws SSAS. But regulation 7 does, and this states that:
the trustees of the scheme in exercising their powers of investment, and any fund manager to 
whom any discretion has been delegated under section 34 of the 1995 Act in exercising the 
discretion, must have regard to the need for diversification of investments, in so far as 
appropriate to the circumstances of the scheme.
This precise wording was reflected in the investment instruction CGL required Mr W to sign. 
And I cant fairly say it was possible for him to obtain advice on whether TRG was suitable, 
and provided adequate diversification for the circumstances of his SSAS, without a 
recommendation being made specifically in respect of the requirements and objectives of 
that SSAS.
Amongst the FCAs Principles, CMIM was required to:
- conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence (Principle2);
- take reasonable care to organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with 
adequate risk management systems (Principle 3);
- pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly (Principle 6);
- take reasonable care to ensure the suitability of its advice and discretionary decisions 
for any customer who is entitled to rely upon its judgment (Principle 9).
I have significant concerns about an arrangement CMIM entered into that effectively meant it 
could only track who the end recipients of its dear Trustee letter were if YCP remembered 
to pass on a trustees signed copy of its terms of business, or it later heard from them 
because theyd signed up for its DFM service. That calls into question whether CMIM was 
adhering to Principle 3. I also think Principle 9 is particularly apt here, as it refers to the care 
CMIM should take in formulating advice (whether thats a personal recommendation or not).
In observance of these principles and rules, I think there were only really two routes CMIM 
could reasonably take:
1 . Decline to get involved in the introducer-adviser relationship with YCP, and therefore 
come into contact with clients like Mr W at all; or
2 . Agree to accept introductions from YCP, but proceed on a basis which was 
fundamentally different in a number of respects in order to ensure that it was 
complying with the principles and rules:
- Take reasonable care to make a personal recommendation to Mr W, which was 
tailored to his specific circumstances and thus was more likely to pay due regard 
to his best interests and treat him fairly.
- Note that if the recommendation was not to invest in TRG, this would not amount 
to promotion and so the restrictions on promotion wouldnt be breached.
- Ensure it issued that recommendation to Mr W directly, rather than supplying it via 
third parties (where there was potentially some doubt whether it would reach 
Mr W, if the advice didnt give a favourable impression of investing).Ive carefully considered what the possible consequences of CMIM taking either of these two 
routes might have been. Clearly no third party could make CMIM give advice that was in 
favour of investing in TRG. So if CMIM declined to get involved or indicated it would make 
direct recommendations against investing, I accept its possible that those parties would 
have looked to tie up with a different adviser hoping to get a more favourable outcome.
However the wording of PA95 meant that the proper advice Mr W was required to take 
couldnt just be given by any adviser. s.36 states:
For the purposes of this section proper advice means
( a ) if the giving of the advice constitutes the carrying on, in the United Kingdom, of a regulated 
activity (within the meaning of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000), advice given by 
a person who may give it without contravening the prohibition imposed by section 19 of that 
Act (prohibition on carrying on regulated activities unless authorised or exempt);
( b ) in any other case, the advice of a person who is reasonably believed by the trustees to be 
qualified by his ability in and practical experience of financial matters and to have the 
appropriate knowledge and experience of the management of the investments of trust 
schemes
Whether or not the other parties realised that any advice on TRG was a regulated activity, it 
wasnt surprising that typically the relevant knowledge and experience to give that advice 
was more likely to be found amongst regulated firms. And I would also expect any regulated 
adviser to be as mindful of the FCAs principles and rules as CMIM should have been. So 
they too should have considered the position on promotion; whether a personal 
recommendation would be expected; and the consequences of giving advice in favour of 
investing that couldnt be supported by a valid exemption.
CMIM had the option to refuse to get involved in advising Mr W at all, but it chose to give 
advice. So, I think its fair and reasonable that CMIM is held to the standard of the proper 
personal recommendation that it should have given to Mr W to satisfy the regulators 
expectations and those reasonably implied by PA95.
What would have happened if CMIM gave suitable advice?
As a regulated firm with permission to advise on investments, Im satisfied CMIM should 
have been aware of the regulators views on UCIS and other non-mainstream investments. It 
ought to have known that an investment in UCIS taking up a substantial portion of the 
individuals pension provision was plainly unsuitable for an inexperienced investor. It should 
have been apparent that Mr W could ill afford to take this level of risk given the low amount 
of other savings he had. In my view Mr W is unlikely to have had the experience to 
appreciate this for himself.
There was nothing about TRG in particular  being an off-plan, offshore property 
development subject to a variety of currency, counterparty, construction and occupancy risks 
 to counter that presumption of unsuitability. Its evident that the whole reason for the SSAS 
being introduced to Mr W by other parties was in order to invest in TRG. And Im satisfied 
from the evidence, including my experience of other cases, that Mr W most likely received 
CMIMs dear Trustee letter before his pension was transferred to the SSAS. So I need to 
consider how Mr W would have acted, if CMIM had made a proper personal 
recommendation that didnt involve TRG.
I find it unlikely that the other parties involved would have been interested in Mr W 
proceeding to transfer to the SSAS on any basis that didnt involve investing in TRG. And to 
secure the TRG investment they needed advice in favour of it, to comply with PA95, and as 
I said above I think its reasonable to conclude that other regulated firms should also have 
advised against TRG.
CGL told this service the advice wouldnt necessarily need to come from a regulated adviser, 
but Im mindful that an unauthorised firm recommending a collective investment scheme would be committing an actionable offence under FSMA. That would in my view make such 
a firm difficult to find, and their advice would in any event carry less credibility. It could also 
have been flagged up in the checks ceding pension schemes was carrying out to mitigate 
against pension liberation/scams.
Ive taken into account that Mr W didnt instigate the advice here and hadnt built up a long- 
standing relationship with the introducer. He told our investigator it only occured because the 
person handling his PPI claim speculatively asked what pensions he had. He didnt even 
meet CMIM. As CMIM itself realises, its name was brought on board to legitimise Mr Ws 
investment in TRG. But CMIMs advice should have far from legitimised the investment. It 
should have made very clear that it was unsuitable for him.
Once that opinion had been given I cant safely say it could easily have been undone by 
any attempts to refer Mr W to other advisers. Im satisfied the more likely outcome is that any 
further attempts to secure his TRG investment would have failed in the light of CMIMs 
advice. As a result, Mr W would most likely have had a reason not to give (or to abort) his 
instruction to Standard Life before the transfer happened.
Should I only apportion part of Mr Ws losses to CMIM?
CMIM says that CGL was reckless and negligent given its professed level of experience. I 
understand the argument that it should have been apparent to CGL that the dear Trustee 
letter couldnt satisfy the requirements (which it identified itself) of PA95. I didnt know 
whether Mr W intends to complain about CGLs actions as his SSAS administrator, but 
occupational schemes arent within the Financial Ombudsman Services jurisdiction. In any 
case there is a higher bar against financial advisers, and this is reflected in the way they are 
regulated and rules they must follow. So its also understandable that Mr W has chosen to 
bring this complaint to us.
CMIM also says that Mr Ws own responsibilities as a trustee should be taken into account, 
but a trustee is just as entitled to appropriate advice as any consumer of financial services. 
CMIM was providing FCA-regulated advice to Mr W as the sole lay-trustee and, equally, had 
an opportunity to check for itself what the requirements of PA95 were. If it couldnt do that, it 
shouldnt have given the advice. I cant see a basis here on which it would be fair or 
reasonable for me allow CMIM to avoid the consequences of its own failings, even in part.
I agree that if I were satisfied that Mr W would have chosen to transfer and invest in TRG 
come what may, it wouldnt be fair for me apportion any responsibility for compensating him 
CMIM. Its not that principle that is in dispute. Rather it is whether I can, in fact, fairly say that 
on the balance of probabilities Mr W would still have gone ahead with transferring his 
pension to this SSAS or investing in TRG and the balancing component in the DFM 
arrangement, had CMIM treated him fairly. 
Theres a reason people go to regulated firms for advice. Such firms have earned their 
regulatory authorisation and, as a result people are more inclined to trust the advice they 
give. In this case, CMIM displayed an awareness of Mr Ws legal obligations as a trustee 
and Mr W has confirmed to our investigator that he correctly understood its role at the time  
to provide a qualified opinion on the suitability of these investments for his SSAS. He issued 
his investment instructions to CGL on the basis of advice that CMIM held itself out as 
suitably experienced to give.
Accordingly I have little reason not to conclude that Mr W would have taken seriously a 
recommendation from CMIM not to invest in TRG . Im persuaded on the balance of 
probabilities that Mr W would not have transferred his Standard Life pension to the SSAS 
and would not, as a result, have invested in TRG or the DFM arrangement. We consider 
each case on its own merits. If an investigator has taken a different view on causation on 
another complaint, then either party may refer that view to an ombudsman. I may not have agreed with that view.
Putting things right
My aim in awarding fair compensation is to put Mr W in the position he would have been in, 
had he not transferred from Standard Life to the SSAS.
Central Markets Investment Management Limited must therefore contact Standard Life to 
obtain a notional value for Mr Ws policy as at the date of my final decision, assuming that it 
continued to be invested in the same funds after it was transferred out. As a condition of 
accepting this decision Mr W will need to give CMIM his authority to obtain this information. 
CMIM should check that no tax-free cash or income payments have been taken from the 
CGL SSAS  if they have, the gross amounts of these payments will need to be allowed for 
accordingly from this notional value.
This notional value should be compared with the actual value, as at the date of my final 
decision, of Mr Ws CGL SSAS (including the proceeds of the various DFM arrangements 
hes held).
The actual value of Mr Ws CGL SSAS as at the date of my final decision should be 
deducted from this notional value to arrive at Mr Ws initial loss amount. (Any currently 
outstanding administration charges yet to be applied to the CGL SSAS should be removed 
from the actual value first.)
The actual value is difficult to determine where an investment is illiquid (meaning it cannot be 
readily sold on the open market). That is the case with the TRG holding in the CGL SSAS. 
Therefore as part of calculating compensation in respect of the TRG value:
CMIM should agree an amount with CGL SSAS as a commercial value for this 
investment, then pay the sum agreed to CGL SSAS plus any costs, and take 
ownership of the investment. The actual value used in the calculations should include 
anything CMIM has paid to CGL SSAS. The fractional ownership company through 
membership of which Mr P holds the TRG investment should be consulted to achieve 
this.
Alternatively, if CMIM is unable to buy the TRG investment from the CGL SSAS it 
should value it as nil, as part of determining the actual value. Its also fair that Mr W 
should not be disadvantaged while he is unable to close down the CGL SSAS and 
move to a potentially cheaper and more strongly regulated arrangement. Third 
parties are involved and we dont have the power to tell them what to do. So to 
provide certainty to all parties I think its fair that CMIM adds five years worth of
future SSAS administration fees at the current tariff to the initial loss amount, to allow 
a reasonable period of time for the CGL SSAS to be closed.
CMIM has suggested to this service that it may be able to use independent valuers for the 
TRG investment, or agree a value with CGL (which is more than nil value), even if its not 
actually buying the investment from the SSAS. As there appears to be no market for the 
investment I dont consider its fair to use a value that is the opinion of someone who is not 
actually buying the investment from the SSAS (should it not be possible for CMIM to do so). 
I also cannot anticipate whether TRG will be permitting changes of ownership because 
clearly legal processes would be involved. But to the extent that this is possible, CMIM will 
have benefited from the value it thinks is in the investment by buying it out of the SSAS. But 
if CMIM is unable to take ownership of the investment, it may ask Mr P instead to provide an 
undertaking in return, to account to it for the net amount of any payment he may receive 
from the investment in future.The aim of this undertaking is to avoid double-recovery of Mr Ws losses. If CMIM wishes to 
do this the undertaking should be drawn up after compensation is paid  and CMIM will need 
to meet any associated costs. It is not my role to set the terms of the assignment and 
undertaking, but rather to explain its aim in achieving overall fairness for both parties. If 
CMIM asks Mr W to provide this undertaking, payment of the compensation awarded may be 
made dependent upon provision of that undertaking.
Payment of compensation
If there is a loss, CMIM should pay into the CGL SSAS, to increase its value by the initial 
loss amount. The payment should allow for the effect of charges and any available tax relief. 
CMIM shouldnt pay into the CGL SSAS if this will conflict with any tax protections or 
allowances.
If CMIM is unable to pay the compensation into the CGL SSAS, it should pay it directly to 
Mr W. But had it been possible to add a sum to the CGL SSAS, this would have provided a 
taxable income. Therefore the initial loss amount should be reduced to notionally allow for 
any income tax that would otherwise have been paid.
The notional allowance should be calculated using Mr Ws actual or expected marginal rate 
of tax at his selected retirement age. Here, its reasonable to assume that Mr W is likely to 
be a basic rate taxpayer at the selected retirement age, so the reduction would equal 20%. If 
he has not yet taken his tax-free cash sum, the adjustment should only apply to 75% of the 
compensation, giving a composite reduction of 15% overall.
CMIM must also pay Mr W £300 for distress and inconvenience in view of the disruption 
caused to his retirement planning.
Details of the calculation must be provided to Mr W in a clear, simple format.
In all of the circumstances above I think its fair and reasonable for me to hold CMIM 
responsible for 100% of Mr Ws loss. Its a matter for CMIM whether it wishes to attempt to 
recover any of the compensation Im requiring it to pay from other parties. It may take an 
assignment of Mr Ws rights to pursue those parties as a further part of the above-mentioned 
undertaking, if it wishes to do so.
If Standard Life cannot provide a notional value
In this eventuality, CMIM will need to use a benchmark to provide a fair value for Mr Ws 
investment instead, and use it in the same way as the notional value in its calculations. Mr W 
was approaching his sixties at the time of advice and could not afford to take as much risk 
with his pension as if he had perhaps been younger, due to the risk of needing to draw out 
funds at a time of markets falling. He already had little capacity to absorb losses in terms of 
other assets, from the evidence we have.
So, to the extent that either Standard Life cannot provide a notional value  which remains 
the preferred method of redressing this complaint  I consider that a 50% portion in the 
FTSE UK Private Investors Income Index on a Total Return basis and a 50% portion in line 
with the average return from fixed rate bonds would be the appropriate benchmark to use in 
this case.
The FTSE UK Private Investors Income total return index is made up of a range of indices 
with different asset classes, mainly UK equities and government bonds. Its a fair measure 
for someone who was prepared to take some risk to get a higher return. The average rate for 
the fixed rate bonds would be a fair measure for someone who wanted to achieve a 
reasonable return without risk to his capital. I consider that Mr Ws risk profile was in between, in the sense that he was prepared to take a small level of risk to attain his 
investment objectives. So, the 50/50 combination would reasonably put him into that 
position.
It doesnt mean that Mr W would have made investments that exactly mirrored the return on 
this index. For that reason CMIM shouldnt be deducting investment costs or other charges 
from the benchmark. The view Im taking here is that the sort of funds Mr W would have 
invested in with Standard Life would typically have performed broadly in line with this 
benchmark; notwithstanding the charges (which would have been lower than the SSAS in 
any event). It is a proxy that is being used for the purposes of compensation. 
Im also satisfied the losses or indeed gains (if any) flowing from the DFM portfolio form part 
of Mr Ws overall loss. I note the points CMIM has made about the steps it took to ensure 
that its own DFM portfolio was appropriate, which it cannot say for the subsequent 
reinvestment with Organic, or the proceeds of the reinvested income from TRG that ended 
up with Organic. But Ive reached the conclusion that Mr W would have had no reason to be 
transferring his pension from Standard Life at all, but for CMIMs failings, and would not have 
had a need to reinvest the TRG income.
So, including the present-day value of the DFM portfolio is part of putting Mr W back into the 
position he would have been in, had CMIM not acted as it did. That includes the subsequent 
changes of DFM provider which also would not have happened if CMIM had not given Mr W 
its advice at the outset.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ws complaint and award compensation as set out in the Putting things right 
section above. If Mr W accepts this decision and compensation is not paid within 28 days of 
CMIM being notified of his acceptance, interest must be added to my award at the rate of 8% 
per year simple from the date of the final decision to the date of payment.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2022.
