K820x#14complaint
Miss A complains  about the amount that shes been  charged by PSA Finance UK Limited, 
trading as Peugeot Financial Services, for damage to a car that she returned at the end of 
her hire purchase agreement. 
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
adjudicator so I wont repeat them again  here. Instead Ill focus on giving  the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the adjudicator for these reasons:
Miss A had agreed  in the terms and conditions that on termination of the agreement  
she would pay to Peugeot Financial  Services:   all arrears  of payments and excess 
mileage charges and other sums due under this agreement together with interest 
[and] our costs in respect of  servicing,  providing replacement parts and carrying  
out repairs which are needed to put the vehicle in good condition  following its return 
- and what would  be considered to be good condition was described in the terms 
and conditions;
Miss A returned the car when the agreement  ended  and it was inspected in 
February 2019 by a third party acting on behalf  of Peugeot Financial Services - it was 
recorded that it had been driven for 21,078 miles but the annual  mileage  allowance in 
the agreement  was 6,667 miles;
the inspection  report identified a large amount of damage to the car including burns  
and soiling on the carpets and upholstery, an incomplete service history,  scuffs, 
scratches and dents on the bodywork,  poor repairs, a cracked sill, a misaligned  
bumper and a missing parcel shelf strap   and it recommend charges totalling 
£2,263.80 for the damage;
Miss A was charged for the damage, £312.79  for excess  mileage and £224.21 for an 
outstanding payment  - but she complained to Peugeot Financial Services  and it 
reduced the damages charges by £1,156.76  to £1,107.04  (which  reduced the total 
charge to £1,644.04);
Miss A says that shes not liable for the majority  of the charges  but the photos in the 
inspection report show considerable damage  to the car  and I consider that the 
majority of that damage wouldnt reasonably be considered to be fair wear  and tear 
and that the car wasnt in a good condition when it was returned by her;
Peugeot Financial Services has reduced  the charges for the damage  from £2,263.80 
to £1,107.04 - I consider that to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances and Im 
not persuaded that its acted incorrectly in its dealings  with Miss A about the return of 
the car;
Ref: DRN17617712I consider that its fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Peugeot Financial 
Services to charge Miss A £1,107.04 for the damage to the car, £312.79  for the 
excess mileage and £224.21 for the missing payment;  and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Peugeot  Financial 
Services to waive or reduce those charges - or to take any other action in response 
to Miss As complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Miss As complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 July 2020.
