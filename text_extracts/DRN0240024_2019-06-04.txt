K822xcomplaint
Mr and Mrs S complain  that Barclays Bank UK PLC charged interest on their mortgage  
account when  they had repaid it. The annual mortgage statement for 2018  said that the total  
cost of repayment in full was -£128.06, that figure  being owed to them. They accept  that 
figure. They have  been paid £91.53 so are still owed £36.53.  They would like to be paid this 
amount. 
They were  offered £50 compensation which they view as inadequate after the several phone 
calls theyve had to make.
background 
Mr and Mrs S paid off their Barclays mortgage  with a payment of £8,393.94 on 
19 September 2018. I will call this the redemption date (RD).  There were two accounts  
associated with the mortgage, namely  (1) the mortgage account  (MA)  and (2) the mortgage 
current account (MCA). Mr S phoned Barclays to check  that the money had been  received 
and attributed  to the correct account, and was assured  that was the case. 
Mr and Mrs S say that on the RD the MA was in credit by £696.27, that overpayment  having 
been made on 16 August 2018.  The MCA balance was £9,062.15 (I think  Mr and Mrs S must  
mean £9,062.15DR). By oversight Mr and Mrs S omitted to cancel a standing order so they 
paid £100 to the MCA on 20 September  2018 leaving a balance  of £8,962.15DR. 
Deducting from that figure  their payment on the RD and the balance  in the MA left a balance  
owed to them of £128.06. Mr S phoned  Barclays pointing out that the payment of £100 on 
20 September was an overpayment  and asking that it be refunded, after which £91.53 was 
paid into his current account with another bank.
Mr and Mrs S had asked for a letter to confirm that their mortgage had been paid off, and 
they received  this letter, dated 5 November 2018,  confirming that the MA had been settled 
on 19 September 2018. 
Then they received an annual mortgage  statement  dated 15 October  which said that the 
balance on the MA was -£696.27 on 30 September 2018. It also confirmed that the balance  
on the MCA (no date stated) was £568.21  and that the total  cost of repayment in full was    
-£128.06. They took the minus sign to mean that that amount was owed to them.
Taking in to account the £91.53 already paid to them there remained a sum of £36.53  owing 
to them.  Then they received a statement dated 16 October 2018  on the MCA which  included  
a figure  of £36.37 for Interest Charged Overdraft Interest For The Period to 25 October. 
Mr S phoned  Barclays to query this and was told that it was interest accrued after that shown 
on the previous  MCA statement which showed interest charged'  on 19 September  2018 of 
39.68. 
The figure of £36.37  could  only refer to the MCA since  the MA was in credit after 16 August. 
The Schedule of Amounts to Pay showed  an increasing amount day by day which  was 
clearly due to interest accruing on the MCA and not the MA. That being the case  there 
should have been no other interest  charged. 
Ref: DRN02400242Barclays offered to pay compensation of £50. It was apparently only possible for this to be 
paid by cheque. But when  Mr S received the cheque, the payee  was stated using Mr Ss 
initials and Mrs Ss surname, making it impossible  to pay into his account.  
On 12 November 2018 Mr S made a further  phone call and was given the same explanation  
for the interest charge  in the statement of 16 October 2018.  
In May 2017  Mr S had transferred his bank account away from Barclays.  This transfer was 
completed on 5 June 2017  and the transfer  paperwork  stated that his Barclays  current 
account had been closed  on that date. 
However a statement on that account  dated 17 October 2018 showed  that the amount of 
£91.53 had been transferred into that account  and then to his account with the other bank. 
Mr S was concerned that an account  in his name which he thought  defunct  was still 
accessible providing an opportunity for misuse. During a phone call on 25 October  he asked 
that it be immediately  closed but was told that he could only close  it by going into a branch 
with two forms of ID, at considerable inconvenience.
On his complaint  to Barclays  it wrote to Mr S on 25 October 2018:
We're sorry that you recently had cause to complain.  During our conversation today we 
discussed the details of your complaint and agreed an outcome that you were satisfied with.
The letter doesnt say what  the outcome was but I assume it was the payment of £91.53 
referred to above  because on 5 November 2018 Barclays  wrote  to Mr and Mrs S saying that 
a refund of that amount had been sent to their nominated account. The notes  say that a 
refund of £91.53 was actioned on 16 October  and sent on 17 October.
On Mr and Mrs Ss complaint to this service Barclays  acknowledged  that the credit left 
should have been £128.06. However it hadnt backdated the payment needed to clear the 
MCA balance. It said it shouldnt have  charged  the additional MCA interest of £36.37 on the 
16 October 2018, as it had received  the necessary money on 19 September 2018.
Barclays said it had refunded £91.53 but the refund hadnt been calculated  correctly. 
Therefore it was happy to refund Mr and Mrs S £36.53 (£128.06-£91.53=£36.53) and also 
increase the compensation for distress and inconvenience  to £100.00.
Our investigator thought this was fair but Mr and Mrs S didnt agree. They said the Barclays 
account was still open and theyd  need to visit the branch to close  it, wasting petrol. £100 
was insufficient  for their wasted time and this should be increased.
They also said that the Barclays account should have been closed when Mr S performed the 
switch on his account in 2017. They said it should  be obvious that Mr Ss new bank cant  
close a Barclays account, Barclays has to do that and had failed to do so. This had exposed  
and presumably continued  to expose  Mr S to abuse of this account.  Why had Barclays  never 
sent a statement,  even an annual one, since 2017?
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN02400243Barclays says the open  account is a transfer account and any money  paid in is 
automatically transferred  out to the nominated account. Mr and Mrs S say the account  was 
supposed to be closed as part of the switch. 
Mr and Mrs S havent yet raised  with Barclays the allegation that it hasnt performed its 
duties in relation  to the switch in 2017.  Nor have I been supplied with any documents relating 
to that switch or any evidence on which I can decide  what duties each of the two banks had 
and whether they were fulfilled. Its a separate  matter from the complaint about Barclays  
conduct of Mr and Mrs Ss mortgage accounts.  Therefore if they wish to proceed with this 
matter Mr and Mrs S will need  to raise it firstly  with Barclays and then make a new complaint 
to this service if they arent satisfied with Barclays response.
In relation to the matters which have been  referred  to me, I would uphold this complaint  
because Barclays should have backdated the payment needed  to clear the MCA balance, 
shouldnt have charged the additional MCA interest of £36.37, and should have calculated 
the refund  correctly.  It now proposes to put that right, and I consider that this, together  with 
increasing the compensation for distress and inconvenience to £100.00 is a fair and 
reasonable outcome.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and order Barclays  Bank UK PLC to pay to 
Mr and Mrs S £36.53 and £100.00 compensation for the trouble  and upset caused  to them.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision  before  4 July 2019.
