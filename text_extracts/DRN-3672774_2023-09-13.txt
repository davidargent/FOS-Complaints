The complaint
Mrs M complains that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont refund to her the money that she paid 
for some holiday club membership points. Shes being represented in her complaint by a 
claims management company.
What happened
I understand that Mrs M had bought a trial membership of a holiday club from a holiday 
company in February 2011 and that she traded in the trial membership and bought 5,000 
holiday club membership points from the holiday company in April 2012. She then entered 
into a purchase agreement to buy 5,000 more holiday club membership points from the 
holiday company in August 2015. The purchase price of the additional points was £4,350 
and she entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank for a loan of that 
amount. She agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £54.20 to Shawbrook Bank but I 
understand that she paid off the loan in full in December 2015.
Mrs Ms representative made claims, on behalf of Mrs M, to Shawbrook Bank under sections 
75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in June 2021 about the purchase that Mrs M 
had made in August 2015. The claims included that: the points were mis-sold and 
misrepresented to Mrs M; the terms of the agreement were so egregious so as to be unfair 
and the payment of commission was hidden from view; no credit or affordability checks were 
carried out to establish whether Mrs M could afford the purchase; the holiday company 
breached the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 
2010 and the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008; Mrs M was 
pressured into entering into the loan agreement; and her relationship with Shawbrook Bank 
was unfair.
Shawbrook Bank set out in detail the reasons that it said that it was unable to uphold 
Mrs Ms claims, including that: Mrs M had complained to it in about October 2015 about the 
interest on her loan and she said that shed been a member for three to four years and this 
was the first thing that had gone wrong and had raised no other issues until June 2021; she 
repaid her loan in December 2015; Mrs M had made seven reservations with the holiday 
club between August 2015 and October 2019; it was satisfied that Mrs M was willing to make 
an informed decision based on the information that she received in August 2015; appropriate 
checks for the type and amount of credit were carried out; and Mrs M had agreed that the 
holiday company was entitled to receive a commission in respect of the credit brokered.
Mrs M wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. Her 
complaint form says that: Shawbrook Bank paid a commission to the holiday company which 
wasnt declared to her; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of her 
ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured her into entering the contracts and used 
aggressive commercial practices to pressure her; and the product was misrepresented to 
her; all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140. It said that the claim should 
also be considered under section 75.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ms complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that Shawbrook Banks decision to turn down Mrs Ms claims was unfair or 
unreasonable. She wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale, 
she said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mrs M and 
Shawbrook Bank was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the 
conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She also said that she hadnt seen anything 
persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mrs M.
Mrs Ms representative, on behalf of Mrs M, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It has provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday 
company and the unfair terms that it uses and a witness statement from Mrs M. It has also 
raised its serious concerns about the way that the finance was sold to Mrs M. It says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that:
Mrs M was sold a product with little or no benefit or value as non-members regularly 
holidayed at and were given easy access to the resorts without requiring to purchase 
a membership or pay annual maintenance fees and theres little or no secondary 
market for the points;
the points were an in perpetuity contract with unlimited liability for management 
charges which was concealed at the point of purchase; and
Mrs M was pressurised into entering into an agreement on that day and was 
prevented from making an informed consumer decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ms complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
I understand that Mrs M had been a member of the holiday club since February 2011 
and she then signed the purchase agreement in August 2015 to buy 5,000 more 
holiday club membership points;
Mrs M also signed the loan agreement and Shawbrook Bank has provided unsigned 
copies of other documents that it says that she would have signed at that time 
including a right of withdrawal form, a customer compliance statement, a key 
information document, a joint application form, pre-contract credit information and an 
adequate explanation document  but signed copies of those documents havent 
been provided;
Mrs Ms representative made claims to Shawbrook Bank in June 2021 under sections 
75 and 140A and Mrs M then made a complaint to this service;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Ms claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Shawbrook 
Banks response to her claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
the June 2021 letter said that the holiday company represented to Mrs M that she 
would be able to use the additional points that she was buying in August 2015 to 
book her preferred holidays and would also give her access to more luxurious resorts with five star accommodation but it says that those representations were false and 
misleading, were made for the sole purpose of inducing Mrs M to purchase the points 
and, were it not for the misrepresentations, she wouldnt have purchased the points;
Mrs M say in her witness statement that she was told that all the resorts would be of 
the highest standard (but that wasnt the case and they continued to get worse as 
time went on as the resorts began to look tired and in need of a renovation) and that 
it was a members only club and that it was exclusive (but it became apparent very 
early on that that wasnt the case);
Shawbrook Bank says that Mrs M had bought a trial membership of the holiday club 
in February 2011, then traded in that trial membership and bought 5,000 membership 
points in April 2012 and bought 5,000 more membership points in August 2015 so I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have been aware of the 
condition of the resorts that shed used and the basis on which members and non-
members were able to use the resorts before she bought the additional points in 
August 2015; 
Shawbrook has provided evidence to show that Mrs M completed a supplier 
dissatisfaction form in about October 2015 about the interest on her loan in which 
she said that shed be a member of the holiday club for three to four years and this 
was the first thing that had gone wrong and she made no comment at that time about 
the condition of the resorts or their exclusivity;
Shawbrook Bank says that Mrs M made seven reservations with the holiday club 
between August 2015 and October 2019 but had raised no other issues with it until 
her representatives June 2021 letter;
Mrs M says in her witness statement that she did make complaints to the resort staff 
about her issues with the standard of the resorts but shes provided no other 
evidence or information to show that she complained to the holiday company about 
the issues that she says were misrepresented to her and neither she nor her 
representative has provided a detailed account of the circumstances in which the 
alleged misrepresentations were made, the conversations that took place or the 
information that was provided to her;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
that Mrs M bought in August 2015 were misrepresented to her by the holiday 
company or that she was induced into entering into that purchase agreement by any 
such misrepresentations;
Mrs Ms representative says that commission was paid between Shawbrook Bank 
and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mrs M which created an unfair 
relationship but Shawbrook Bank says that Mrs M had agreed that the holiday 
company was entitled to receive a commission in respect of the credit brokered;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show the amount of commission that 
Shawbrook Bank paid to the holiday company but, from what this service has seen 
across the industry, when commission was paid it tended to be low and of less than 
15% and Im satisfied that Shawbrook Bank wouldnt have breached any duty in 
making any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory duty to disclose the 
amount of any commission paid in these circumstances - and I dont consider that the 
level of commission that was normally paid in this type of situation would have been 
sufficiently high to mean that Shawbrook Bank should have appreciated that not 
disclosing the amount of the commission to Mrs M risked the relationship being unfair 
under section 140A;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs M asked Shawbrook Bank for any information 
about the commission that it paid to the holiday company until her representatives letter to Shawbrook Bank in June 2021  as shed entered into the loan agreement in 
August 2015 and repaid the loan in December 2015 I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect her to have raised any concerns about any commission that 
was paid sooner than that;
Mrs Ms complaint form says that no credit or affordability checks were carried out to 
establish whether Mrs M could afford the purchase but Shawbrook Bank says that it 
carries out checks in line with its regulatory obligations and it uses lending industry 
standard products, including credit searches and information provided to it by 
prospective borrowers, to assess the likelihood of them defaulting on their repayment 
obligations and of them becoming overindebted  and that its satisfied that these 
checks were appropriate for the type and amount of credit provided to Mrs M;
Mrs Ms complaint form also says that she now has a debt of £4,000 but Shawbrook 
Banks says that Mrs M settled the loan with savings in December 2015;
neither Mrs M nor her representative had provided detailed evidence about Mrs Ms 
financial position in August 2015 or to show that the loan wasnt affordable for her at 
that time;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs M asked Shawbrook Bank for any information 
about its credit or affordability checks before June 2021  as the loan was made to 
her in August 2015 and was repaid in December 2015 I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect her to have raised any concerns about the credit or affordability 
checks before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that a loan with a monthly 
repayment of £54.20 wasnt affordable for Mrs M when it was made to her in August 
2015 or that the loan was mis-sold to her;
Mrs Ms complaint form also says that the holiday company unduly pressured her into 
entering the contracts and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure her  
but Mrs M had bought a trial membership in February 2011 and 5,000 membership 
points in April 2012 (and Shawbrook Bank says that shed agreed to make other 
purchases in May 2011 and August 2015 but had withdrawn from them) so I consider 
that she ought to have been aware of how the holiday company operated and the 
sales practices that it used before she bought the additional membership points in 
August 2015;
Mrs M had completed a supplier dissatisfaction form in about October 2015 but there 
was no reference in that form to the holiday company unduly pressuring her into 
entering the contracts or using aggressive commercial practices to pressure her and 
Ive seen no evidence to show that she contacted either the holiday company or 
Shawbrook Bank about the way that the membership points were sold to her in 
August 2015 until her representatives June 2021 letter to Shawbrook Bank - if she 
felt that shed been unduly pressured into entering into the contracts and didnt want 
to buy the additional membership points I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect her to have raised her concerns when she completed the supplier 
dissatisfaction form or soon after shed signed the contracts;
Mrs M had signed the loan agreement which clearly set out her right to withdraw from 
that agreement without giving a reason within 14 days and Shawbrook Bank says 
that she also signed a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be 
given to withdraw from the purchase agreement  but Ive seen no evidence to show 
that she contacted either the holiday company or Shawbrook Bank to withdraw from 
the agreements within any applicable withdrawal period;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs M was unduly 
pressured into entering into the purchase agreement or loan agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptably aggressive commercial practices to pressure 
her;
Mrs Ms representative says that the membership points were an in perpetuity 
contract with unlimited liability for management charges which was concealed at the 
point of purchase and it has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses - but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in those agreements were unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
continued in perpetuity and the purchase agreement that Mrs M signed said that the 
structure of the membership was governed by the articles of association and the 
associated legal documentation and that she should carefully read her 
legal/governing documents booklet and the key information document;
Mrs M had been a member of the holiday club since February 2011 and she says in 
her witness statement that she was made aware that she would have to pay yearly 
maintenance fees;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mrs M and I consider it to 
be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the terms of the 
documents created an unfair relationship between Mrs M and Shawbrook Bank;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of any applicable regulations for which Shawbrook Bank would be liable under 
section 75 or 140A;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs Ms relationship 
with Shawbrook Bank was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs M and Shawbrook Bank 
in these circumstances;
Mrs M says that the issues that shes had with her membership points and her loan 
agreement have severely damaged her and her daughters mental and physical 
health - I sympathise with Mrs M for those issues but I consider that Shawbrook 
Banks response to the claims that had been made to it was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Shawbrook Bank to refund to Mrs M any of the money that she paid under the loan 
agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 October 2023.
