The complaint
Miss S is unhappy as she feels NewDay Ltd provided credit to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Between December 2018 and December 2021, Miss S successfully applied to NewDay for
six differently branded credit accounts. During this time, NewDay also increased the credit
limits available to Miss S on several occasions.
In April 2022, Miss S raised a complaint with NewDay as she felt theyd provided credit to
her which hadnt been affordable for her, and that this should have been evident to NewDay,
had they undertaken checks into her financial position before providing that credit to her.
NewDay responded to Miss Ss complaint and explained that they had undertaken checks
into her financial position before providing credit to her. NewDay also explained that, on
review, they continued to feel that the majority of the credit provisions hadnt been provided
irresponsibly by them.
However, NewDay did acknowledge that two of the credit provisions shouldnt have been
provided to Miss S, and so they reimbursed interest incurred on the accounts in question for
when the balance of the account was greater than the credit limit they felt was fair. Miss S
wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that all the provisions of credit
from June 2019 onwards  which was all but three of the provisions of credit  had been
provided by NewDay to Miss S irresponsibly, and so they recommended that this complaint
be upheld in Miss Ss favour on that basis. NewDay didnt agree with the view of this
complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman
for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 11 April 2023 as follows:
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how 
much and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before 
approving a customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of 
credit available to a customer on an existing line of credit, the business would 
undertake reasonable and proportionate borrower focussed checks to ensure that 
any credit being offered to a customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
NewDay believe that they did that here and note that at the time of the applications 
they took information from Miss S about her employment status and annual income, 
as well as obtained information about her from a credit reference agency to get a 
better understanding of her wider financial position. Additionally, NewDay also note 
that before increasing Miss Ss existing lines of credit, they again obtained 
information from a credit reference agency to refresh their understanding of her 
financial position.
Between December 2018 and December 2021, NewDay provided new or additional 
credit to Miss S on 14 occasions. Accordingly, Ive considered each of these credit 
provisions in turn.
07 December 2018  M branded credit account application
When Miss S applied to NewDay for a new credit account in December 2018, she 
said that she was employed with a gross annual income of £16,500. Miss S also 
confirmed that she had existing unsecured credit of £900 at that time.
Additionally, when NewDay checked Miss Ss credit file, they saw that Miss S didnt 
have any active credit accounts that were in arrears at that time. And, while Miss S 
did have defaults and other adverse public records on her credit file, these were all 
from over three years ago. As such, NewDay made the decision to approve Miss Ss 
credit application and they issued an M branded credit card to her with an initial credit 
limit of £1,200.
In providing this new line of credit to Miss S, NewDay were increasing Miss Ss 
potential credit exposure to £2,100 - which doesnt seem unreasonable to me. I say 
this because, while Miss Ss annual income at that time was relatively low  which 
could mean that Miss S potentially didnt have a large amount of disposable income 
available to her from which to repay spent credit  I feel that her financial 
circumstances at this time suggest that would most likely have been able to afford 
the monthly credit repayments that might have become due, had she used the full 
amount of the credit available to her.
12 December 2018  D branded credit account application
Soon after successfully applying for the M branded credit account, Miss S applied to
NewDay for a D branded credit account. Again, she told NewDay that she was 
employed with a gross annual income of £16,500 and had existing unsecured credit 
of £900. And again, when NewDay checked Miss Ss credit file, they saw the same 
information that theyd seen regarding Miss Ss M branded application a few days 
previously.
Accordingly, NewDay approved Miss Ss application and issued a D branded credit 
card with an initial credit limit of £600. This meant Miss Ss potential credit exposure 
was now £2,700, which again doesnt seem unreasonable to me, for the reasons 
previously explained above.
06 May 2019  M branded credit limit increase
In May 2019, NewDay increased the credit limit on Miss Ss M branded account by 
£1,000, from £1,200 to £2,200.
In the three months leading up to the credit limit increase, Miss S had maintained the
balance of her M and D accounts considerably below their respective credit limits and 
had made monthly payments to both of those accounts that were greater than the 
minimum monthly payments required. As such, Im satisfied that there was nothing in 
how Miss S had managed her NewDay accounts up to that time that should reasonably have given NewDay any cause to suspect that she couldnt afford the 
credit she already had.
Additionally, Miss Ss credit file didnt appear to show that Miss S had taken any 
further credit from other credit providers. And while this further £1,000 credit provided 
by NewDay meant that Miss Ss potential credit exposure was now approximately 
£3,700, this amount again doesnt seem unreasonable to me, given Miss Ss income.
29 June 2019  Z branded credit account application
The month after NewDay increased the credit available to Miss S on her M branded 
credit account, Miss S applied for a new Z branded credit account with NewDay. In 
her application, Miss S told NewDay that she was employed with an increased 
annual income of £18,500. Miss S also told NewDay that she had existing unsecured 
credit of £1,500.
Additionally, when NewDay reviewed Miss Ss credit file it continued to show that 
none of her existing credit accounts were in arrears, with the adverse credit 
information that was present on Miss Ss credit file now even further in the past. 
Accordingly, NewDay approved Miss Ss new application and issued a Z branded 
credit card to Miss S with an initial credit limit of £900.
The provision of this new credit meant that Miss Ss potential credit exposure with 
NewDay alone was now approximately £3,700, with potential further exposure from 
other credit providers. But I still feel this level of potential credit exposure was most 
likely affordable for Miss S at that time, especially given her increase in annual 
income from £16,500 to £18,500.
05 July 2019  G branded credit account application
Less than a week after Miss S applied for the Z branded account, she applied to 
NewDay again for a fourth account  a G branded account. And again, Miss S told 
NewDay that she was employed with an annual income of £18,500 with a slightly 
increased amount of existing unsecured credit at £1,800.
As mentioned, this was the fourth NewDay account that Miss S was applying for. And 
her application would be successful with NewDay providing a G branded credit card 
to her with an initial credit limit of £2,000  which is a relatively large initial credit limit, 
especially in consideration of Miss Ss other NewDay accounts.
In the month immediately preceding this application, Miss S had been maintaining 
her older M and D branded accounts approximately £1,300 and £300 below the 
credit limits available to her on those accounts respectively. And Miss S had just 
opened a new line of credit with NewDay, providing her with a further £900 of 
potential credit. This meant that, across the three accounts, Miss S had potential 
available credit of £2,500.
So, it seems strange that Miss S would apply for, and be granted, a fourth line of 
credit to the amount of a further £2,000, given the existing available credit she 
already had available to her. And its difficult not to feel that NewDay should 
reasonably have recognised this, and that they should have asked Miss S about it. 
However, given that Miss S appeared to be managing her financial position without 
incident at that time, I dont feel it can be said with any certainty that any discussion 
NewDay held with Miss S here would or should have given them any reasonable 
cause for concern.Additionally, its notable that in regard to the NewDay credit that Miss S was utilising 
in June 2019  which was a combined amount of roughly £1,150  the combined 
minimum monthly payments for that amount was approximately £30. This means 
that, if Miss S were to have suddenly utilised the further £4,500 available NewDay 
credit she had available to her following this fourth application, her combined 
minimum monthly payment was unlikely to be significantly more than £160.
But this £160 per month payment referred to above would be a minimum payment 
only, and as such if Miss S did have such a credit exposure and did make such a 
minimum payment, it would potentially take her many years to clear the balance of 
her account, during which time shed pay a considerable amount of interest.
Accordingly, I feel that a more sustainable payment amount in these circumstances 
would be closer to £200 per month. And while I feel that this would most likely have 
been affordable for Miss S at that time, given her income and her financial position, 
this potential sustainable repayment on the full credit amount available to Miss S is 
drawing closer to what I feel would potentially become unaffordable for Miss S to 
realistically have maintained.
16 July 2019  D branded credit limit increase
Not long after Miss S successfully applied for the new Z and G branded accounts, 
NewDay increased the credit limit available to Miss S on her D branded account  
from £600 to £1,500.
This meant that Miss Ss total NewDay potential credit exposure was now £6,600 and 
had more than doubled from the amount it had been only a few weeks earlier, before 
the two new account applications, when it had been £2,800.
Again, this is pushing the limits of what I feel was reasonably affordable for Miss S 
here, given her relatively low annual income and the potential combined amount that 
she may have had to pay to repay her combined credit in a sustainable manner.
03 September 2019  M branded credit limit decrease
Indeed, NewDay themselves appear to have recognised that the amount of credit 
provided to Miss S may have been unsustainable for her, because in September 
2019 they reduced the credit limit on Miss Ss M branded account by £900. This had 
the effect of reducing Miss Ss total NewDay potential credit exposure to £5,700.
14 January 2020  D branded credit limit increase
However, in January 2020, NewDay increased the credit limit available to Miss S on 
her D branded credit account by £1,000  from £1,500 to £2,500.
This increased Miss Ss total NewDay potential credit exposure up to £6,700. And, 
given that Miss Ss relatively low annual income  which she would confirm as 
remaining at £18,500 in her application for a fifth NewDay account in March 2020  
as well as that Miss S appears to have had some other credit exposure to other 
providers, I dont feel that this was a sustainable amount of credit for Miss S to be 
provided with at that time.
Additionally, following this, NewDay then proceeded to provide Miss S with a further 
six new or additional credit provisions, until her total NewDay potential credit exposure reached £14,250 in December 2021  which is more than double the 
£6,700 total amount I consider likely to have been unsustainable for Miss S as of the 
credit limit increase in January 2020.
There also doesnt appear to have been any changes in Miss Ss financial 
circumstances to have merited these further provisions of credit, given that Miss S 
again confirmed to NewDay in November 2021 that her annual income remained at 
£18,500. And, as mentioned earlier, given that Miss Ss income was relatively low, I 
feel that theres a greater chance that Miss S wouldnt have had a great deal of 
disposable income available to her, after her essential and priority spending.
NewDay may argue that Miss S hadnt displayed any evidence of struggling 
financially, having incurred no over-limit or late payment fees on her accounts, and 
appeared to be making monthly payments without incident. But Miss S didnt utilise 
the full amount of credit that NewDay provided to her, and if she had done  which 
she was able to do at any time  I feel that its more likely than not that she would 
have struggled to sustainably repay the increased monthly payments that would then 
have become due.
As such, my provisional decision here is that Ill be upholding this complaint in Miss 
Ss favour on the basis that I feel that all new or additional provisions of credit made 
by NewDay to Miss S after the credit limit decrease of September 2019 were 
provided irresponsibly.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Miss S and NewDay the opportunity to respond 
and provide any comments or new information they might wish me to consider before I 
moved to issue a final decision. 
Neither Miss S nor NewDay provided any response. As such, I see no reason not to issue a 
final decision upholding this complaint in Miss Ss favour on the basis explained above. And I 
therefore confirm that I do uphold this complaint in Miss Ss favour on that basis accordingly.
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse to Miss Ss M branded account all interest, fees, and charges 
incurred or accrued on any portion of the account balance above £1,300 from the point of 
the credit limit increase beyond £1,300 that took place in December 2021.
NewDay must reimburse to Miss Ss D branded account all interest, fees, and charges 
incurred or accrued on any portion of the account balance above £1,500 from the point of 
the credit limit increase beyond £1,500 that took place in January 2020.
NewDay must reimburse to Miss Ss Z branded account all interest, fees, and charges 
incurred or accrued on any portion of the account balance above £900 from the point of the 
credit limit increase beyond £900 that took place in January 2020.
NewDay must reimburse all interest, fees, and charges incurred or accrued on Miss Ss Q 
and F branded accounts, that were opened in March 2020 and November 2021 
respectively.
No reimbursements are required on the G branded account.
If any of these reimbursements result in an account having a credit balance in Miss Ms 
favour, NewDay must apply 8% simple interest to that balance from the date it fell into credit. 
NewDay may then use this amended balance to clear any outstanding balances Miss S may have on her other NewDay accounts. If no balances remain outstanding to be cleared, 
NewDay must pay any credit amount remaining to Miss S.
Finally, NewDay must remove any adverse credit reporting relating to Miss Ss accounts 
from January 2020 onwards, on the provision that Miss S no longer has a balance 
outstanding on that account to repay. If Miss S does have a balance outstanding on an 
account, NewDay must make the credit file amendments after she has cleared that balance.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 June 2023.
