The complaint
Mrs B complains that NewDay Ltd had failed to assist her with a chargeback, to refund 
money for goods which never arrived.
  
What happened
Mrs B told us that she placed an order with an online retailer in July 2020. The retailer took a 
payment of £85.97 straight away, although her order was for almost twice that much. Then 
she got an email saying some of her goods were delayed.
Mrs B didnt receive any of the items forming any part of her order. She tried to get in touch 
with the store, completed online forms, and tried to cancel so she could get a refund. 
Nothing worked, so she contacted NewDay to help get her money back.
Mrs B has shown us emails from the retailer saying that £84.99 was refunded on 30 
November, but also separate emails from the same retailer, saying that no payment was 
taken because the payment was reversed on 7 September. She says that shes never 
received either of those payments, and NewDay hasnt contested this.
Mrs B said that a refund did appear on her account in October 2020, but then it disappeared 
again in November 2020.
NewDay said that Mrs B had raised a chargeback, and it had processed this for her. But this 
chargeback was unsuccessful. NewDay said that Mrs B should have raised her chargeback 
as goods not received because she had never received the item. But it was raised as 
refund not received. To make a chargeback for refund not received Mrs B would have to 
show that the retailer had promised to pay the money back, then not paid it. But here, 
NewDay said, Mrs B didnt actually have any confirmation that she was promised a refund by 
the retailer.
NewDay said that the retailer had defended this chargeback on the basis that it hadnt
received any returned goods that it needed to refund. NewDay said it only had one chance
to raise a chargeback, and as this had failed, it couldnt now help Mrs B.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. He said he could see that the
money had left Mrs Bs account for this order, and hadnt been paid back by the retailer. Our
investigator set out the efforts that Mrs B had made to complain about this to NewDay, and
to ask it to help. Mrs B had been directed to the online portal to make a chargeback request,
which she did.
Our investigator said NewDay had shown us the screens that Mrs B had to complete to 
make a chargeback, but he hadnt been shown what evidence or details Mrs B entered. He 
thought though that a refund not received chargeback was raised. He said he understood 
there wasnt much supporting evidence supplied by Mrs B on that form about the dispute, 
but he thought shed made herself clear in previous discussions.
Our investigator said NewDay had submitted a refund not received chargeback, but the
retailer disputed this, saying it hadnt received returned goods that it needed to refund. Our
investigator thought NewDay shouldve asked Mrs B for further evidence, rather than just
process an incorrect chargeback. He thought that NewDay had provided poor customer
service, and it should pay Mrs B £100 to make up for that.
Mrs B accepted this. But NewDay didnt. It set out the detail of what Mrs B had told it. It said
shed initially raised this as a transaction not recognised, then said that shed made a
purchase but cancelled it. Then she said that the retailer told her it had made a refund, but
she hadnt received this. A missing refund query was raised.
NewDay said it was after this that Mrs B raised her chargeback request, and she did so
online. NewDay said it didnt see the information Mrs B supplied for this chargeback before it
was made. Thats because it has no input into chargeback requests which are made online.
But NewDay said it could see now that Mrs B had noted this as a refund not received
request, and had provided no evidence that a refund was promised.
Our investigator didnt change his mind. He said that Mrs B had explained what had
happened over the phone, and would have assumed that this information wouldve been
taken into account in her online submission, but it wasnt. Our investigator thought that Mrs B
should have been allowed to raise a chargeback on the phone, rather than being directed to
the online portal.
NewDay again disagreed. It said that it had offered to raise the dispute for Mrs B, over the
phone, on a call on 3 October 2020. But a declaration form would have to be posted to her,
and the account would not be credited until the form was returned. And NewDay said it had
said the same thing again later to Mrs B, that she could raise the dispute over the phone but
wouldnt get the money back as quickly. So NewDay thought shed chosen to make her
chargeback claim online, because this was faster.
Because no agreement was reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
I think this was always going to be a difficult issue to resolve for Mrs B. Mrs B has 
been clear that she didnt receive the goods, and I accept what shes said about this. 
But its not clear how the retailer has treated this. I can see from the emails she had 
shared with us, that the retailer hasnt clarified whether it ever sent her any goods, or 
whether it had taken funds from her bank. It has at different points both claimed that 
it never took this money, and that shes going to get the money back.
Because of that, I dont think it was clear to Mrs B what sort of chargeback she 
should raise.
A chargeback has to fit within the rules set by the card scheme operator (whose 
symbol is on Mrs Bs card). But I wouldnt expect a card account customer, finding 
themselves in this particularly complex and unclear position, to be able to decide 
without support from their bank, what sort of chargeback should be raised.
Ive listened to the call that Mrs B had with NewDay, when it advised her to raise her 
chargeback online. And I do consider that Mrs B was given a strong steer to raise 
this chargeback herself, online. She was repeatedly advised to do so, because she would receive a refund quicker. But what she was paid wasnt a refund, it was a 
temporary credit, which was then removed by NewDay when the chargeback failed.
I think that Mrs B had explained in some detail to NewDay just how complex this 
case was. I dont think she should have been advised to raise this particular 
chargeback online, because NewDay has told us that this is an entirely automated 
process, and there would be no opportunity for it to give Mrs B any support or 
assistance with her chargeback.
Instead, I think that Mrs Bs chargeback should have been taken over the phone. She 
should have been told that, while this would unfortunately take longer, that would still 
be better for her, in this case, because it was complicated, and if she raised her 
concerns over the phone, NewDay could help with that.
So I think that NewDay gave Mrs B poor advice, and because of this, she lost out on 
her opportunity to recover her money. I think that if her chargeback had been 
processed with adequate support from NewDay, then it would have been likely to be 
successful. So I think that NewDay should pay Mrs B £85.97, which she hasnt 
recovered through her chargeback, and which I think she had a good chance of 
recovering if she had been given support.
Mrs B has also been caused a considerable amount of frustration and inconvenience
throughout this process. I think that NewDay should pay Mrs B £100, to make up for 
that.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs B said she was happy to proceed on the basis Id set out. 
But NewDay wasnt happy. It said that as part of the disputes process, customers are 
required to provide evidence supporting a claim. Although NewDay appreciated that the 
incorrect category was chosen by Mrs B, NewDay said it wouldnt have gone ahead anyway, 
due to the lack of evidence. 
NewDay said it understood that its agent may have used the incorrect words; but he had 
also fully advised Mrs B to ensure that evidence supporting her claim was attached. And 
NewDay said Mrs B didnt complete this. 
NewDay also said that given Mrs B's urgency, its agents advised her correctly about the 
quickest way to have her account credited. NewDay said Mrs B hadnt asked what category 
she should use for her chargeback, and she hadnt got back in touch to ask for help. 
NewDay said Mrs B could have got back in touch, and told NewDay that she wanted to raise 
her claim over the phone rather than online. NewDay said Mrs B had chosen not to do this, 
because of the longer timeline involved. 
NewDay said, because of this, it felt asking it to pay the disputed amount of £85.97 and 
compensation of £100 was disproportionate. It said that was because Mrs B had the 
opportunity to contact NewDay for assistance, and didnt do so.I said in my provisional decision, that I felt Mrs B was given a very strong steer on the call 
Ive listened to, that she should register her complaint online. Ive listened to this call again, 
and I still think that. I also note that Mrs B was told that doing this would mean the 
moneys back on the account within three days. But, as I set out in my provisional decision, 
Mrs B wasnt given a refund. She was given a temporary credit which was then taken back 
when her chargeback failed. It doesnt appear to me that the chargeback process was 
properly explained to Mrs B on this call. So Mrs B was both encouraged to make her claim 
online, and not given enough information to make an informed choice about that.
NewDay has also said Mrs Bs complaint would always have failed, for lack of evidence. 
Although NewDay has previously said that Mrs B didnt provide evidence that the retailer had 
promised her a refund, NewDay now seems to be suggesting that Mrs B didnt provide any 
evidence at all.
As we know, the only written evidence available to Mrs B in this case was confusing and 
unclear. Mrs B had never received the goods, and, over an extended period of time, the 
retailer has told her both that it had never taken a payment from her, and that it had already 
paid this refund. So its perhaps not surprising if Mrs B has struggled to set out what has 
happened.
NewDay also said Mrs B should have raised this chargeback claim as goods not received. I 
think thats right. But I still also think that Mrs B should have been supported to raise her 
chargeback in this way. I also think its worth noting that the evidence NewDay has shown 
us, makes me think that Mrs B had been asking for help with this transaction for some time, 
and not getting it.
If NewDay had supported Mrs B with her chargeback claim, and advised her to raise this as 
goods not received then I think its likely that this would have pointed her towards different 
evidence, which Mrs B may well have been able to provide.
So I still think that things went wrong here when Mrs B was given such a strong steer to 
raise this chargeback claim online, rather than being supported through the process by an 
agent. For that reason, I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the decision I originally 
proposed.
  
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must refund onto Mrs Bs card the sum of £85.97, and 
pay her £100 in compensation.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 November 2021
