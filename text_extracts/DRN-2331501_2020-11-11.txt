DRN-2331501
The complaint
Mrs T complains that CIGNA Europe Insurance Company SA-NV has withdrawn her Family 
Injury policy from the market.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them 
again here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
CIGNA has decided to withdraw cover under all its health insurance policies, as it 
has made the decision to exit the health insurance market. 
CIGNAs decision to do so is a commercial decision, which I cant interfere with. 
However, I can consider whether or not CIGNA has treated Mrs T fairly.
The policy terms explain that the policy is annually renewable. They also say 
that CIGNA may not offer renewal if theres an event that prevents it from 
continuing to provide the policy. 
Since CIGNA had decided to exit from the healthcare market, this event 
prevents it from continuing to provide the policy. Im therefore satified that its 
decision not to offer Mrs T renewal in 2020 was in line with its policy terms.
Whilst I can understand Mrs Ts disappointment with CIGNAs decision, I dont 
think CIGNA has treated her unfairly. Ive noted her comments that she thinks 
CIGNAs decision may be because of her age, however thats not the case as 
CIGNA has made this decision for all policyholders.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2020.
