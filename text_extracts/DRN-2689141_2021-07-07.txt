The complaint
Mr J brings this complaint on behalf of his business, which Ill call G, a limited company.
 
Mr J complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited didnt tell G about a chargeback request, gave 
him incorrect information when he queried the deduction from Gs account, and didnt 
properly warn G about the risks of Card Not Present (CNP) transactions.
 
What happened
G took payment for an order over the phone in a CNP transaction. The goods were later 
collected by a third party, and the cardholder disputed the transaction, resulting in a 
chargeback. 
WorldPay say they wrote to G to tell them about the chargeback. Mr J says no letter was 
received, and he called WorldPay to find out what was happening when he saw a debit for 
£4,999 from Gs account at the beginning of July 2020. 
WorldPay told Mr J about the chargeback and explained that they could dispute it. They told 
Mr J to send the evidence theyd need to do this, and if they could defend it, theyd credit Gs 
account. 
The £4,999 was credited back to Gs account in mid July 2020, so Mr J thought the dispute 
had been successful. When it was debited again in early August 2020, Mr J called WorldPay 
and they explained that the dispute had been unsuccessful. They told Mr J that when the 
dispute was raised the money was credited to Gs account, but because the dispute was 
unsuccessful itd been debited again. They warned him about the risks of CNP transactions 
and customers subsequently collecting their orders. 
Mr J complained to WorldPay that theyd given no warning of the chargeback, had provided 
poor customer service and incorrect information about the process when hed contacted 
them, and theyd only warned him about the risk of CNP transactions afterwards. 
WorldPay sent G a response to their complaint in August 2020. They said the chargeback 
process was followed and that warnings about CNP transactions were within the agreement 
between G and WorldPay. They offered G £100 compensation for incorrect information 
provided during calls between Mr J and WorldPay.  
Unhappy with this, Mr J bought the complaint to our service. Hed like WorldPay to refund 
the costs of preparing the order for £3,000. 
Our investigator looked into things and didnt think that WorldPay needed to take any further 
action in respect of the complaint. 
Mr J has asked for the case to be reviewed by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Chargeback
WorldPay have provided evidence that they sent a letter to G to make them aware of the 
chargeback. I dont dispute that G didnt receive this communication from WorldPay. But I 
am satisfied that it was sent to the correct address, therefore I dont think theyre responsible 
for G having not received it.  
When Mr J contacted WorldPay to discuss the debited amount, they collected the relevant 
information from him to dispute the chargeback for G. I havent seen any evidence that they 
acted unreasonably, and they tried to recover the funds for G under the chargeback process, 
which included refunding the money to G whilst the dispute was ongoing. 
The dispute was unsuccessful. The terms and conditions between WorldPay and G set out 
what happens when a chargeback dispute is unsuccessful, and Im satisfied that its clear 
that G is responsible for the cost of the chargeback. 
I find that WorldPay acted reasonably in processing the chargeback dispute, and in debiting 
the amount from Gs account when this was unsuccessful. 
Customer Service
Mr J has said that WorldPay only warned him about the risk of CNP transactions after this 
event had happened. 
Ive seen the Customer Operating Instructions, which form part of the agreement between G 
and WorldPay, and it sets out the risks of CNP transactions, including suggestions on how to 
mitigate these. So, Im satisfied that WorldPay gave G enough information to help it protect 
itself prior to this transaction occurring. 
Theres no dispute that Mr J was given incorrect information when WorldPay explained the 
chargeback process, and this led Mr J to think the chargeback dispute had been successful.
I appreciate that this was a distressing and upsetting situation for Mr J, and that his company 
has lost a large amount of money due to this transaction. Because G is a separate legal 
entity to Mr J, I can only make an award for inconvenience experienced by the company, 
and not by Mr J personally. 
G has been inconvenienced in the time that Mr J has spent away from his usual running of 
the business, and the incorrect information provided by WorldPay meant that Mr J had to 
make further phone calls to understand what had happened. So, I find that WorldPay should 
compensate G for this, and that the £100 theyve offered is a fair reflection of the 
inconvenience caused to the business.
 My final decision
WorldPay has already made an offer to pay £100 to settle the complaint and, for the reasons 
explained above, I find this offer is fair in all the circumstances. 
My final decision is that I require WorldPay (UK) Limited to pay G £100 compensation.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask G to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 August 2021.
