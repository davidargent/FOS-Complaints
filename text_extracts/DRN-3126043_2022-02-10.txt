The complaint
B complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) handled a chargeback 
request incorrectly.
B is a charity and the complaint has been brought by one of its representatives on its 
behalf.
What happened
In July 2020 B received a donation through PayPal. It was a larger sum that it was used to 
receiving so it contacted the sender to check that theyd donated the correct amount. It 
received a reply to tell it to take the money out and use it.
In October 2020 PayPal contacted B to tell it the donor had disputed the payment because it 
hadnt been authorised. Its bank had raised a chargeback request. PayPal asked B to 
provide any evidence and B sent it the exchange of emails.
Shortly afterwards, PayPal contacted B to say the chargeback request had been successful 
and the donation had been removed from Bs account which left it with a negative balance. 
PayPal also charged an administration fee of £14.
B says it doesnt have the money to repay the sum. PayPal passed the debt to a debt 
collection agency in December 2020.
PayPal said B had chosen to accept the donation and withdrew it. As a donation, it was not 
eligible for PayPals protection programme and B needs to repay it.
Our investigator thought that PayPal should have provided a better service. In particular it 
should have provided clearer communication to B and it should have passed on the 
evidence B provided to its bank who was responsible for defending the chargeback claim. 
But the investigator didnt think the evidence would have changed the overall outcome. In 
the circumstances, she thought PayPal should pay B £100 for the inconvenience the poor 
service caused.
PayPal credited Bs PayPal account with £100.
But B didnt agree. It said the £100 shouldnt have been credited to its PayPal account and 
asked for its complaint to be passed to an ombudsman for review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PalPals terms and conditions make it reasonably clear that it does not offer seller protection 
for donations. So I dont find PayPal is obliged to repay the amount B has lost.
That leaves me to decide if PayPal treated B fairly when the donor made a chargeback 
request.
If a donor of B wants to raise a chargeback, they will raise it with their own bank directly. 
Their bank will then contact PayPals bank and ask whether or not it wishes to defend the 
chargeback. PayPals bank will ask PayPal to send it any evidence to use as a defence, and 
it will then send this onto the donors bank.
As PayPal is a payment processor, its role is not to defend a chargeback request. Its bank is 
responsible for this. PayPals role is to provide its bank with evidence from its customer (B) 
so it can put forward a defence.
B provided PayPal with copies of its emails to the donor, but PayPal decided this didnt 
amount to the compelling evidence that would be required to successfully defend a 
chargeback; so it didnt pass this to its bank.
I dont think PayPal acted fairly here. Its role was to ask B for any information it wanted to 
submit to defend the chargeback request. Its role wasnt to decide if that information would 
be enough to defend the chargeback  that was the decision for its bank to make. So I think 
it should have passed the evidence on.
Ive thought carefully about what difference this would have made. B emailed the donor to 
check that they meant to donate the amount they did. And it received a reply telling it to take 
the money out of the PayPal account and spend it. This suggested to B that the donation 
was genuine. But the name of the donor and the name associated with the email address 
didnt match. And for a chargeback to be successfully defended in these circumstances, 
PayPals bank would have to provide clear evidence to show that the donor authorised the 
card transaction. Unfortunately, I dont think the emails provide this evidence. 
So, whilst I think PayPal made a mistake, I dont think it would have made a difference to the 
overall outcome here  I think the chargeback would still have been successful.
I agree with out investigator that PayPal could have provided better communication with B to 
have made the chargeback process clearer and to have managed Bs expectations of the 
outcome.
For its poor communication and its failure to pass the emails onto its bank, I agree with our 
investigator that £100 is fair compensation.
I understand PayPal has already credited Bs PayPal account with £100. But as this is a 
payment to compensate B for the inconvenience caused, it should be paid directly to it, and 
not used to reduce the debt it owes. 
PayPal communicated with B reasonably clearly once the donation was debited to its 
account and I dont think it acted unfairly in passing the account to a debt collection agency.
I am not unsympathetic to what happened to B. And I am sorry for the position in which it 
finds itself when donations are so important to fulfil the needs of its charity. But my role is to 
consider whether PayPal acted fairly and reasonably. And, for the reasons Ive explained, 
I cant ask it to reverse the chargeback.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should remove the £100 it 
credited to Bs PayPal account. It should pay £100 directly to B, and not use it to reduce the debt B owes, unless B instructs it otherwise.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask B to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 March 2022.
