K821x#15complaint
Mr M has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr M says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny.
background
We now know that Mr M took out some 33 loans from Sunny between  October 2014 and 
June 2017. One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought it should 
be upheld from the point of loan 6 onwards.  Sunny  originally didnt think it had done  anything 
wrong, but it later offered  to settle the complaint  from the point of loan 20 onwards. This 
wasnt accepted  by Mr M so the complaint has come to me for an ombudsmans final 
decision. 
Given Sunny  accepts it mis-sold from the point  of loan 20 onwards, Ive enclosed  a summary 
of Mr Ms borrowing  up to that point. It can be found  in the appendix at the end. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Ms 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr M could  repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN33331662There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay the loans;  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr M could  
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr M. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending  history with 
a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Bearing in mind what Ive said above  about the length of the lending relationship, I think the 
checks which Sunny most likely carried out appear to have been proportionate  for loans 1  
4. For loan 5, I can see how more in-depth  checks  may have been  useful  but I dont actually 
think this would have  altered Sunnys lending decision  or made the loan seem obviously 
unsustainable. In arriving at that view,  Ive taken into account  that there was a significant gap 
between loans 1 and 2 which represented a break  in the lending  chain. And overall, I think 
the level of checks,  together with the income  and expenditure details provided  by Mr M, 
would have made the loans appear  affordable for him up to the point of loan 5. So I dont 
uphold this part of Mr Ms complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan 6 onwards in this case  things would have  looked  
different and therefore required  a more thorough and responsible approach. For loan 6, for 
example, Sunny ought to have been aware  this was applied for immediately after paying  off 
loans 3, 4 and 5 which had all been  outstanding  together  for a while.  Loan  6 was also for the 
highest amount  to date in the chain of lending and it was Mr Ms fifth such loan with Sunny in 
just 2 months. I think any reasonable analysis of his situation would have therefore shown he 
didnt seem to be making any inroads into reducing his need to borrow  from Sunny.
I also think by this point  more comprehensive financial checks would have revealed Mr Ms 
exposure to other short-term lenders in the recent past, which would have helped show the 
financial problems hed been having.  Theres no evidence Sunny altered its approach at the 
point of loan 6 to look more thoroughly at Mr Ms financial situation. So I think  it was 
irresponsible to lend to Mr M at the point of loan 6 onwards.
In addition to the above,  from the point of loan 7 onwards,  there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident  in my view. Loan  7 directly followed loan 6 being repaid 
and then a number of further loans followed very quickly thereafter, whilst previous loans 
remained outstanding.  So there  was an obvious  dependency on high-interest,  short-term 
lending evidenced  by this.
Im therefore  also upholding Mr Ms complaint in respect of loans 7 - 33 as well. Sunny 
repeatedly lent to Mr M in an unsustainable manner because:
Ref: DRN33331663 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  6 - 33;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges on these from 
the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 6 from Mr Ms credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 -33 should be completely 
removed from Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr M a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited 
should put things right for Mr M as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 March  2020.
