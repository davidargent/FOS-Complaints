The complaint
Mr F complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA wont refund him money he says he lost to 
an investment scam.
What happened
The detailed background to this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide 
a brief overview of some of the key events here.
In May 2020 Mr F made three payments (totalling Â£70,000) towards what he says was an 
investment scam. The payments were made through his PayPal account using his debit card 
from his own bank that Ill refer to as C (hed added these card details as a funding source).
Mr F reported these transactions to PayPal as unauthorised. PayPal said there was no 
evidence of third-party access to his account and so they declined to offer him a refund. Mr F 
complained to our service seeking reimbursement. Im also aware of a separate complaint 
made against C in which I issued a final decision that didnt uphold the complaint. 
Mr F has alleged that PayPal didnt do enough to protect him with regard to the payments 
that he said went to a scam. He later said that he only reported the payments as 
unauthorised because that was the only option available to him under PayPals systems. 
Our Investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. In summary she 
didnt think PayPal had done anything wrong. Mr F disagrees and has asked for an 
Ombudsman to review his complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our Investigator and for similar reasons. 
I know this will be disappointing for Mr F, so Ill explain why. 
Despite the way in which this was initially reported to PayPal  it doesnt seem to be in 
dispute that Mr F authorised these transactions. The basis of his argument is that he feels 
PayPal ought to have intervened in the payments to protect him from losing money to what 
he says was a scam investment.
PayPals role in these payments was to charge the funds to the card Mr F had linked to his 
account and to pass this on to the merchant involved. There arent the same obligations on 
PayPal as there would be on the card issuer. Ive considered PayPals obligations here and 
it would be for the card issuer who were releasing the payments to intervene if there was a 
reason for them to do so. I cant comment on the actions of C in this decision, and Mr F is 
already aware of my decision and the reasons for it on that case.
I dont think PayPal have done anything wrong in the circumstances of this complaint  they 
processed the payments as requested. I dont think there was any reason for them to 
intervene when the payments were made, and I dont think there were any options available 
to them that could have assisted Mr F to recover any of his funds. Despite my natural 
sympathy for Mr F losing the money he did, there isnt any reasonable basis upon which I 
can ask PayPal to do anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2022.
