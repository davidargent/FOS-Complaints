The complaint
Ms P complains NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (NewDay) gave her unaffordable credit limits.
What happened
Ms P applied for a NewDay credit card, branded as Marbles.
NewDay gave Ms P an initial £300 credit limit. Five months later, NewDay increased the 
credit limit to £1,550, then £2,300 then a final increase to £3,300.
Five months after the last Marbles credit limit increase Ms P was accepted for an Aqua card, 
also from NewDay. This card was agreed with an initial credit limit of £250. Six months later 
the limit was increased to £1,250, then £2,500, and a final increase to £3,750.
Ms P complained to NewDay. Ms P said shed had to enter a debt management plan (DMP). 
Ms P said shed told NewDay her income was £7,200 a year and it should never have given 
her such large credit limits.
Ms P felt if NewDay had given her smaller limits, shed never have entered a DMP. Ms P 
also said her credit file now had adverse information on it and she was struggling to get 
credit anywhere else. Ms P asked NewDay to refund all the interest and late fees, and 8% 
interest on those refunds.
NewDay responded to Ms P and didnt think it had done anything wrong. NewDay said it 
had, among other checks, checked with credit reference agencies and looked at how Ms P 
had handled her NewDay accounts.
NewDay said Ms P had run her accounts well. NewDay said the credit limit increases were 
carried out correctly and checks were done to ensure they were affordable.
Unhappy with this answer, Ms P brought her complaint to this service.
An adjudicator looked into things and thought Ms Ps complaint should be upheld. The 
adjudicator thought the last credit limit increase on the Marbles card, to £3,300, was 
unaffordable.
The adjudicator thought NewDay should have asked for proof of Ms Ps income and 
expenditure. Ms P sent the adjudicator her bank statements, and from the income and 
expenditure on them, the adjudicator felt Ms P couldnt afford the highest limit on her 
Marbles card.
The adjudicator thought NewDay should refund any interest and charges on the Marbles 
card, for balances above £2,300 (the last, affordable, credit limit increase). And since the last 
Marbles increase was unaffordable the adjudicator thought all the Aqua lending was 
unaffordable.
So, the adjudicator thought NewDay should refund all the interest and charges on the Aqua 
account too. The adjudicator also thought NewDay should remove all the adverse credit file 
data recorded after the last Marbles increase.
NewDay didnt agree. NewDay said Ms P had managed her accounts well, her debt was low, 
there were no charges or cash withdrawals, and the repayments were higher than the 
minimum required.
NewDay asked for an ombudsman to decide things.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres little dispute about Ms Ps income. NewDays said Ms P declared her income as 
£6,500 per year for the Marbles card and £7,200 per year for the Aqua card.
NewDays said it doesnt ask for proof of income and expenditure when it first agrees 
lending. I dont believe NewDay needed to request proof of income and expenditure for the 
initial Marbles application, but this is because the limit was low, it was £300.
But for the future increases, I think NewDay should have been asking for proof of income 
and expenditure. Ive considered what the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) says, to 
decide where I think it would have been fair to ask for proof of income and expenditure.
CONC says, in 5.2A.4(3), income checks should be carried out where NewDay is 
significantly increasing the credit limit. I think increases of over £800 are, in Ms Ps individual 
circumstances, significant.
I think the increases are significant because of what NewDay knew about Ms Ps income, it 
was relatively low compared to the increases agreed.
CONC says, in 5.2A.27(2), NewDay must assume Ms P draws down the entire available 
balance at the earliest opportunity and repays by equal instalments over a reasonable 
period. This would mean NewDay should assume Ms P would spend £3,300 (or the 
remainder available on the card) the moment it increased her credit limit.
For someone NewDay knew was earning just over £7,000 per year, this is a lot to lend 
immediately. I think NewDay, at the point it increased Ms Ps Marbles limit to £3,300, should 
have asked for bank statements, to check her income and outgoings.
Had NewDay done this, it should have been clear Ms P wasnt in a position to handle a 
credit limit this high. Ms Ps income was a little over £1,100 per month, including benefits, 
and her priority bills totalled more than half her income.
Ms P has two children, and the priority bills dont include food, clothing, travel to work or any 
other leisure spending. I dont think Ms P would have been in a position to make payments, 
over a reasonable time, to pay off borrowing of £3,300.
Like the adjudicator, I think NewDay should have stopped increasing Ms Ps Marbles limit 
when it reached £2,300. And I think all the lending on the Aqua card was unaffordable, 
because of the existing limit on the Marbles card.
Putting things rightBecause I think NewDay should have stopped increasing Ms Ps credit limit when it reached 
£2,300, I think it should refund all the interest and charges on Ms Ps Marbles card for 
borrowing above £2,300.
Looking at Ms Ps Marbles statements, it looks like she never borrowed much more than 
£800. Its likely theres no refund due on Ms Ps Marbles card.
I think all the borrowing on the Aqua card was unaffordable, so all the interest and charges 
for this card should be refunded.
The final increase on the Marbles card was March 2020. I think NewDay should remove any 
adverse data, on both the Marbles and Aqua accounts, from March 2020. This adverse data 
includes any defaults NewDay may have applied.
My final decision
My final decision is I uphold this complaint. NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua must:
refund all the interest and charges applied to any balances over £2,300 to Ms Ps 
Marbles card
refund all the interest and charges applied to Ms Ps Aqua card
if either of these refunds result in a credit balance owing to Ms P, NewDay should 
pay this to Ms P including 8% simple interest per year*
if Ms P still has a balance owing on either card, NewDay should agree an affordable 
repayment plan for the outstanding balance
remove any adverse data on Ms Ps credit file in respect of her Marbles card after 
March 2020
remove any adverse data on Ms Ps credit file in respect of her Aqua card after 
March 2020
*HM Revenue & Customs may require NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. If it 
does, it must give Ms P a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if she asks 
for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 November 2022.
