The complaint
S, a limited company, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) gave it 
conflicting information about the number of accounts it could view online. 
S wants to be able to view all of it accounts without having to pay a monthly fee to NatWest. 
What happened
S is a business banking customer of NatWest. After S opened some new client accounts it 
couldnt see all of them when using the Online Banking platform. This meant S, through its 
director Mr G, had to contact NatWest each time it wanted to manage the accounts, 
including making any payments.
Mr G was also unhappy that NatWest told him there was a £10,000 cap on the amount of 
money that S could send when making a payment. S said that the caps on the number of 
accounts and payments didnt appear in NatWests terms of business.
NatWest has told S that to view all its accounts online, it would have to register for its 
Bankline service for a monthly fee.
Mr G is unhappy that NatWest wants to charge S for services that should be free with its 
business account.
The investigator recommended that Ss complaint be upheld. He didnt think NatWest had 
explained the cap on viewing accounts when S opened the additional accounts. This meant 
S had to speak with NatWest about making a payment from one of the accounts. At this 
point, NatWest told S that it couldnt make payments over £10,000. The investigator thought 
this was contrary to NatWests terms and conditions which say that S can make payments of 
up to £50,000 from its business accounts. The investigator thought that NatWest could have 
better supported S by agreeing the payment request given the unusual circumstances.  To 
put things right, the investigator recommended that NatWest pay S £100.
NatWest agreed to pay S £100 but S wasnt happy. Mr G told the investigator that NatWest 
had lied about the caps. He was unhappy that NatWest was forcing S to pay for the Bankline 
service. Mr G said that he didnt want the compensation payment and asked that NatWest 
give it to charity. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G says that someone from NatWest told him the cap on viewing Ss accounts online was 
100 and that nowhere does it say there is a cap of 50 accounts. I can understand this was 
confusing and can see why Mr G might not trust what NatWest has told him about the 50 
accounts cap but Im satisfied that the information is correct.
From carrying out a search online, I have found a section on NatWests website which says 
that Online Banking is available to NatWest business customers. You can add up to 50 
business accounts in Online Banking. Another section says that if youre a NatWest 
customer, you can register using Online Banking and that once registered its easy toadd 
up to 50 accounts
There is also a section of NatWests website that explains the difference between Online 
Banking and Bankline. This says that Online Banking is suitable for customers who manage 
a lower volume or value of payments. And that with Bankline, its possible to view all 
accounts on one profile. 
The payment limits for NatWest business customers are also set out on its website. It says 
that payments via telephone banking are limited to £10,000. I understand that this is for both 
personal and business customers. Payments made by businesses using Online Banking are 
capped at £50,000. The website also says that if youre a business customer who regularly 
makes payments above £50,000 then Bankline may be better suited to your needs.
Although Mr G wants to view all of Ss bank accounts, I cant reasonably require NatWest to 
allow S to view more than 50 accounts using Online Banking. It would be for S to decide 
whether to take up NatWests suggestion of switching to Bankline. I dont find - as Mr G 
suggests  that NatWest is somehow trying to commit fraud by suggesting that S pay for 
Bankline. And as the limit for making payments via telephone banking is £10,000, I cant 
require NatWest to permanently change this for S.
I agree with the investigator that it wouldve been better if NatWest had explained the Online 
Banking limitations when S opened more accounts. As it wasnt then possible to use Online 
Banking to make payments from the accounts, it was less than satisfactory for S to be told 
there was a £10,000 limit on payments made by telephone. For this failing, I consider the 
investigators suggestion of £100 compensation is fair. It reflects the inconvenience caused 
to S when Mr G had to speak to NatWest  which I assume diverted time away from running 
the business of S.
NatWest says that it can only pay the money to S and not direct to charity. It would be for S 
to decide what to do with the payment if Mr G accepts my decision on Ss behalf. Im sorry if 
this is unsatisfactory for S.
Putting things right
National Westminster Bank Plc should pay S £100. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I require National 
Westminster Bank Plc to pay S £100.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask S to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 July 2022.
