K820x#14complaint
Mr T says Bank of Scotland  plc mis-sold  him a payment  protection insurance (PPI) policy.  
background
Mr T bought  the policy in 1999 at the same time as taking out a credit card. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr T disagreed with the adjudicators opinion so 
the complaint  has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Ts case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Ts complaint  because:
 I think Bank of Scotland made Mr T aware that the PPI was optional and that he chose  
to take it. I say this because he signed the PPI section of the credit card application 
form to confirm  that he wanted the cover.
 Bank of Scotland didnt recommend the PPI to Mr T so it didnt have to check if it was 
suitable for him. It was for Mr T to decide whether the PPI was suitable for his needs.
 Its possible the information Bank of Scotland gave Mr T about the PPI wasnt as clear 
as it should have been. But its unlikely  Mr T would  have been  affected by any of the 
main things  the policy didnt cover. And the policy was competitively priced and had a 
reasonable benefit. So I dont  think better  information wouldve stopped him buying it. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 July 2019.
