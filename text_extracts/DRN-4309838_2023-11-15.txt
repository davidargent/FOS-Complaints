The complaint
Mr B, a sole trader, is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt update 
his business address when he asked them to, which he feels led to the unfair defaulting of 
his Bounce Back Loan (BBL).
What happened
In May 2020, Mr B successfully applied to NatWest for a BBL. Mr B missed several 
payments on the loan, and in April 2022 NatWest began attempting to contact Mr B to 
discuss the BBL arrears with him.
In June 2022, Mr B spoke with NatWest about the account arrears. At that time, Mr B told 
NatWest that his business was no longer trading and asked them to update the address on 
his BBL to his personal address so that he would receive the letters NatWest were sending.
But NatWest didnt update the address as Mr B had requested, and this meant that Mr B 
continued to not receive BBL letters from NatWest  because they continued to be sent to an 
incorrect address. Mr B wasnt happy about this, and he felt the non-receipt of account 
letters had directly led to NatWest defaulting his BBL for non-payment, which NatWest did 
four months after his phone call with them. And Mr B also wasnt happy that NatWest had 
passed his BBL debt to a debt recovery agency (DRA). So, he raised a complaint.
NatWest responded to Mr B but didnt feel theyd done anything wrong in how theyd 
administered the loan. And NatWest noted that when Mr B has asked them to change the 
address on the phone call in June 2022, it had been explained to him at that time that he 
would need to either visit a branch or request a change of address via email  neither of 
which Mr B had subsequently done. Mr B wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he 
referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel NatWest had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation and so didnt uphold the complaint. Mr B 
remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In his ongoing correspondence with this service, Mr B has raised several further points of 
complaint, beyond those that Ive described in the preceding section. However, this service 
can only consider points of complaint that have already been raised as complaints with the 
respondent business, such that the business has had the opportunity to consider and 
respond to those points.
This means that I wont be able to consider any of the further points of complaint that Mr B 
has raised at this time  because these further points of complaint havent yet been raised 
with NatWest directly. As such, if Mr B still wishes to pursue these further points of 
complaint, I can only refer him to NatWest to raise these further points of complaint with 
them, so that they have the opportunity to formally consider and respond to them.
Mr B has explained that hes unhappy that NatWest didnt update his address when he 
asked them to in June 2022. And he feels that NatWests failure to update his address has 
directly contributed to the defaulting of his BBL for non-payment because he wasnt receiving 
letters from NatWest about the account.
It was Mr Bs responsibility as the BBL account holder to have monitored the account and to 
have been aware of whether any monthly payments had been missed. And Mr Bs 
responsibility to do this wasnt in any way affected by whether he was or wasnt receiving 
letters from NatWest. 
As such, if Mr B wasnt receiving letters from NatWest, it would be expected both that Mr B 
would monitor his account by the other channels available to him, such as online or by 
telephone, and that he would proactively contact NatWest to arrange for the account letters 
to be correctly addressed to him.
But Mr B doesnt appear to have done either of these things. And I say this because it was 
NatWest who appear to have initiated contact between Mr B and themselves in April 2022, 
when they began trying to contact Mr B to discuss the several missed payments on the loan 
and resultant arrears that were present on Mr Bs BBL at that time.
This means that when Mr B spoke with NatWest in June 2022, his BBL was already in a 
position of significant arrears. And having been made aware of the arrears present on the 
BBL at that time, Mr B subsequently made no attempt to either clear those arrears in full or 
arrange a repayment plan with NatWest to clear the arrears in instalments.
Accordingly, Im satisfied that, because of the inaction of Mr B in this regard, his BBL would 
most likely have been fairly defaulted by NatWest for non-payment of account arrears 
regardless of whether NatWest had updated the address on his account in June 2022 or not.
Importantly, having listened to the telephone call between Mr B and NatWest in June 2022, 
on which Mr B requested the change of address, its clear that Mr B was told by NatWest 
that his address couldnt be updated over the phone and that Mr B would need to either visit 
a NatWest branch or send a scanned signed letter via email. And on the call, Mr B asks 
NatWests agent to pause while he finds a pen and paper to take the email address needed. 
Im therefore satisfied that Mr B did in all likelihood understand the information about the 
change of address hed been given. 
Accordingly, I feel that if Mr B wasnt receiving letters from NatWest prior to the June 2022 
phone call that this was because Mr B hadnt met his responsibilities to have contacted 
NatWest and informed them of his change of address prior to that call. And if Mr B continued 
to not receive letters from NatWest after the June 2022 phone call, I feel this was because 
Mr B didnt take the actions that he had been clearly informed by NatWest that he would 
need to take to arrange the updating of his address.
Additionally, NatWest have demonstrated to my satisfaction that they sent BBL arrears 
correspondence to Mr B via several channels, and not just by posted letter. And these 
channels include by email and text message to the email address and telephone number 
that Mr B has provided to this service as being his own. 
I therefore feel that its more likely than not that Mr B would have received these emails and 
text messages from NatWest, even if he wasnt receiving the letters NatWest were sending. 
And, as explained previously, even if Mr B wasnt receiving any correspondence of any kind from NatWest, it remained his responsibility as the BBL account holder to have monitored 
the BBL and been aware of the ongoing status of the account.
Ultimately, Mr B didnt meet his contractual payment obligations for the BBL, to which he 
agreed when he accepted the loan. And as per the above, I dont feel it can reasonably or 
fairly be said that this was because of any action or inaction by NatWest, as Mr B contends.
Because of this, I feel that it was fair that NatWest undertook the arrears collections and 
recoveries process that they did, which ultimately led to the defaulting of Mr Bs BBL by 
NatWest and NatWests decision to no longer provide banking services to Mr B  which was 
a commercial decision I feel that NatWest were entitled to make and which Im satisfied they 
gave fair notice of to Mr B, in line with the terms of their accounts.
Finally, Mr B is unhappy that, having defaulted his BBL, NatWest passed his debt to a DRA. 
But the transferral of debt to a DRA is a common practice in such circumstances, and one 
which is permitted by the terms of the BBL which Mr B consented to when he accepted the 
loan. And NatWest didnt need any further consent from Mr B, beyond his acceptance of the 
BBL agreement, to fairly transfer the defaulted debt to a DRA as they did.
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have done anything wrong or unfair here. 
And it follows from this that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take 
any further or alternative action.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mr B was wanting, but I trust that hell understand, given 
all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 December 2023.
