The complaint
Ms P complains that Bank of Scotland plc has rejected the claim that shes made under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Her complaint is being dealt with by a 
representative on her behalf.
What happened
Ms P entered into an agreement to buy a timeshare in February 1986 and she used a loan 
agreement with Bank of Scotland to pay for it. She says that the loan was for Â£8,970. Bank 
of Scotland notified Ms P in June 1996 that the loan had been repaid. 
Ms Ps representative made a claim to Bank of Scotland in August 2019 under section 75 
and said that the timeshare had been misrepresented to Ms P. Bank of Scotland has said 
that Ms P brought her complaint too late. Ms P wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He said that Ms Ps 
claim was more than likely time barred under the Limitation Act 1980 so he thought that 
Bank of Scotlands decision not to look into her claim was fair.
Ms Ps representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It said that a full substantive response to our investigators recommendations 
would be provided when it had received instructions from Ms P but I cant see that it has 
provided any further information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that she 
had cause for complaint;
Ms Ps complaint is that Bank of Scotland turned down her section 75 claim;
Ms P has referred her complaint to this service within six years of the event that shes 
complained about but I need to consider whether Bank of Scotland should have 
considered her claims or whether they were time barred under the Limitation Act;
Ms Ps section 75 claim to Bank of Scotland is that the timeshare was 
misrepresented to her and that she wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to her;
in this decision Im not determining the outcome of that claim as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Bank of Scotlands response to 
her claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Bank of Scotland would be 
expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Ms P could have made a claim to the timeshare company or Bank of 
Scotland about the misrepresentations that induced her into buying the timeshare 
when she entered into the agreement to buy the timeshare  which was in February 
1986  as that was when she entered into an agreement based on the 
misrepresentations of the timeshare company and suffered a loss as she entered into 
the loan agreement with Bank of Scotland to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or Bank of 
Scotland  but she didnt make a claim to Bank of Scotland until August 2019, which 
was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Bank of Scotland says that section 75 doesnt apply to Ms Ps claim  I dont consider 
that to be correct and I consider that it should have assessed her claim under section 
75  so I cant say that it acted fairly in response to Ms Ps claim, but I consider that it 
wouldnt have upheld the claim if it had properly considered it as it would have said 
that the claim wasnt made within the period set out in the Limitation Act; and
I sympathise with Ms P for the issues that shes had with her timeshare and the 
difficulties that shes described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require Bank of Scotland to refund to her any of the 
money that she paid under the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ps complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 November 2021.
