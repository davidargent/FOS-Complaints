* Maximum  monthly  repayment over the term of overlapping loans  3 and 4
** Debt Collection Agency
Mr W says Lending Stream failed to carry out effective affordability checks  and did not 
identify that hed become stuck in a cycle of borrowing.
Lending Stream says it asked Mr W about his income and expenditure for each loan and 
checked his credit file. It says that none  of the information indicated the loans were 
unaffordable. It offered to set up a repayment plan for the outstanding amount on loan 4.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She said that, by loan 4, 
proportionate checks would most  likely have shown  that Mr W was having problems 
managing his money. He recommended that interest and charges should be refunded  on 
loan 4 (plus 8% statutory  interest)  and that any negative information about the loan should 
be removed from Mr Ws credit file.
Neither party responded to the adjudicators view.
my provisional findings
I issued my provisional decision to Mr W and to Lending Stream  on 16 December 2019. I 
summarise my findings:
I was satisfied that Lending Stream did proportionate checks for loan 1 which  showed  
the repayments were  affordable;
For loan 2, Lending Streams credit  check showed Mr W had two defaults on his 
credit file, the latest of which was in the previous three  months;
As a result, I considered Lending  Stream should  have carried out a full financial 
review before it approved loan 2. I couldnt  see it had done this, so I had a look at 
what such a review  would  have found:
oMr W had defaulted on four accounts;
oHis credit  file showed he had two ongoing  debt management plans;
oMr W had four other outstanding short-term loans when he applied  for loan 2.
I considered there were clear indications that Mr W was having trouble managing his 
money and he was unlikely to be able to sustainably repay loan 2. So I didnt think  
loan 2 should have been approved;
Ref: DRN20874272A full review for loan 3 would  have shown that Mr Ws financial circumstances were 
unchanged from loan 2 and he still had at least four outstanding  short-term  loans. So 
I considered it was irresponsible for Lending  Stream to have approved loan 3;
When Mr W applied  for loan 4, loan 3 was outstanding and hed missed  his first 
repayment on it. Because of this, the credit check and the number of loans, I still 
considered a proportionate check should have been a full review. This is likely  to 
have shown Mr W had taken five more short-term loans in the previous three weeks.  
So I couldnt  conclude  Lending Stream acted responsibly by approving loan 4.
My provisional decision was that Lending Stream should refund interest and charges  on 
loans 2 to 4 (plus  8% statutory interest) and remove negative information from his credit file.
Both Lending Stream and Mr W accepted  my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both Lending Stream  and Mr W accepted my provisional decision, I see no reason  to 
depart from it.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ws complaint. Gain Credit  LLC (trading as Lending 
Stream) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr W paid on loans 2 to 4;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loans 3 and 4, apply the refund to 
reduce any capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr W; 
Arrange to repay any portion  of the sum due to the third party that is made  up of 
interest and charges   including any added by the third party;
Pay Mr W interest and charges he has already paid to the third party  plus 8% interest 
simple per annum  on each amount from the date of payment to the settlement date;
Remove any negative  information about loans 2 to 4 from Mr Ws credit  file;
Request the third party to remove  adverse information it may have recorded about  
loan 3, once it has been repaid.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If 
Lending Stream intends to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it 
must do so after deducting  the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 February  2020.
