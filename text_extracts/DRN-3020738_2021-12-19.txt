The complaint
Mr G complains that Number One Police Credit Union Limited (T/A No 1 CopperPot Credit 
Union) declined his application for a short term loan because he now lives abroad. Hes 
unhappy that Number One Police Credit Union Limited (T/A No 1 CopperPot Credit Union) 
no longer lends to members who are non-UK residents.
What happened
Mr G is a longstanding member of Number One Police Credit Union Limited (T/A No 1 
CopperPot Credit Union), hereafter referred to as CopperPot. Whilst he used to be a UK 
resident, he moved overseas around 11 years ago.
On 13 April 2021, Mr G said he contacted CopperPot over the telephone to apply for a short 
term loan. He was informed during this telephone call that his loan would be processed 
within two days. However, on 16 April 2021, CopperPot explained to Mr G that he wasnt 
eligible for a loan because he is a non-UK resident.
Mr G was unhappy with CopperPots decision to decline to lend to him and complained. He 
said CopperPot was aware that he wasnt a UK resident on 13 April, when he applied for the 
loan. And he said it had offered to lend him funds knowing he was living overseas. 
In its final response to Mr Gs complaint, CopperPot explained that it had changed its policy 
on lending post Brexit, which had led to it taking a decision not to lend to non UK residents 
due to complex and cost prohibitive financial regulations and licence requirements within EU 
member states. It stated that its decision not to lend to Mr G was in line with its new lending 
policy. But it accepted it hadnt changed its website to show the impact of its new lending 
policy on its overseas members. 
CopperPot also acknowledged that Mr G had been given incorrect information about his 
eligibility to borrow. It apologised for that and explained that additional training had been 
provided to the staff member whod spoken to Mr G on 13 April. To put matters right, 
CopperPot offered Mr G £40 compensation for the trouble and upset hed experienced in 
receiving incorrect information. It also offered to pay him £10 for any potential loss in 
dividend that he might suffer as a result of withdrawing funds from his savings account.
Being dissatisfied with how CopperPot had offered to resolve his complaint, Mr G referred it 
to our service. Our investigator empathised with Mr G but they didnt recommend upholding 
this complaint. They thought the compensation Mr G had been offered fairly reflected the 
trouble and upset hed have experienced as a result of the incorrect information hed been 
given. And they explained that our service cant interfere with a business decision not to lend 
to overseas members. So, they didnt think that CopperPot had done anything wrong or 
needed to do anything more here. But Mr G disagreed and asked for the matter to be 
referred to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Whilst I sympathise with Mr Gs situation, Ive reached the same conclusion as the 
investigator for broadly the same reasons. I understand that Mr G will be disappointed with 
my conclusions, so Ill explain why I dont uphold this complaint.
I can see that the Mr G has provided evidence together with very detailed submissions about 
this complaint. I want to assure him Ive read and considered everything that both he and 
CopperPot have sent when reaching my decision. I havent referred to all the points Mr G 
has raised as Ive focused on what I feel are the key issues of this case. I hope he wont take 
that as a discourtesy; my approach reflects the informal nature of our service. 
When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time. 
Im sorry to hear about the difficulties Mr G experienced here. Hes told our service hes 
been reliant on CopperPot to finance his borrowing needs while living abroad. So, I can 
understand how the change in policy may have been met with frustration and surprise by 
him.  Its also clear that Mr G has suffered some upset and inconvenience in dealing with 
CopperPot and for that Im sorry. However, the issue here is whether CopperPot acted 
unfairly in deciding not to lend to Mr G given his residency overseas. 
Like our investigator, Im satisfied that CopperPot had the right not to lend money to Mr G 
given its change in policy on lending to its members. I say this because Mr G isnt a UK 
resident and CopperPot made a decision to change its lending policy in around February 
2021 insofar as it no longer lends to non-UK residents for the reasons it outlined in its final 
response letter to Mr G.
I appreciate this is frustrating and inconvenient to Mr G. But, as a business, CopperPot is 
entitled to make commercial decisions about who it lends money to. Were not the regulator 
of banks. So, we cant tell a business to change its policy, or to adopt the changes that Mr G 
might like. 
Based on the evidence Ive seen, Im satisfied that CopperPot declined to lend to Mr G 
based on the fact that he lives overseas. Im persuaded that, in reaching a decision about Mr 
Gs loan application, CopperPot followed its new lending policy and this is why it wasnt able 
to offer him the loan he wanted. This isnt a case of CopperPot discriminating against Mr G 
as an individual member. And I think CopperPot provided a very detailed explanation of why 
it had decided not to lend to Mr G, and other non-UK residents, in its final response to this 
complaint. 
CopperPot has accepted that Mr G experienced poor service as a result of being given 
incorrect information about his loan application on 13 April 2021. I think it was reasonable for 
Mr G to expect a staff member to be aware of the new lending policy and its impact on 
overseas members. This would have avoided the confusion, and false expectation, that the 
incorrect advice created. 
To recognise the poor service Mr G received, CopperPot has offered Mr G £40 
compensation. It also offered him £10 in potential loss in dividends he may suffer as a result 
of withdrawing funds from his savings account. 
Like our investigator, Im satisfied the sums offered to Mr G are a reasonable amount that 
fairly recognises the impact this all would have had. Its in line with what I would have 
suggested had no offer been made, and its consistent with our approach in similar scenarios. It isn't clear whether CopperPot paid Mr G the amount it offered. If it hasnt 
already done so, CopperPot should make payment of the £50 it offered to resolve this 
complaint to Mr G. 
CopperPot says that it also took additional measures, which included amending its website 
to include reference to the fact that loans can only be offered to UK residents and providing 
additional training to its staff member who gave incorrect advice. I think that was sensible. 
And, having seen CopperPots website, Im satisfied that its now clear that loan applicants 
must be resident in the UK to be eligible for borrowing. 
I appreciate that Mr G feels very strongly about the issues raised in this complaint and Ive 
carefully considered everything hes has said. But I dont think CopperPot has made a 
mistake here in not lending money to him. Its dealt with this complaint fairly and done all it 
can to resolve this dispute. So, I wont be upholding this complaint or asking CopperPot to 
do anything further to resolve it. 
This now brings to an end what we, in trying to resolve his dispute with CopperPot 
informally, can do for him. Im sorry we cant help Mr G any further with this.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 January 2022.
