The complaint
Mr A complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA did not lift a limitation on his account
even though he provided them with identification.  
What happened
A limitation was placed on Mr As PayPal account as PayPal wanted to verify Mr As identity.
PayPal requested a proof of name document and a proof of address document. Mr A
provided these documents, but PayPal rejected them as they said that the documents didnt
match the name on his PayPal account.
Mr A had registered his PayPal account with his initials, therefore the details were amended
on his account in order to provide support in having the identity verification completed.
PayPal informed Mr A that he had not provided the documents they had asked for and
therefore they would limit his account permanently. They emailed Mr A and said they would
withhold his funds (over £800) for 180 days to cover any potential disputes. Mr A complained
to PayPal and brought his complaint to our service.
PayPal carried out a further review of Mr As account in February 2021 and they determined
his account could be reinstated as his proof of identification he provided them in October
2020 gave them the information they needed. PayPal credited Mr As account with £50 due
to the inconvenience of the matter. Mr A felt the compensation wasnt enough as it didnt
reflect the level of distress he says he suffered due to PayPals actions.
Our investigator upheld Mr As complaint. She said that PayPal reviewed his account again
once wed contacted them and found that the identification he had sent them in October
2020 was now acceptable. Our investigator said this shows that his account shouldve been
reinstated much earlier than it was, and this wouldve caused him stress. In her view the
compensation of £50 didnt reflect this. She said that a further £150 would be a fairer
reflection of the inconvenience and distress Mr A suffered as this would bring the
compensation awarded to a total of £200.
PayPal didnt agree and asked for an Ombudsman to review the complaint. They made a
number of points including that they requested additional documents from Mr A multiple
times before deciding to limit his account and hold the funds, in accordance with their User
Agreement and Mr A provided partial documents during the review phase and was asked to
provide a full document with all the information visible on it.
Mr A thought the compensation that our investigator recommended was too low. He said that
he had a loss of earnings due to the limitation on his account and he had provided clear
photographs of his identification. Our investigator explained to Mr A that PayPals User
Agreement clearly states that PayPal will not be responsible for any loss of profits and that
the £200 (in total) was based on distress and inconvenience that Mr A suffered. Mr A replied
that he had nothing further to add.
As my findings differed in some respects from our investigators, I issued a provisional
decision to give both parties the opportunity to consider things further. This is set out below:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A has made a number of points to this service and Ive considered and read everything
hes said and sent us. But, in line with this services role as a quick and informal body Ill be
focusing on the crux of his complaint in deciding whats fair and reasonable here.
Ive considered whether PayPal were entitled to limit Mr As account initially. Im satisfied
they were. This is because the PayPal User Agreement shows they have the right to limit a
customers account if they see certain activities. It also says, Limitations also help us collect
information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.
Ive considered what happened when Mr A sent the documentation PayPal requested to lift
the limitation. PayPal have said that they accepted Mr As proof of address document. But
the copies provided did not include the whole document or were focusing on a particular
detail of it (date of issue, stamp, photo). And they say they asked him to provide a new copy
on 7 October. But the email PayPal provided this service shows that they actually just
requested proof of address as they said the date of the document was missing.
I asked PayPal about this and they confirmed that Mr A was incorrectly asked to provide a
new proof of address due to a technical issue in their system, rather than a copy of his
identity document. PayPal said that the proof of identity Mr A provided had been rejected
and he had the possibility to see that this document was still missing from the resolution
centre and the notification centre of his PayPal account. So although Mr A may have been
able to see that this document was still missing in the resolution centre or the notification
centre, Im not persuaded that it would be clear to Mr A exactly what was missing based on
the message telling him that there was an issue with the proof of address when there wasnt.
Im persuaded that this will have been very frustrating for Mr A as he says he had sent his
identification several times and the date was showing on his proof of address identification.
Ive thought about what PayPal have said regarding why they didnt accept his passport.
They said that the copy did not include the whole document. But PayPal confirmed the last
time that Mr A submitted identification to them was 7 October 2020. As Mr A had his account
limitation lifted on 25 February 2021 then PayPal had the required identification to lift his
limitation over four months earlier. So regardless of whether the acceptance of his
identification in February 2021 was outside of their normal protocols or not, Im persuaded
that because PayPal had decided to lift the limitation in February 2021, that they could have
done so in October using the same rationale as what they did four months later to lift the
limitation.
Mr A will have been distressed by the message he received on 9 October 2020 with the
subject PayPal appeal refused. He was informed that his money would be held for 180
days. Ive seen no evidence to see what changed between Mr A submitting his 
documentation in October 2020 to February 2021 so I am persuaded for the reasons Ive
already given that PayPal should have lifted the limitation on his account on 7 October 2020
and therefore the email stating the limitation would be permanent would not have needed to
have been sent to Mr A if they lifted the limitation on his account when they could have lifted
it.
Mr A thinks that the compensation our investigator said was fair was not enough and that it
doesnt reflect a loss of earnings. But as our investigator explained to Mr A, PayPals User
Agreement is clear that they cant be held responsible for loss of earnings. So Im not
persuaded that it would be fair to ask PayPal to pay for loss of earnings when his sales
arent guaranteed  even though Mr A has demonstrated that the items he was selling were
in demand. I say this as Mr A will have agreed to this condition when he became a PayPaluser.
But I am persuaded that the £50 which PayPal paid Mr A did not reflect the inconvenience
and distress Mr A suffered. I say this because he was sent an incorrect message about what
identification was outstanding and will have suffered the distress of not being able to access
his money (over £800) despite providing enough identification to have the limitation lifted.
And he had to wait nearly five months for the issue to be resolved, when in reality, the issue
shouldve been able to have been resolved within a matter of days. I say this as PayPal have
had his identification from 7 October 2020.
So, Im persuaded that a further £150 would better reflect the inconvenience and distress
that Mr A has had as a result of PayPal not lifting the limitation on his account months earlier
than they couldve done. So I intend to ask PayPal to put things right.
I invited both parties to let me have any further submissions before I reached a final
decision. Mr A confirmed he was happy for matters to proceed with the current evidence
and comments put forward. PayPal did not respond to my provisional decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has presented me with any further information to consider, then my final 
decision and reasoning remains the same as in my provisional decision.
Putting things right
In my provisional decision I said I intended to ask PayPal to pay Mr A a further £150 for 
distress and inconvenience. Im still satisfied this is a fair outcome for the reasons given 
previously.
  
My final decision
I uphold the complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should pay Mr A a further £150 for 
distress and inconvenience.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 October 2021.
