The complaint
Mr L has complained about the delays in transferring his Individual Savings Account 
(ISA) away from a business that has recently been acquired by Metro Bank PLC 
(Metro Bank).
 What happened
Metro Bank acquired the business of RateSetter and its liabilities since Mr L brought 
his complaint to this Service. However, for ease of reference Ive referred to 
RateSetter throughout my decision.
Mr L held an ISA with RateSetter and in early 2021 he was notified that Metro Bank 
had acquired RateSetters business and his account would need to be closed. 
Mr L decided to transfer his ISA to a different business which I will refer to as Firm 
A. He completed a new account form with Firm A on 2 April 2021.
On 16 April 2021 RateSetter received the transfer out request from Firm A. It had 
requested the funds be sent to it by cheque, however RateSetter has said it didnt 
have the ability to issue cheques for transfers and this needed to be done by bank 
transfer. However, there were some problems when RateSetter tried to do a transfer 
of the funds, mainly involving getting the correct banking information from Firm A.  
Over the next few months there were several attempts to transfer the funds that all 
failed. 
Eventually the funds were received by Firm A on 12 May 2022.
However, in early August 2021 Mr L lodged a complaint with RateSetter regarding 
the length of time that the transfer was taking to complete. 
RateSetter advised that it had made several attempts to transfer the funds and the 
delays were caused by Firm A failing to provide its correct bank details.
Mr L wasnt satisfied with this and so brought the complaint to our service. 
A separate complaint was lodged by Mr L against Firm A as well and this has been 
dealt with under a different complaint with our service. 
The complaint was reviewed by one of our investigators who agreed that while the 
main delays hadnt been caused by RateSetter it had contributed to the overall delay 
in some instances. She felt that a payment of £100 was fair to acknowledge this 
inconvenience it had caused Mr L.
RateSetter disagreed with the outcome stating it had done all it could to chase the 
correct details from Firm A and it remained of the view it had not contributed to the 
delay in the transfer. 
As no agreement could be reached the matter has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Having done so I agree with the outcome reached by the investigator.
Looking at all of the information that has been provided to me I can see that there 
were multiple occasions when RateSetter chased Firm A for its bank details ranging 
from when Mr L first submitted the transfer request in April 2021 and August 2021. 
And on 4 August 2021 Ive seen that RateSetter received a letter from Firm A dated 
27 July 2021 confirming the correct bank details to use and also the correct 
reference to be used for the payment. 
Following this letter RateSetter attempted to make payment to Firm A on 10 August 
2021. Initially the payment appeared successful and RateSetter emailed Mr L to 
confirm the transfer was now completed. But the payment was later returned to 
RateSetter.
RateSetter has provided a copy of the payment instruction of 10 August 2021 and 
Ive noted that the payment reference it used was incorrect and missing one digit. 
Looking at the letter sent by Firm A of 27 July 2021 I can see it was clear that the 9-
digit reference was needed in order to allocate the payment once received on its 
side. As Firm A received the payment with the incomplete reference it couldnt be 
allocated, and it was returned to RateSetter. 
After this payment was returned, Ive seen further communication between 
RateSetter and Firm A trying to again clarify the correct details for payment.
On 18 November 2021 Firm A emailed RateSetter to confirm the bank account 
details and again requested that the 9-digit reference is used as the payment 
reference. RateSetter replied to this email saying that it didnt have the 9-digit 
reference and that it only had the old account reference Mr L had used on his initial 
transfer application form beginning TON. 
RateSetter didnt get a response to the request for clarification regarding the 
reference number, but as already mentioned it had previously received this 
information in the 27 July 2021 letter. So it appears that RateSetter did have the 
account number that needed to be used as reference, and it could have attempted 
payment again at this time.
Before finalising this decision, I asked RateSetter for its thoughts on the above two 
instances. It replied saying that when it made the payment in August 2021 it wrote to 
Firm A confirming the reference used for the payment was the one beginning TON. 
However Ive seen that on 1 July 2022 when replying to our investigator RateSetter 
confirmed it used the 9-digit reference and included its back-office printout of the 
payment details and here the reference was missing the first digit of the 9-digit 
reference. 
Regardless, it is evident that Firm A sent the correct details and reference to be used 
in its 27 July 2021 letter. And if RateSetter used the TON reference as it has now 
stated when making payment on 10 August 2021 it had ignored the information 
provided by Firm A. RateSetter has also stated with the November 2021 payment attempt the adviser 
couldnt locate the 9-digit account number, but again this was provided in the letter of 
27 July 2021 so the information was available. It seems that RateSetter had not 
taken the necessary action to update its internal information to reflect this, requiring 
unnecessary further emails and time to gain information already in its possession.
   
So, in my view RateSetter also contributed to the delays as it had two different 
opportunities where payment could have been successfully completed earlier than 
when it finally was. 
The financial loss Mr L suffered because of the delays has already been considered 
against Firm A under that complaint, and so I am not commenting on or making an 
award for this aspect of the complaint.
Ive considered how Mr L has explained he needed to constantly chase both 
businesses to try get the transfer finalised. The length of time the transfer took also 
added to his frustrations he experienced.
So in this instance I agree that the £100 suggested by the investigator is fair level of 
compensation to acknowledge the inconvenience RateSetter caused Mr L with its 
contributions to the delays in transfer.




