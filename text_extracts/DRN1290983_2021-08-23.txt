K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains that Beauforce Corporation Limited (BCL) contacted him unexpectedly in 
2019 to tell him that he owes it around £28,000, which  is secured  by a charge on his 
property.Mr B says he repaid  a loan he took out with BCL in 2007 in full in 2008,  but despite  making  
BCL aware of this, it has continued to pursue him for the alleged debt.
backgroundMr B says he took out a loan with BCL in 2007, but he repaid this loan in full in 2008.  He 
says he was able to do this after re-mortgaging his property  with another  lender,  which  Ill 
call (L1). 
I understand that in 2019, a different  lender  which Ill call (L2) was granted  possession  of 
Mr Bs property  following  a court hearing that Mr B attended. I understand that L2 holds a 
first charge  on Mr Bs property and BCL holds  a second charge on the property. 
Mr B says BCL approached him out of the blue at the court  hearing in 2019 and told him that 
he owes it around £28,000. He says he told BCL that he didnt owe it any money, but it has 
continued to pursue him for the alleged debt.   
Mr B says he complained  to BCL in writing,  but he didnt receive a response.  So, our service  
agreed to investigate Mr Bs complaint and L2 agreed to put the repossession  of Mr Bs 
property on hold whilst we did this.   
BCL told us that in August 2007,  Mr B agreed  to a loan facility  with it for the amount of 
£112,000. More recently, BCL has said this was agreed in February 2007. I understand this 
was to be drawn in stages  and BCL says an initial loan amount of £34,630.59  was advanced 
to Mr B. I also understand the loan was secured by an All Monies charge  on Mr Bs property. 
BCL says only £32,815.57  was repaid, which left an outstanding balance of £2,337  to be 
repaid.  
BCL says that in February 2008, Mr B agreed to another loan facility  with it for the amount of 
£26,500. I also understand this was to be drawn  in stages, with an initial  loan amount of 
£16,500 being agreed. BCL says this loan also incorporated the outstanding balance from 
the first loan and it was secured via the original All Monies charge.  
BCL says a total of £21,337 was advanced to Mr B between February  2008  and 
February 2010 and Mr B stopped making repayments towards the loan in 2011. BCL says it 
wrote to Mr B about the outstanding balance on multiple occasions,  but it didnt receive any 
response from Mr B.
BCL says Mr B now owes it a total of £27,337.40. I understand this comprises  of £21,337.40 
of outstanding capital, £5,774.41 of outstanding interest and £854.66  for penalty charges.
Our investigator didnt  uphold Mr Bs complaint. In summary, she wasnt  satisfied the first 
loan had been fully repaid by Mr B in 2008  and she didnt  think  BCL had acted unreasonably 
by pursing Mr B for the debt it says is outstanding.
Mr B disagreed with the investigator and provided us with further  information.  This included 
Ref: DRN12909832bank statements, which Mr B believes show he didnt receive the money  BCL says it 
advanced to him. Hes also provided correspondence  from BCL which  he believes shows 
BCL has provided incorrect information about the loan.
BCL has also provided us with further information,  including copies of correspondence 
between it and Mr B, which it feels confirms the existence of the loan.
As agreement hasnt been  reached, the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision setting out my thoughts on the case. I said:
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come  to a different conclusion than the investigator.  Ive set out my 
provisional findings below, so that both parties can comment before I finalise my decision.
Our jurisdiction
It appears that the debt that BCL is pursuing Mr B for concerns at least  one unregulated 
loan, which  was taken  out before BCL joined our compulsory jurisdiction in April 2014.  
However, Mr Bs complaint concerns BCLs actions from 2019, when Mr B says BCL 
contacted him out of the blue to tell him that he had a debt to repay which  BCL has 
continued to pursue him for.
Because BCL was in our compulsory  jurisdiction  in 2019, Im satisfied that I have the 
jurisdiction to consider  this complaint.  Further, Im satisfied that I can consider what 
happened before  BCL joined our compulsory jurisdiction, to assist  me in determining  
whether BCL has acted  reasonably by pursuing Mr B for the alleged debt since 2019.
Ive also noted  that BCL left our compulsory jurisdiction in October 2015 and joined it again 
in December 2017. However,  Im also satisfied that I can consider what  happened  during 
this time to assist me in determining  whether BCL has acted reasonably by pursuing Mr B for 
the alleged debt.
Was the first loan fully repaid in February 2008?
BCL says that in August  2007, a loan amount of £34,630.59  was advanced to Mr B. It has 
also provided us with a copy  of a loan agreement document dated August 2007, which was 
also signed by Mr B on this date.  
Ref: DRN12909833Mr B appears to accept  he received this loan, but he says he fully repaid it in February 2008, 
after he re-mortgaged with L1.
Mr B has provided us with a copy of a letter dated  March 2008 from his Solicitor, who I 
understand was involved  in the re-mortgage of his property with L1. This confirms that in 
February 2008, a payment was made to BCL. This document refers to a separate  Cash 
Account document which shows the amount of £49,486.31 was paid to BCL. Mr B has also 
provided a Ledger  document  from his Solicitor, which also confirms  the amount of 
£49,486.31 was paid to BCL in February  2008.
However, BCL maintains  that it only received a payment of £32,815.57  in February 2008, 
which wasnt enough to fully discharge the debt. BCL has also provided a copy of a letter  it 
says it received from Mr Bs Solicitor  dated March 2008, which  refers  to the payment being a 
partial redemption, which BCL feels shows the loan was only partially repaid.
Ive carefully reviewed this document. However,  Ive noted that it doesnt refer to any amount 
repaid or any amount  outstanding.
BCL has provided us with an undated Loan  Statement document.  This shows the loan 
amount advanced  to Mr B as £34,480.59 and it lists the dates  the repayments were  due. 
This indicates all of the repayments were made, with the exception  of a final repayment due 
on 21 February 2008. It also shows a payment of £32,815.57  was received from L1 and a 
balance of £2,337.40 left outstanding. This was made up of the remaining capital balance  of 
£1,665 and the repayment due on 21 February 2008.
However, this document provides a loan advance date of 21 February 2007 and indicates 
the first monthly repayment was due on 21 February  2007.  Whereas  the loan agreement  
document BCL has provided for this loan is dated August 2007,  almost six months after the 
Loan Statement document indicates the loan was advanced and repayments were  due. I 
asked BCL for further clarification regarding this, but I didnt receive a response  on this point.  
So, it remains unclear  to me why the dates  provided in these documents differ.
Mr B has also provided us with a copy of a letter he says he received from BCL dated     
June 2019, which states:
The loan was partially  paid off on the 21st February  2008, leaving a balance of £1,0000.
The information provided in this letter appears  to conflict  with BCLs statement that a 
balance of £2.337.40 was left outstanding,  after it received  a payment from L1 in February  
2008.Ive also noted  that the loan agreement document dated August 2007 states that the loan 
was a further advance  and extension to your loan which is secured by a charge over the 
property.Mr B has also provided us with a copy of another loan offer document  from BCL dated 
February 2007. This refers to BCL granting  Mr B a loan facility  for £26,500 with an initial  loan 
amount of £16,500.  The monthly repayments  were £321.75 over a term of six months. 
Mr B has also provided us with a copy of a letter from BCL dated  February  2007,  which  
states the loan completed on 21 February  2007  and the first payment of £321.75 was due on 
21 March 2007.
Ref: DRN12909834It seems  to me that Mr B may have had multiple loans with BCL in 2007 which BCL may be 
confusing. This could  explain why a larger amount was paid to it in 2008.
In any event, as it stands, BCL maintains the amount outstanding in February  2008  was 
£34,480.59. And I currently  find the evidence Mr B has provided from his Solicitor involved in 
the re-mortgage with L1 to be the most persuasive. Both the Cash Account document and 
the Ledger document provided  indicate the amount paid to BCL in February  2008  was 
£49,486. So, it seems  to me that this payment would have been more  than sufficient to fully 
discharge the loan of £34,480.59.
It follows that I dont think the amount of £2,337.40 should have been rolled into the 
subsequent loan that BCL says Mr B agreed  to in February 2008.
The 2008  loan  what amount is still outstanding?
BCL says Mr Bs second loan with it started  on 21 March 2008, and this incorporated  the 
outstanding balance of £2,337.40 from the first loan. It has also provided  us with a signed 
loan agreement document dated February  2008. 
I understand the loan facility was for £26,500,  to be drawn in stages in line with the 
refurbishment and development of Mr Bs property,  with an initial loan amount  of £16,500 
being agreed. 
BCL says the following advances were  made  to Mr B via cheque  payment:
-£3,000 in August 2008;
-£5,000 in August 2008;
-£2,000 in February 2009;
-£500 in October  2009;
-£6,000 in December 2009;
-£1,500 in January 2010;  and
-£1,000 in February 2010.
BCL has told us the total amount it advanced to Mr B was £21,337.40   £19,000 plus the 
£2,337.40 rolled  over from the previous loan.
However, Mr B has told us he didnt receive the payments BCL says it made  to him and hes 
provided us with bank  statements from the account he says was using during the relevant 
time period, which he feels show this.
Ive reviewed Mr Bs bank statements, and I cant see any evidence  of the amounts listed 
above being credited to this account.  Although I accept the payments could have been 
credited to another account.
Ive asked BCL for its banking records to show the above listed advances  were  made to 
Mr B, but it hasnt been able to provide this information.
BCL has provided an undated  Loan  Statement document showing the amounts it says were 
advanced to Mr B and the repayments it says were due and were  received from 
Mr B. However, Ive noted  this doesnt appear to be a record  of a running  transaction history.
Ref: DRN12909835It has also provided us with copies of correspondence  between it and Mr B, which  it feels  
confirms the existence of the loan and that repayments were  being made up until around 
2011. This includes several handwritten  letters it says it received from Mr B.
However, Ive noted many  discrepancies  between  the information  contained  in the 
correspondence provided and the information  and figures BCL has provided in its Loan  
Statement document.
For example, in an email  dated 15 August 2009,  BCL states  the payment for July has not 
been received  in the sum of £58.50.  However, the Loan Statement document  indicates an 
amount of £240.58  was due that month. Further, it appears a payment £251.69 was made 
by Mr B.
Also, in one of the handwritten letters BCL says it received from Mr B in December 2009, 
Mr B acknowledges a cheque for the amount of £1,500 and refers  to this bringing  the total 
amount hes borrowed  to £3,000 and the monthly repayments being  £60. The Loan 
Statement document shows the loan balance increasing by £1,500 in January 2010. 
However, the loan amount balance is recorded as being £20,337.40 at that time.
Mr B has also provided us with a copy of a letter dated 19 September 2008, which appears 
to have been sent to him by an employee at BCL. This refers to a further advance being  
made to Mr B in June  2008 and states:
 you opted to pay the first 3 months interest out of the advance.  Consequently, we 
deducted 3 x £19.50  [£58.50]. The next quarter will start again on 2 October  2008
However, the Loan Statement document doesnt  show a further  advance  being made to
Mr B in June  2008. Nor is there any reference to a quarterly  payment.   
Weve also been  provided with copies  of correspondence from BCL to Mr B dated 
January 2009  and April 2009,  which also refer to quarterly repayments  of £58.50. However,  
theres no reference to this in the Loan  Statement document. Although it does show  a 
payment of £58.50 being made in October 2009.
Ive asked BCL for further clarification regarding some of these discrepancies  and it has 
more recently accepted  that there may have  also been another small loan. I agree thats a 
possibility. However, it remains unclear to me from the information  it has provided  what  
amounts were advanced to Mr B and when, what repayments were made towards which  
loan and what amount remains outstanding.
Mr B has also more  recently told us that he thinks he owes BCL around £4,000. However,  it 
also isnt clear to me from the information hes provided how hes calculated that amount. 
Although I accept this does correspond with the amounts referred to in the handwritten 
letters BCL says it received from him between February 2009 and February  2010.
Both parties  have had a significant amount of time and opportunity to provide evidence  to 
support their arguments, so Im satisfied  theres  unlikely to be any further  evidence  available  
to clarify what happened  and what amount is outstanding. So, to resolve the dispute  in a fair 
way, I think the best thing  for me to do is to determine a fair figure  to settle  the loan. 
Ref: DRN12909836Calculating a fair settlement 
BCL says Mr B owes it a total of £27,337.40. Whereas Mr B says he thinks he owes 
BCL £4,000. However, Im not persuaded either  is correct.
The difficulty  here is arriving  at a correct figure. On the evidence  I have,  thats simply not 
been possible. BCLs records  are not adequate to evidence what it advanced to Mr B, or the 
payments that hes made, with any degree of certainty. But although they dont appear on 
his bank statements, Im satisfied from the other  evidence that Mr B received at least  some  
further lending  from BCL in and after 2008   and Im satisfied that it has not all been repaid 
yet.This is a provisional decision, and therefore both parties have the opportunity to give me 
further evidence  as to what a correct  settlement figure might be. If they do so, Ill consider 
and if necessary, revise  my proposed outcome.
But as things stand,  I dont think I can give a precise figure for exactly what Mr B owes  but 
at the same  time, there needs to be certainty so that the property can be sold and BCLs  
charge be removed.
I bear in mind that our rules give me wide power  to do whats  fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances. That includes giving me latitude to make  a fair estimate where   as here  
precision isnt possible.
Im satisfied that Mr B owes BCL money, and I think its more  likely than not that the 
remaining balance is more than £4,000.  But Im not persuaded  that its as high as 
£27,337.40  but between those two figures its not been possible for me to reach  a precise 
figure.I therefore think a fair basis for the settlement  of the loan is the mid-point  between  these two 
figures, which is £11,668.70.
Further, because Im satisfied the first loan was fully repaid and the amount of £2,337.40 
shouldnt have been incorporated  into the subsequent loan, I think  this amount should be 
deducted from £11,668.70.  This leaves an amount of £9,331.30. As I say, Ill consider any 
further evidence  either  party may provide. But as things stand, my current  view is that this 
represents a fair basis for Mr Bs outstanding debt to BCL to be settled.  
 
my provisional decision
Taking everything into account,  I felt a fair amount to settle the debt was £9,331.30.
I said that if Mr B pays BCL this amount,  I intended to direct  BCL to accept this in full 
settlement of the debt it believes Mr B owes it and remove any charge it holds on 
Mr Bs property  on receipt.
responses to my provisional  decision
Mr B responded saying  he accepted  my provisional decision.
Ref: DRN12909837BCL didnt accept my provisional decision.  In summary, it said:
It did respond to Mr Bs complaint on 29 July 2019;
It didnt contact Mr B unexpectedly  in 2019.  As a legal charge holder, it attended the 
hearing as an opportunity  to speak to Mr B as he hadnt responded to the 
correspondence it says it sent to him since he stopped making  repayments;
Mr Bs first loan commenced in February 2007;
Mr B didnt  repay the 2007 loan in full and it repeated its point  that a letter from       
Mr Bs Solicitor, dated March 2008, refers to the payment being a partial redemption;
Mr B did sign and agree to out the second loan and he also requested  further 
advances;
It doubts the accuracy of the documentation that Mr B has provided from his Solicitor,  
showing the amount  of £49,486.31 was paid to BCL in February 2008; and
It would  accept a payment  of £16,000  in full and final settlement  of the account and it 
would release its charge on Mr Bs property, providing it receives an undertaking 
from the first charge holder.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The 2007  loan
BCL has confirmed the first loan commenced  in February 2007. However,  it hasnt provided  
any loan agreement or documentation  confirming this.
Mr B has provided us with a copy of a loan offer document dated February 2007. This refers  
to BCL granting Mr B a loan facility for £26,500  with an initial loan amount of £16,500. The 
monthly repayments were  £321.75 over a term of six months. Mr B has also provided us with 
a copy of a letter from BCL dated  February  2007,  which states the loan completed on         
21 February 2007 and the first payment of £321.75 was due on 21 March  2007.
However, the Loan Statement document BCL has provided shows the initial  balance  in 
February 2007 to be £34,480.59  and the monthly  repayments being £672.37.
Given the above, Im not persuaded the Loan Statement document  BCL has provided is an 
accurate indication of what  amount was advanced,  due, paid and of any amount left 
outstanding.
BCL has referred again to a letter it says it received from Mr Bs Solicitor,  dated March 2008,  
which refers to a partial redemption.  Ive reviewed this letter again, and I accept that it does 
refer to a partial  redemption. However, it doesnt refer to any amount  repaid  or any amount 
outstanding. Whereas  the documents provided  by Mr B do refer to an actual amount repaid 
to BCL,  which is £49,486.31.
Ref: DRN12909838It therefore remains that I find the documents that Mr B has provided to be more  persuasive 
in regard to the amount that was repaid than the letter BCL refers  to. And because these 
documents indicate that BCL was paid more than it says Mr B owed it in February  2008,  Im 
not satisfied there was an amount left to be repaid. It follows, therefore, that Im not 
persuaded that it was fair or correct for the amount  of £2,337.40 to have been rolled into the 
subsequent loan that BCL says Mr B agreed  to in February 2008.
the 2008 loan
BCL has said that it will accept  the amount of £16,000 to settle the alleged debt. However, it 
hasnt provided  any reasoning  or rationale  for how it has calculated this figure.  Ive also 
asked Mr B whether  hes willing to accept BCLs proposal and Mr B has confirmed that he 
isnt willing  to accept  it.
It remains my view that BCLs records are not adequate to evidence what  it advanced  to    
Mr B, or the payments  that hes made, with any degree of certainty.
I still think the starting point for a fair settlement of the debt is £11,668.70. My provisional 
decision refers to this being the mid-point between the two figures  each party believes is still 
outstanding, but this is actually half the difference of between  the two figures  that each party 
believes is owed. This weighting in favour of Mr B reflects my view on how persuasive  each  
party has been  in demonstrating an accurate figure,  whilst acknowledging that I find neither  
party has been  able to demonstrate this with any degree of certainty.
Further, because I remain satisfied the first loan was fully repaid and the amount of 
£2,337.40 shouldnt have been  incorporated  into the subsequent loan, I think  this amount 
should be deducted from £11,668.70. This leaves an amount of £9,331.30. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained here and in my provisional decision, I think a fair amount to 
settle the debt is £9,331.30.
If Mr B agrees,  I direct  Beauforce Corporation  Limited to accept a payment of £9,331.30 
from Mr B in full settlement of the debt it believes Mr B owes and it should remove  any 
charge it holds on Mr Bs property.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 September  2021.
