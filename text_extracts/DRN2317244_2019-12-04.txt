K821x#15complaint
Miss G says MYJAR  Limited lent to her irresponsibly.  She says that the loan repayments 
were a burden and she struggled to meet normal household commitments because  of this. 
She thinks MYJAR shouldve noticed this and not lent to her. 
background
This complaint is about seven loans MYJAR  provided to Miss G between November 2015 
and October 2015.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought shouldnt have approved any 
lending after loan 6. MYJAR disagreed with the adjudicators opinion so the complaint has 
been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss G 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN23172442the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Gs complaint. Ive decided to uphold Miss Gs 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Miss G didnt  disagree with our adjudicators  opinion about loans 1 to 5. Because of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. So I wont  be making a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Miss G had with 
MYJAR. So they are something I will take into account when considering the other  loans 
Miss G took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 and 7 because I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of MYJARs  lending 
history with Miss G, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  MYJAR should  
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
MYJAR should have  realised that it shouldnt have  provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Gs case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 5. I say this because:
at this point MYJAR ought to have realised  Miss G was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss G had taken out five loans previously and she had been 
indebted to MYJAR for 14 months.  She was scheduled to make repayments  for 
another 12 months going forward. So MYJAR ought  to have realised it was more 
likely than not Miss G was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying her 
previous loans had left in her finances and that Miss Gs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably
Miss Gs first loan was for £100  and loan 6 was for £450. At this point MYJAR ought 
to have known  that Miss G was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in 
her income but to meet an ongoing need  
Miss G wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed MYJAR. Loan 7 was 
taken out around two years after Miss Gs first. Whilst  there  were  some shorter  
breaks in the lending  Miss G had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect, service a 
debt to MYJAR over an extended period
Ref: DRN23172443I think that Miss G lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Gs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time
the length of time over which Miss G borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on Miss Gs ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 and 7and MYJAR  should put things  right.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss G paid on loans 6 and 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 and 7 should be removed from 
Miss Gs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Miss G a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if MYJAR asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Miss Gs complaint.
MYJAR Limited should put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 January 2020.
