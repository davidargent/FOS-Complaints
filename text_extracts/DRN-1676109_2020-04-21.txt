The complaint
Mrs W complains that TSB Bank plc hasn't found an account she has a passbook 
for which shows she had £416.04 saved in 1988. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
TSB has searched its records and hasn't found an open savings account in Mrs W's 
name despite being able to locate other accounts she holds. 
TSB hasn't found any records of a dormant savings account in Mrs W's name. TSB is 
only required to retain information for a certain period and I wouldn't expect it to have 
records going back thirty years. 
Passbook accounts could be operated without the actual passbook being presented 
in branch. So whilst Mrs W's passbook shows she had a balance of £416.04 in 1988, 
the funds could have been withdrawn and the account closed without it being 
updated. 
I'm satisfied that TSB doesn't hold this savings account for Mrs W and hasn't retained 
any information about it. I think it's more likely than not that the account was closed 
and funds withdrawn. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 May 2020.
