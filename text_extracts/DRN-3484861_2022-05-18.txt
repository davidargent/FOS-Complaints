The complaint
Mr S complains that RCI Financial Services Limited (RCI), in the way it set up his hire
purchase agreement (agreement) and then administered and managed it, has caused him
a loss for which he would like to be compensated.
What happened
RCI considered Mr S complaint. It said that the agreement hadnt been mis-sold and it had
been correctly set up and (ultimately) administered and manged correctly.
Unhappy with RCIs response to his complaint Mr S referred matters to our service.
Mr S complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that
ultimately RCI had done nothing wrong.
Mr S didnt agree and so his complaint was passed to me for review and decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in May 2022. In summary I said: 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Mr S has very strong feelings about the matters he has complained about. He has
provided detailed submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and
considered in their entirety. However, I trust that Mr S will not take the fact that my findings
focus on what I consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in
considerably less detail, as a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every
point raised. The purpose of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for
reaching them.
Mr S could have bought his new car (without finance) for £15,706.82 broken down as
follows:
On the Road Price of the new car* £39,206.82
Part Exchange allowance on his existing car £20,000.00
Government EV Grant  £3,500.00
Total Payable £15,706.82
*£39,340.00 (list price) plus £55.00 (registration fee) plus £955.00 (extras/accessories) less £1,143.18 (discount/adjustment)
Instead, what Mr S did was finance the purchase by way of an agreement with RCI for
£24,706.82 broken down as follows:
On the Road Price of the new car £39,206.82
Part Exchange allowance on his existing car (£20,000 less £10,000) £10,000.00
Government EV Grant £3,500.00
Dealership Deposit Contribution £1,000.00
Sub Total £24,706.82
And what Mr S then ended up paying, following the decision to finance the purchase, was
£14,936.50 broken down as follows:
Payments debited from Mr S bank account(s) to RCI/the dealership
5 March 2020 £500.00
27 March 2020 £277.62
30 March 2020 £28,329.64 £29,107.26
Payments credited to Mr S bank account(s) from RCI/the dealership
5 March 2020 £10,500.00*
1 April 2020 £3,393.14^
12 June 2020 £277.62^ £14,170.76
Total Payable £14,936.50
*£500.00 returned deposit and £10,000.00 part exchange offer not used against the acquisition of the new car
^over payment requested by RCI in error and paid by Mr S as part of his payment of £28,329.64
Therefore, by financing the acquisition rather than not, Mr S ended up £770.32 better off.
Put another way by financing the acquisition Mr S ended up paying one monthly agreement
sum of £277.62 that he wouldnt have otherwise had to pay and benefited from a dealership
deposit contribution of £1,000.00 and an interest credit/adjustment on final settlement of
£47.94 that he wouldnt have otherwise benefited from.
I would also add that Ive checked the various documentation that has been provided by the
parties including, but not restricted to, the agreement, the order form and the invoice raised
by the dealership for RCIs purposes. And having done so I can confirm that these can all be
reconciled to each other and are set out in such a way that, in my view, Mr S would have
understood them.
I accept that I cant say for sure what was discussed between the dealership and Mr S and
what was said, or wasnt said, that led him to finance the car acquisition rather than acquire
the car outright immediately by way of a cash payment. But based on what both parties have
said and submitted Ive seen insufficient evidence to be able to conclude that Mr S was
pressured into acquiring the car by way of finance provided by RCI rather than acquiring
outright and immediately by way of a cash payment. I would also reiterate what I say above,
and that is Im satisfied that regardless of whether Mr S was pressured into financing his car
acquisition I cant see that this has caused him a loss.Mr S also submits that he was offered a part exchange allowance of £22,000 for his old car
by the dealership. But there is no documentary evidence to support this. In fact, all the
documentation Ive seen references a part exchange allowance of £20,000 and this fact was
never disputed, at least at the material time, by Mr S. I would also add that Ive seen
insufficient evidence to suggest an on the road price for the new car was agreed (before any
discounts) for anything other than £39,206.82.
Finally, and for the sake of completeness, I would add that Im satisfied that no commission
was paid by RCI to the supplying dealership for arranging the agreement Mr S is
complaining about. Ive come to this conclusion having had regard, amongst other things, to
the documentation supplied to our service by RCI in this respect.
RCI didnt respond to my provisional decision by the date I gave.
Mr S responded to my provisional decision to say he didnt agree with it and to reiterate his 
previous submissions.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that Mr S is unhappy with my provisional decision and doesnt agree with it. But in 
my view he has added nothing materially new for my consideration. However, for the sake of 
completeness, I make the following comments.
I reiterate what I said in my provisional decision, thats Ive carefully considered all of the 
points Mr S has made and all of the evidence hes provided in relation to his complaint. Now 
Mr S may consider that my findings dont mirror the level of detail of his submissions, but 
thats simply a reflection of the informal nature of our service. My role isnt to address 
everything Mr S has raised. Instead, my role is to address the points that Mr S has raised 
that I believe to be relevant in fairly and reasonably deciding his complaint.
I would also add that my role isnt to fine or punish firms, or to direct firms to change their 
polices, procedures and working practices, that is the role of the regulator. My role is to have 
regard to what financial loss and non-financial loss a consumer has suffered (if any) as a 
result of something a business did wrong.
Mr S has referred to another case decided by our service in his submissions. Im aware of 
this case and even if I was to agree there are similarities, and for the record I dont, each 
case is considered and decided on its own fact and merits and Im not bound by what our 
service might have found in the past on other cases.
I accept that Mr S has the right to bring his complaint against RCI rather than the supplying 
dealership and for the avoidance of doubt Ive never said otherwise.
Mr S believes he has been scammed by the supplying dealership and other consumers 
might have been scammed also or might be scammed in the future. But Mr S has simply 
provided nothing that would persuade me this was the case.Mr S questions how I derived one or more of the figures in my provisional decision. But Im 
satisfied that Ive already set out how these figures were derived in sufficient detail (in my 
provisional decision) so Ive nothing further to add on this point.
I remain of the view that all the documentation that has been provided can be reconciled 
and each and every document was set out in such a way that Mr S would have understood 
the nature of the commitment he was entering into.
Ive still seen nothing that would lead me to conclude that Mr S was ever offered anything 
other than £20,000 for his part exchanged car or an on the road price for the new car of 
anything other than (before government grants and dealership contributions) £39,206.82.
The loan agreement doesnt show Mr S received £10,000.00 for his part exchanged car. 
What it shows is £11,000.00 was paid upfront by Mr S for the new car. And when the 
agreement is considered with the other documentation supplied, Im satisfied that its clear 
what happened in this case. And that is Mr S received £20,000.00 for his part exchanged car 
of which £10,000.00 was used as an upfront payment. To this £10,000.00 upfront payment 
the dealership contributed a further £1,000.00 making a total upfront payment of £11,000.00. 
Mr S then received £10,500.00 by way of a bank credit from the dealership made up of the 
£10,000.00 outstanding part exchange allowance he was given of £20,000.00 and a refund 
of the £500.00 he paid by way of a deposit right at the outset to secure the car subject to this 
complaint.
Mr S says its irregular for a car purchase loan to be twice the purchase price. But I cant 
see that this is the case.
The cash price of the car was £35,706.82 (£39,206.82 less £3,500.00). £11,000.00 was paid 
upfront leaving a sum to be financed of £24,706.82. Had the agreement run to term Mr S 
(everything else being equal) would have ended up paying £39,607.26 (£11,000.00 upfront, 
£24,706.82 in capital repayments and £3,900.44 in interest). Put another way Mr S would 
have ended up (re)paying 111% of the purchase price of the car, not more than twice the 
purchase price.
Mr S says I didnt address in my provisional decision his point that he was pressured into 
taking out the agreement when he didnt want to or need to. But I did, and I can confirm Ive 
nothing further to add in this respect except to say that Mr S point in this respect doesnt 
indicate to me that there was any type of scam going on.
I remain of the view that by financing the car acquisition, rather than paying for the car 
outright and at the outset, Mr S ended up financially better off by £770.32 and Ive nothing 
further to add on this point except to say the sum of £770.32 wasnt, nor could it be, derived 
by taking £277.62 from £,1,000.00.
Given what I say above and given that RCI didnt respond to my provisional decision, I see 
no reason to depart from my provisional findings and I now confirm them as final.
My final decision
My final decision is that RCI Financial Services Limited has done nothing wrong is this
case and it need do nothing further.
I appreciate Mr S will be disappointed by my conclusions. My final decision, however, 
represents the last stage of this services dispute resolution procedure. Mr S doesnt have to 
accept my decision, and if he doesnt do so, he will be free to pursue legal action against 
RCI Financial Services Limited or any other party he deems appropriate.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 June 2022.
