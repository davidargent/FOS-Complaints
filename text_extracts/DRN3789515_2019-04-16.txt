Mr C says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as Pounds to Pocket, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent Mr C and Pounds to Pocket  my provisional decision on 5 April 2019. A copy  of it is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.  The full background  to the complaint is set out 
in my provisional decision,  so I wont reiterate it here.
I explained why I was planning  to uphold the complaint in part and asked both parties  to let 
me know if they had anything to add. Mr C said he didnt  have  anything  else to add. 
Pounds to Pocket said it didnt agree with my provisional decision.
The complaint has now been passed back to me to decide.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding  Mr Cs complaint in part. Ill explain why the points 
Pounds to Pocket made didnt change my provisional findings.
For the most  part, Pounds to Pockets response didnt deal with Mr Cs individual  
circumstances; rather, it made  general  points about  Pounds to Pockets  interpretation of the 
FCAs consumer credit sourcebook (CONC)  specifically CONC 5.3.1 (6). 
In short,  it said that CONC 5 required it to carry out an individual,  proportionate affordability 
assessment for each  loan and as such, it wasnt possible  to say that a pattern of lending 
alone could establish that lending could be unsustainable.
I dont agree with Pounds to Pocket on the above  point. Ive taken  into account this services 
approach to short-term  lending,  which  is set out on our website and which Pounds  to Pocket 
will be familiar with from previous decision. So I wont set out in detail here why I consider 
the pattern  of lending to be a relevant factor when considering the sustainability of a chain of 
lending. The reasons for this are already known to Pounds to Pocket.
I make  it clear  to Pounds to Pocket  that I havent  made and will not make any definitive  
finding as to whether it breached CONC (or any other rule or regulation).  That is not my role. 
I have ultimately determined this complaint with reference to what  is fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances  of Mr Cs case (as per DISP  3.6.1R).
I have taken relevant  rules and regulation into account in determining Mr Cs complaint. And 
I dont think its right to look at CONC 5.3.1 (6) in isolation. I accept its correct  that CONC 5 
should be taken  into account. But CONC 6.7.22G is also relevant and says the following:
A firm should not allow  a customer to enter into consecutive agreements with the firm for 
high-cost short-term credit if the cumulative effect  of the agreements  would be that the total 
amount payable by the customer is unsustainable

Ref: DRN37895152[Note: paragraph 6.25 (box) of ILG]
The reference to ILG largely  concerns payday  loans   and Mr Cs loans were  instalment 
loans. But they were also still high-cost short-term credit. And with that in mind,  I think  there 
could still come a point at which lending  particularly consecutive loans where the amounts 
lent increase  could  still result in the cumulative effect of the lending  becoming 
unsustainable. 
Mr Cs first loan commenced in September 2015  and his last loan commenced in April 2018 
and was scheduled to end in July 2019.  Had it ran to term the total period of lending  with no 
real breaks would be about  46 months  just under four years. I say there were no breaks  as 
there was a gap of just 19 days between loan 1/1a and loan 2 (less  than one pay cycle) and 
no gap at all between loan 2 and loan 3. Even  taking into account that these were 
instalments loans, with much longer  terms than payday loans, thats a significant period of 
time to be constantly repaying high-cost short-term credit. I set out in my provisional decision 
why this caused Mr C to lose out and Pounds to Pocket hasnt said anything to change my 
mind on that point.
With the above mind, I still think its perfectly  reasonable  to suggest the pattern of lending,  at 
some point, would  cause a responsible lender to be concerned about the sustainability of the 
lending. That the loans were repaid does not mean  that they were repaid sustainably,  or 
without causing  Mr C undue difficulty. For the reasons Ive given, I think that point arose 
when Mr C asked for the loan approved  in May 2017.
Im therefore  upholding Mr Cs complaint in part, for the reasons given above and in my 
provisional decision.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out in my provisional  decision.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2019.

Mr C says CashEuroNet UK LLC,  trading  as Pounds to Pocket, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr C had three loans with CashEuroNet. Loan 1 was refinanced (into loan 1a) about half way through 
its term  Mr C borrowed  extra funds and the term of the loan was extended.

An adjudicator considered Mr Cs complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. She didnt think 
CashEuroNet was right to approve  loans 2 and 3. CashEuroNet didnt  agree with the adjudicator, so 
the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. 
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website  and Ive 
taken this into account in deciding  Mr Cs case. 
Im planning to uphold Mr Cs complaint in part and have explained  why below.
CashEuroNet needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr C could repay  his 
loans in a sustainable  manner. 
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion of their 
income 
the amount, or amounts,  due to be repaid are higher  
there is a larger number  and/or frequency of loans 
the period of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Mr Cs income and expenditure.  With this in mind, in the early stages  of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind,  I think that there are three key questions for me to consider in order to fairly 
and reasonably determine  Mr Cs complaint. These questions are:
Ref: DRN378951541.Did CashEuroNet, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy 
itself that Mr C would be able to repay in a sustainable way?  If not, would those  checks have 
shown that Mr C would have  been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase  Mr Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
3.Did CashEuroNet act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  all of these questions and what they mean  for Mr Cs complaint.
Did CashEuroNet, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself 
that Mr C would be able to repay  in a sustainable  way? If not, would those  checks have shown that Mr 
C would have  been able to do so?
Before approving loan 1 and the refinance, 1a, CashEuroNet asked Mr C questions about his income  
and expenditure. For both the initial  loan and the refinance, CashEuroNet recorded 
Mr Cs net monthly income as £1,400. CashEuroNet recorded Mr Cs total monthly  living expenses as 
£525 for both loan 1 and 1a. This would leave  Mr C with disposable income of around £825 a month. 
CashEuroNet made further adjustments to create a monthly estimate disposable income figure for Mr 
C of £787. I can see it arrived at this figure by increasing  Mr Cs credit commitments from the £250 he 
declared to £338. It made this increase as the result of a credit check. CashEuroNet hasnt shared the 
credit check data it obtained  with this service.
Without having seen the results of the credit check CashEuroNet carried out, its difficult  to say 
whether the checks it undertook were reasonable or proportionate. But having considered Mr Cs 
bank statements and credit  report, I dont  think proportionate checks  wouldve suggested loans 
1 or 1a were not affordable  for Mr C. He may have had some extra credit commitments, on top of 
what he declared  and on top of the adjustment CashEuroNet made  to his declared  figure. 
And it may be that proportionate  checks wouldve uncovered further credit commitments.  But even if 
CashEuroNet had looked more closely  at Mr Cs credit commitments at this time,  I dont think  loans 
1/1a wouldve looked unaffordable,  given the size of the monthly instalments.
So Im not planning to uphold  Mr Cs complaint about loans 1/1a. I dont think proportionate checks  
wouldve suggested they were not affordable to him.
I havent recreated  individual, proportionate affordability checks for loan 2 and 3 because I dont think  
that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of lending 
increase Mr Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of lending.  Ive looked to see if there was a point at which  
CashEuroNet should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful. And so CashEuroNet should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further 
lending. 
In considering this, I bear in mind the short-term purpose of high-cost short-term credit. CashEuroNet 
will be aware  of this services general  approach to lending patterns and high-cost  short-term credit,  
which is set out on our website.1

ombudsman.org.uk/publications/technical_notes/payday-lending.html
Ref: DRN37895155Its also worth highlighting the Financial Conduct Authoritys (FCA) Dear CEO letter of 6 March  2019.2 
It noted there were  two key ways consumers may be harmed in the high-cost short-term credit 
market. The first of these  was, a high volume of relending, which may be symptomatic of 
unsustainable lending patterns
So I consider it entirely proper and fair to look consider the above question in Mr Cs case.
In the particular circumstances  of Mr Cs case, I think the point at which CashEuroNet  ought to have 
realised that further lending would likely be unsustainable was reached by loan 2. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr C was borrowing was increasing, and CashEuroNet ought to have realised it 
was likely  his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
Mr C wasnt making any real inroads to the amount they owed CashEuroNet.  And he was in 
effect paying  large  amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended  period
Mr C was asking for high-cost loans  and even though these  were instalment loans,  they still 
met the definition of high-cost short-term credit. So they were  not appropriate  if used  as a 
long-term financial solution.  Mr Cs first loan and refinance  ran for two years.  So CashEuroNet 
ought to have realised further loans of this type were not appropriate,  given their purpose and 
cost.
I think  that Mr C lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from loan 2 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period of time  a little under four years had loan 3 run to 
term
extending high-cost  credit to Mr C for such a long period  would likely have negative 
implications on his ability to access mainstream  credit and so keep him in the market for 
these high-cost loans
So I plan to uphold  Mr Cs complaint about loans 2 and 3 because the overall  pattern of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and he lost out as a 
result.
Did CashEuroNet act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  everything provided. Having  done  so, Ive not seen anything  here that 
leads me to conclude CashEuroNet acted unfairly  or unreasonably towards  Mr C in some other way.
other matters
CashEuroNet has confirmed it wrote off the balance of loan 3 on 1 October 2018. Mr C borrowed 
£1,500 and had repaid a little under £900 at the point CashEuroNet wrote off the balance. So 
although I dont think CashEuroNet  was right to approve loan 3, Mr C is around £600 better off having 
had this loan than if CashEuroNet hadnt approved  it.
I think  its fair that this be taken into account and I intend to say CashEuroNet can deduct the amount 
of principal it wrote off for loan 3 from what  it owes Mr C for loan 2.

https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/portfolio-letter-firms-high-cost-lending.pdf
Ref: DRN37895156putting things  right
I plan to tell CashEuroNet to:
refund the interest and charges Mr C paid on loan 2
add to the above  interest at 8% simple  per year, from when Mr C paid them  until the date of 
settlement
CashEuroNet may deduct from the above redress the principal it wrote off for loan 3.
In respect of Mr Cs credit  history:
the number of loans combined with length  of the period of borrowing means  any information  
recorded about loans  2 and 3 is adverse. So all entries about  loans  2 and 3 should be 
removed from Mr Cs credit file
my provisional  decision
I plan to uphold this complaint in part and to tell CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things by taking the 
steps set out above.
