The complaint
Mrs O is unhappy PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA PayPal recorded a missed payment on 
her credit file, in relation to a PayPal Credit account she holds with it.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional
decision. I said:
Mrs O used her PayPal Credit account to make a purchase in November 2022. Mrs O 
returned the purchase the same month and was due a refund. However, the refund wasnt 
applied to the account. Mrs O says she realised this in March 2023 and refunded the £71.20 
to the PayPal Credit account on 8 March 2023.
On 22 February 2023, PayPal sent a statement to Mrs O with an outstanding balance of 
£132.12. The statement explained that a minimum payment of £5 was required and that this 
was due on 19 March 2023. Mrs O had a direct debit set up for the minimum payment, but 
this was returned. Mrs O says PayPal didnt notify her of the returned direct debit nor attempt 
to take it again. The £5 payment was made by Mrs O on 14 April 2023.
As the payment was missed, PayPal recorded that onto Mrs Os credit file. Unhappy with the 
adverse information recorded by PayPal, Mrs O complained. She said it was incorrect of 
PayPal to spoil her credit file for a £5 returned payment, especially when her account had 
been refunded with £71.20. 
The complaint was referred to our service and an investigator looked into the matter. They 
concluded that PayPal should remove the missed payment marker. They said the 
implications of a marker showing for six years is disproportionate to the amount and the 
circumstances leading to the missed payment. 
PayPal didnt agree and said what it recorded was an accurate reflection of what happened 
and to remove the missed payment marker would be irresponsible. In response to PayPal 
disagreeing with the findings, Mrs O added that the refund of £71.20 was applied prior to the 
£5 minimum payment due date so her account was up to date. 
As PayPal didnt agree with the investigators findings, the complaint has been passed to me 
to decide. 
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of the complaint. I would like to point out Ive read and 
considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is relevant. If I 
dont comment on any specific point, its not because Ive failed to take it on board and think 
about it but because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach what I think is the 
right outcome.
Ive reviewed Mrs Os statement dated 22 February 2023. This makes it clear that a £5 
minimum payment was due on 19 March 2023. It isnt disputed that this payment was 
missed and the £5 wasnt paid until 14 April 2023. 
Lenders have an obligation to report true and accurate information to credit reference 
agencies. In this case, while I understand the payment was only for £5, it was still missed 
and therefore PayPal has acted correctly in reporting this. 
Mrs O has said that she believed she didnt need to make the £5 payment, because the 
£71.20 refund was applied to her account before the minimum payment due date of 19 
March 2023.  
Ive looked at the terms and conditions that govern Mrs Os PayPal Credit account. Section 
2.3 of the terms and conditions explains how the minimum payment can be made. It states 
payments can be made by direct debit, with your debit card or from your PayPal account 
balance. While refunds do reduce the outstanding amount, theyre not given as a way of 
making the minimum payment by the due date. 
Section 7.4 of the terms and conditions says:
The amount you owe us will be reduced by all cleared payments made into the Credit 
Account and any refund due to you from us or a Merchant who has sent us a properly 
completed refund request for a Transaction.
Its clear a refund was finally sent by the merchant, as this shows as being credited to Mrs 
Os account on 8 March 2023. Mrs Os statement balance given on the February 2023 
statement is £132.12. Therefore, after the refund of £71.20 on 8 March 2023, she still had an 
outstanding balance of £60.92. 
In addition, the terms and conditions also say in summary, that the minimum payment 
amount due is the greater of the following: 
i. 2 % of the outstanding balance; or
ii. £5; or
iii. the whole amount of the outstanding balance;
As Ive said above the refund Mrs O received didnt clear the full outstanding amount of 
£132.12. Mrs O still owed £60.92 and the refund she received, isnt an accepted way of 
making the minimum payment. Therefore, Im satisfied Mrs O was still required to make the 
£5 minimum payment detailed on her February 2023 statement. 
As this didnt happen, the missed payment marker is a true and accurate reflection of what 
happened. PayPal hasnt made an error here and while I acknowledge the investigators 
point that the missed payment being recorded is disproportionate, I agree with PayPal that 
removing something that is accurate would be irresponsible. 
Lastly, Ive considered Mrs Os point that PayPal didnt notify her the direct debit payment 
had been missed and didnt try to take it again afterwards. PayPal has provided an email it 
sent to Mrs O, after the payment was missed. Its also provided evidence this email was sent 
to the same email address Mrs O provided our service and that it was opened on 25 March 
2023. This email made it clear the payment was unsuccessful and made no mention that 
PayPal would try to take it again. 
I invited both parties to respond with new information they wanted me to consider before I
made my final decision.
Mrs O didnt agree and said she was due two refunds which she believed would clear her 
PayPal Credit balance. Mrs O says the refunds were delayed and when she realised this, 
she chased the merchant. When the refunds were finally processed, only one was paid to 
her PayPal Credit account. Mrs O says the other refund was paid to a credit card thats 
linked to her PayPal account.
 Given this Mrs O maintains that the missed payment wasnt due to any fault of hers. Mrs O 
also said that PayPal didnt try to take the £5 minimum payment again, nor did it send a 
letter or call her when the payment was missed.
 
In response to the provisional decision, PayPal confirmed it agreed and had nothing further 
to add.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Mrs Os frustrations with the delays in receiving refunds from the merchant and 
that one of these went directly to her credit card. However, that isnt something that I can 
hold PayPal responsible for. 
PayPal issued a statement that clearly showed a £5 minimum payment was due on 19 
March 2023. While one refund was paid to the PayPal credit account before 19 March 2023, 
it still left an outstanding balance. From looking at the emails Mrs O had provided regarding 
the refunds, it appears that the one paid to her credit card was for £53.10. So even if this 
had of been credited to the PayPal Credit and done so before 19 March 2023 (the email 
appears to say it was refunded on 27 August 2022), there would still have been an 
outstanding amount owed and therefore a direct debit still due on 19 March 2023. 
As explained above, refunds arent an accepted way of making payment on the account 
when one is due. Mrs O had an outstanding balance on 19 March 2023, that as per the 
terms and conditions, meant a £5 direct debit payment was due. This payment wasnt made 
and so PayPal, in line with its obligations to report true and accurate information, correctly 
recorded the missed payment. Im therefore unable to recommend PayPal remove this from 
Mrs Os credit file. 
In my provisional decision I explained that PayPal did email Mrs O when the payment was 
missed, and this email was opened. I dont think PayPal needed to call Mrs O or send a 
letter after emailing. I appreciate Mrs O feels that PayPal shouldve tried to take the payment 
again, but PayPal didnt say it would and there isnt an obligation for it to do so. 
My final decision
I dont uphold Mrs Os complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs O to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 October 2023.
