K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs P complain  that National Westminster Bank Plc acted irresponsibly when it 
increased their overdraft facility instead of giving them a consolidation loan to help reduce 
the cost of their borrowing.
background
Mr and Mrs P have  a joint current account with NatWest,  which  has an arranged  overdraft  
facility. In July 2013  Mr and Mrs P wanted to apply  for a consolidation loan to help them  
reduce the cost of their borrowing so they attended a NatWest  branch. But instead of being 
offered a loan, NatWest  offered to increase their overdraft facility.  Mr and Mrs P accepted 
this overdraft increase  and over the years  their overdraft facility was reduced. 
In 2018 Mr and Mrs P complained to NatWest about  the interest they were being charged  on 
their overdraft. They said the overdraft increase they had been given in 2013 had increased  
the cost of their borrowing. And they thought NatWest had acted irresponsibly when it 
agreed to increased  their overdraft facility. 
NatWest didnt uphold  this complaint. It said, having undertaken proportionate affordability 
checks it was satisfied  that Mr and Mrs P could  repay their overdraft in a sustainable way. 
And it doesnt accept  it made a mistake  in how it dealt with its offer to increase Mr and Mrs 
Ps overdraft  facility in 2013.
Mr and Mrs P werent satisfied with NatWests  response to their complaint. So they referred 
it to our service.  While our adjudicator empathised with them, they didnt think NatWest had 
acted irresponsibly in increasing their overdraft facility. They told Mr and Mrs P that they 
thought NatWest had dealt  with their complaint fairly  and they didnt think  it needed to do 
anything more. But Mr and Mrs P dont accept this and asked for their complaint to be 
referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I know  that Mr and Mrs P will be 
disappointed with my decision but having  looked at all the information Ive come to the same 
conclusion as the adjudicator for very similar reasons.  Ill explain why.
I can understand Mr and Mrs Ps frustration  here.  They feel NatWest  shouldnt have 
increased their overdraft facility and they say its decision to do so was irresponsible. So, in 
looking at whats fair and reasonable Ive carefully considered what Mr and Mrs P and 
NatWest have said here.
The key issue for me to determine here is whether NatWest  acted  reasonably and fairly 
when it increased  Mr and Mrs Ps overdraft facility.  They wanted  to reduce the cost of their 
borrowing and feel they were offered a facility that increased it instead.  
Mr and Mrs P think NatWest shouldve given them a loan instead  of increasing their 
overdraft facility as they wouldve paid less interest  if they had been given a loan.  And they 
told our service that NatWest had declined their loan application deliberately  so that it could 
offer to increase their overdraft facility, which would attract a higher interest rate. But 
NatWest said it had no record that Mr and Mrs P applied for a loan in July 2013.  
Ref: DRN50768632Where theres a disagreement about  what happened, as there is here,  I have to base my 
decision based on what I think is more  likely  to have happened in the circumstances, on the 
balance of the evidence available. 
Based on the evidence  Ive seen, I think its more likely than not, on balance,  that if Mr and 
Mrs P had applied for a loan there  would be an audit trail. I would expect to see evidence of 
a loan application, income and expenditure check,  full credit search and proof  that the loan 
application was declined. As theres  no record of any of these I think  its more likely  than not 
that Mr and Mrs P didnt apply for a loan with NatWest in 2013.  
Its possible that, when  Mr and Mrs P attended  their branch in 2013, they had an informal  
discussion with an adviser regarding whether it would be likely that they would be approved  
for a loan. And after being told an application would  most likely be declined on the basis  of 
affordability they chose  not to make a formal application. This may explain why theres  no 
audit trail and may account for why Mr and Mrs P think NatWest declined  to offer them a 
loan. 
So, as I havent  seen any evidence that Mr and Mrs P applied for a loan in 2013  I cant  say 
NatWest deliberately declined a loan application  so it could offer them lending at a higher 
interest rate by increasing their overdraft facility instead. 
When NatWest decided  to offer Mr and Mrs P an overdraft increase in 2013  they accepted it. 
Mr and Mrs P told our service that this increase was unaffordable to them.  But having seen 
Mr and Mrs Ps bank  accounts, Im not persuaded it was. I say this because prior to the 
overdraft increase their account balance was largely kept within  their overdraft limit. There 
were a small  number of occasions when Mr and Mrs P exceeded their overdraft  limit by 
small amounts. But the available evidence suggests  to me that on the occasions that Mr and 
Mrs P exceeded their overdraft facility  they brought their account within  the agreed limit 
quickly after doing  so.
Before agreeing to increase the overdraft facility on Mr and Mrs Ps account, NatWest 
shouldve assessed  the affordability  of credit to ensure that they afford to repay what  they 
were borrowing in a sustainable manner. Based on the bank statements Ive seen, I think  
that Mr and Mrs P wanted and needed the overdraft increase they were  offered. But Ive also 
considered whether NatWest acted reasonably in increasing their overdraft facility.  
Our service cant question how NatWest decides  to operate its business.  Our role is to make 
sure it does so properly within the criteria  it sets out. It isnt for me to tell the bank what 
lending criteria they should use before agreeing  to lend to someone,  but they do need to 
make sure their checks are reasonable and proportionate to the size of the overdraft, the 
cost of repayment and a customers lending  history.
Its up to NatWest which checks  it carries  out. There isnt a set list of checks  needed  and we 
cant say a lender  shouldve  done any particular checks. It uses  its lending criteria to come to 
its decision and its entitled to set those criteria using its commercial judgement. 
NatWest said it carried  out its affordability  checks before agreeing to increase Mr and Mrs 
Ps overdraft  facility. And it said it decided to proceed with the increase because based  on 
the information it had at the time of Mr and Mrs Ps application, it thought  the increase in 
overdraft facility was affordable.  So, it granted  their application.
Ref: DRN50768633Based on what Ive seen  Im satisfied that NatWest  took appropriate affordability checks, 
which Mr and Mrs P passed. So I think it took reasonable steps to ensure Mr and Mrs P 
could afford  to repay the additional money they were borrowing. Ill explain why.
Ive seen evidence  that before NatWest increased Mr and Mrs Ps overdraft facility  it part 
credit scored and reviewed information it held about them. Mr and Mrs P dont believe 
NatWest took their full income and expenditure into account because  it didnt  ask them  about  
this. But based  on what Ive seen Im satisfied  NatWest  considered  information about  their 
employment status, their salary, the way in which they were  managing  their accounts. 
While NatWest may not have asked  Mr and Mrs P about their regular financial commitments 
and expenses it wouldve  been able to see this information from looking at their bank 
account. Im persuaded that after reviewing  Mr and Mrs Ps bank statements, NatWest  were 
able to gain a true and accurate picture  of how they were managing  their account. I think  this 
wouldve enabled NatWest to look at a real time picture of Mr and Mrs Ps income  and 
expenditure. NatWest  said that having undertaken all of these checks, it felt the increase in 
facility was affordable  to Mr and Mrs P. 
Having taken all of these  checks  into account  Im satisfied that they were proportionate to 
the increase in credit limit. So, I cant fairly conclude that NatWests decision to increase  Mr 
and Mrs Ps overdraft facility was irresponsible. 
I also think that if NatWest hadnt  offered to increase Mr and Mrs Ps overdraft facility, and 
their debit balance  had continued  to increase,  they wouldve been placed into an unarranged 
overdraft situation.  This wouldve incurred high charges and they wouldve had to find a way 
to repay  this money.  The cost to Mr and Mrs P in this scenario  wouldve been higher than 
the cost of increasing the overdraft facility  on Mr and Mrs Ps account. So I can understand 
why NatWest offered  Mr and Mrs P the option to increase their overdraft facility. And, while  
Mr and Mrs P may not agree, I think NatWest  was acting in their best interests to avoid them  
entering into an unarranged overdraft situation.  
Mr and Mrs P told our service they struggled  to keep  up with their repayments after NatWest 
increased their overdraft facility. But from the evidence  Ive seen, Im satisfied  that Mr and 
Mrs P managed their account satisfactorily  and consistently made payments to their account  
as was required to reduce  the balance. 
The available evidence indicates  that Mr and Mrs P wanted and used the increased  
overdraft facility. They knew  what their overdraft limit was. And overall, they kept their 
account balance  within the new overdraft limit. After their facility was increased, there were 
occasions when  they exceeded  their overdraft limit but, as before, they brought  their account  
within its permitted limit within days.  I understand that their account was never passed to 
NatWests collection department and, between 2013  and 2018,  they were  able to reduce 
what they owed  considerably. So Im not persuaded the overdraft  increase  was unaffordable 
to Mr and Mrs P.
I havent seen  any evidence to suggest  that the way in which  Mr and Mrs P were managing 
their account  after NatWest increased  their overdraft facility shouldve  alerted it to any 
problems. And theres nothing to demonstrate that Mr and Mrs P told NatWest  they were  
experiencing financial difficulties. From  the evidence Ive seen Mr and Mrs P didnt raise  
issues of affordability until 2018, when they made their complaint to NatWest. So, I dont 
think the bank  acted irresponsibly here or had reason to treat Mr and Mrs P differently. 
Ref: DRN50768634I understand that Mr and Mrs P made two loan applications with NatWest  in March 2007  and 
May 2018, which were  declined. Ive seen evidence that these applications were declined  
following a full credit  assessment  by NatWest on the basis  of affordability.  NatWest told our 
service that, when it obtained  a full credit score, it didnt think Mr and Mrs P had sufficient 
income to repay the loan in a sustainable manner. I think this, again, demonstrates that 
NatWest was practicing  responsible lending and appropriately assessing affordability when 
Mr and Mrs P asked  to borrow additional funds.
Mr and Mrs P have  queried how they could be declined  for a loan when they had been  
approved for an overdraft  facility increase. But as our adjudicator  explained to Mr and Mrs P 
the products NatWest  is prepared to offer its customers is a commercial  decision its entitled 
to take. And I think its reasonable  for a business to offer different products based on the 
results of a credit  search.  
Finally, Mr and Mrs P told our service that the cost of their overdraft wasnt properly 
calculated by NatWest.  But NatWest has provided a calculation  showing how it arrived  at the 
figures Mr and Mrs P were given.  Having seen this, Im persuaded that the figures  Mr and 
Mrs P were  given by NatWest are correct. Im also satisfied that the charges and interest 
that NatWest has applied were in line with the terms and conditions  of Mr and Mrs Ps 
account. It follows that I dont think it did anything wrong.
So for the reasons set out above, Im satisfied NatWest acted reasonably  and fairly  here.  It 
follows that I wont be asking it to do anything more.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs P to 
accept or reject my decision  before  8 June 2019.
