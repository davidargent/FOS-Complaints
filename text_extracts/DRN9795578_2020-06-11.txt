K821x#15complaint
Mr O has complained PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA didnt manage his account well and 
re-allocate payments  back to his account  after chargebacks were raised.
background
Mr O has a PayPal account.  In 2018  he used  his mothers credit card to finance a number of 
transactions. His mother had already raised  concerns with her credit  card provider (who Ill 
call T) about unauthorised  use of her card. When she discovered further transactions  on her 
account she complained to T. Without  her knowledge T raised a chargeback on transactions  
totalling just over £2,660 with PayPal. T didnt get in touch  with Ms O to let her know  what 
was happening.  She was unaware a chargeback with PayPal had been raised.
PayPal, in accordance  with their procedures, accepted the chargebacks and repaid the 
money to T. This resulted  in PayPal also clawing back funds from those accounts that Mr O 
had bought things from with his mothers credit card. Some  of those people  who now no 
longer had money for goods and services were  sending threatening messages to Mr O. 
Mr O tried to contact  PayPal to ask them to stop refunding these transactions through  
chargeback. PayPal confirmed they had no choice but to respond to the chargeback  as they 
had and any further refunds back to PayPal should be managed  through T.
Mr O brought a complaint to us in early April 2018.  When this complaint (and a complaint 
Ms O brought against T) first came to this service, Ms O represented her son and explained  
the serious impact  this was having on him. This was because of his mental health issues  
and the pressure being placed on him by his sellers whod had their own funds depleted by 
PayPal.
T got in touch with PayPal towards the end of April 2018 and let them know they were  
stopping the investigation and were  no longer  pursuing the funds from them.  Within  two 
weeks of this T returned the funds theyd already received back  to PayPal. On 17 May 2018 
PayPal refunded 12 (of 15) payments to those accounts that had money  removed.
Mr O was still receiving  threats about unpaid  accounts. PayPal said theyd not received  the 
full money so they couldnt re-allocate this. T provided our service  with detailed printouts of 
the repayments theyd made and we shared these with PayPal. After a detailed search 
PayPal repaid these  final three amounts on 27 July 2018.
Our investigator reviewed  the evidence. He noted that part of what  had happened had not 
been PayPals  fault. However  the delay  in finding and re-allocating  the payments had 
continued to have a serious impact on Mr O. He asked PayPal to pay Mr O £300 in 
compensation.
PayPal disagreed with this outcome  and has asked an ombudsman  to review Mr Os 
complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached roughly the 
same conclusion as our investigator.
Ref: DRN97955782Ive completed a detailed description  above about what happened in this case as the dates 
and facts are important to my conclusion.
Firstly its worth confirming I cant expect  PayPal to have done  anything differently in 
responding to the chargeback requests  they got from T. It is also their normal procedure  to 
try and take funds from accounts where  unauthorised  transactions may have taken place. 
I think with hindsight Ms O is now aware  of the repercussions of PayPal seeking redress  
from the recipients,  and the serious impact this has had on her son.
But Im not sure that anyone could have known  or expected her sons friends and family  to 
react in the way they did and issue threats  about  debt collection. I think its very possible  that 
everybody would have expected the recipients of the funds  to get in touch with Ms O first 
and try and get funds  from her, rather  than taking the quite extreme steps they appear to 
have taken.
Similarly its not fair for PayPal to have  taken any steps to mitigate  this risk when  nobody  
knew this would develop  as things did.
But once T had returned  the funds, issues were back in PayPals control.  They were 
certainly aware at that stage of the impact this stressful time was having  on Mr O. They  
originally re-allocated 12 payments relatively  swiftly and within a timescale which would have  
helped to minimise the impact on Mr O. But they didnt appear  to be taking a similar  
approach to trying to re-allocate  the three missing payments. In fact it appears it was only as 
we pushed them to expedite matters, they located  these after a detailed  search  of their 
systems (and after having seen evidence supplied by T).
There was just over two months  whilst  these  payments remained missing. During this period 
a wedge was driven between Mr O and his friends  which may be long-lasting. Its also clear 
this impacted his health. As I believe  PayPal  could have taken action sooner to resolve this 
issue, I agree with our investigator they should  pay Mr O £300 for the distress caused.
Some of what happened is inevitably the result of Mr Os own actions. He used  his mothers  
credit card for transactions.  When it became clear  what had happened, he was no longer 
welcome on holiday with friends. Unfortunately for him I dont think  it would be fair to ask 
PayPal to refund any of these costs to him.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is to instruct  PayPal Europe  Sale & Cie, SCA to 
pay Mr O £300 for the trouble caused  and the impact on him.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 July 2020.
