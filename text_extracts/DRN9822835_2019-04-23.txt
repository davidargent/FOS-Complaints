K820x#14complaint
K Limited,  represented  by Mr G a director, complains that National Westminster  Bank  Plc 
(NatWest) caused them to lose out money when it transferred money from a third party bank 
into its NatWest  account.
background
In August  2018,  K Limited made  a payment in euros  from its Dutch  bank account to its 
NatWest Euro Currency  Account  the amount K Limited transferred from the Dutch  account 
was €21,000.00. To process the payment, the Dutch bank used an intermediary bank. 
When K Limited checked its NatWest Euro Currency Account, it noticed that €20,094.13  had 
been debited to the account  when it was expecting the full €21,000.00. K Limited saw the 
funds had been transferred from UK sterling into euros.
K Limited  contacted NatWest to find out what had happened. NatWest  said it had received 
the funds in sterling. And because the account the funds were  sent to was a euro account,  it 
converted it into euros.
K Limited  made a complaint to NatWest because  it said that it had lost out €905.87 when it 
converted the money from sterling  to euros  given the exchange  rate at the time. K Limited 
didnt understand  why the money  had been transferred into sterling in the first place.
K Limited  contacted the bank from which it originally sent the €21,000.00. It said it had used 
an intermediary bank  to send the money. And that the intermediary had converted  the funds 
into sterling and then sent it to NatWest.
NatWest responded  to K Limiteds complaint to say that it didnt agree that the loss in funds 
due to the currency conversion  was because of something it had done wrong. And so it 
didnt uphold  K Limiteds complaint. 
K Limited  then brought its complaint to our service. Our adjudicator didnt think  that the loss 
in funds was as a result  of something  NatWest  did wrong. Because K Limited didnt agree 
with our adjudicators  opinion, the complaint has been passed  to me to make a final decision 
on the matter.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its worth  noting that for me to be able to agree with K Limited, in that NatWest  should refund 
the difference of €905.87, from the funds sent and received, I have to find that NatWest has 
done something wrong. And I dont think it has. Ill explain why in more detail below.
I appreciate this situation has been frustrating for Mr G on behalf of K Limited. There are 
three separate banks involved in this transaction  the bank from where the €21,000.00  was 
originally sent, the intermediary bank that handled  the payment on behalf of the Dutch  bank 
and converted  into UK sterling and NatWest that received the funds.  
Ref: DRN98228352NatWest has sent me copies of its internal systems  that show  the transfer. I can see from 
this that £18,441.86 was received by NatWest and converted to €20,094.13.  So Im satisfied 
that NatWest received  the money  in UK sterling.
NatWest have sent us a screen shot with some information that can be found online about 
receiving international  payments electronically. It says,  if the currency of the payment is 
different from the currency  of your account,  we will automatically convert  sums  of under 
£25,000 equivalent.  So as NatWest  received  the payment in sterling, I dont think  it did 
anything wrong  in converting  this to euros  as K Limiteds account was a euro account.  The 
payment received was less than £25,000.00, so NatWest acted in line with its terms and 
conditions when it automatically converted the money to euros.
K Limited  has referred  to the charges  that have been applied  by NatWest. From the 
information Ive seen, I dont think NatWest have  charged K Limited.  The difference  in 
money is down to the exchange rate at the time.
K Limited  has asked  me to look at the actions of the intermediary bank also,  but I cant in the 
context of a complaint against NatWest. I say this because NatWest  is not responsible  for 
the parties that sent the money. Our adjudicator has already explained to K Limited what 
other options there may be open  to K Limited to pursue this matter further. But that is for K 
Limited to find out and decide. For the reasons  explained above, I dont think  NatWest has 
made a mistake
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G on behalf of 
K Limited  to accept  or reject my decision before 23 May 2019.
