The complaint
Miss C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) was irresponsible to lend to 
her on several occasions.
What happened
NatWest agreed five loans for Miss C between October 2017 and May 2022. Ive
summarised some of the information it provided about these loans in the table below.
NatWest also agreed a £3,000 overdraft limit for Miss C on 9 October 2017, in between
agreeing loans 1 and 2. I understand this was an increase to an existing overdraft limit of
£500.

Miss Cs first loan was refinanced into a second a month later. Miss C took out a third loan
while this second loan was still running and both the second and third loans were refinanced
into a fourth loan taken out in November 2021. This loan is still outstanding. Miss C took out
a fifth loan in May 2022 which was fully repaid shortly after. I understand Miss C held two
current accounts with the bank which were closed earlier this year.
Miss C complained to NatWest about her loans and her overdraft. She said that NatWest
didnt carry out appropriate checks before lending to her. She said she had a current account
with the bank and was fully utilising her £3,000 overdraft which should have raised the 
concern that she was in financial difficulties. Miss C said that the loan provided to her in
November 2017 fuelled her gambling addiction and NatWest would have known that she
spent money on gambling prior to agreeing it. Miss C also said NatWest would have known
about her gambling when it granted her an overdraft of £3,000 and that it failed to identify
that she was borrowing from short term lenders.
NatWest didnt uphold Miss Cs complaint about her loans or her overdraft. It said that it
relied on information she provided along with information from credit reference agencies
when considering her credit applications. It said the checks were carried out in line with its
lending criteria at the time and it would have declined her application had the checks raised
any affordability concerns. NatWest also said that Miss Cs credit file didnt show any
adverse information such as defaulted accounts or county court judgements.
Miss C referred her complaints to us. Our investigator found that NatWest carried out
proportionate checks prior to agreeing each loan and it seemed the loans were affordable for
her. They didnt recommend that her complaint about her loans be upheld. 
Miss C asked for her complaint to come to an ombudsman for review and it came to me. I 
issued a provisional decision on 7 November 2023 explaining why I didnt think Miss Cs 
complaint about her loans or her overdraft should succeed. I allowed time for either party to 
comment on what Id said or provide any new information they wished me to consider when 
making my final decision. NatWest accepted my decision and neither party provided any 
comment or new information. 
Miss C told us in June of this year that NatWest also irresponsibly provided her with a credit
card account. We advised her to raise a complaint about that facility with the bank in the first
instance. To confirm, this is my final decision on the matter and only deals with Miss Cs 
complaint about her overdraft and the above loans.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed everything again and having no comments or any new information to 
consider, I see no reason to depart from my provisional conclusions. Ill set out my reasons 
again for not upholding Miss Cs complaint in this final decision. 
As before, Ive had regard to the regulators rules and guidance on responsible lending (set 
out in its consumer credit handbook  CONC) which lenders, such as NatWest, need to 
abide by. NatWest will be aware of these, and our approach to this type of lending is set out 
on our website, so I wont refer to the regulations in detail here but will summarise and refer 
to them where appropriate.
Before entering into a credit agreement, NatWest needed to check that Miss C could afford
to meet her repayments out of her usual means for the term of the loan, without having to
borrow further and without experiencing financial difficulty or other adverse consequences.
In the case of running account credit, such as an overdraft, where there wasnt a specified
repayment term, NatWest needed to check that Miss C could repay what she borrowed
without difficulty within a reasonable period of time. The checks NatWest carried out needed
to be proportionate to the nature of the credit (the amount borrowed or the term, for
example) and to Miss Cs particular circumstances.
The overarching requirement was that NatWest needed to pay due regard to Miss Cs
interests and treat her fairly. CONC 2.2.2G(1) gave an example of contravening this as
targeting customers with regulated credit agreements which are unsuitable for them by
virtue of their indebtedness, poor credit history, age, health, disability or any other reason.
With this in mind, my main considerations are did NatWest complete reasonable and
proportionate checks when assessing Miss Cs applications for credit to satisfy itself that she
would be able to make her repayments without experiencing adverse consequences? If not,
what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown and, ultimately, did NatWest
make fair lending decisions?
Lending in 2017
NatWest said to Miss C in its final response to her complaint that it assessed her 
applications on the basis of information she provided about her income and expenditure. It 
explained to us that it corroborated that information with the average credit turnover of 
Miss Cs bank accounts and considered her existing credit commitments based on information from credit reference agencies (CRAs). It estimated Miss Cs living costs based 
on national statistical datasets. Ive summarised some of the information NatWest relied on 
in the table below.

5 £2,499 £500 £467 £830* £1,797*
* Information from assessments of other borrowing applications made to NatWest around that time
When Miss C applied for her first loan on 2 October 2017 she declared her income as
£1,800. NatWest recorded that her rent or mortgage was £760 a month and that she had
other monthly costs of £556. It didnt record any non-NatWest loan repayments and
estimated that Miss C had £484 available each month to meet her loan repayment of £157
and any other expenses.
The regulations at the time stated that it wasnt generally sufficient to rely solely on a
customers statement of current income in a creditworthiness assessment. Miss Cs wages
were paid into one of her NatWest bank accounts and so the bank had access to this
information. It would have seen that Miss Cs income was as shed said so further
consideration of this figure wouldnt have revealed an inconsistency.
NatWest said that at the time of the applications there was no adverse information recorded
against Miss Cs accounts such as credit defaults, court judgements or bankruptcy either on
its records or on the CRA data it obtained. I havent seen the detail of the CRA data
NatWest relied on nor has Miss C provided us with a copy of her credit file. In the absence of
any information to the contrary I have accepted that NatWest saw no adverse information on
Miss Cs credit record.
Altogether, I cant say that there was anything in the information NatWest had about
Miss Cs circumstances that should have led it to decline this loan application or should have
prompted it to complete further checks before entering into the agreement. There were no
obvious signs of financial difficulty in the information it relied on and the loan repayments
werent so large relative to Miss Cs means that they were clearly unaffordable. I havent
found that NatWest lent irresponsibly on this occasion.
About a week later on 9 October 2017 NatWest agreed an overdraft limit of £3,000 for
Miss C. This was an open-ended credit facility and NatWest needed to check that Miss C
would be able to repay any money borrowed within a reasonable period of time, not just the
interest and fees. From what I can see NatWest relied on the same information as before
and estimated that Miss C would have enough money left over to repay the overdraft
borrowing even if she borrowed up to the limit. As with the above loan, I cant say that there
was anything in the information NatWest relied on about Miss Cs circumstances that should 
have led it to decline this loan application or should have prompted it to complete further
checks before entering into the agreement. And, if it had verified Miss Cs income from her
bank statements, it would have seen it was as she had said.
Miss C told us that NatWest failed to identify that she was borrowing from short term lendersand was spending money on gambling before it agreed to her overdraft. I havent seen any
evidence of short term borrowing on Miss Cs bank statements covering 2017 and I dont
know to what extent she was using this type of borrowing because I havent seen a copy of
her credit file. There are some gambling transactions on her bank statements but, as 
mentioned, I dont think the information NatWest relied on for its lending decision would have 
raised concerns about the affordability or sustainability of this credit for Miss C and I dont 
think it needed to look into her circumstances further before lending to her. So I cant find 
that NatWest was irresponsible to have increased her overdraft limit on the basis of the
information it had gathered.
Miss C applied for another loan the following month on 14 November (which was disbursed
on the 20th). NatWest relied on the same information as before which yielded similar results.
This might well have been a reasonable and proportionate approach in some circumstances.
However, Miss C had only just taken out a £3,000 loan and now wished to borrow another
£4,000. As mentioned, NatWest had also just agreed an increased overdraft limit of £3,000
for Miss C. Her account had been in credit up to that point but shed gone overdrawn on
13 November and by 16 November her overdraft balance had reached £2,660.
I think all of this should have prompted NatWest to go further in its checks on this occasion.
It would have been proportionate for it to have carefully considered all the information it had
available about Miss Cs income and expenditure to check shed be able to meet her
repayments sustainably for this new loan over the term.
Ive reviewed the bank statements NatWest provided for the account Miss Cs income was
paid into and which now had a £3,000 overdraft limit. I can see her income of £1,900
deposited in October 2017. There are few identifiable expenses but many gambling
transactions - over £2,000 of her overdraft was spent on gambling in the days prior to her
second loan. Miss C shared with us that she had a gambling addiction and said that this loan
fuelled her spending. I can see that Miss C spent over £3,000 on gambling within a few days
of the loan deposit.
It would seem from my summary that Miss C was spending more than her means on
gambling and so it wasnt likely that shed be able to repay any credit without difficulty. 
However, I dont know the detail of Miss Cs financial circumstances at the time. As
mentioned, I dont have a copy of her credit file and Miss C hasnt explained her
circumstances. Aside from identifiable purchases and identifiable gambling spend and
refunds on this bank account statement, there were multiple transfers in and out to other
accounts and cash withdrawals and deposits. These transactions ranged from a few
thousand pounds in August and September, to around £17,000 in October.
Given how the account was being managed, I cant say that Miss C was spending money on
gambling, or anything else, beyond her means and so I cant reasonably find that the loan
was unaffordable for her. I dont think NatWest would have declined to lend to Miss C on the
basis that her spending patterns were evidently causing her financial harm and that further
lending was likely to compound that and so was clearly unsuitable. Altogether, I cant find
that NatWest was irresponsible to have agreed this loan for Miss C.
Lending in 2021 and 2022
NatWest recorded Miss Cs income as £2,280 when she applied for her third loan in
September 2021. It recorded her monthly rent/mortgage repayments as £500 and her
monthly repayments to other creditors as £375. At this point Miss Cs second loan with
NatWest was still ongoing with monthly repayments of £189. Agreeing a new loan with
repayments of £247 would potentially commit Miss C to paying over £800 a month on
unsecured debt, over a third of her stated income.The regulations in place at the time said that certain factors may point to a more rigorous
assessment and others towards a less rigorous assessment. I think NatWest needed to take
more care here because of the level of Miss Cs existing debt repayments. As with her
previous loan, I think it would have been proportionate for NatWest to have carefully
considered all the information it had available to it about Miss Cs income and expenditure to
check shed be able to meet her repayments without difficulty for this total amount of credit
over the loan terms.
Ive reviewed Miss Cs bank statements from the time and her income was as stated, on
average. There was no evidence of gambling at that time and her account had been in credit
for at least six months, usually by several thousand pounds. The account was still being
managed as before, with relatively significant transfers in and out along with cash deposits
and withdrawals, for example over £11,000 the month before. I cant say that Miss C was
spending beyond her means and so I cant reasonably find that the loan was unaffordable for
her based on what Ive seen on her bank statements.
As Ive said above, I dont know the extent of Miss Cs borrowing from elsewhere. Miss C 
hasnt provided any information about her general financial circumstances, beyond 
mentioning she borrowed from short term lenders. I have seen a few token payments to a 
short term lender and a debt collector in the months preceding this loan but in the context of 
the account as Ive described I dont think NatWest would have considered that Miss C was 
in financial difficulty based on these transactions alone. Altogether, I dont think NatWest 
would have declined to lend to Miss C on the basis that she was experiencing financial 
difficulty and further lending was likely to add to that, even had it carried out further checks 
before lending to her.
Miss C applied for another loan two months later in November. NatWest relied on similar
information as before recording Miss Cs income as £2,200, her rent/mortgage as £485 and
her repayments on existing non-NatWest loans as £443. Miss C consolidated her existing
two loans with this loan and so her monthly repayment going forward was £398, slightly less
than before but agreeing this loan potentially committed Miss C to paying close to 40% of
her income on repaying debt. This was Miss Cs fourth and largest loan with the bank in four
years and indebted her for another five years. Altogether, I think it would have been
reasonable and proportionate of NatWest to have considered all the information it had about
Miss Cs means before lending to her again.
Ive reviewed Miss Cs bank statements and Ive seen no evidence of gambling around this
time. As before, there are relatively significant transfers into and out of her account along 
with cash deposits and withdrawals, for example over £20,000 in September. I cant say that
Miss C was spending beyond her means and so I cant reasonably find that the loan was
unaffordable for her. I dont think NatWest would have declined to lend to her on the basis
that she was experiencing financial difficulty and further lending was likely to add to that.
Miss C applied for her fifth and final loan with NatWest in May 2022. For the same reasons
Ive given above for her 2021 loans, I havent found that NatWest was irresponsible to lend
to her on this occasion either.
Summary
Based on the information I have available, Ive concluded that NatWest wasnt irresponsible 
to lend to Miss C in 2017, 2021 or 2022 nor was it irresponsible to have increased her 
overdraft limit in 2017.My final decision
For the reasons given above, I am not upholding Miss Cs complaint about National 
Westminster Bank Plc and dont require it to take any action.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 December 2023.
