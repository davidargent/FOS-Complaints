After the complaint came to us Sunny  offered to uphold loans 13 to 15, but our adjudicator  
thought the loans from loan 4 onwards shouldnt have been given. Sunny didnt agree, so 
the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN63518932the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
Sunny needed  to do more when it approved loans 1 to 3. So I dont think Sunny was wrong 
to give loans 1 to 3 to Miss B.
However I dont think Sunny carried out proportionate checks  for loan 4. Had it done so I 
think it would  have  made a different lending decision. I say this because by loan 4 there 
were clear  signs  that Miss B was struggling  to manage her money. When Miss B applied for 
loan 4 she had two outstanding loans with Sunny and she had active agreements  for other 
short-term high cost credit  products from two other lenders. I think this should have 
suggested to Sunny that her finances  were under pressure. So it was most likely she was 
just borrowing to pay off other loans.  And that this, and any subsequent  loans  provided  in the 
short term, were unlikely  to be sustainably affordable for Miss B. At this point I think  it should 
have stopped lending to Miss B. At least until such point that it had evidence  that her 
finances had stabilised. And I cant see this was the case when it approved loans 5, 6 or 7. 
There wasnt a sufficient  gap in lending for Sunny to have fairly  concluded  her financial 
situation had improved.
It follows I dont think Sunny should have given loans 4 to 7 to Miss B.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history  with Miss B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
Ref: DRN63518933was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Bs case, I think that this point was reached at 
loan 8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss B was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss B had taken out eight  loans in less than nine months. So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Miss B was having  to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan(s) was leaving in her finances  
and that Miss Bs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
From  loan 8 onwards  Miss B was provided with a new loan within  two days of taking 
out a previous one. 
Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. She had 
taken out 15 loans in the 14 months  after her first loan. Sunny ought to have  known 
that Miss B was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but 
to meet  an ongoing need. Miss B had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, 
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
The loans were  instalment loans, each  with six-month  terms. But Miss B frequently  
repaid her loan in the same month that shed taken it out. This isnt how instalment 
loans should usually work.  I think  this pattern of lending should have alerted Sunny to 
the likelihood that Miss B was having  problems managing her money. I think that 
Sunny shouldve been concerned that Miss B might be borrowing elsewhere to repay  
its loans, again increasing her indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Miss B lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Miss Bs ability 
to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
I have carefully considered Sunnys  response  to our adjudicators view. In summary, it 
explained the checks it had carried out on eligibility,  affordability and credit worthiness. It 
said it only ever gave  Miss B a small amount of credit relative to her income.  But these 
points dont change  my conclusion. 
Sunny was required to do more  than check Miss B could afford each individual loan on a 
strict pounds and pence basis. It had to ensure Miss Bs borrowing was sustainably 
affordable, and from loan 4 onwards  there were indications this was not the case. Rather, it 
seems Sunny was unfairly extending  her use of high cost short  term credit.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 onwards, and Sunny should put things right.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Ref: DRN63518934refund  all interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 4 to 15;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
if it chooses, apply  the refund to any outstanding principal balance on loans 12 to 15 
before paying  any remaining balance (if there  is any) to Miss B**; and
remove any negative information  about loans 4 to 7 from Miss Bs credit file
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse, so all entries about  loans 8 to 15 should  be removed from 
Miss Bs credit file.
If Sunny has, as we understand, sold the outstanding debt from loans 12 to 15 to a third 
party it should buy it back before doing what Ive said above. If this isnt possible, Sunny 
needs to make sure that Miss B has paid or will pay no more  in total than the principal  
amounts she was lent. So Sunny  should  (in addition  to the above  if necessary):
arrange to repay  any portion of the sum due to the third party  that is made up of 
interest and charges   including any added by the third party;
refund  any interest and charges  that Miss B has already paid to the third party,  plus 
8% simple interest  from the date of payment to the date of settlement*;
instruct the third party  to remove any information that it may have recorded about the 
loans from Miss Bs credit  file.
If Sunny doesnt buy the debt back then it isnt entitled to make any deductions  from 
the amount that it needs to pay Miss B.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Sunny  to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Miss B a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one. If Sunny intends to apply the refund 
to reduce any outstanding balance, it must do so after deducting the tax.
**If after taking  the above steps  there is still a principal balance due, I remind  Sunny of its obligation to 
treat Miss B fairly and reasonably in any settlement  discussions.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Bs complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should pay Miss B compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 November 2019.
