The complaint
Mr P and the estate of Mrs P are unhappy with the way in which National Westminster Bank 
Plc (NatWest) dealt with matters relating to the estate. 
What happened
Mr P and the estate of Mrs P says Mrs P passed away in July 2018 and Mr P shortly after 
this contacted NatWest to obtain any balances held on his late wifes bank accounts. Mr P 
was aware his wife had accumulated funds over the years, so it was no surprise that in June 
2019 two payments totalling close to £37,000 was identified by NatWest and credited to his 
bank account in June 2019. Mr P and the estate of Mrs P says a few days after crediting 
these monies NatWest contacted Mr P and explained this was an error and a substantial 
amount of the funds credited to his bank account were taken back by NatWest, a few weeks 
later. Mr P and the estate of Mrs P are unhappy with the way the estate has been handled 
by NatWest, they say NatWest unnecessarily asked Mr P to visit a branch with identification 
and they havent been able to provide all the bank account statements relating to Mrs Ps 
bank accounts with them. 
NatWest says they have apologised and accepted they made a mistake crediting funds to Mr 
Ps bank account in error, but those funds belonged to a third party, so they have acted 
correctly asking for these monies to be returned. NatWest says they do not have all Mrs Ps 
bank statements going back to the period in the early 1990s as their records dont go that 
far back. NatWest says they accept they shouldnt have asked Mr P to provide further 
identification and visit the branch as the balance of any funds in Mrs Ps account had been 
settled by this time.
Mr P and the estate of Mrs P were unhappy with NatWests response and referred the 
matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator says that while several issues had been identified in dealing with the late Mrs 
Ps estate, she could only focus on those issues regarding the estate, as a separate 
complaint regarding matters affecting Mr P was being considered separately by this service. 
The investigator concluded the monies credited to Mr Ps bank account belonged to a third 
party and it wasnt unreasonable that NatWest no longer had access to bank statements for 
the late Mrs P going back almost 30 years. The investigator says in any event she was 
limited to any redress she could offer the estate as its not a physical entity and in part why it 
was decided to split the complaint, to include a separate complaint in Mr Ps name. 
Mr P and the estate of Mrs P werent happy with the investigators view and asked for the 
matter to be referred to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision. 
Mr P and the estate of Mrs P have complained how NatWest have handled the 
arrangements of the late Mrs Ps banking accounts and generally how they have dealt with 
matters relating to it. When looking at this complaint I have considered if NatWest actions 
have directly affected the estate of the late Mrs P and if any redress is appropriate in the 
circumstances. I am aware that this service has looked into a separate complaint in Mr Ps 
name regarding matters relating to the estate and the impact on him personally, so I will not 
be commenting on that as this will be considered on its own individual merits. 
Mr P and the estate of Mrs P says NatWest havent been clear on what happened to all the 
monies held in the late Mrs Ps bank accounts and have given conflicting information 
regarding the third-party bank account, where NatWest say the monies belonged. 
What happened here is following the passing of Mr Ps wife, Mr P contacted NatWest to 
arrange for any monies held in her bank account to be made available to him. Mr P says he 
was aware over a number of years his wife had accumulated funds and when NatWest then 
credited his bank account with two sums totalling close to £37,000 this wasnt unexpected. 
From the information made available to this service, I cant see why having credited Mr P 
with a small sum representing the balance of the late Mrs Ps account in early June 2019, 
NatWest then credited him again with the much larger sum of nearly £37,000, later the same 
month, other than a genuine mistake on their part. I say this because from what I have seen 
those larger sums did belong to another customer of NatWests. This seems to have been 
the result of a mix up over the account details and like the investigator, its unclear how Mr P 
and his solicitor got to know of these account details, that said I am satisfied these monies 
were not those belonging to the late Mrs P. Thats not to say NatWest shouldnt have 
checked the details of the correct account before crediting Mr P with any monies from the 
late Mrs P bank account. It is fair to say the wrong account details on the documentation 
provided to NatWest, would have contributed to the mistakes made. 
This service has been provided with some bank statements on the late Mrs Ps bank 
accounts and these show over a number of years, between 2008 and 2012 in the region of 
£25,000 had been withdrawn so while its understandable that Mr P may have thought there 
was more money in those accounts than turned out to be the case, there is no evidence to 
suggest these monies hadnt simply been spent over the preceding years. From the 
information available to me the bank accounts that had been held in the late Mrs Ps name 
had been either closed or any balances transferred into a joint account with Mr P, which has 
subsequently been converted into Mr Ps sole name. While Mr P and the estate of Mrs P 
may not agree, I cant see that NatWest should be able to produce bank statements going 
back to the time they wish, even though that is a frustration for them. This service would 
expect banks, like NatWest, to  produce bank statements going back for a period of six years 
and they have here. 
While Mr P and the estate of Mrs P says they were told the account held in the third-party 
name, where the large sums of moneys came from, was frozen, but from the evidence I 
have seen, I cant see anything to support that. I am satisfied this doesnt alter the fact where 
these funds belonged as this has been made clear by NatWest to this service. I will leave it 
to Mr P and the estate of Mrs P if they feel they need to take this up with NatWest directly, 
although its unlikely NatWest would be able to divulge information relating to third party 
accounts. 
Mr P and the estate of Mrs P says NatWest asked Mr P to visit their branch to provide further identification and a copy of the late Mrs Ps death certificate when this was unnecessary. I 
do accept this point, given NatWest had already settled any outstanding balances due from 
Mrs Ps bank account in June 2019, some months earlier. Its fair to say Mr P has been put 
to some inconvenience by the mistakes NatWest have made in dealing with the late Mrs Ps 
estate. As explained by the investigator this service wouldnt be able to award a 
compensation payment for trouble and upset caused to an estate, as its not a physical 
entity, even if it was believed to be due. In part, this is why the investigator here, decided to 
separate the complaint and deal with Mr Ps issues separately in a complaint under Mr Ps 
name. 
Its important to say the estate has received the correct amount of monies held in the late 
Mrs Ps bank account with NatWest and as a result it hasnt been directly affected by 
NatWests actions here. 
While Mr P and the estate of Mrs P will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking 
anymore of NatWest. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P and the 
estate of Mrs P to accept or reject my decision before 19 May 2021.
