K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  was wrong to 
lend to him. He asks for compensation  and that the loans  are removed from his credit  file.

14 £250 30.10.2015 * 03.11.2015 6 x 81
*these loans were  taken  out while a previous loan was outstanding.
Mr C says Sunny shouldnt have offered this number  of loans over a short  period. He said 
his problems stemmed from gambling and the loans made his situation worse, both 
financially and emotionally.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld. She said Sunny 
shouldnt have offered loans  6 to 14 to Mr C. She said by the time Mr C took out loan 6, 
Sunny should  have  known from his borrowing pattern the loans werent sustainable. 
Sunny didnt agree. In summary,  it said the number  of loans taken out by Mr C reflected the 
flexibility of its product. Sunny said its checks showed the loans were affordable and there  
was no evidence theyd  caused detriment to Mr C. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr C could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Cs 
Ref: DRN31962442income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I 
think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. Such factors include the 
customers income  particularly a lower  income  the amount of the loan repayments and 
the time over which the loan is to be repaid, and the number and frequency of loans  and the 
time over which the customer  has been given loans. Repeated borrowing can signal that the 
borrowing has become,  or is becoming, unsustainable. There may even come a point where  
the lending history and pattern of lending  itself demonstrates that the lending was 
unsustainable.
Id also note here that Sunny was required to establish whether Mr C could sustainably 
repay his loans  not just whether the loan repayments were  affordable  on a strict pounds 
and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. The FCAs Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable  as being 
without undue difficulties:  in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on 
time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  what this means  for Mr Cs complaint.
Sunny did some checks before lending to Mr C. Mr C told Sunny that his monthly income 
was £1,765 throughout the time he borrowed from Sunny. So far as I can tell, Sunny  didnt  
ask about Mr Cs expenditure until loan 9. It then recorded his monthly  expenditure, including  
rent/mortgage, essential spending and credit  expenditure as about  £1,400.  
Sunny says it did credit checks and provided a summary  of the results, which dont appear to 
show anything of concern to Sunny  such as bankruptcy, county court judgements  or that 
Mr C was having other difficulties managing his money.
But I think the way in which Mr C was borrowing from Sunny should have caused  it some 
concerns. 
loans 1 to 5:
The amounts of loans 1 to 5 were relatively small (between £100 and £200). And since  Mr C 
agreed to repay the loans in instalments, his monthly repayments  were smaller than theyd 
have been if hed taken a normal payday loan. But Mr C took out some loans before 
repaying his earlier borrowing. So when looking at the affordability of the loans Sunny 
needed to consider the total amounts  that Mr C needed to repay each month.
The repayments that Mr C needed to make  on his first five loans were relatively modest  
compared to his stated income,  even when he had more than one loan outstanding. Given  
the repayment amounts, what was apparent about Mr Cs circumstances at the time,  and his 
history with Sunny,  I dont  think it would have been proportionate for Sunny to ask him for 
the amount of information that would be needed  to show the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN31962443So I dont  think Sunny was wrong to give loans 1 to 5 to Mr C.
loan 6 onwards:
I think when Mr C asked for loan 6, Sunny should  have  realised  further lending  was 
unsustainable. This was Mr Cs sixth loan in less than three months. I appreciate  that Mr C 
repaid loans early. But he also took out new loans shortly after  or even while a previous 
loan was still outstanding. I think Sunny ought  to have  realised Mr C was having  to borrow  to 
cover the gap in his finances left by repaying previous loans. And he wasnt  making  any real 
inroads into repaying  his indebtedness.  When  Mr C took out loan 13 he had loans from 
Sunny totalling  £550  as compared to the £200 loan hed first taken  out. And when he took 
out loan 14 he had loans totalling  £600 from Sunny. 
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards. These loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of time. 
And the sheer  number of loans was likely  to have had negative implications on Mr Cs ability 
to access mainstream credit, and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
what should happen now?
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr C after, and including, loan 6. So for 
each of those  loans Sunny should:
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr C on the loans.
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 14 should be removed from Mr Cs credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order Elevate Credit International Limited to take 
the steps and pay the compensation set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 November  2019.
