The complaint
Mrs K says S.D. Taylor Limited trading as Loans at Home (LAH) lent to her irresponsibly. 
She says that every time she had made a few repayments the agent encouraged her to take 
further borrowing to increase the amount of interest she would repay. She says the agent 
didnt check if the loans were affordable.

Our adjudicator upheld Mrs Ks complaint and thought the loans from loan 7 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. They thought that LAH shouldve realised, from the pattern of 
lending, that Mrs Ks indebtedness was increasing unsustainably and so it wouldnt be right 
to continue to lend to them. LAH disagreed and so the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that LAH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate checks to make 
sure Mrs K could repay her loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there may come a 
point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that the 
lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
Ive considered the pattern of lending up to loan 7 and I think the lending history and pattern 
of lending itself clearly demonstrates that further lending would likely be unsustainable. So I 
think LAH was irresponsible to continue lending after this point.
Ive considered the points LAH made in response to the adjudicators view. It says that due 
to the passage of time it didnt have enough information to show what checks it did. But it 
was wrong to assume that it didnt do any checks at all, or inadequate checks. 
But these arent new points  and its the pattern of lending itself rather than the checks the 
business did that is the main consideration by loan 7. This pattern doesnt demonstrate to 
me that the lending from 24 July 2008 was sustainable. So the points raised by LAH havent 
changed my decision and Im upholding this complaint in part.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mrs K paid on loans 7 to 34;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from 24 July 2008 onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans approved from this point 
onwards should be removed from Mrs Ks credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to take off tax from this interest. LAH must give 
Mrs K a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if they ask for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mrs Ks complaint. 
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 September 2020.
