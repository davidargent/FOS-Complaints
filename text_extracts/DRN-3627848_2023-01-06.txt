The complaint
Ms M complains that PrePay Technologies Limited closed her account without giving 
reasons.
What happened
Ms M had an account with PrePay, which was administered by an agent. To keep things 
simple Ill refer to PrePay in this decision. 
On 9 December 2021, PrePay wrote to Ms M to say it had recently undertaken a review of 
her business account arrangements with it  and had decided to close Ms Ms account. It 
said that it would close Ms Ms account within the next 60 days, and that during this period 
her account would remain non-operational. On 6 January, PrePay closed the account.
Ms M contacted PrePay to ask for reasons it had done this. Dissatisfied, she referred the 
matter to us.
Our investigator looked at the complaint and concluded PrePay had acted in line with the 
terms and conditions when it closed Ms Ms account. Ms M didnt agree. The complaint has 
been referred to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
The terms and conditions that applied to Ms Ms account said that PrePay  or its agent 
acting on its behalf  could terminate the agreement at any time. It could do this by giving 
two months notice. In some circumstances, it could do this immediately.
In Ms Ms case, although PrePays agent said it would close the account within 60 days, it in 
fact did so on 6 January, just 28 days later. It also said that the account would remain non-
operational while this was happening. In effect, Ms M lost the use of the account 
immediately.
Looking at everything, Im satisfied the terms and conditions allowed PrePay to close Ms Ms 
account. And even if I accept that PrePay may not have had cause to close the account 
immediately, it doesnt appear Ms M was using the account at the point PrePay gave notice 
of the closure: the statements Ive seen show the account had a zero balance, and hadnt 
been used in the three months prior to the closure. I also note that Ms M told PrePay on 9 
December 2021 that as there was Â£0 in the account it wont matter if its closed  and that 
she planned to cut up her card.
Ms M also wants to know why PrePay closed her account. But where PrePay closes her 
account in these circumstances, it doesnt need to give reasons  just as Ms M wouldnt 
need to give reasons if she wanted to close her account. Nor would it be appropriate for me 
to tell PrePay to tell Ms M its reasons.
Ms M has told us that the closure of the account affected her business  in particular, clients 
wanted to pay her by bank transfer, and once her account was closed she couldnt receive 
any payments. I have every sympathy for Ms M, and dont doubt that this may have caused 
her real difficulties. But as Ive found PrePay was entitled to close Ms Ms account, this isnt 
something I can award compensation for  she would have lost access to her account in any 
event. 
Finally, Ms M feels that PrePays agent may have received information about her from 
another business in the same group of companies. Ive checked the terms and conditions, 
and Im satisfied this allowed PrePays agent to share information within its group of 
companies. But here Im only looking at the actions of PrePay and its agent in closing the 
account  any concerns Ms M has about the actions of another business need to be looked 
at separately.
My final decision
For the reasons above I dont uphold Ms Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 February 2023.
