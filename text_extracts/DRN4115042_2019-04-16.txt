K820x#14complaint
Ms M complains that loans she had from Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) were  
unaffordable.
background
Ms M had three loans from Lending Stream between November 2013 and January 2014:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment* Due Repaid
1 30 Nov 2013 £400 160d £216 8 May 2014 Outstanding
2 15 Dec 2013 £50 173d £233 5 Jun 2014 Outstanding
3 9 Jan 2014 £150 176d £266.80 3 Jul 2014 Outstanding
* Maximum  four-weekly instalment due on all overlapping  loans
Ms M says she was on a debt management  plan and was reliant  on short-term lending  when  
Lending Stream approved three loans in quick succession. She says she had a poor credit  
record and was suffering  from a mental health condition  at the time. Ms M adds that she had 
two dependent children  and loan money  was being used for regular household expenses.
Lending Stream says it asked Ms M about  her income and expenditure and checked  her 
credit file for all three loans. It said that, although  the repayments  were well within Ms Ms 
disposable income, the timing of loan 2 was such that affordability may have been marginal. 
It offered  to refund interest and charges on loan 2 (plus 8% statutory  interest)  and remove 
any associated negative  information from Ms Ms credit  file. It added that all three loans were 
now with a debt collection agency.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. Although she wasnt 
satisfied that Lending  Stream had done enough checks, she didnt find better  checks would 
have changed  the lending  decisions.
Ms M responded to say, in summary, that her bank statements showed she was consistently 
running at a deficit and was only kept afloat by borrowing. She maintains that if Lending 
Stream had carried out proper checks it would have seen this along with the adverse 
information on her credit  file. Ms M adds she was borrowing from eight to ten other short-
term lenders between November 2013  and January 2014.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Lending Stream was required to lend responsibly.  It should  have  made checks to make sure 
Ms M could afford to repay  the loans before it lent to her. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Ms M was borrowing, and her lending  history. 
But there was no set list of checks Lending Stream had to do.
When Ms M applied for the first loan from Lending Stream she told it her income was £2,150 
and her monthly expenditure was £1,650. Ordinarily, Id consider such checks  went  far 
enough as Ms M could  afford the highest  repayment, of £216, from her disposable  income. 
But Lending  Stream also carried out a credit check, and I can see from Ms Ms credit file, 
this would have  shown three  defaults in eighteen months, of which one was in April 2013.
Ref: DRN41150422So, for all the Lending  Stream loans, I think a proportionate check should  have included 
asking Ms M whether she had any other short-term loans.
I acknowledge Ms M says she had between  eight and ten short-term  loans between  
November 2013  and January 2014,  but I can only see one which  would have been 
outstanding at the time of the Lending  Stream applications. Ms M had borrowed £100 from 
this lender on 15 November 2013,  and £125 was due to be repaid in January 2014.  As it is, 
Ms M repaid that loan on 3 Jan 2014, so it wasnt outstanding at the time of loan 3.
However, even taking into account  the additional £125 repayment Ms M needed to make to 
the other short-term lender, I find she could also afford the highest scheduled repayments on 
loans 1 and 2 combined.
So, even if Lending  Stream had carried out better checks, Im satisfied it would still have 
found the loans to be affordable to Ms M. Ms M had paid the first instalment of loan 1 on 
time by the time she applied for loan 3 and I cant see any evidence  that Lending Stream  
knew of her mental health condition. I acknowledge she told Lending  Stream she was in 
financial difficulties, but that was only after all three loans  had been  approved.
I accept what Ms M says about the deficit it would have seen in her bank statements, but 
Lending Stream was entitled to rely on the information provided by Ms M about  her 
disposable income at that stage and it wasnt obliged to check  her bank  statements.
Nevertheless, Ms M can now still contact Lending  Stream about the offer it made  on loan 2.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2019.
