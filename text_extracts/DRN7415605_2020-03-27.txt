K821x#15complaint
Ms C complains that Provident  Personal Credit Limited was irresponsible when it provided 
her with 18 loans between June 2006  and December 2014.
background
The 18 loans Provident provided to Ms C were home-collected loans. This meant that a 
Provident agent engaged  with Ms C at her home  during  the approval process and to collect 
the repayments. This table contains  some  of the information Provident has provided to us 
about Ms Cs loans:

*these loans  were repaid shortly after later loans were  taken.  Its likely that the later loan was used  to 
repay them so I havent included the weekly instalments  due on those loans in the highest weekly  
amount column for the later loans.
Our adjudicator issued  her assessment explaining why this Service wasnt able to look at 
Loans 1 and 2. And she also told Provident  why she thought we could look at Loans 3 to 12 
even though it thought  Ms C had complained about  them too late. 
The adjudicator recommended that Ms Cs complaint  be upheld from the point she took 
Loan 4 and that Provident should put things right. It hasnt responded to her view.  As the 
complaint hasnt been resolved informally, it has come to me  an ombudsman   for a final 
decision. If Ms C accepts my decision  it will be binding  on the parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN74156052This Service doesnt have  jurisdiction  to look at complaints about home collected credit  loans 
provided by Provident  before April 2007  (Loans 1 and 2). 
Additionally Provident says that this Service shouldnt consider Ms Cs complaint about  
Loans 3 to 12. This is because  it says  she complained too late. 
The rules  say that this Service cannot consider a complaint if a complainant refers it to us 
more than six years after the date of the event  being complained of - or, if later  more than 
three years from the date on which the complainant became aware or ought reasonably 
have become aware that they had cause for complaint (unless Provident consents or there  
were exceptional  circumstances). 
Our adjudicator explained in her assessment of Ms Cs complaint that she thought  Ms C 
complained within three  years of when she knew or she ought reasonably to have known 
she had cause to complain.  And Provident  hasnt provided a response to that assessment.  
In these circumstances and having  reviewed  this matter myself, Im satisfied that Ms C 
complained about loans  3 to 12 in time. So I am making a decision about  all the loans  taken 
since April 2007. And although  I cannot  make a finding on those first two loans I am able to 
take the existence of them into account  so far as my consideration of Ms Cs broader  
borrowing relationship  with Provident  is concerned. 
At the time Provident  provided the loans  to Ms C it was licensed by the Office of Fair Trading 
(OFT). There is no doubt that businesses like Provident had a duty not to act irresponsibly. 
And over the years the regulations and guidance have evolved. In the earlier part of this 
lending relationship, broader  good  practice  dictated  that  lenders should  ensure that all loan 
applications went through sound and proper credit  assessments and that the interests  of the 
borrowers should be taken into full account.  In January 2008 the OFT issued the Consumer 
Credit Licensing  General  Guidance for Licensees  and Applicants on Fitness  and 
Requirements  clarifying some of the regulators thoughts on what  it considered  to be 
irresponsible lending.
The guidance explained  that the aim of the OFT was to ensure  that an appropriate standard 
of consumer protection was in place and that it would focus on a several things when 
assessing fitness of applicants  for licenses. One of those considerations was integrity, 
adding that The way you operate any aspect  of a business may well be relevant to your 
fitness to hold a consumer  credit  licence. It went on to provide examples of the kind of 
evidence that may involve  integrity issues. The final example stated   evidence of business  
practices that appear to the OFT to be deceitful  or oppressive or otherwise unfair or 
improper whether  unlawful or not and whether arising in relation to the licensed business or 
otherwise with particular regard  to any breaches  of OFT guidance.  This could  include 
evidence of irresponsible lending.
Ref: DRN74156053The guidance added that Lenders  may take different approaches  to responsible  lending  in 
line with variations between the needs  of different sectors of the market.  However, lenders 
should always take reasonable care in making loans or advancing lines of credit and should 
take full account of the interests of consumers in doing so. They should undertake proper 
and appropriate  checks on the potential borrower's creditworthiness  and ability to repay the 
loan and to meet the terms of the agreement. The checks should be proportionate, taking 
account of the type of agreement, the amounts involved, the nature of the lenders 
relationship with the consumer, and the degree  of risk to the consumer.  So, it seems that 
the avoidance of unfair  practices  that may result in detriment to consumers was central to 
the OFTs guidance.  And this was emphasised in the annex  in the guidance.  It listed a 
number of practices that the OFT deemed  unlawful and/or considered  unfair or improper. 
The final one of these  was as follows:    
Irresponsible lending
Lending irresponsibly  contrary  to the provisions of section  25(2B)  of
the Consumer  Credit Act 1974, by failing  to take reasonable care in
making loans or advancing lines of credit, including making only
limited or no enquiries about consumers' income  before  offering
loans, and failing to take full account  of the interests of consumers
in doing so.
In summary,  when granting  licences, the OFT had regard to whether businesses  were being 
run with integrity with particular concern  around whether licence holders were engaging  in 
unfair business practices of which irresponsible lending was an example.  Businesses  had to  
take reasonable care to consider the risk to the borrower and take full account of the 
borrowers interests. 
So before granting  credit  to Ms C, Provident  had to carry out reasonable enquiries. These 
had to take account of the type of credit, the amounts involved, the nature of the lender's 
relationship with the borrower, and the degree  of risk to the borrower.  As I dont know  what  
information it obtained about  Ms C, I'm not able to say whether  its enquiries went  far 
enough.  But  Im also - at this late stage - unable to say what  any such enquiries  wouldve 
shown. In these  circumstances I dont think I can safely  conclude  that Provident was 
irresponsible when  it provided Loan 3. I accept that this was Ms Cs third loan but it had 
been over a year since shed taken Loan 1 (which had been  repaid earlier  in July 2007) and 
the amount hadnt increased  since Loan 1. Her repayments for Loans 2 and 3 had been 
similar (as both overlapped with the previous loan).  I have some concerns about the pattern 
which was developing  but on balance Ive decided not to uphold  Ms Cs complaint about 
Loan 3.
However, with the over-arching obligation on Provident not to act irresponsibly in mind, Im 
not persuaded that it did so from the point it approved Loan 4 for Ms C. I dont think  that 
Provident was taking full account of her interests  when it continued to lend to her in this way 
- from the point she took Loan 4 and thereafter.  
By the time Ms C took Loan 4 she had been borrowing from Provident for 21 months. She 
had taken Loan 2 whilst  Loan 1 was still live. And a week after repaying Loan  1 she took 
Loan 3. Loan 4 was for the highest amount yet - £300  and Loan 3 was still live  meaning 
that her weekly repayments were  also increased - to £16.50. This equated to around £70 per 
month  which  was more  than double the amount shed initially  had to repay with Loan 1. 
Ms C took Loan 5 (higher again  - £350) the day before she repaid Loan 3  suggesting she 
used Loan 5 to repay  Loan 3. And Loan 4 was still live. 
Ref: DRN74156054On 1 December  2008 Ms C borrowed  £1,100 (Loan 6). This was around three times the 
amount shed previously  been borrowing. And now she was taking it over a term of more  
than two years whereas  previously her loans had been taken over around a year.  She repaid 
Loans 4 and 5 on the following  day  no doubt from the Loan 6 advance. And although  she 
now only had one live loan the weekly repayments  were £22  around £95 per month and as 
Ive mentioned  due to last over two years.  Less than a year later Ms C was approved  for 
Loan 7 - £600. This meant that Ms Cs repayments  amounted to £43 per week (around £186  
per month).
At the point Ms C took Loan 8 (November  2010),  Loan 6 was still outstanding and shed 
been indebted to Provident  for over four years with no breaks. 
And in 2010 the OFT issued its new guidance  the Irresponsible Lending Guidance (ILG). 
In this the OFT sought to expand on its definition  of irresponsible lending, which I covered 
above, and also provide  greater clarity  for businesses as to what  it considered  might  
constitute irresponsible lending practices. And it outlined its general principles for fair 
business practice which included - amongst  other things - making a reasonable assessment 
of whether a borrower could afford to meet repayments in a sustainable manner. It added 
that in the OFT's view,  all assessments of affordability should involve a consideration of the 
potential for the credit  commitment to adversely impact on the borrower's financial situation, 
taking account  of information that the lender  was aware of at the time the credit was granted.  
'Assessing affordability', was described  as a 'borrower-focussed  test' which  involved a lender 
assessing a borrower's ability to undertake a specific credit commitment,  or specific 
additional credit  commitment,  in a sustainable manner, without the borrower  incurring 
(further) financial difficulties and/or experiencing adverse  consequences.
And the ILG added that whatever means  and sources of information lenders employed as 
part of an assessment of affordability they should be sufficient  to make an assessment of the 
risk of the credit sought being unsustainable for the borrower in question. It said In our view 
this is likely to involve  more than solely assessing the likelihood of the borrower being able to 
repay the credit in question. We consider that before granting credit,  significantly increasing  
the amount of credit, or significantly increasing the credit limit under an agreement for 
running account credit, lenders should  take reasonable steps to assess  a borrower's likely 
ability to be able to meet repayments under the credit agreement in a sustainable manner .
The OFT clarified that 'in a sustainable  manner' meant that could be repaid  by the borrower:
without undue difficulty  in particular without incurring or increasing  problem 
indebtedness
over the life of the credit agreement or, in the case of open-end agreements, within a
reasonable period of time
out of income  and/or  available savings,  without having to realise  security  or assets.
Undue difficulty was further clarified  as meaning that a borrower should be able to make 
repayments:
while also meeting  other debt repayments and other normal/reasonable outgoings
and
without having  to borrow further to meet these repayments.
Ref: DRN74156055I think that last bullet point is of particular relevance in Ms Cs case in light of the section  in 
the ILG which  states that a lender would be lending irresponsibly  if it granted a loan if it was 
known, or reasonably ought to be suspected, that the credit is likely to be unsustainable.  
By Loan 8 Ms C had been borrowing from Provident for over four years without any breaks 
in her indebtedness   and eight  of those loans were  provided even though  the OFT had 
issued more guidance to lenders - through the ILG - about their responsibilities and its 
expectation of the fair treatment of borrowers by licensed credit  providers. 
The pattern  of Ms Cs borrowing was clearly indicative  of someone borrowing to repay  earlier 
credit. And the amounts she was borrowing meant that her indebtedness was growing.  More 
and more of her income was having  to be used to repay Provident. And this doesnt  even 
take into account that some loans were repaid early with funds  from later Provident loans 
causing the interest from the earlier loan to roll into the later one. Provident lending in this 
way led Ms C to pay truly enormous amounts of interest when the funds she actually 
received is taken into account.  So the true cost to Ms C was higher  than the  already very 
high  Annual Percentage Rates set out on her agreements.
I think that Ms C lost out because Provident continued to provide her with credit from Loan 4 
onwards. She took a further  13 loans over the following six and a half years.  And from what  I 
can see, there was never a period during which Ms C wasnt indebted to Provident in that 
time. On occasion she had three  live loans and I can see that she often took new loans at 
the point she repaid  earlier ones  - all indicating that she was borrowing to repay earlier  
loans. I note from her complaint form that Ms C says she recalls Whilst still paying off
the loans I would be contacted by the collector  saying I was eligible for another  loan and I 
could pay off the previous loan by doing this. When you are in a difficult situation financially 
this seems an easy option and a short  term solution. This wasnt  a sustainable solution and 
I think that it was irresponsible for Provident  to continue to lend to her in this way.
Ms Cs indebtedness  was unfairly prolonged and the sheer number  of loans was likely to 
have had negative  implications on her ability to access mainstream (and cheaper) credit and 
so kept her in the market for these expensive loans.
So Im upholding  Ms Cs complaint about  Loans  4 to 18.
putting things right
Provident shouldnt  have provided Loans 4 to 18 to Ms C  in other words it shouldnt  have 
provided her with any of the loans taken from (and including) March  2008. I understand that 
there may be a balance  outstanding on Loans 17 and 18.  If Provident has sold the 
outstanding debts it should  buy these  back if it is able to do so and then take the following 
steps. If Provident is not able to buy the debts back then it should  liaise  with the new debt 
owner to achieve  the results outlined below.
a)Provident should add together the total of the repayments made  by Ms C towards  
interest, fees and charges on Loans 4 to 16 
b)It should calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Ms C 
which were considered as part of a), calculated from the date she originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
Ref: DRN74156056c)Provident should remove all interest, fees and charges from the outstanding balance  
on Loans 17 and 18, and treat any repayments made by Ms C as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on those outstanding loans. If this results  in Ms C 
having made overpayments then Provident  should refund these overpayments  with 
8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments 
would have arisen, to the date the complaint  is settled. 
Provident should then refund the amounts  calculated in a) and b) and move  to 
step e)
d)If there  is still an outstanding balance after the steps at c) have been completed, then 
the amounts calculated in a) and b) should be used  to repay any balance  remaining 
on the outstanding loans
If this results  in a surplus then the surplus  should  be paid to Ms C. However, if there 
is still an outstanding  balance then Provident should  agree an affordable repayment 
plan with her. It shouldnt  pursue outstanding balances made up of principal it has 
already written-off.  
e)The number of loans  being upheld means that any information  recorded about them 
is adverse, so if they still appear  on Ms Cs credit file, Provident  should remove  them 
entirely. 
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires Provident  to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Ms C a certificate 
showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above I uphold Ms Cs complaint in part and require Provident 
Personal Credit Limited to put things right in the way Ive explained.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 April 2020.
