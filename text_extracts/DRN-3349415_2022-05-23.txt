When Mrs K complained to AvantCredit it didnt uphold her complaint so she brought her 
complaint to us. One of our investigators looked at the complaint and thought that 
AvantCredit shouldnt have provided the loan. Our investigator explained why she was 
recommending that the complaint should be upheld and she set out directions indicating 
what AvantCredit should do to put things right. 
AvantCredit disagreed. It mainly said that Mrs Ks spending on credit would be around £827 
per month after taking out this loan, which was around 56% of her income and she would still 
have around £318 left after paying its loan on top of her other monthly outgoings.
So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved, it comes to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to complaints like this on our website and Ive followed that 
approach when deciding this complaint. Having done so, I think our investigator reached a 
fair and reasonable outcome and I am upholding Mrs Ks complaint for broadly the same 
reasons. Ill explain why I say this. 
The rules dont say what a lender should look at before agreeing to lend. But reasonable and 
proportionate checks should be carried out. Lenders must work out if a borrower can 
sustainably afford the loan repayments alongside other reasonable expenses the borrower 
also has to pay. This should include more than just checking that the loan payments look 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation  a proportionate check might also 
require the lender to find out the borrowers credit history and/or take further steps to verify 
the borrowers overall financial situation.  
If reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out, I need to consider if a loan 
wouldve been approved if the checks had been done. If proportionate checks were done 
and a loan looked affordable, a lender still needed to think about whether there was any 
other reason why it would be irresponsible or unfair to lend. For example, if the lender 
shouldve realised that the loan was likely to lead to significant adverse consequences or 
more money problems for a borrower already struggling with debt that cant be repaid in a 
sustainable way. 
I have reviewed the information AvantCredit gathered when it agreed to provide this loan. 
Alongside asking Mrs K what her regular outgoings were each month, AvantCredit also 
carried out its own credit checks to understand Mrs Ks credit history and current credit 
commitments and it took steps to verify that her declared income was around £1,456 per 
month.  
I've thought carefully about what AvantCredit has said, including the comments it has made 
in response to our investigators view, but I dont think that AvantCredit made a fair lending 
decision when it provided this loan.
It isnt unusual for applicants for this type of loan to have a credit history showing other 
lending or even an impaired credit record  and I wouldnt expect these things would 
necessarily be enough to prompt a responsible lender to decline a loan application.
But AvantCredit told us it saw from its credit checks that Mrs K already needed to pay 
around £764 just on servicing her existing credit commitments  equivalent to more than half 
her take home pay. I think that this was such a significant proportion of Mrs Ks monthly 
income it was a clear warning sign that she was already over-reliant on credit and potentially 
an indication that she was having serious money problems. 
That was borne out by other information AvantCredit saw in its credit checks showing that 
within the last 3 years, Mrs K had incurred six defaulted accounts- including one that had 
gone into default just 21 months earlier.
Nevertheless, she had opened other new credit accounts  five in total over the last 
12 months, including one within the previous 3 months. The outstanding balances on three 
of her accounts had increased during the same 3 months period and she had closed no 
accounts during this time. All in all, Mrs K had borrowed a further £987 in the 6 months 
period running up to her applying for this loan  despite already having outstanding defaulted 
accounts reflecting debt she couldnt afford to maintain in line with her contractual 
obligations. 
This information looked to be clearly at odds with AvantCredits affordability assessment 
suggesting Mrs K had more than £300 spare cash each month and I think AvantCredit 
shouldve realised it couldnt fairly rely on the figures it had worked out. 
Given that AvantCredit understood that Mrs Ks monthly take home pay was on average 
around £1,456, this meant that after she had taken out this loan with AvantCredit, Mrs K 
would be paying more than 56% of her net pay to creditors. I agree with our investigator that 
this was such a significant proportion of Mrs Ks monthly income AvantCredit couldnt 
reasonably say it was likely that she would be able to repay the loan in a sustainable way 
over the loan term. 
To sum up, I think that AvantCredit shouldve realised that Mrs Ks credit file showed that 
managing her credit had got beyond her control, she already had debt she had been unable 
to repay and AvantCredit should have realised that this loan was likely to add to her overall 
indebtedness and financial difficulty. I think thats borne out by the payment problems Mrs K 
ultimately ran into with the loan which, in my view, were reasonably foreseeable. So, I am upholding Mrs Ks complaint that she should not have been given the loan.
This means that as Mrs K has been further indebted with a high amount of interest on a loan 
that she shouldnt have been provided with she has lost out as a result of what AvantCredit 
did wrong. I think AvantCredit needs to take the following steps to put things right.
Putting things right
Our investigator didnt recommend that AvantCredit should pay any additional redress. 
Mrs K hasnt commented on that and I havent seen anything which makes me think 
AvantCredit acted unfairly towards Mrs K in any other way. 
So Im not awarding any additional redress. 
And I think it is fair and reasonable for Mrs K to repay the capital amount that she borrowed, 
because she had the benefit of that lending. But she has paid extra for lending that should 
not have been provided to her.
In line with this Services approach, Mrs K shouldnt repay more than the capital amount she 
borrowed.
AvantCredit should buy back outstanding debt it sold before doing what I have outlined 
below. If AvantCredit isnt able to buy the debt back then it should liaise with the new debt 
owner to achieve the following:
add up the total amount of money Mrs K received as a result of having been given 
the loan. The repayments Mrs K made should be deducted from this amount.
If this results in Mrs K having paid more than she received, then any overpayments 
should be refunded along with 8% simple interest* (calculated from the date the 
overpayments were made until the date of settlement).
If any capital balance remains outstanding, then AvantCredit should attempt to 
arrange an affordable/suitable payment plan with Mrs K.
Whilst its fair that Mrs Ks credit file is an accurate reflection of her financial history, 
its unfair that she should be disadvantaged by any adverse information recorded 
about a loan that was unfairly provided. So AvantCredit should remove any negative 
information recorded on Mrs Ks credit file regarding the loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to deduct tax from this interest. AvantCredit 
should give Mrs K a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted if she asks for 
one.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct AvantCredit of UK, LLC to take the steps I've set out 
above to put things right for Mrs K.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2022.
