K820x#14complaint
Ms S is concerned there may have been  a security breach  which meant 
National Westminster Bank Plc shared her details with fraudsters. Ms S complains that when 
she called  NatWest about a fraudulent text message she received she was told there had 
been a breach in security.  
background
On 8 April 2019  Ms S received  a fraudulent text message. The text message appeared as if 
it had been sent by NatWest and asked Ms S to provide personal information. Shes told us 
that she initially followed a link provided  in the text message but became concerned when  
she was asked to give her private  password  in full. Ms S then called NatWest.  
During the call Ms S was told that the text she had received was part of a scam  and wasnt  
from NatWest.  At the end of the call the person Ms S spoke with said there had been a 
breach in security. 
Ms S called  NatWest again the following day as she was concerned about the information 
shed been given in the previous call and that her details may have been  compromised. The 
person she spoke with repeated that the text was part of a scam. She explained NatWest 
was looking at the situation to try and establish how phone numbers were obtained by the 
people who sent the text message. Ms S complained  and NatWest  responded on 
1 May 2019.  
In its response,  NatWests  complaint  handler  said they hadnt been able to listen  to the 
original call Ms S had made. But they accepted Ms S had been  given incorrect information 
and apologised. NatWest also confirmed there had been no security  breach leading to Ms S 
details being shared  externally and said there  are various  ways  fraudsters can send 
messages that appear to be from a bank.  
NatWest didnt find any evidence of a security breach that led to Ms S details being  shared 
and didnt offer any compensation. Ms S referred  her complaint to our service and an 
investigator looked at what  had happened. She forwarded Ms S the calls she had with 
NatWest on 8 and 9 April 2019. The investigator  thought NatWest  had dealt  with Ms S 
complaint fairly so didnt ask it to pay compensation. 
Ms S didnt agree and said she was told there was a security  breach during the first call and 
that NatWest said it was still investigating what had happened during  the second  call. As 
Ms S didnt accept the investigators  view her complaint has been passed to me to make  a 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Ms S was so concerned after she received the text message on 
Ref: DRN619696128 April 2019. Shes told us she became suspicious when she was asked to provide her full 
password which  is why she decided to call NatWest. I can see Ms S has been  sent a copy of 
the 8 April 2019 call and Ive also listened  to what she was told. 
During the call, NatWest  quickly  told Ms S that the text she received was part of a scam and 
not genuine. But I agree  that at the end of the call the person she spoke to said he believed 
there had been  a breach  in the security  system.  I appreciate  this concerned  Ms S and 
caused her to call NatWest back the following  day. 
When Ms S spoke with NatWest on 9 April 2019  she was again  told that the text she 
received was part of a scam. This call handler  said NatWest was trying to establish  how the 
fraudsters had got customer numbers. But I didnt find that Ms S was told there had been a 
breach during this call. And, as the call handler said, NatWest was still looking at how 
numbers were shared  at this point. 
Ms S complained and NatWest responded on 1 May 2019. In its response  NatWest 
apologised for the misleading information  given during  the first call and confirmed there had 
been no security breach.  I think thats  reasonable. I appreciate Ms S was initially  given some 
incorrect information but when she called on the following day she was told NatWest was 
investigating. And that was the correct  information. So there  was a period of less than 24 
hours where  Ms S was under the impression there had been a breach. NatWest wrote to 
Ms S about her complaint  on 1 May 2019 and confirmed no breach had occurred. 
Whilst I appreciate how concerned Ms S was, I havent found  grounds to tell NatWest to pay 
compensation. I agree it did make a mistake on 8 April 2019 but the point was clarified  the 
following day and NatWest has since apologised in its response to the complaint.  I think 
thats reasonable in the circumstances.  Ms S has told us how concerned  she is that 
fraudsters have obtained her details but I havent seen anything to show  that NatWest was 
responsible for her number being  used  as part of an attempted  scam  or that its had a 
security breach. Looking  at everything  provided  by both Ms S and NatWest, Im satisfied its 
dealt with the complaint fairly  so Im not telling it to do anything else. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 September  2019.
