Mr M said ECI didnt do enough  checks on his financial position; if it had done, he concludes 
it would  have seen  the loans were  unaffordable for him. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ms complaint and thought the loans from 3 to 12 
shouldnt have been given. ECI disagreed with our adjudicators view but it offered  to settle 
Mr Ms complaint on loans 6 to12 and to amend his credit file. Our adjudicator  told Mr M that 
ECIs offer was not in line with our approach. Mr M rejected ECIs offer and the complaint 
was passed to me.
None of the parties commented on loans 1 and 2 being rejected, so I dont need to look at 
those loans again. And as ECI have  agreed  to uphold loans 6 to 12, I dont  need  to look at 
those loans again. So I only need  to look at loans 3 to 5 in this decision.  Although  I will look 
at Mr Ms full lending history with ECI to assess the case  fairly.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN77556552ECI needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that ECI should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that ECI was required to establish whether 
Mr M could  sustainably repay his loans   not just whether the loan payments were affordable 
on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 3 onwards would most  likely 
have shown that Mr M was paying  a significant proportion  of his income for two other  loans 
which had all been taken  out in the same month.  So a proportionate  check would have 
probably shown  he was having  difficulty in paying  off his previous loans or had problems in 
managing his money well. And also that he was likely to have some difficulty  in sustaining  
loan repayments  without borrowing again.  I have  considered all the arguments raised by 
ECI, but they do not change my mind. So I dont think  loan 3 onwards should have been 
given to Mr M.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 3, 4 and 5 and ECI has already offered  to 
uphold loans  6 to 12. ECI should put things right in line with our approach.
Ref: DRN77556553putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
For the sake of clarity and completeness,  Ill explain what Elevate Credit International 
Limited needs to do in respect of loans  3 to 12  so as to include the loans where  it has 
made an offer.
refund  all interest, fees and charges Mr M paid on loans 3 to 12 (inclusive);  
pay 8% simple interest a year on any refunded interest, fees and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative payment information about 3 to 5 (inclusive)  from Mr Ms credit 
file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 12 (inclusive)  should  be 
removed from Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit International  Limited to take off tax from 
this interest. Elevate  Credit International Limited must give Mr M a certificate  showing how 
much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right for Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 May 2020.
