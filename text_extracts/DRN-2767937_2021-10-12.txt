The complaint
Mr P complained that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua overcharged him fees and interest on his 
borrowing. He said this forced him into debt and further borrowing. Mr P wanted NewDay to 
make a refund.
What happened
Mr P told us that the interest and charges that NewDay applied to his borrowing made things 
much worse for him. He said NewDay had refused to do anything about it, and he wanted us 
to look into this for him.
NewDay didnt think it had done anything wrong. It set out what the terms of Mr Ps account 
said about charges, and the fees that he had paid. It said Mr P incurred four late payment 
fees of £12 each, with the first one on August 2017, just over three years after the account 
was opened. 
NewDay charges a cash advance fee of 3% (with a minimum payment of £3). It said Mr P 
was charged £264 in cash advance fees while he held the card. NewDay also said that Mr P 
had been charged £2,548.62 in interest.
NewDay said all of these charges were valid.
NewDay explained that Mr P last made a payment for his card on 12 November 2017. And 
there was no evidence Mr P had told NewDay he was experiencing financial difficulties, 
either before or at that time. NewDay said that after payments were missed it had tried to call 
Mr P in January, February and March 2018, but it wasnt able to speak to him. 
A default notice was sent to Mr P on 10 February 2018. And on 28 March 2018, his account 
was terminated. No further charges and interest were applied to the account. NewDay said a 
default was recorded on 29 June 2018, and the debt of £5,595.90 was sold to a third party.
NewDay didnt think it had done anything wrong. It said the terms and conditions of Mr Ps 
account show that charges and interest formed part of Mr P's credit agreement. NewDay 
said the fees and interest were all charged correctly, and stressed that Mr P hadnt told it he 
was experiencing financial difficulties
Our investigator didnt think Mr Ps complaint should be upheld. He said the terms of Mr Ps 
agreement did set out when he would have to pay interest and charges. Hed been charged 
£12 for going over his limit, and £12 in the months when he didnt make a payment. Our 
investigator said NewDay did apply the charges and interest in line with its terms. And he 
didnt think that a charge of £12 for a missed payment or going over an agreed credit limit 
was excessive. 
Our investigator said NewDay has a responsibility to support customers who may be 
experiencing financial difficulties. But he couldnt see that Mr P had told NewDay about this, 
or responded when it tried to contact him. So he couldnt say NewDay did anything wrong.
Mr P didnt agree. He thought we had focused too narrowly in how we assessed NewDays 
conduct. He said that NewDay's demand for £411.91, before it defaulted his account, was 
approximately one third of his monthly wage at the time and was wholly inappropriate.
Mr P said that during the term of the credit card, the interest rate rose on several occasions 
as well as the credit limit. He thought this complaint should be referred on to an ombudsman.
Our investigator said a demand for such a large sum was usual in situations where several 
payments have been missed. NewDay was calling in the debt. Our investigator appreciated 
that Mr P would have been very unlikely to be able to pay this back at such short notice. But 
our investigator said that the key was that NewDay had stopped receiving any payments to 
the card and it wasn't able to contact Mr P. He noted that NewDay does have an obligation 
to be supportive in situations where a customer is experiencing some difficulties but on this 
occasion he could see NewDay tried to make contact and was unable to.
Because no agreement was reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator, and for 
broadly the same reasons.
Credit card providers generally add a charge to an account if a customer goes over the 
credit limit, pays late, or doesnt pay at all. These arent automatically unfair.
I can see that the terms of Mr Ps account provide for a fee of £12 to be payable in these 
circumstances, and Mr P has incurred charges in line with these terms. As our investigator 
said, our service doesnt generally think that a fee of this amount is unfair or unreasonable. 
I can also see Mr P also incurred fees for cash advances. Again, these fees are in line with 
the terms of Mr Ps agreement with NewDay. I dont think its unfair for NewDay to charge for 
cash advances, or to charge interest from when this transaction is made. 
NewDay amended Mr Ps interest rate on this card on 5 December 2016. It wrote to Mr P 
warning him of this upcoming change on 27 September 2016, setting out a 4% increase in 
the interest rate for purchases and balance transfers, with no change to the interest on cash 
advances. Ive seen the letter that NewDay sent to Mr P at this time, and Im satisfied that 
NewDay explained what it was doing, gave Mr P sufficient notice of the change, and 
provided the option to opt out if he wanted to, by closing his account for future spending. I 
dont think that NewDay acted unfairly or unreasonably when it did this. 
NewDay also planned to increase Mr Ps interest rate again, on 2 February 2018, but it 
cancelled this change, as Mr Ps account was in difficulties at the time and NewDay had 
started the collections process on his account. 
I know Mr P thinks that NewDays charges for lending have been excessive, but I havent 
been able to see, taken in isolation, that the fees charged were unfair or unreasonable, or 
that NewDay had been told of Mr Ps financial difficulties when it asked him to pay the 
interest and charges on his card. In response to our investigators view, Mr P also said that he thought wed looked too 
narrowly at his complaint. He said he was asked for too much money when NewDay said it 
was going to default his account. And he mentioned that the credit limit increased several 
times during the time that this card account was opened.
I dont think NewDay has been asked about the amount Mr P was told to pay in its default 
notice, but I am able to make a general comment on this point here. Our investigator 
explained that when NewDay issues a default notice, it will give the alternative of bringing 
the account up to date, and this can involve a large payment. And, like our investigator, 
thats also what I would expect to see, when someones stopped making payments and isnt 
responding to efforts to get in touch. 
But our service hasnt considered if NewDay should have offered Mr P increased lending by 
raising his credit limit, or if this was affordable for him at the time. We can only look into a 
complaint after a business has had the opportunity to consider that, and respond to Mr P. 
And I cant see that Mr P has previously raised concerns about the increases to his credit 
limit with NewDay. 
If Mr P would like to do so now, then our service may then be able to consider this wider 
issue of credit limit increases for Mr P. But, although I know that Mr P will be disappointed, I 
dont think this complaint about unfair charges and interest applied to his account by 
NewDay should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2021.
