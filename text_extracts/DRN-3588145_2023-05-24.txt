The complaint
Mrs S complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that shes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Shes being represented in her complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mrs S and her husband had entered into an agreement for a trial membership of a holiday 
club in May 2006 and they traded-in the trial membership and bought some holiday club 
membership points in November 2006. Those purchases werent financed by loans provided 
by Barclays Partner Finance so arent part of this complaint.
Mrs S and her husband entered into an acquisition agreement in November 2008 to buy 
some more holiday club membership points. The purchase price of those points was £7,669 
and Mrs S entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan 
of £7,764 (the purchase price of the points plus a document fee of £65). She agreed to make 
120 monthly repayments of £123.55 to Barclays Partner Finance but she repaid the loan in 
December 2008. 
Mrs Ss representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in August 2019 under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that Mrs S had a claim for 
misrepresentation and that the misrepresentations and practices in the sales presentation 
made the loan agreement unfair. It also said that no assessment of Mrs Ss creditworthiness 
was done before the loan was made to her.
Barclays Partner Finance said that Mrs S was out of time to bring any misrepresentation 
claim under section 75. It also said that she settled the loan in December 2008 and the time 
limit applicable to a section 140A claim was six years from the date of the end of the debtor-
creditor relationship so any claim would have needed to have been raised no later than 
December 2014. Mrs S wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this 
service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ss complaint should be upheld. She thought 
that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of Mrs Ss section 75 and 
140A claims to turn them down. She said that she hadnt seen any persuasive evidence to 
suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mrs S. 
Mrs Ss representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
Mrs S first became aware that she had cause for complaint when she took legal 
advice in 2016 and didnt know she had cause for complaint against Barclays Partner 
Finance; and
the holiday company deliberately concealed facts from Mrs S and her husband so the 
limitation period is postponed under section 32 of the Limitation Act 1980.
It has also provided an indicative and non-exhaustive list of the holiday companys terms 
which it says may be regarded as unfair and a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company and the unfair terms that it used.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ss complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Ss complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that shed 
made to it and I accept that she referred her complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to her 
claims;
Mrs Ss claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs Ss claim under section 75 is that the membership points were misrepresented to 
her and her husband and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, 
Barclays Partner Finance would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim 
was brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it 
would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs S could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her and her 
husband into buying the membership points in November 2008 as that was the latest 
time that any misrepresentations would have been made to them by the holiday 
company and any loss would have been incurred as that was when she also entered 
into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made until August 2019, 
more than ten years later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to the claim 
and I find that it wasnt unreasonable for it to have rejected it;Mrs Ss representative says that Mrs S only became aware that she could make a 
claim to Barclays Partner Finance after she took legal advice in 2016  but when she 
had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist her for the purposes of the 
Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are 
extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mrs Ss 
claims;
Mrs Ss representative says that information was deliberately concealed from Mrs S 
and her husband so the time limits are postponed under section 32 - section 32(1)(b) 
says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been deliberately 
concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the debtor has 
discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have been 
discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a breach 
of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
deliberate concealment of any relevant information in these circumstances and I 
dont consider that section 32 is applicable to Mrs Ss claims; 
Mrs Ss representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs S and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it wasnt still running 
at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under section 
140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that the loan was settled in December 2008 and 
Mrs Ss representative has provided a settlement quote from November 2008 for an 
amount of £7,764 and a handwritten note on the quote says that it was paid in 
December 2008  Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan continued after 
December 2008 so I consider that the loan agreement ended in December 2008;
Mrs S would have had six years from then to bring a section 140A claim against 
Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made until August 2019, more than 
ten years later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I 
consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to the claim and I find that it 
wasnt unreasonable for it to have rejected it; 
Mrs Ss representative says that no assessment of Mrs Ss creditworthiness was 
done before the loan was made to Mrs S  Ive not been provided with any evidence 
about any credit assessment that was conducted but the loan was made to Mrs S in 
November 2008 and was repaid in full in December 2008 and Ive seen no evidence 
to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mrs S when it was made to her or that 
shes experienced any financial difficulties since then;
Ive also seen no evidence to show that Mrs S asked Barclays Partner Finance for 
any information about its assessment of her creditworthiness until August 2019  as 
the loan was made to her in November 2008 and was repaid in December 2009, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have raised any concerns about 
the assessment before then;
I sympathise with Mrs S for the issues that she and her husband have had with their 
membership and the health issues that her husband has suffered but I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to apply the provisions of the 
Limitation Act in response to the claims that had been made to it; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mrs S any of the money that she paid under 
the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2023.
