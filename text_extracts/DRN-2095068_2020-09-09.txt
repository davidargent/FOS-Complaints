The complaint
Mr M complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (NewDay) acted irresponsibly when they 
increased the limit on his credit card on several occasions.
What happened
Mr M held a credit card account with NewDay, and he says that in a period of less than 
3years his limit was increased several times despite it being clear to NewDay that he was in 
financial difficulties and had gambling issues. Mr M says that the conduct of his account and 
regular cash withdrawals should have flagged to NewDay that he was in financial difficulty 
and they shouldnt have increased his credit card limit to the extent they did. Mr M 
complained to NewDay and asked for all the  interest charged to his credit card to be 
refunded along with a further 8%. 
NewDay says that at no point did Mr M advise them of his gambling problems or any 
financial difficulties and the increased limits on his credit card met with their criteria and 
credit assessments. 
Mr M wasnt happy with the response and referred the matter to this service.
Since their final response to Mr M, NewDay have since conceded that following additional 
information from credit reference agencies it should have been aware that Mr M had external 
debts meaning later increases in his credit card limit shouldnt have been sanctioned. As a 
result, they offered Mr M a payment of £307.64 to cover the extra interest incurred as a 
result of the credit card account limit being  increased from that time.
The investigator looked at all the information available and partially upheld Mr Ms complaint 
but felt the increased credit card limits were justified up until November 2016 when NewDay 
should have been aware of Mr Ms other commitments indicating he was experiencing 
financial problems. The investigator felt that NewDay couldnt be held responsible for the fact 
Mr M used his account for gambling transactions as these were legitimate transactions. The 
investigator did agree that NewDay should refund the interest from the period they should 
have been aware of likely financial issues. The investigator asked NewDay to pay £307.64 in 
interest representing the extra interest charges, if the limit on his card hadnt been increased, 
plus a further £100 for the inconvenience caused. 
Mr M wasnt happy with the investigators view and felt all interest should be refunded and 
asked for the matter to be referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain the 
reason for my decision. 
When considering this complaint, I have looked at whether NewDay acted irresponsibly 
when agreeing to a series of increases to Mr Ms credit card account limit. 
I can understand that it would be a worrying and stressful time for Mr M experiencing 
financial difficulties and gambling problems. My role here is to see if NewDay acted fairly and 
reasonably  when they increased the limit on Mr Ms credit card on the number of occasions 
they did. I have seen detailed information from both Mr M and NewDay which timetables the 
increases in Mr Ms credit card since opening the credit card account in 2014. 
This information was provided again by the investigator in his view to both parties, so I wont 
be detailing this again in this decision letter, merely commenting on it. What is important 
here is that Mr M believes that NewDay should have noticed he was in financial difficulty 
from his credit card account activity- namely cash withdrawals on a regular basis and 
payments to betting companies. 
I can understand Mr Ms point here, but cash withdrawals arent on their own evidence that 
someone is necessarily having financial difficulties and gambling after all is a legitimate 
expense and its not for NewDay to tell its customers how they should spend their money. 
Its also worth mentioning that at no time since the credit card was opened is there any 
evidence to show that Mr M contacted NewDay to tell them of any financial difficulties or he 
had gambling problems until May 2017, which was post the latest limit increase to his credit 
card. 
When considering this complaint, I have looked at whether NewDay could have done more 
when increasing the limit on Mr Ms credit card. What is important is that NewDay, like all 
banks, carry out reasonable and proportionate checks when increasing the limits , NewDay 
have provided this service with details of the credit card account operation and undertook 
internal assessments including information from credit reference  agencies. 
Looking at the credit card account operation up until NewDay received additional  credit 
reference agency information, Mr M believes there was obvious signs of financial difficulty. I 
have considered this but like the investigator I am satisfied that credit card account didnt 
show any obvious signs of financial difficulty and the credit card account did show 
reasonable fluctuations so I dont think NewDay could be expected to have known or thought 
this was the case.  Mr M also had the opportunity when the increases were offered to have 
opted out within 40 days, under the terms offered by NewDay,  but he chose to take up the 
offers.  
That said, when the additional information became available to NewDay from a different 
credit reference agency showing Mr M having pay day loans and other financial 
commitments, I wouldnt have expected NewDay to continue to increase Mr Ms credit card 
limit to the levels they did. At this point NewDay should have undertaken a more forensic 
understanding of his financial situation. 
I can see that NewDay have recognised this and have offered to pay for the difference in 
interest they actually charged to what they would have charged if the limit had remained the 
same from November 2016. I also understand that NewDay have since agreed to reduce Mr 
Ms interest rate, froze his credit card charges and put in place a payment plan. On balance,  I am satisfied that NewDay have acted fairly here and it is what I would have expected to 
see. As a result , like the investigator I support the view to pay Mr M an additional £100 for 
the inconvenience  caused.
While Mr M will be disappointed with my decision, I am satisfied the offer of compensation 
and interest refund for the period in question is fair and reasonable and I wont be asking 
anymore than this from NewDay. 
Putting things right
I instruct NewDay to pay Mr M £307.64 by way of  interest adjustment and a further £100 for 
inconvenience and upset caused .
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and instruct NewDay Ltd to pay Mr M 
£307.64 by way of  interest adjustment and a further £100 for inconvenience and upset 
caused .
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 October 2020.
