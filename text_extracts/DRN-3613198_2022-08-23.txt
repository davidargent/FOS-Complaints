The complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPay) didnt apply its seller 
protection policy for his transaction following a chargeback claim made by a buyer.
What happened
Mr M says that he sold a designer handbag through an online marketplace to someone who 
lives abroad and who paid by PayPal. He received £5,000.65 to his PayPal account on 3 
December 2020. On 4 December the buyer filed a dispute, saying he didnt receive the bag. 
PayPal asked Mr P for the tracking number, which he provided, and closed the dispute 
without providing a refund to the buyer.
On 12 December 2020 the buyer re-opened the dispute with PayPal saying the item he 
received was significantly not as described. PayPal asked the buyer to report this to a law 
enforcement agency and provide a record of this. The buyer uploaded the report but closed 
the dispute before PayPal made a decision about it. This meant the buyer didnt receive a 
refund and wasnt asked to return the bag. 
In March 2021 PayPal were notified that the buyer had filed an external chargeback. The 
recorded chargeback reason was that the buyer had not received a refund or credit after 
attempting to return goods. PayPal disputed the chargeback, but it wasnt successful and in 
April 2021 the chargeback was closed in favour of the buyer.   
PayPal say it has acted in accordance with its user agreement which says that the 
transaction isnt covered by its Seller Protection Policy as the chargeback wasnt filed for an 
unauthorised transaction or because the buyer didnt receive the goods. 
Mr M is unhappy because the funds have been deducted from his PayPal account and the 
bag hasnt been returned to him  and PayPal hasnt asked the buyer to return it. He 
believes he should be covered by PayPals Seller Protection. Mr M also that says PayPal 
told him it wouldnt debit his account and has also referred to a friends case that he says is 
similar and PayPal has provided a refund. 
Our investigation so far
Whilst Mr Ms case was with this service PayPal made a goodwill offer of £1,500 which Mr M 
rejected. The investigator who then considered the complaint didnt recommend that it be 
upheld. He said he hadnt seen any evidence that the buyer received the bag. Mr M didnt 
agree with the investigators findings, so the complaint has been passed to me to consider. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My role is to consider the individual circumstances of Mr Ms case, so I wont comment in 
this decision on what PayPal has done in any other case. 
Whilst I understand Mr Ms strength of feeling in this case, I consider the offer made by 
PayPal exceeds any award I would make and will explain why. 
Mr M has told this service that the buyer must be a fraudster as he raised a goods not 
received dispute and then when Mr M provided a tracking number he changed the dispute to 
significantly not as described and then raised a chargeback. I dont know why the buyer 
chose the dispute reasons he did. PayPals user agreement says chargeback provides 
broader protection, but a buyer can either raise a dispute or a chargeback. So it seems the 
buyer decided to close his dispute and raise a chargeback. 
I have carefully considered why PayPal say Mr Ms case isnt covered by its Seller Protection 
Policy and agree that in the individual circumstances of this complaint it doesnt apply. The 
payment was authorised, and the goods not received dispute was closed and doesnt apply. 
The buyer raised a chargeback claim saying that he didnt receive a refund when he 
returned the goods. PayPal provided representations in respect of this dispute, but it wasnt 
decided in Mr Ms favour. PayPals user agreement correctly identifies that PayPal doesnt 
decide whether a chargeback claim is successful. Chargeback is a process that allows debit 
and credit card holders to reverse a transaction when theres a problem with the goods or 
services they have purchased. It is organised and run through the overarching card scheme. 
So, I consider PayPal acted reasonably in responding to the chargeback claim. And I cant 
hold PayPal responsible for the chargeback decision made as it was outside of PayPals 
control. 
PayPal may ask the buyer to return the bag to Mr M under the protection policy, but as Im 
satisfied PayPay acted reasonably in not applying its Seller Protection Policy to Mr Ms case 
I wouldnt expect it to ask the buyer to do so.
Mr M also said that PayPayl confirmed it would return funds to him if it was unable to recover 
funds from the buyers financial institution. But Mr M has read this incorrectly. What PayPal 
said in the message was that it would refund the money to Mr Ms PayPal balance if it was 
able to recover it from the buyers financial institution. In any event, even if I were to 
conclude PayPal didnt do as it said it would, I consider the goodwill offer of £1,500 would be 
above the level of any compensation I would award. 
Overall, I consider PayPal has acted reasonably and in line with the terms of Mr Ms 
account. I realise Mr M will likely be disappointed with my decision, but I cant reasonably 
say that PayPal has done anything wrong. PayPal has made a goodwill offer of £1,500. If Mr 
M would now like to accept this offer, I suggest he contacts PayPal directly. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 September 2022.
