The complaint
Mr K complains that American Express Services Europe Limited wont refund to him the 
money that hes claimed as a result of a cancelled flight.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr K used his American Express credit card, and some points and vouchers from his 
credit card account, in May 2019 to pay for four international flights and hotel 
accommodation for a holiday for his family and himself;
the outbound flight was cancelled and Mr K and his family were offered and agreed 
to take a flight the following day  and they were provided with overnight hotel 
accommodation;
Mr K claimed a refund of consequential losses totalling £643.99, and a refund of the 
account points and vouchers, from American Express in August 2019  the losses 
claimed were: £205.04 for the loss of one day of the holiday; £21.71 for a taxi from 
the hotel to the airport; £25.57 for a taxi from the airport to his hotel; £144.68 for a 
missed complimentary restaurant booking; £16.51 for a taxi from the hotel to the 
restaurant; and £230.48 for the difference between the cost of the cancelled flights 
and the estimated cost of the replacement flights;
American Express said that it had reviewed the airlines terms and conditions which 
say that, if it makes a significant change to the scheduled departure time of a flight 
which is unacceptable and it cant book the customer on another acceptable flight, it 
will give a fare refund;
it said that by accepting the replacement flight, Mr K had consented to the contract 
being amended so it couldnt see that there had been a breach of contract for which 
Mr K would be entitled to consequential losses  and if he wasnt happy with the 
replacement flight offered he should have accepted a fare refund;
it also explained why the Package Travel and Linked Travel Regulations 2018 to 
which Mr K had referred werent applicable in these circumstances;
Mr K then complained to this service but our investigator agreed with the views 
expressed by American Express in response to Mr Ks claim and he said that he was 
unable to conclude that it had been at fault in how it responded to the claim;
Ive considered in detail the evidence provided by Mr K and American Express  and 
I sympathise with Mr K for the disappointment and frustration that he clearly feels 
about the delay to the start of his family holiday and the costs that he incurred;
Mr K booked the flights and in doing so accepted the airlines terms and conditions 
which contain the term about replacement flights described above;
theres no dispute that the flight that Mr K had booked was cancelled but he and his 
family were offered and accepted replacement flights for the following day which was 
in accordance with the terms and conditions  he and his family were also provided 
with overnight hotel accommodation;
under the terms and conditions he was entitled to either a replacement flight or a fare 
refund - and he accepted the replacement flight so wasnt entitled to a fare refund;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that American Express has 
responded to his claim incorrectly and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require it to refund to Mr K the amount that hes 
claimed for his consequential losses or any other amounts; and
I also find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require American Express to 
pay any compensation to Mr K or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2021.
