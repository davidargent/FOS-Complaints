The complaint
Mr R complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he paid for some holiday club membership 
points. Hes being represented in his complaint by a legal adviser. 
What happened
Mr R entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance that he signed 
in March 2009 for loan of £21,572 to pay for some holiday club membership points. He 
agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £376.59 to Barclays Partner Finance. The loan 
was repaid in March 2010.
Mr R wrote to Barclays Partner Finance in January 2021 and said that it appeared that the 
credit intermediary recorded on the loan agreement wasnt permitted or authorised to 
arrange loans  and he asked it to explain its position. He also asked it to provide evidence 
of the checks that were undertaken to assess the suitability of the loan for him. He wrote to it 
again in March 2021. 
Barclays Partner Finance sent a letter to Mr R in April 2021 in which it said that the purchase 
was made in March 2009 so was time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980. Mr R then 
complained to this service and his representative wrote a detailed complaint letter to this 
service in August 2021.
That letter said, in summary and amongst other things, that the credit intermediary wasnt 
authorised to arrange the loan which makes it unlawful, Mr R purchased the loan following a 
lengthy and pressurised sales presentation, the membership points were misrepresented to 
Mr R, there was an unfair relationship between Mr R and Barclays Partner Finance pursuant 
to section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, there was no evidence that a credit check 
was conducted before the loan was granted and the high interest rate was also an indication 
of an unfair relationship. It also referred to an overseas court judgment which commented on 
the unlawful structure of a group of companies which included the holiday company and it 
said that the holiday company was in administration. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Rs complaint should be upheld. She thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of the misrepresentation claim 
that was made under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act and of the section 140A claim to 
turn them down. She said that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the 
lending was unaffordable for Mr R.
Mr Rs representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded to our investigators recommendations in detail and says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that:
 she hasnt identified the credit broker or assessed whether it was authorised to 
arrange the loan;
 Mr R couldnt have known about the misrepresentations at the time of sale as he 
wouldnt have bought the membership points if he knew that theyd been 
misrepresented to him;
 the ombudsman service isnt required to follow the relevant law, guidance and 
practice but to reach an evaluative assessment of the merits of Barclays Partner 
Finances decision;
 it would be entirely wrong and unfair if Mr Rs complaint cant proceed due to issues 
of limitation; and
 no credit check was performed on Mr R before the arrangement of the loan.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Rs complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
 we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
 Mr Rs complaint is about the lawfulness of the loan that Barclays Partner Finance 
made to him and that it turned down the claims that he would have been able to 
make under sections 75 and 140A - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 
applies to his claims;
 Im not determining the outcome of Mr Rs claims under sections 75 and 140A in this 
decision as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
 section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
 Mr Rs claim under section 75 is that the membership points were misrepresented to 
him and that he wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to him 
- if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
 the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under sections 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
 I consider that Mr R could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him into buying 
the membership points in March 2009 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been incurred 
as that was when he also entered into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance; I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made 
until August 2021, more than twelve years later which was outside of the time limits 
set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Mr Rs misrepresentation claim is now 
time-barred;
 Mr Rs representative says that Mr R didnt know that the membership points had 
been misrepresented to him in March 2009  but when he had the knowledge to 
bring a claim doesnt assist him for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits 
for a claim under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt 
have knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider 
that those sections are applicable to Mr Rs claim;
 Mr Rs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr R and 
Barclays Partner Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
 the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
 Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that the loan was repaid in 
March 2010 - so Mr R would have had six years from then to bring a claim against 
either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance;
 Mr R didnt raise his concerns about the authorisation of the credit intermediary and 
the credit checks that were performed with Barclays Partner Finance until January 
2021, and there was no reference to a claim under section 140A until Mr Rs 
representatives letter to this service in August 2021, so I consider that his claim 
under section 140A is now also time-barred; 
 Barclays Partner Finance has provided a copy of the loan agreement which identifies 
the retailer and I consider it to be more likely than not that the retailer was the credit 
intermediary that arranged the loan  its a different company to the company that 
Mr R identified as the credit intermediary in his letter to Barclays Partner Finance in 
January 2021;
 this services records show that the retailer identified on the loan agreement was 
covered under the consumer credit jurisdiction from April 2007 to August 2010  
which it wouldnt have been had it not been granted a consumer credit licence by the 
Office of Fair Trading - and I dont think that (in the absence of any persuasive 
evidence to the contrary) its unreasonable to conclude that it was likely to have held 
the requisite licence in March 2009 when the loan was made to Mr R and that the 
loan agreement was likely to have been enforceable; 
 Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the credit intermediary 
wasnt authorised to arrange the loan for Mr R in March 2009 or that the loan was 
sold to him unlawfully;
 Mr R asked Barclays Partner Finance to provide evidence of the checks that were 
undertaken to assess the suitability of the loan for him in January 2021  Ive not 
seen a response from it in which addresses that request but the loan was made to 
Mr R in March 2009 and was repaid in March 2010 and Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mr R complained to Barclays Partner Finance about its credit checks or the 
affordability of the loan at any time before January 2021; as Mr Rs request was made more than ten years after the loan was repaid I dont 
consider that it was required to have retained information about the affordability 
assessment that was conducted in March 2009;
 Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr R when it was 
provided to him or that he experienced any financial difficulties because of the loan 
that Barclays Partner Finance made to him; 
 Mr Rs representative says that the high interest rate that Mr R was expected to pay 
is also an indication of an unfair relationship  but Mr R signed the loan agreement 
which clearly set out the annual rate of interest (and the APR), the amount of credit, 
the total charge for credit and the monthly repayment and immediately above his 
signature it says This is a Credit Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. Sign it only if you want to be legally bound by its terms;
 if the terms of the loan agreement werent acceptable to Mr R I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect him not to have signed the loan agreement;
 the loan agreement also set out Mr Rs right to cancel the loan agreement within 
fourteen days but Ive seen no evidence to show that he tried to cancel the loan 
agreement within that period;
 Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr R was unduly 
pressured into buying the membership points or entering into the loan agreement or 
that the holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices against him  he 
didnt contact Barclays Partner Finance about any issues relating to the loan until 
January 2021 (more than eleven years after he entered into the loan agreement) and 
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained to Barclays 
Partner Finance about any such issues before then;
 Mr Rs representative has referred to an overseas court judgment which commented 
on the unlawful structure of a group of companies which included the holiday 
company  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
structure of those companies was unlawful;
 Mr Rs representative has also referred to the administration of the holiday company 
in November 2020  but I understand that another company is providing the services 
that the holiday company had agreed to provide and Ive seen no evidence to show 
that Mr R has been adversely impacted by the administration;
 I consider that Barclays Partner Finances responses to Mr R and his representative 
have been fair and reasonable and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that it has acted incorrectly in these circumstances; and
 I sympathise with Mr R for the issues that hes described but I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to him any of 
the money that he paid under the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 April 2023.
