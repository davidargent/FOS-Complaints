K821x#15complaint
The trustees have  complained that advice they received from an appointed representative 
(AR) of Global Financial Limited  (GFL) in July 2007 to invest  Â£220,000 in the Distribution 
fund of four investment  bonds was unsuitable  for the objectives of a will trust.
Mrs B stipulated in her will that, on her death,  Mrs R, the life tenant, should  receive  an 
income from the residual  value of her estate (the trust fund). Then, whenever Mrs R died, the 
capital value of the trust fund should pass to two nominated charities. This was confirmed by 
GFL in a suitability letter  to the trustees dated  July 2007.
 
The trustees were recommended to make capital withdrawals of five per cent of the original  
investment to pay as income to Mrs R. The trustees have said that, although gains made  
within an investment bond  are taxed as income, the five per cent withdrawals paid to Mrs R 
are a return of capital. Mrs R is not entitled to this capital - she was due an income.
The trustees have  questioned this advice for the following reasons:
this was an interest-in-possession trust where  the life tenant,  Mrs R, is entitled  to 
income and the remaindermen,  the nominated charities, to the capital.  But the 
advice recommended investment bonds that pay out capital, not income. This 
breached the terms of the trust;
the case of Broadies  trustees v IRC (1933)  stated that any regular payment made to 
a beneficiary can be taxed as income,  which makes  the advice even more curious;
the advice  is presented  as tax-efficient to pay capital but the regularity of the 
income would imply that it should be taxed as income regardless. As such, if 
investment returns dont match the income  paid to Mrs R, the value of the trust fund 
for the remaindermen  would  fall and the income distributed to Mrs R may also be 
taxed;
the will trust is a protected trust which is intended to maintain the original value of 
the trust fund for the remaindermen. But the capital has been paid to Mrs R with no 
guarantee that the value  of the trust fund would remain intact;
Mrs R is a non-taxpayer and an interest-in-possession trust is taxed at basic  rate, so 
she would have  been able to claim the benefit of any tax paid. An investment  bond 
pays corporation tax within the funds, equivalent to basic  rate tax of 20 per cent, that 
affects the investment returns and cant be reclaimed by Mrs R, despite her tax 
status. In other words, the advice  has turned  Mrs R from a non-taxpayer with limited  
income into a basic rate taxpayer;
a pure income-producing  investment  would  have enabled Mrs R to set any gains 
against her personal allowances  and starting band of income. But the advice given to 
the trustees ensures that she pays  tax of 20 per cent she cant reclaim;
any gains made  by the investment  bonds  are charged to the trust at the trust rate of 
45 per cent (less 20 per cent already taxed within the fund),  whereas an income-
producing investment  would incur a tax credit of ten per cent and further liability  only 
if Mrs R was a tax payer. But she was a non-taxpayer;  
the advice  doesnt consider the position if Mrs R survives 20 years  and the whole 
capital has been paid out. There is then no capital that qualifies for tax-efficiency 
and all subsequent  payments to Mrs R would be taxed  as income.
The trustees have  requested  that the value of the trust is placed  back  in the financial position  
it would  have been in but for this advice.
Ref: DRN12147222background
I issue a provisional  decision in June 2017  in which I concluded  that the complaint should be 
upheld and that GFL should reimburse the trust for all investment  losses  and surplus tax 
liability incurred by the trust on investment  gains  when the bonds were surrendered in 2014.
The trustees accepted this provisional  view but GFL did not. It didnt dispute that the 
complaint should  be upheld.  But it argued that, in law, as it ceased to be the original 
trustees adviser since 8 September 2009, its liability for losses emanating from the original  
advice should  be capped at that date. Any further  losses incurred by the trust arising from 
the advice given in July 2007 should be met by the advisers appointed by the trustees  since  
September 2009 as it would have been their responsibility to review the original advice.
Having considered the issue of continued liability, I issued a second  provisional decision in 
June 2019 in which I concluded that, on balance, GFLs liability  in this matter ended  when it 
ceased to be trustees  adviser on 8 September 2009. I proposed that GFL should 
compensate the trust for all the losses it suffered to that date. In order to claim compensation 
for all losses  suffered by the trust, the trustees  would  need to bring complaints against the 
principals of the three advisory firms they appointed  since  8 September 2009.
I invited both the trustees and GFL to respond with comments  to my further provisional 
decision, a copy  of which is attached and forms part of this final decision.
developments
GFL replied to say that it agreed  my second provisional view. 
The trustees disagreed  with my most recent  assessment and said that:
whether the flaw in the original  advice was identified in 2007  or later is irrelevant, as 
the loss flows from the advice given in July 2007 by an appointed representative of 
GFL. GFL should,  therefore, meet all losses subsequently arising from that advice;
that GFL ceased  to be the trustees  adviser doesnt alter the fact that the advice in 
July 2007 breached  the terms of the trust and all financial losses  suffered by the trust 
flowed from that beach. That the original adviser  represented  three  other firms since 
September 2009 doesnt change this and there  is no question of GFLs liability  
ending at that date;
the most  recent adviser  (IFA4) has admitted that the investments should  have been 
amended and it refunded the trust its fee charges since  it took over;
even if the trust has withdrawn from the bonds at that point, the financial loss 
continued and a tax charge was incurred by the trust arising from a chargeable 
event; 
the tax charges are a result of the initial investment, not any ongoing reviews. The 
reviews are contributory, but not the cause. The investments were not liquid stock or 
unit trusts;  they were  bonds that have a tax charge and the cause of that charge is 
the initial advice  which was flawed. The original adviser had four years to change  his 
advice and didnt  do so;
its not appropriate to hide behind  the legal position. In simple  terms, GFL made an 
error in the original  advice it gave and it needs to put this error right.  The trustees are 
prepared to take this matter  to court;
it cant provide a copy of any Retainer Agreement or Terms of Business made 
between the original trustees  and subsequent  advisory firms. The advisory  firm, in its 
Ref: DRN12147223current trading style, ought to be able to provide a copy  of this Retainer and its 
disappointing that it cant do so.
 
findings
Ive considered all the further evidence and arguments from each party to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my view, the outcome  of this complaint turns on whether or not subsequent advisers 
were retained by the trustees to provide  an ongoing review of the original  advice. That 
question could have  been answered  on production  of a Retainer Agreement  made between 
the trustees  and the adviser some  time after 8 September  2009.
But, although such an Agreement cant be produced,  the evidence  provided by the review 
letter IFA2  sent to the trustees dated  June 2010 indicates that it was retained to review the 
original advice, did carry out such a review  and made a recommendation to the trustees that 
the advice remained  suitable.
If, alternatively, IFA2 had concluded (as IFA4 did in July 2013) that the original  advice was 
flawed and recommended  that the trust money  should be redirected to more  appropriate  
investments, GFLs liability would  have been capped at 8 September 2009.  That IFA2  didnt  
make such  a recommendation and, moreover, confirmed that the original advice remained 
suitable for the trustees objective, means it should take responsibility for that advice.         
So, my view remains that I dont think GFL is liable  for the financial losses flowing from the 
original advice given  to the trustees  in July 2007  once it ceased  to be the principal firm of the 
trustees adviser in September 2009.    
Therefore, I believe it is appropriate to limit its liability  to 8 September  2009 and should 
compensate the trust for losses incurred caused  by the original advice from 5 July 2007 to 
8 September 2009.
Also, given the will trust did specify that the trust fund should be invested, it is difficult to 
reconcile the interests of the life tenant and the remaindermen. The only form of investment  
that could guarantee the interests of both beneficiaries was a deposit-based account that 
enabled the life tenant to receive interest which wouldnt erode  the capital value of the trust 
fund for the remaindermen. But this may not have guaranteed a worthwhile income  for the 
life tenant. 
Therefore, there did need to be a fair balance between the interests  of the beneficiaries 
without breaching the terms of the trust. Accordingly, I think the trustees should have been 
advised to invest  in a pure income-producing  product that invested in a fund that presented a 
low risk profile.
  
fair compensation
In assessing what would  be fair compensation, I consider that my aim should be to put the 
trust as close to the position it would probably  now be in if the trustees  had not been given 
unsuitable advice.
I think the trustees would  have invested differently. It is not possible to say precisely  what  
the trustees  would have  done, but I am satisfied that what  I have set out below is fair and 
Ref: DRN12147224reasonable given the trusts  circumstances  and objectives when the trustees invested. 
what should  GFL do? 
To compensate the trust fairly, GFL must request  each bond provider to calculate the value 
of a unit trust that invested in a Distribution, or an equivalent, fund on 8 September  2009, 
including all the natural income payments that would have been made to the trustees.
GFL should then compare  these values with the value of each investment bond  at 
8 September 2009 and pay the difference between the value of each unit trust and 
investment bond  at that date. If the combined value of the investment bonds  is greater  than 
the value of the unit trusts, no compensation is payable.
 
The periodic  withdrawals made from the bonds should be deducted from the ongoing value 
of the unit trusts at the points  they were actually  paid so they cease to accrue any return in 
the calculation  from that date.
As the investment bonds ought to have been surrendered on 8 September  2009, a potential 
tax charge would  have  incurred by the trust on any gains they made at that date. This tax 
charge would not have occurred if the trustees had been recommended  pure income-
producing investments that, in all likelihood, would have given rise to no income tax or 
capital gains tax charges,  given the life tenants  tax status.
Therefore, the tax charge  the trust would have incurred at 8 September  2009 should  be 
added to any investment  losses calculated below.  
If the bond providers are unable, or unwilling, to carry out these calculations, GFL should:  
Compare the performance of the trusts investments with that of the benchmark  
shown below and pay the difference between the fair value and the actual value of 
the investments.  If the actual value is greater  than the fair value, no compensation is 
payable.
A separate  calculation should  be carried out for each investment. The resultant figures 
should then be added  up. If the calculation still shows a loss, that would be the amount 
payable to the trust. GFL should also pay interest as set out below. Income tax may be 
payable on any interest awarded.

This means  the actual amount paid or payable from the investment at the end date.
fair value
This is what  the investment would have been  worth at the end date had it produced  a return  
using the benchmark.
To arrive at the fair value when using the fixed rate bonds as the benchmark,  GFL should 
use the monthly average rate for the fixed rate bonds with 12 to 17 months  maturity  as 
published by the Bank  of England. The rate for each  month  is that shown as at the end of 
Ref: DRN12147226the previous month. Those rates  should be applied to the investment on an annually  
compounded basis.  
Any withdrawal, income or other payment out of the investment should be deducted from the 
fair value  calculation at the point it was actually paid so it ceases to accrue any return  in the 
calculation from that point on. 
If there are a large number of regular  payments,  to keep  calculations simpler, I will accept if 
GFL totals  all those payments and deducts that figure at the end instead of deducting 
periodically. 
why is this remedy suitable?
I have chosen  this method of compensation because:
The trustees wanted income with some growth  with a small risk to the trusts capital.
The average rate for the fixed  rate bonds  would be a fair measure  for someone who 
wanted to achieve  a reasonable  return  without  risk to the trusts capital. 
The FTSE UK Private Investors Income  total return index (prior to 1 March  2017, the 
FTSE WMA Stock  Market Income total return index) is a mix of diversified indices  
representing different  asset classes, mainly UK equities and government bonds. It 
would be a fair measure for someone  who was prepared  to take some risk to get a 
higher return.  
I consider that the trusts risk profile was in between, in the sense that the trustees 
were prepared  to take a small level of risk to attain the trusts investment objectives. 
So, the 50/50 combination would reasonably put the trust into that position. It does 
not mean that the trustees  would have invested  50per cent of the trusts money  in a 
fixed rate bond and 50per  cent in some  kind of index  tracker fund. Rather,  I consider  
this a reasonable compromise that broadly  reflects the sort of return the trustees 
could have obtained from investments suited to the trusts objective and risk attitude. 
The additional interest is for being  deprived  of the use of any compensation money 
since the end date. 
decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. 
Global Financial Limited should pay the amount calculated as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask the trustees to 
accept or reject my decision  before  9 September 2019.

complaint
The trustees have complained that advice they received  from an appointed representative (AR) of 
Global Financial Limited (GFL) in July 2007 to invest  Â£220,000 in the Distribution fund of four 
investment bonds was unsuitable for the objectives of a will trust.
Mrs B stipulated in her will that, on her death,  Mrs R, the life tenant, should  receive an income from 
the residual value of her estate (the trust fund). Then, whenever Mrs R died, the capital value of the 
trust fund should pass to two nominated  charities. This was confirmed by GFL in a suitability letter to 
the trustees dated July 2007.
 
The trustees were  recommended to make  capital withdrawals of five per cent of the original 
investment to pay as income to Mrs R. The trustees have said that, although  gains made  within  an 
investment bond are taxed as income, the five per cent withdrawals paid to Mrs R are a return  of 
capital. Mrs R is not entitled  to this capital - she was due an income.
The trustees have questioned this advice for the following reasons:
this was an interest-in-possession trust where the life tenant, Mrs R, is entitled to income and 
the remaindermen,  the nominated charities, to the capital. But the advice recommended 
investment bonds  that pay out capital, not income. This breached  the terms of the trust;
the case  of Broadies  trustees v IRC (1933)  stated that any regular payment made  to a

ensures that she pays tax of 20 per cent she cant reclaim;
any gains made by the investment bonds  are charged to the trust at the trust rate of 45 per 
cent (less 20 per cent already taxed within  the fund),  whereas an income-producing 
investment would incur a tax credit  of ten per cent and further liability only if Mrs R was a tax 
payer. But she was a non-taxpayer;  
the advice doesnt  consider the position if Mrs R survives 20 years and the whole  capital has 
been paid out. There is then no capital that qualifies for tax-efficiency and all subsequent 
payments to Mrs R would be taxed as income.
The trustees have requested  that the value  of the trust is placed back  in the financial position  it would 
have been in but for this advice.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in June 2017 in which I proposed that the complaint 
should be upheld  because the advice given to the trustees  did breach  the terms of the will trust. 
Ref: DRN12147228The will created an interest-in-possession trust which required the life tenant  to receive an income  
from the recommended  investments. The income paid to the life tenant through the trust were  
withdrawals of capital from investment bonds to which she wasnt entitled.
Furthermore, whenever the bonds were surrendered, any gain would be taxed at trust rates  of 45 per 
cent, less 20 per cent already levied  on gains made by the underlying  investment funds, rather than at 
the life tenants personal tax rate. Moreover, the life tenant was a non-taxpayer who couldnt  reclaim 
tax at 20 per cent applied to gains made by the underlying investment funds. So, the advice 
effectively turned a non-taxpayer into a basic rate taxpayer.
Also, I thought GFL remained liable for the financial consequences  of that advice,  even after it was 
removed as advisers  in September 2009. While it says it didnt hold the file for this client after 
September 2009, and therefore cant be held responsible for advice given since then, in my view, the 
complaint concerned the suitability of the original advice,  and not any subsequent advice given  after 
GFL ceased to be the trustees adviser.
I referred to a recent case of Denning  v Greenhalgh Financial Services Limited (2017)  which set out 
when a new adviser  can be held responsible  for a previous advisers negligent advice. This depends 
on the terms and limits of the Retainer  Agreement and that any duty of care arising from this must  be 
directly related to what  the new adviser  was instructed to do. 
As the trustees complaint concerned the suitability  of advice GFL gave (through its AR) in July 2007, 
GFL remained responsible for the financial consequences  of that advice regardless of whether the 
trustees changed their advisers since then (or effectively removed  GFL as its adviser and remained 
with its former  AR). 
Only if it ought to have occurred to the new  adviser  after September 2009 there was an issue with 
the suitability of the original advice would  it be liable for this advice from that date. 
But I didnt know the terms and conditions of any Retainer Agreement  between  the trustees and the 
AR. And, as the AR had always been the trustees adviser (albeit that any advice  it gave  was the 
responsibility of GFL between July 2007  and September 2009), the AR would have some knowledge  
of the original  advice.
In the Denning  case above, the new advisers  werent responsible  for previous advice because  it was 
a different firm, the advice had been given eight years earlier and it hadnt  been asked to look at that 
advice. 
The AR in this case was the same adviser  and the advice it gave was less than three years earlier. 
But, unless it was retained by the trustees to review the original advice, it didnt have cause to do so 
because it had been  given  in 2007 for the long term. Therefore, my provisional  view was that GFL 
remained financially responsible after September 2009  for the advice it gave in July 2007.  
But, I did say that, if it can be shown that the terms and benefits  of the investment bonds had in any 
way been altered  significantly, or the advice had been reviewed fundamentally, after September 2009, 
there could  be a case for the ARs  new principal  accepting responsibility for advice given after this 
date.
I invited both the trustees and GFL to comment on my provisional view, a copy of which is attached 
and forms  part of this decision.   
developments
In response, GFL did not disagree with my conclusion that the advice  given to the trustees  (and 
hence to the life tenant  and remaindermen) in July 2007  was unsuitable. 
Ref: DRN12147229However, it set in great detail why it didnt  agree that it should accept responsibility for the whole of 
the losses  made by the trust when the trustees surrendered the four bonds in 2014.
Briefly, it said that:
the decision not to limit its liability  to September 2009 is wrong in how Ive applied  case  law;
our service failed to supply us the information on request in order to defend  its position;
Ive ignored  the trustees responsibilities under  the Trustee Act 2000 and failed to comment 
on this aspect of the case in my decision;
the decision not to limit its liability  is flawed;
I failed  to observe the FCAs own guidelines by incorrectly using Denning v Greenhalgh 
Financia l_ Services (2017) to justify  my stance;
I wrongly dismissed the previous  decisions  of ombudsm en by wrongly claiming that this 
decision was not based  on the same facts. ;
the new advisers in September 2009 received  remuneration  showing  how they took 
their clients, by novation, when moving  to a new principal  firm;
the new advisers have influenced   the trustees  decision to continue  the investments and 
GFL requests that I provide evidence  on which I based my decision  that there  was no 
influence  of the new adviser  on  the trustees;
I failed  in my duty of enquiry to discover information  and provide GFL with information  it 
requested;
If the complaint is upheld  to nay degree, the basis of redress is incorrect  given I said the 
financial interests  of the both life tenant  and the remaindermen should  be protected;
GFL was unable  to influence  the trustees after September  2009;
there  was limitation  on the investment  advice  it promised the trustees in its own 
Terms of Business.
The trustees replied  to say that it was disappointed at the time taken to resolve this complaint and for 
the trust to receive redress for the losses it has suffered due to negligent advice  given in July 2007. 
It commented  on the response from GFL that was attempting  to limit its exposure to September 2009 
when it ceased to be the trustees  adviser. It was also regrettable that GFL appeared  to pass  the 
responsibility for the advice to the original trustees.  If the trustees  had delegated under Section 5 of 
The Trustee  Act 2000 they would have completed a policy statement and reviewed the investments 
under Section 15. But they didnt  do either. Those reviews were  undertaken by GFL which didnt  see 
the flaws in the advice it gave. After the AR was taken on by a fourth  principal firm in 2012, this firm 
did identify the problem with the advice GFL had given originally.
The Trustee  Act 2000 puts in place legislation  giving  powers to trustees, but these  powers dont 
extend to indemnifying financial advisers for their incompetent and negligent advice. Sections 5 and 
15 concern the delegation of investment management and are relevant  to a breach of trust where 
trustees have  failed to exercise sufficient safeguards in delegating investment management. But it 
doesnt stop the trustee seeking redress for losses arising from incompetent advice  from financial 
advisers.
The original trustees didnt possess investment experience and appointed a financial adviser who 
advised them  negligently and they acted on that negligent  advice. GFLs  attempts to pass liability  to 
an appointed representative  is a risk its business structure runs when providing compliance and 
regulation services to allow small  IFAs to operate where they would not otherwise.  The negligent 
advice was given in July 2007 by an AR of GFL at the time and, regardless where the adviser moved, 
the losses  arose and continued from the original advice that was wholly unsuitable  for an interest-in-
possession trust. 
further provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint, including the whole of GFLs response to my provisional  decision. In 
Ref: DRN121472210doing so, Ive also taken into account all relevant law, including the provisions  of the Trustee Act 
2000, and industry practice.
But, while I have considered  all the arguments put forward by GFL, Im not proposing  to recite them  
all in this decision.  I mention refer to the points made by GFL which  materially affect  the outcome of 
this complaint.
I should  also emphasise that this service is impartial and doesnt  act as advocate for either side.  So it 
isnt for us to retrieve information or documentation for GFL for it then to present  its case  to us. If I felt 
I needed further information  about this complaint  I would have obtained  it. My role is to reach  a fair 
and reasonable decision about the complaint  based on the available evidence  in the individual case. 
According to the Financial Conduct Authority Register, the firm which gave  the original advice in July 
2007 ceased  to be an appointed Representative (AR) of GFL on 8 September 2009. 
This firm then became tied to another principal  firm (henceforth  referred to as IFA2) from January 
2010 to November 2010. It then became an appointed representative of another  principal firm (IFA3)  
until September 2012 and then an AR of IFA4  from September 2012 to March  2014,  whereupon it 
was no longer  authorised to conduct regulated investment business and ceased to trade in April 2015.     
My understanding is that, in July 2013,  IFA4  carried out an annual review of the investments  and 
identified that the original advice may not have been appropriate for an interest-in-possession  trust 
and advised the original trustees accordingly.  The trustees appointed new advisers and the current 
trustees raised this complaint with GFL. 
While IFA4 didnt accept liability for the original advice in July 2007,  it settled  matters with the trustees 
in June 2015  for the time it acted as servicing  agent for the investment bonds.
I remain satisfied  that the AR of GFL gave fundamentally inappropriate advice for an interest-in-
possession trust and GFL hasnt disputed this conclusion.
The outstanding matter is the issue of GFLs continued liability when the trustees retained the adviser 
firm in September 2009 even  though  it ceased  to be an appointed  representative of GFL by then. 
In the light of GFLs response to my provisional decision, I, therefore,  need to decide whether the 
financial loss to the trust when the investment bonds were surrendered in February  2014 should be 
split among all the principal firms the AR firm ever represented or whether GFL takes ongoing 
responsibility for the original  advice even after it ceased to be the trustees advisers. There is much 
case law on this matter and, for the purposes of this complaint, a great deal rests  on the Retainer 
Agreement the AR made with the trustees in September 2009.  
But neither IFA4  nor the trustees is able to produce for me a copy  of this Agreement which would 
confirm the scope of the advice the AR was retained by the trustees  to provide since September  2009 
and settle many of the points  made by GFL with regard to the provisions of the Trustee Act.
All four product providers  have confirmed there was some activity on the bonds between September  
2009 and February 2014 before they were  surrendered. But this mainly involved  fund switches and 
one-off withdrawals of capital to increase  the level of income paid to the life tenant.  This leads  me to 
believe that the AR did review the original advice since September 2009 but not fundamentally  to 
question whether the bonds  were appropriate investments for the trust until IFA4 did so in July 2013.
In its response to my provisional decision GFL provided  a copy of its ARs Terms  of Business it 
agreed with the trustees in July 2007, which state that: With regard  to investments, which we have 
arranged for you, these  will not be kept under review but we will advise  you upon your request. But 
this is the terms of business  it agreed with the trustees until September  2009.  It doesnt mean GFL 
ceased to be liable for the original advice after it was replaced as adviser if there was no agreement  
between the AR and the trustees  as to the advice  it was retained to give after September  2009. 
Ref: DRN121472211And, even if the AR firms new principal began to receive renewal commission  from September  2009, 
that doesnt mean  it was retained by the trustees to review  the original advice. 
The key issue is that the complaint concerns the original advice given to the trustees  in 
July 2007 to invest in the four bonds.
 
GFL argues  that the responsibility for this advice after September 2009  should lie with the AR when it 
took the trustees with them on ceasing to represent  GFL. By implication, the AR must have provided 
new or ongoing advice to the trustees after September 2009.
GFL points to renewal  commission paid to the AR by the bond providers  which indicates  it was 
responsible for providing  ongoing advice and, as such, it ought to have identified any flaw in the 
original advice. I understand this point if the AR was contracted  to review the original advice. But, 
unless I see the Retainer Agreement, I dont know whether it was contracted to extend a duty of care 
to the trustees by reviewing  past advice.
If the AR was obliged by virtue of its Retainer Agreement just to provide new advice on unrelated 
matters, it would not have been expected to identify errors in the original advice. And theres no 
evidence the original  trustees  had expressed any concern to the AR on which the AR failed  to act until 
IFA4 identified a flaw in the advice in July 2013.
   
With regard to the points made by GFL in its response to my provisional  decision, I dont agree  I have 
misinterpreted the ruling in Denning v. Greenhalgh. There may be a legal nexus and fiduciary 
relationship between  the trustees  and the AR. But the complaint  concerns the original advice and GFL 
was responsible for that advice.
GFL does refer to a letter in January 2010 from one of the bond providers confirming that all liabilities 
are transferred and all future payments and debits  will be made to the new firm. But this simply means  
that all future liabilities  were transferred. 
Further case  law on the issue of continued  liability  can be found in Davy v. 01000654 Limited 
(formerly Heather Moor & Edgecomb Limited) [2018] EWHC 353 QB and Capita (Banstead 2011) v. 
RFIB Group Limited [2016] WB 835.
These cases advocate that the Retainer  Agreement is crucial in deciding whether  future advisers  are 
obliged to identify previous  negligent advice or a continuing one that doesnt require  them  to do so. 
The presumption is that investment advice  is only forward, and not backward, looking.  And any 
obligation to identify negligent advice in the past must be based on fact and not on an ongoing duty of 
care. A judgement  in Midland Bank Trust Co Limited  v Hett Stubbs and Kemp states  that the court 
must be aware of imposing  upon solicitors  - or upon professional men in other spheres - duties which 
go beyond the scope of what they are requested and undertake to do.
But, in Credit  Lyonnais SA v Russell Jones and Walker, it was established that it was a signal  feature 
of that case  that the totality of the information required by the professional  to give the advice  which it 
was alleged was negligently omitted was before the professional concerned and if, in the course of 
doing that for which he is retained, he becomes  aware of a risk or a potential risk to the client, it is his 
duty to inform the client. In doing that he is neither going beyond the scope of his instructions nor is 
he doing extra work for which he is not paid. He is simply reporting back to the client on issues of 
concern which he learns as a result of, and in the course of, carrying  out his express instructions.    
As such, the judgment in Capita highlighted how important a Retainer  Agreement was to decide  if 
there could  be further liability for not correcting original advice that was flawed. Regrettably,  a copy of 
such an Agreement made between the AR firm and the trustees in September 2009 isnt available to 
me. This leaves me to decide on balance  whether  the AR firm was contracted to review the original 
advice after September 2009.
Ref: DRN121472212I can realistically say that GFL is responsible  for the advice  to 8 September 2009 and that the AR firm 
may be liable  after that date. But, in order to hold the AR firm liable after September 2009,  I would 
need to see some evidence that there were continuing reviews and/or a Retainer which suggested 
such reviews  would look at the original advice. 
Its evident that the original  individual was still advising the trustees  until May 2010  and, by virtue of 
his professional training and expertise, may have had reason to believe that the original advice was 
flawed by that point.
There is evidence that the AR firm did continue to monitor and review the original advice after 
September 2009. But most  activity on the bonds since September 2009 involved fund switches,  
requests for one-off withdrawals and taking of natural income rather  than capital withdrawals.  
So, there do appear  to have been efforts made after this date to change the objective of the bonds to 
maintain their capital value  and provide a worthwhile income for the life tenant as well. But this didnt 
involve any fundamental change to, or an analysis of the suitability of, the investments themselves.    
But, more significantly, in June 2010, while representing IFA2, the AR firm carried out an annual 
review of the will trust, enclosing the annual  portfolio valuation and comment  on the continued 
suitability of the investments  based on the Trustee Investment Report  dated February 2007 
with confirmation to the trustees  that the investments continue to meet your objective. to provide an 
income for the life tenant  and endeavour to preserve  the capital value  in todays terms for the benefit  
of the remaindermen.  
In September 2011, while representing IFA3,  the AR firm carried out a similar  with identical 
conclusions.
And, yet, in July 2013, IFA4 identified a fundamental flaw in the original  advice - that the investment  
bonds were  not appropriate  to provide  an income  for the life tenant as it constituted  withdrawals of 
capital to which she wasnt entitled under an interest-in-possession  trust  and recommended that 
the trustees should surrender the bonds  for reinvestment  in suitable products.  
Accordingly, notwithstanding  the absence of a Retainer Agreement  between  the AR firm and the 
trustees from September 2009, Im inclined to conclude  that the AR firm was retained to carry  out a 
review of the original  advice  from July 2007, did carry out such a review in June  2010 and made  a 
recommendation to the trustees  that the advice remained suitable.
So, based on the evidence available to me, I dont think GFL is liable for the financial losses 
emanating from the original advice  given to the trustees in July 2007 once it ceased to be the principal 
firm of the trustees adviser in September 2009.   
Therefore, its appropriate to cap its liability to 8 September 2009.  From  this point, it was the 
responsibility of the new principal of the AR firm to review the original advice. This it did in June 2010 
and concluded the investments remained suitable. So, this firm assumed responsibility for this advice 
at that point.
As such, my revised view is that GFL is responsible  for losses incurred by the will trust caused by the 
original advice  in July 2007 to 8 September 2009.
As I said in my first provisional decision, its difficult to reconcile the interests of Mrs R and the 
remaindermen when there was provision in Mrs Bs will for the trust fund to be invested. The only form 
of investment that could guarantee the interests of both sets of beneficiaries was a deposit-based 
account that enabled the life tenant to receive  interest which didnt threaten the original capital  value 
for the remaindermen.
But this didnt  guarantee that the life tenant  would  receive  a worthwhile income and the will did make 
provision for the trust fund to be invested. Therefore,  my view remains that the interest of the 
Ref: DRN121472213beneficiaries should be fairly balanced without breaching the terms of the trust.  The trustees  should  
have been advised to invest in a pure income-producing product that invested in a Distribution fund,  
or an alternative fund that offered the same mix of assets and a low risk profile.
  
fair compensation
In assessing what would be fair compensation, I consider  that my aim should be to put the trust as 
close to the position it would probably now be in if the trustees had not been given unsuitable advice.
I think  the trustees would have invested differently. It is not possible to say precisely what  the trustees 
would have done, but I am satisfied that what I have  set out below  is fair and reasonable given the 
trusts circumstances and objectives when  the trustees invested. 
what should GFL do? 
To compensate the trust fairly, GFL must request each bond provider  to calculate the value of a unit 
trust that invested  in a Distribution, or an equivalent, fund on 8 September  2009, including all the 
natural income payments that would have been made to the trustees.
GFL should then compare  these values with the value of each investment bond  at 
8 September 2009 and pay the difference between the value of each unit trust and investment bond 
at that date. If the combined value  of the investment  bonds  is greater than the value of the unit trusts, 
no compensation is payable.
 
The periodic withdrawals  made from the bonds should  be deducted from the ongoing value of the unit 
trusts at the points they were actually  paid so they cease to accrue any return  in the calculation from 
that date.
As the investment bonds  ought  to have been surrendered  on 8 September  2009, a potential tax 
charge would  have incurred by the trust on any gains the four investment bonds made at that date. 
This tax charge would not have occurred  if the trustees had been recommended  pure income-
producing investments that, in all likelihood, would  have  given rise to no income tax or capital gains 
tax charges, given the life tenants tax status.
Therefore, the tax charge the trust would have incurred  sat 8 September  2009 should be added  to 
any investment losses calculated below. 
If the bond  providers are unable, or unwilling, to carry out these  calculations, GFL should: 
Compare the performance  of the trusts investments with that of the benchmark shown below  
and pay the difference between the fair value and the actual  value of the investments.  If the 
actual value  is greater than the fair value, no compensation is payable.
A separate calculation should  be carried  out for each investment. The resultant figures  should  then be 
added up. If the calculation still shows  a loss, that would be the amount payable  to the trust.  GFL 
should also pay interest  as set out below. Income tax may be payable on any interest awarded.

fair value
This is what the investment  would  have  been  worth at the end date had it produced a return using the 
benchmark.
To arrive at the fair value when  using the fixed rate bonds as the benchmark, GFL should  use the 
monthly average rate for the fixed rate bonds with 12 to 17 months maturity as published by the Bank 
of England. The rate for each month is that shown as at the end of the previous month. Those rates  
should be applied  to the investment on an annually  compounded basis. 
Any withdrawal, income or other payment out of the investment should be deducted from the fair 
value calculation at the point it was actually  paid so it ceases to accrue  any return  in the calculation 
from that point  on. 
If there  are a large number  of regular payments, to keep calculations simpler, I will accept if GFL 
totals all those  payments  and deducts that figure at the end instead of deducting  periodically. 
why is this remedy suitable?
I have chosen this method of compensation because:
The trustees wanted  income  with some growth with a small risk to the trusts  capital.
The average rate for the fixed rate bonds would be a fair measure  for someone who wanted to 
achieve a reasonable  return without risk to the trusts capital. 
The FTSE  UK Private Investors Income total return  index  (prior to 1 March 2017,  the FTSE 
WMA Stock Market  Income total return index)  is a mix of diversified indices representing 
different asset classes, mainly UK equities  and government bonds. It would be a fair measure  
for someone who was prepared to take some risk to get a higher return. 
I consider that the trusts  risk profile  was in between, in the sense that the trustees were  
prepared to take a small level of risk to attain the trusts investment  objectives. So, the 50/50 
combination would reasonably put the trust into that position.  It does not mean that the 
trustees would have  invested 50per  cent of the trusts money  in a fixed  rate bond and 50per  
cent in some kind of index tracker fund.  Rather, I consider this a reasonable compromise  that 
broadly reflects the sort of return the trustees could  have obtained from investments suited to 
the trusts objective and risk attitude.  
The additional interest is for being deprived  of the use of any compensation money  since the 
end date.  
further provisional decision
I uphold the complaint. 
My provisional  decision  is that Global Financial  Limited should pay the amount calculated as set out 
above.
Kim Davenport
ombudsman
Ref: DRN121472216COPY OF FIRST PROVISIONAL DECISION
complaint
The trustees have complained that advice they received  from Global Financial Limited  (GFL) in July 
2007 to invest Â£220,000 in the Distribution  fund of four investment bonds was unsuitable  for the 
objectives of the trust.
Mrs B stipulated in her will that, on her death,  Mrs R, the life tenant, should  receive an income from 
the residual value of her estate (the trust fund). Then, whenever Mrs R died, the capital value of the 
trust fund should pass to two nominated  charities. This was confirmed by GFL in a suitability letter to 
the trustees dated July 2007.
 
The trustees were  recommended to make  capital withdrawals of five per cent of the original 
investment to pay as income to Mrs R. The trustees have said that, although gains made within an 
investment bond are taxed as income, the five per cent withdrawals paid to Mrs R are a return  of 
capital. Mrs R is not entitled  to this capital - she was due an income.
The trustees have questioned this advice for the following reasons:
this was an interest-in-possession trust where the life tenant, Mrs R, is entitled to income and 
the remaindermen,  the nominated charities, to the capital. But the advice recommended 
investment bonds  that pay out capital, not income. This breached  the terms of the trust;
the case  of Broadies  trustees v IRC (1933)  stated that any regular payment made  to a 
beneficiary can be taxed as income,  which makes the advice  even more  curious;
the advice is presented as tax-efficient to pay capital  but the regularity of the income would 
imply that it should be taxed as income  regardless. As such, if investment returns  dont match 
the income paid to Mrs R, the value  of the trust fund for the remaindermen would fall and the 
income distributed to Mrs R may also be taxed;
the will trust is a protected trust which is intended to maintain  the original  value of the trust 
fund for the remaindermen.  But the capital has been paid to Mrs R with no guarantee that the 
value of the trust fund would  remain intact;
Mrs R is a non-taxpayer and an interest-in-possession trust is taxed  at basic rate, so she 
would have  been  able to claim the benefit of any tax paid. An investment bond pays  
corporation tax within  the funds, equivalent to basic rate tax of 20 per cent, that affects the 
investment returns  and cant be reclaimed  by Mrs R, despite her tax status.  In other words, 
the advice has turned Mrs R from a non-taxpayer with limited income into a basic rate 
taxpayer;
a pure income-producing investment would have enabled Mrs R to set any gains against her 
personal allowances and starting band of income. But the advice given to the trustees 
ensures that she pays tax of 20 per cent she cant reclaim;
any gains made by the investment bonds  are charged to the trust at the trust rate of 45 per 
cent (less 20 per cent already taxed within  the fund),  whereas an income-producing 
investment would incur a tax credit  of ten per cent and further liability only if Mrs R was a tax 
payer. But she was a non-taxpayer;  
the advice doesnt  consider the position if Mrs R survives 20 years and the whole  capital has 
been paid out. There is then no capital that qualifies for tax-efficiency and all subsequent 
payments to Mrs R would be taxed as income.
The trustees have requested  that the value  of the trust is placed back  in the financial position  it would 
have been in if this advice had not been given.
background
Mrs R was aged 50 at the time, she didnt  work for health reasons and received income support.  So, 
in all likelihood, she was a non-taxpayer and GFL noted that the investments needed  to be as tax-
efficient as possible.
Ref: DRN121472217It seems that a representative of the two trustees confirmed  to GFL that Â£220,000  was available from 
the trust fund for investment,  which included equity from the sale of a property, other investments and 
shares.
GFL advised the trustees to place Â£220,000 in four investment  bonds in equal  shares, invested in 
funds that represented a low-to-medium  degree of risk, with the trustees as bondholders and Mrs R 
as life assured. In this way, whenever Mrs R died, the capital value of the bond would be paid back  to 
the trust for disposal to the nominated charities.
In its response to the complaint, GFL said that:
the trustees adviser was an Appointed Representative  (AR) of GFL until September  2009 
when it became an independent financial  adviser  which retained the file and continued to act 
as the trustees adviser;
the trustees and the adviser decided  to continue  their relationship, severing their relationship 
with GFL.  Accordingly, GFL has access to very limited  point of sale documentation, including 
the suitability letter but not the factfind;
it only holds a record  for one of the investment bonds whose capital value was intact in 
September 2009. The trustees  had only taken the distribution from the investment bonds and 
there was no reduction  in the capital;
the trustees were responsible  for deciding  how they declared this distribution via their tax 
return. GFL was not their tax adviser;
any losses or advice about the suitability for the continuance of the arrangement  was the 
responsibility of its former AR.
The trustees  complaint  was investigated by one of our adjudicators, whose  initial view was that it 
should be upheld.  
Briefly, he felt that Mrs R was receiving a natural income from the investments which  didnt breach  the 
trust as the trustees  are claiming.  But he thought the choice of Distribution  fund didnt match the 
trustees instructions for a low/medium  approach  to risk because they invested a significant  amount in 
UK and overseas equities. Accordingly, he recommended  that GFL should  pay redress to the trust as 
if the trustees had been advised to invest in funds that provided a benchmark  rate of return  
appropriate for low risk investors.   
He also confirmed that GFL should accept responsibility  for the advice given by its appointed 
representative.
In response, GFL disagreed with the adjudicators  assessment  and said that:
the adviser ceased  to be an AR of GFL since September 2009 but retained the trustees  as 
clients. Therefore, GFLs  liability for the advice  ended  at that time. This is supported by a 
previous ombudsmans  decision and in Vick v Vogle-Gapes [2006]  EWHC 1579 (QB);
it is the trustees responsibility (under the Trustee Act 2000) to vet their new adviser and 
ensured that it properly reviewed their existing  investment holdings;
with regard to the make-up of the Distribution funds, they included  a reasonable proportion of 
assets in equities that made the funds suitable for low/medium risk investors;
the adjudicator  should have obtained  and passed  on to GFL all evidence, including  the 
business file held by its former AR so that natural justice can prevail;
the trustees werent advised to take five per cent withdrawals; this was quoted to illustrate  the 
tax-efficiency of the bonds;
the investments  were  set up in a way that provided  a distribution of income only to Mrs R and 
the capital to remain  intact for the remaindermen;
GFL is not responsible  after September 2009 for reviewing the original advice, the method of 
withdrawals, monitoring the ongoing value  of the bonds  and the suitability  of the will trust;
The advisers  who receive trail commission  are responsible for ongoing advice.
Ref: DRN121472218The adjudicator considered these points and wrote  to the trustees with his revised view that the 
complaint should not be upheld.  He didnt think the trust had been  breached and the make-up of the 
investment funds was suitable for low/medium risk investors. The intention of Mrs Bs will was to 
maintain the real value of the trust fund while providing  Mrs R an income. This required some degree 
of risk to achieve this balance.  If GFL had recommended no-risk investments,  this would have 
disadvantaged Mrs R since interest rates have drastically  reduced since March 2009. 
In response, the trustees disagreed with this view and said that:
the trust required  true and natural income  from the investments. Investment bonds are not 
deemed to generate  income. Even  if the underlying funds in which  the bond is invested are 
income generating, its not income in the hands  of the trustees;
the court  of appeal case of  Stevenson v Wishart [1987] STC 266 concluded that investment 
bonds are unsuitable  for interest-in-possession  trusts because  the beneficiaries are only 
entitled to receive a true income;
an investment bond is a wholly unsuitable investment for a will trust where there is a 
protective life interest as the aim is to yield a natural income to Mrs R and capital growth for 
the remaindermen. Withdrawals from an investment bond are capital  and if it exceeds the 
annual allowance amount,  there is an income tax charge.  The trustees are liable to income 
tax within the bond and theres no top slicing relief for trustees ;
gains are charged to income tax at the trustees rate, currently 45 per cent. A 20 per cent 
credit is given for corporation tax suffered  in the funds of an investment bond.  But this tax 
cant be reclaimed  by a non-taxpayer; 
for interest-in-possession trusts, the life tenants right to income is credited with the basic 
rate tax suffered  by the trust on the income being distributed to them before being taxed  at 
their own marginal  rates.  The problem  with the income tax charge on a chargeable event gain 
is that the tax has arisen on a capital profit rather than income. As theres no income paid to 
the life tenant, she cant recover the tax suffered in the trust.  With a trust tax rate of 45 per 
cent, this situation is something  that should be avoided;
when the bonds are surrendered (on Mrs Rs death), the overall gain on surrender  will 
potentially produce a tax charge on the trustees at, currently  45 per cent.  No credit for this will 
be available to the remaindermen when capital  is distributed to them;
if distribution of the growth  is income (which its not), all distributions  from the bonds would  be 
taxable at the rate applicable to trusts rather than based on Mrs Rs personal allowance. This 
disadvantages her as shes unable  to reclaim  income tax suffered;
trustees can assign investment bonds to beneficiaries when they become entitled, thereby 
avoiding a charge  to tax. This allows  the beneficiaries to surrender  the bond  with reference to 
their own tax position. This cant be done where there is a life tenant who is not entitle to 
capital;
distributions from the bond are not natural income. If, as the adjudicator states,  distributions 
are made  from within  the five per cent withdrawals, this would produce an income tax charge, 
making the whole investment tax-inefficient as it would  be taxed  at trustee  rates without  Mrs 
R, who is a non-taxpayer, being able to reclaim  any of the tax.
The adjudicator replied to say that:
while  its technically  correct to say that withdrawals are a return  of capital, Mrs R hasnt 
actually received  any of the original Â£220,000 invested. She only received the natural income 
produced. Therefore,  he couldnt say that the trust has been breached.  
if, for example, Mrs R had received a dividend or distribution from a corporate bond, this 
would be the income or return on the capital invested.  In essence, this is whats also 
happening with the investment bonds; 
although withdrawals are treated for tax purposes as if they are returns  of capital, in financial 
terms, they are the natural  income  from the investment and so they dont make the bonds 
unsuitable;
Ref: DRN121472219the points made about tax dont materially  change this position  which is that the trustees  
under the terms  of the trust had to invest the money to produce an income  which they could  
then pay to Mrs R. Tax was always going to be paid at some rate;
in paying a natural  income to Mrs R from the capital withdrawals, tax was deferred.
The trustees responded that:
the adjudicator  has ignored the arguments against the suitability  of an investment bond for an 
interest-in-possession trust (with no power to apply or advance capital);
the advice stopped income being available  for distribution to the beneficiary under  trust law 
and facilitated a breach of trust by the trustees;
Mrs R wasnt entitled  to any part of the trust fund  only the natural income  derived from it;
although it accepted that tax is deferred, it has to be paid at some point by the trustees and 
not by the beneficiary. This cant be reclaimed by Mrs R;
if the payments  to Mrs R were natural  income, the trustees could  use her personal allowance 
to ensure it was tax-efficient. The bonds can never be taxed on the life tenant  and this is an 
unsuitable position  for the trust.
GFL wished to ensure  that we took account of all the points  it had previously made, principally that
GFL ceased to be the trustees adviser since September  2009 and couldnt provide ongoing 
reviews of the original  advice. A previous decision from this service upheld this view;
the trustees were only meant to distribute income from the Distribution fund to enable capital 
to remain intact. If the trustees failed  to follow this advice,  that is their responsibility;
it did warn the trustees that there would be tax implications if withdrawals were more than five 
per cent;
the cases  of Brodies Trustees v CIR 17 TC 432 and Cunards Trustees v CIR 27 TC 122 
overturned the position taken in Stevenson v Wishart;
other types of investment could have produced  capital gains  tax (CGT) liability;
for interest-in-possession trusts, beneficiaries  to whom income is distributed are entitled to a 
credit equivalent  to basic rate tax;
the tax treatment of income arising from discretionary trusts  has become much less 
favourable. For dividend  payments, tax is charged at 42.5 per cent to take account of the ten 
per cent tax credit. When dividends are distributed to beneficiaries,  its regarded as income 
from the trust and they are doubly penalised by losing the benefits  of the dividend tax credit 
and the income is still deemed to have been franked at 50 per cent even though the actual 
rate is 42.5 per cent. Therefore, all categories of taxpayer receiving dividends from 
discretionary trust suffer a 20 per cent higher  tax charge  than they would on savings  income 
from the same trust.
As no agreement has been reached in this complaint, it has been referred  to me for review.  
provisional findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  is fair and reasonable  in 
the circumstances of this complaint. I do understand and appreciate both parties comments  about the 
suitability of an investment  bond for an interest-in-possession  trust.
Ongoing responsibility of GFL for the original advice
With regard to GFLs ongoing responsibility  for the advice, this depends  on the nature of the 
complaint being made by the trustees.
The trustees say that the complaint concerns the advice given in July 2007 by an Appointed 
Representative (AR) of GFL to recommend investments that would meet the requirements of Mrs Bs 
will trust. As far as I am aware, there are no complaint  issues  that arise after September  2009 other 
than in respect of the original advice.
Ref: DRN121472220Accordingly, my view is that GFL remains responsible for the financial consequences of that advice, 
regardless of whether  they were removed  as advisers after September 2009. I appreciate that they 
say they werent  privy  to any information after this date and therefore  cant  be held responsible for 
advice given since then.  But the complaint,  as far as I can see, is based on the suitability of the 
original advice, and not any subsequent  advice given later on.
A recent  case of Denning v Greenhalgh Financial Services Limited (2017)  sets out when a new 
adviser can be held responsible for a previous advisers  negligent advice. This depends on the terms 
and limits of the retainer and that any duty of care arising from this must  be directly related to what  
the new adviser  is instructed to do. 
As the trustees complaint concerns the suitability of advice GFL gave (through its AR) in July 2007,  
GFL remains responsible for any financial  consequences  of that advice  regardless of whether the 
trustees changed their advisers since then (or effectively sacked  GFL and remained with its former 
AR). 
Only if it ought to have occurred to the new  adviser  after September 2009 there was an issue with 
the suitability of the original advice would  it be liable for this advice from that date. 
But I dont know the terms and conditions of the retainer  (if there was a new agreement) between  the 
trustees and the AR. I do appreciate that the AR has always been the trustees advisers (albeit that 
any advice it gave was the responsibility of GFL between July 2007 and September  2009). As such, 
the AR would  have some  knowledge of the original advice.
In the Denning  case above, the new advisers  werent responsible  for previous advice because  it was 
a different firm, the advice had been given eight years earlier and it hadnt  been asked to look at that 
advice. 
The AR in this case was the same adviser  and the advice it gave was less than three years earlier. 
But it didnt have cause  to review the advice  because  it had been given in 2007 for the long term.  
Therefore, my view is that GFL remains financially responsible after September  2009 for the advice 
given in July 2007. 
But, if it can be shown that the terms and benefits of the investment bonds had in any way been 
altered after September 2009, there would be a case for the new adviser accepting  responsibility for 
any advice given some time after this date.
 
With regard to the decision on a previous complaint quoted  by GFL, I dont agree  that this forms a 
precedent as I cant see that its similar and the outcome was based on different facts.  
Advice given  in July 2007
Regrettably, GFL is unable to provide a file that records the instructions it took from the original 
trustees in 2007 with regard to the objectives of the will trust. So, Ive relied on the suitability letter 
produced by the adviser dated July 2007 to understand the precise  instructions  he received from the 
trustees as to the distribution of the trust fund and their investment objectives. 
Its important to emphasise that the clients who sought,  and received,  advice were the trustees, and 
not the beneficiaries,  of the will trust. It, therefore, fell on the adviser to establish  from the trustees 
(and not from the trust deed itself) what the objectives of the will trust were in order  to make a 
recommendation.
The suitability letter does seem to include  conflicting information; in particular, with regard to the 
nature of an investment  bond  and how it can appropriately satisfy  the objectives of the will trust.  This 
may have arisen either from incorrect or unclear instructions given  by the trustees  or the adviser 
misunderstanding their instructions.
Ref: DRN121472221 
Mrs Bs will states that, from the value of her residual estate, the trust should hold income from the 
trust fund for Mrs R, the life tenant, during her lifetime. Then, after Mrs Rs death, the trustees  hold 
both the capital and income of the trust fund for two nominated charities  in equal  shares.
As a rule, investment bonds are not appropriate  trustee investments  where the life tenant is entitled to 
receive trust income only. But they can be used to produce capital payments to the trustees  through 
the five per cent capital withdrawal allowance, which  can be distributed to beneficiaries entitled to 
income, providing the trust wording stipulates that they are entitled to capital. Ive seen  no evidence 
from Mrs Bs will that she intended Mrs R to receive capital payments as income;  particularly as it also 
seems her intention  was for the original  capital  sum to be intact for the remaindermen  whenever Mrs 
R died.  
Accordingly, the suitability letter confirms that the trustees objectives  are to pay out any income 
generated by the trust (i.e. investment) to Mrs R and then the capital will be distributed to the 
remainder men  (charities)  on her demise.   
Furthermore, the will states only that the trustees should hold the income  of the Trust Fund upon 
protective trusts for the benefit of .. . It does not specify the amount of income Mrs R should  
receive which, again, would suggest that Mrs R is entitled to an income, and only if the trust fund 
produces an income. 
 
Therefore, notwithstanding the issues relating to the taxation of investment bonds or whether  they 
breach the terms  of an interest-in-possession trust, Mrs Bs will provides that she should receive 
purely a natural income, and not capital payments  which  could reduce  the original value of the trust 
fund.
Against that, the trustees did have a duty to balance  Mrs Rs entitlement  to income and preservation  
of the trust funds capital value by apportioning the income, so as to give a fair yield to Mrs R. Hence, 
if the investments  produce less than a fair yield for Mrs R, income can, in my view, be made up to that 
level from capital but only if the trust wording allows this. Although the suitability states that, under the 
will, the trustees .. have the discretion to distribute capital, I cant  see that the will does give 
them this discretion.
Indeed, the adviser confirms that the trustees would  be unlikely to distribute capital to Mrs R as this 
could have an adverse  effect on the benefits she receives. He also states that the specific objective 
of the trust is to invest a lump sum to provide an income and at the same time to endeavour to 
preserve the capital value  in todays terms for the benefit of the remaindermen.   
But the adviser then confirms that, as investment bonds dont produce an income, theres  no 
immediate liability to tax. He also refers to the 5per  cent rule to generate a regular stream  of cash  
but admits that this would be a return of the original  capital invested which ought  to be preserved for 
the remaindermen. To be able to use this option,  the trustees  must have a right to distribute capital as 
income and the will trust doesnt give them this right.     
Having said that, the trustees must be fair to the beneficiaries  of the trust; particularly where  a life 
interest exists. As such,  its understandable that Mrs R should receive  a worthwhile income from it 
while shes alive. A pure income-producing  investment,  such as an OEIC or a unit trust, may not have 
been able to satisfy this requirement. If the adviser  had recommended an investment that produced  a 
real or natural  income, Mrs R may,  on occasions,  have  received no income at all to ensure  the 
original capital  value was intact for the remaindermen.
The ultimate  beneficiaries of Mrs Bs residuary estate are the remaindermen and that this was 
intended to remain intact throughout  Mrs Rs lifetime.  The trustee  had no discretion to allocate  it 
between Mrs R and the remaindermen.  Mrs R has only a lifetime interest in an unquantified income. 
She has no right to the capital of the residuary  estate  under the terms of the will. In my view, if capital 
was distributed  to her when  she was entitled only to income, this did constitute  a breach of the trust. 
Ref: DRN121472222Otherwise, the will needed to give the trustees discretion to pay capital to her to make up any shortfall 
in natural income. But only if it stated that the residuary  estate however much remained should be 
left to the remaindermen. The will didnt make this provision. 
The onus was on the trustees  to make the position  of the beneficiaries under the will trust clear  to the 
adviser. It wasnt the responsibility of the adviser to identify it from the trust wording.  Although there 
are contradictions in the suitability  letter, Im inclined to think that the trustees instructions  to the 
adviser were consistent with the terms of the will and the limitations of Mrs Rs entitlement under  it; 
i.e. she has a lifetime interest only and is entitled to receive an income from the trust fund but, on 
occasions, she may not receive  an income. While the trustees could have been given discretion as to 
whether or not income is drawn from capital, they were given no such  discretion in this case. This 
appears to have been  understood by the adviser  at the time.   
I note the trustees have  since surrendered the bonds in 2014 and reinvested the proceeds in a 
discretionary fund which yields natural income in accordance with the terms of the will. 
But the trustees  also say that Mrs R .is struggling with the income levels  which is a result of the 
poorly managed trust fund and the loss to it.. . .Although it may not have been Mrs Bs intention  
for Mrs R to receive  an irregular income (and sometimes no income at all), that is what  the will states.
Section13 of the will also states that the trust fund may be invested in risk-based  product and the 
trustees appear to have agreed  to adopt a low/medium  risk with the trust fund. This didnt  lend itself to 
the need  for Mrs Rs to receive a regular income  and the trust fund staying intact for the 
remaindermen. They could only be met by investing in deposit-based accounts that preserved  the 
original capital  sum. Bank of England base rate was 5.75 per cent per annum  in July 2007.
Therefore, in my view,  the needs of Mrs R and the remaindermen needed to have been balanced  by 
investing the trust fund in a low risk investment  that offered the potential  to pay Mrs R a pure and 
natural income that preserved,  as much as possible, the capital value of the trust fund.
Distribution fund
So the adviser suggested this conflict between income and a return  of capital could be resolved by 
investing the trust fund in a Distribution fund which he said generates a natural  income in the form of 
periodic distributions. The adviser wasnt recommending the trustees  to make capital withdrawals of 
five per cent to provide a fixed income  for Mrs R. He was suggesting the trustees  could make regular 
payments to her from distributions within the five percent allowance for tax-efficiency. 
In other words, if these  distributions were less than Â£11,000 per annum, the payments made to Mrs R 
from the bonds were  tax-deferred.  He wasnt recommending the trustees to pay Mrs R Â£11,000 per 
annum regardless of the performance of the bonds or the distributions generated by them. If the 
trustees did make payments  to Mrs R of five per cent of the original investment  of Â£220,000, they 
were not following his advice. 
However, for tax purposes, distributions are treated  as capital payments that are charged to income  
tax under the normal chargeable event tax rules even though no units are surrendered to make these  
distributions. The unit price  would continue to fluctuate, so theres  no guarantee that the original 
capital value of the bonds would remain intact either. 
As the adjudicator  has said previously, its possible  that the instruction to the product providers  for the 
trustees to take only the distributions may have changed after July 2007. If Mrs R had begun 
receiving payments from the bonds equivalent to Â£11,000 per annum, she wasnt meant to do so 
according to the original advice  given by GFL. This might explain why the trustees  are now saying 
that Mrs R is struggling with the income  payments she receives from a wholly income-producing 
investment.
Ref: DRN121472223So the remaining question is whether the tax treatment of the Distribution  Bond relative  to that of a 
pure income-producing investment makes it unsuitable  for this will trust.  
Taxation issues
Ive considered GFLs point that the tax treatment of an income-producing  investment, such as a unit 
trust or an OEIC, may not be quite as favourable to the trust as the trustees have indicated.
Mrs Bs will created an interest-in-possession trust, and not a discretionary trust; i.e. one where Mrs 
R has an entitlement to the income  arising  from the trust fund but not to the trust capital.
A pure income-producing investment would appear to present a tax advantage over the bond as the 
charge on dividend income,  and on any gains on surrender, is calculated according  to Mrs Rs 
individual tax status.
Investments, such as units trust or OEICs,  would have paid a real or natural income to the trustees  
from interest or dividends earned and suffered the ten per cent tax credit levied  on share  dividends.  
Mrs R couldnt reclaim  this tax charge. Otherwise, the returns from a unit trust or an OEIC are taxed  
according to her tax status, not at trust rates, and therefore she would  have been unlikely to pay any 
more tax. 
When the unit trust or OEIC is redeemed  on Mrs Rs death, even if it had realised  gains of more than 
her annual  capital gains tax exemption, the surplus is added to her income and taxed as income  from 
savings. As Mrs R was a non-taxpayer, altogether there could be little, or no, tax to pay.
On the other hand, tax on the income distributions from an investment bond would be deferred. But 
the underlying  funds  incur  a tax charge of 20 per cent on profits or gains they make which  the trustees  
cant reclaim until the Bond is surrendered. At this point, tax is definitely charged to the trustees  at the 
trust rate of 45 per cent (less the 20 per cent tax credit under the bond) on any gain made  by the 
bond, including all the distributions made to Mrs R as income.   
All things considered, I tend to agree with the trustees that the tax consequences of the investment 
bonds relative  to a pure income-producing investment are unfavourable  (ultimately to the 
remaindermen).
conclusions
For this reason (and not necessarily because the advice  breached  the terms of the trust), Im inclined 
to think  that investment bonds were not appropriate for the needs of the trust.
Having said that, I dont believe  a pure income-producing investment that couldnt offer a reasonable 
chance of providing a regular  fixed income for Mrs R or preserve the capital value  of the trust fund for 
the remaindermen may not have been appropriate  either.
Its difficult to reconcile the interests of Mrs R and the remaindermen when there was provision in Mrs 
Bs will for the trust fund to be invested. The only form of investment that could  guarantee the 
interests of both sets of beneficiaries was a deposit-based account that enabled Mrs R to receive a 
worthwhile yield which didnt threaten the original capital  value for the remaindermen.
But the will made provision  for the trust fund to be invested. Therefore, my view is that the interest of 
the beneficiaries  should be fairly balanced without breaching the terms of the trust. The trustees 
should have been advised  to invest in a pure income-producing  product that invested in a Distribution  
fund, or an alternative fund that offered the same mix of assets and low risk profile.
fair compensation
In assessing what would be fair compensation, I consider  that my aim should be to put the trust as 
Ref: DRN121472224close to the position it would probably now be in if the trustees had not been given unsuitable advice.
I think  the trustees would have invested differently. It is not possible to say precisely what  the trustees 
would have done, but I am satisfied that what I have  set out below  is fair and reasonable given the 
trusts circumstances and objectives when  the trustees invested. 
what should GFL do? 
To compensate the trust fairly, GFL must request each bond provider  to calculate the value of a unit 
trust that invested  in a Distribution, or an equivalent, fund when the bonds were surrendered in 
September 2014 including all the natural income payments  that would have been made to the 
trustees.
GFL should then compare  these values with the value of each investment bond  at September  2014  
and pay the difference between the value of each unit trust and investment bond  at that date. If the 
combined value of the investment bonds is greater than the value  of the unit trusts, no compensation 
is payable.
 
The periodic withdrawals  made from the bonds should  be deducted from the ongoing value of the unit 
trusts at the points they were actually  paid so they cease to accrue any return  in the calculation from 
that date.
Conversely, from the total actual value  of the four investment  bonds,  a sum of Â£11,482.15 should  be 
deducted at the date of surrender to calculate the actual net value  of the four investments after tax. 
The trustees would not have surrendered  a pure income-producing investment and, therefore,  there 
would have been no capital gains tax liability.
If the bond  providers are unable, or unwilling, to carry out these  calculations, GFL should: 
Compare the performance  of the trusts investments with that of the benchmark shown below  
and pay the difference between the fair value and the actual  value of the investments.  If the 
actual value  is greater than the fair value, no compensation is payable.
A separate calculation should  be carried  out for each investment. The resultant figures  should  
then be added  up. If the calculation still shows a loss, that would be the amount payable  to the 
trust. 
GFL should also pay interest as set out below. 
Income tax may be payable on any interest awarded.

actual value
This means  the actual  amount paid or payable from the investment  at the end date. 
From the total actual value of the four investment  bonds, a sum of Â£11,482.15 should be deducted at 
the date of surrender to calculate the actual net value of the four investments after tax. The trustees 
would not have surrendered  a pure income-producing investment and, therefore, there would have 
been no capital gains tax liability.
fair value
This is what the investment  would  have  been  worth at the end date had it produced a return using the 
benchmark.
To arrive at the fair value when  using the fixed rate bonds as the benchmark, GFL should  use the 
monthly average rate for the fixed rate bonds with 12 to 17 months maturity as published by the Bank 
of England. The rate for each month is that shown as at the end of the previous month. Those rates  
should be applied  to the investment on an annually  compounded basis. 
Any withdrawal, income or other payment out of the investment should be deducted from the fair 
value calculation at the point it was actually  paid so it ceases to accrue  any return  in the calculation 
from that point  on. 
Ref: DRN121472226If there  are a large number  of regular payments, to keep calculations simpler, I will accept if GFL 
totals all those  payments  and deducts that figure at the end instead of deducting  periodically. 
why is this remedy suitable?
I have chosen this method of compensation because:
The trustees wanted  income  with some growth with a small risk to the trusts  capital.
The average rate for the fixed rate bonds would be a fair measure  for someone who wanted to 
achieve a reasonable  return without risk to the trusts capital. 
The FTSE  UK Private Investors Income total return  index  (prior to 1 March 2017,  the FTSE 
WMA Stock Market  Income total return index)  is a mix of diversified indices representing 
different asset classes, mainly UK equities  and government bonds. It would be a fair measure  
for someone who was prepared to take some risk to get a higher return. 
I consider that the trusts  risk profile  was in between, in the sense that the trustees were  
prepared to take a small level of risk to attain the trusts investment  objectives. So, the 50/50 
combination would reasonably put the trust into that position.  It does not mean that the 
trustees would have  invested 50per  cent of the trusts money  in a fixed  rate bond and 50per  
cent in some kind of index tracker fund.  Rather, I consider this a reasonable compromise  that 
broadly reflects the sort of return the trustees could  have obtained from investments suited to 
the trusts objective and risk attitude.  
The additional interest is for being deprived  of the use of any compensation money  since the 
end date.  
my provisional  decision
I uphold the complaint. My provisional decision is that Global Financial Limited should pay the amount 
calculated as set out above.
