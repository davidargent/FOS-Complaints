K822xcomplaint
Mr T complains that Aviva Life & Pensions  UK Limited gave him the wrong information about 
his With Profits Whole of Life Assurance  policy which  meant he didnt surrender it when he 
shouldve done.
background 
Mr T took out his policy on 1 October  1982.  Under  the policy a terminal bonus  and 
reorganisation bonus are potentially payable. The bonus rate applied depends on, amongst 
other things,  how long the policy  has been held. Aviva wrote  to policyholders in May 2018 
with its annual bonus announcement.
Mr T questioned the drop in value in the death  value and surrender  value  between  2017 and 
2018. Aviva  wrote to him on 18 September 2018 showing how the values  had been  
calculated and the bonus rates applied. He telephoned on 20 September 2018  to discuss  his 
policy and was told the current terminal bonus  rate was higher than the letter indicated  
74% instead of 29%.
 
Aviva confirmed the figure of 74% for the terminal bonus rate given on the telephone on 
20 September 2018 was right in its final response letter (FRL).  But it said that the time it 
wouldve taken for it to have sent the surrender forms wouldve meant Mr Ts policy wouldve 
been another year gone and different  rates wouldve applied if he had wanted to surrender. It 
paid him £100  for having provided the wrong  information about the bonus rates.
One of our adjudicators considered the complaint and said she didnt think that Aviva had 
acted fairly.  She said Mr T had been given the correct information about the terminal  bonus 
in a telephone call on 20 September 2018 but was told the figures would have to be checked 
and confirmed to him and that he could then telephone and cancel the policy.
The adjudicator said the policy couldnt be cancelled by telephone and that Aviva  wouldve 
had to send out surrender forms. She said that as this wouldve taken up to 10 days the 
terminal bonus wouldve  dropped by the time Mr Ts policy was actually surrendered and that 
he wouldnt  have been able to surrender at the higher bonus  rate he had been  given on 
20 September 2018. 
The adjudicator thought  that Mr T shouldve had the option of surrendering  on 4 October 
2018 on the basis that if he had been  given the right information  he mightve surrendered  
then and that he should be paid £250 for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Mr T didnt  agree with the adjudicator. He said if he had been  given the correct  information 
he needed in a timely manner the surrender value wouldve been £9445. The options  he has 
as a result  of the adjudicators decision mean he would have to accept a lower  surrender 
value or keep the policy and accept £250  compensation.
Mr T said that both Aviva  and the adjudicator agreed  that delays occurred because Aviva  
consistently provided incorrect advice. It agreed on 20 September 2018 that the terminal 
bonus shouldve  been 74% and the reorganisation  bonus 4.45%.  The fact their process  
meant it took up to 10 days  to issue the surrender forms shouldnt penalise  him.
Ref: DRN50490262As agreement hasnt been  reached the matter has been referred to me for review.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There is no dispute that Aviva provided  the wrong information to Mr T on more than one 
occasion and he is understandably upset by this. But what I have to decide is what wouldve 
happened if it hadnt got things wrong. And my findings and decision are on a balance of 
probabilities - what is more likely, than not.
Mr T contacted Aviva  on 4 September  2018 to query the drop in value of his policy between 
June 2017 and the value  given in the bonus announcement  of May 2018 - which he only 
received on 30 August  2018. 
Aviva responded on 18 September 2018 providing  figures for the surrender value of his 
policy based on the terminal bonus rate being  only 29% as at 2 July 2018  with a 
reorganisation bonus rate of 3.75%. These  figures  were wrong.
Mr T telephoned to query the figures on 20 September 2018 when he was told that the 
terminal bonus rate was actually 74% and the reorganisation bonus rate was 4.45%. These 
were the right rates for the policy as from 2 July 2018, prior to the rates changing  on 
1 October 2018 when  Mr Ts policy moved from having held the policy  for 35 years to having 
held it for 36 years. 
But in a letter dated 5 October 2018  following the telephone call Aviva repeated  that the 
terminal bonus rate was 29% and reorganisation bonus rate was 3.75%  in line with the letter  
of 18 September  2019. It was only when Mr T complained  that Aviva confirmed in its FRL 
that the figures Mr T had been given over the telephone on 20 September  2018  were right.
Mr T said that if he had been  made aware the rates he was given on 20 September  2018  
were right he wouldve  surrendered his policy. I note Aviva seek to argue that Mr T was only 
looking into options when  he telephoned  on 20 September 2018 rather than specifically 
ringing to cancel  the policy.
Having listened  to the call Im satisfied that what Mr T wanted was to have correct 
information so he could decide  what to do with his policy, including whether he should 
surrender the policy. In the call he stated:
Im trying to get a sensible view if it is right, now, to surrender my policy or whether I should 
hold on.
So Im satisfied that surrender was something  he was contemplating. And when he was told 
the terminal bonus rate was 74% with a reorganisation rate of 4.45% he said:
If it was 74% today  and 4.4% I would  probably  cancel because  that is a really good terminal  
rate.
He didnt ask to surrender at the time but I think that is because  he was told the figures 
needed to be checked. I think,  given his comments in the telephone call, that Mr T wouldve 
cancelled the policy if he knew  he would get a terminal  bonus rate of 74%. But I have to 
Ref: DRN50490263decide when that information shouldve first been  given  to him and at what point the 
surrender is more likely than not to have happened using that date.
It isnt clear why he didnt get the May 2018  bonus  announcement when it was first sent out 
as the letter  sent to him at that time was correctly addressed. But I have seen no evidence  
that this was because of something Aviva did wrong.
Mr T first queried the figures on 4 September  2018.  This is the query that Aviva sought to 
answer in its letter  of 18 September 2018 which  provided the wrong  information  about the 
terminal bonus rate and reversionary bonus  rate that were applicable and as a result  of this 
the amount it showed as the surrender  value  was wrong.
If Mr T had been given the right information in the letter  of 18 September 2018, so was 
aware the terminal bonus rate was 74% and the surrender value  was around £9,445, I think 
he wouldve asked for surrender  forms on receipt of the letter. 
So in his call on 20 September 2018 I think he is likely to have asked for surrender forms to 
be sent out. I note in the call that did take place he was told he could cancel over the 
telephone but this was wrong and wasnt  an option  that was open to him.
Aviva have said that it wouldnt have been  possible for the policy  to be surrendered before 
going into another year gone on 1 October  2018,  with different bonus rates applying. This is 
because it says it allows 10 working  days for the surrender forms to be sent out, returned  
and then actioned. Mr T has also suggested  that the forms couldve emailed to him but that 
isnt part of Avivas  process  and there  was no requirement on it to do so.
Mr T has said he shouldnt be penalised  by the fact Avivas processs took up to 10 working 
days. But in order  to find that he wouldve surrendered before 1 October 2018 I would have 
to be satisfied 10 days is an unreasonable period, and I dont think that it is. The forms have 
to be sent out, completed and returned  and the surrender  then actioned. I dont think  
allowing 10 days for that is an unreasonable period of time.  I acknowledge it is possible the 
surrender couldve  taken a shorter time, but I cant say that it is more  likely than not it 
wouldve done so.
What Aviva should  do to put things right
There is no evidence to suggest that Mr T wouldve  wanted to surrender based on the bonus  
rates applicable  after 1 October 2018. But if he had been given the right information  and as a 
result completed and sent in the surrender forms in it is possible the surrender wouldve 
gone ahead  despite this. Im also mindful  that Aviva didnt object to paying redress on that 
basis so I think it is reasonable for Mr T to still have  this option.
So Aviva should  calculate:
The surrender  value of the policy as at 4 October 2018, together with simple interest 
at 8% on that sum from 4 October 2018  to date of settlement.
The premiums paid by Mr T from 4 October  2018 to date ,together  with simple 
interest at 8% on each  premium  form date of payment  to date of settlement.
The total amount  it calculates is due will be called  the October 2018 value and it should 
provide this to Mr T together  with the current surrender  value of the policy.
Ref: DRN50490264If Mr T then decides he wants to surrender the policy  now based on the October 2018 value 
he has to notify  Aviva  within 28 days of receiving  the calculations and complete the 
necessary surrender forms. Aviva should then pay him the difference  between the October  
2018 value and the actual  surrender  value.
Aviva should  also pay Mr T £250,  including the £100 it has already paid, for the distress and 
inconvenience caused by having provided  him with the wrong  information.  
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  for the reasons I have  explained.  Aviva Life & Pension UK Limited 
has to calculate  redress and pay Mr T as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 September  2019.
