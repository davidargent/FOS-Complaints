The complaint
Mr A complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) applied a default unfairly.
What happened
Mr A held a credit card with NatWest and owed money on the card. Mr A had missed a 
couple of payments, but not enough to start the default process.
In August 2015 Mr A was declared bankrupt. Mr A has said this was a petition from a 
creditor and he was out of the country when it happened, so he couldnt defend the 
bankruptcy.
NatWest was notified of Mr As bankruptcy in August 2015 and it applied a default to the 
credit card. Mr A paid off his credit card, in full, in October 2015.
Mr A had the bankruptcy annulled almost a year later and says he told NatWest about the 
annulment at the time.
Mr A checked his credit file in mid-2020 and saw the default was still registered against his 
credit card. Mr A felt this was unfair as his bankruptcy had been annulled so he complained 
to NatWest.
Mr A said having the default on file would have meant hed paid more for financial products. 
And Mr A said hed been declined lending in the past five years and felt this was due to the 
default from NatWest.
Mr A also said NatWest had referred to him using his brothers details and sent him some of 
his brothers information.
NatWest responded to Mr As complaint and said it thought the default was an accurate 
record. NatWest explained the default was applied when Mr A was declared bankrupt and 
would stay on file for six years.
NatWest acknowledged some of the service it had provided wasnt as good as it should have 
been. To compensate for this, it sent Mr A a cheque for £50. And NatWest said it had 
checked Mr As records for a data breach but felt his information was safe.
Mr A didnt agree and brought his complaint to this service.
An investigator looked into things and didnt think Mr As complaint should be upheld. The 
investigator thought the default was a fair and an accurate record of how the credit card had 
been handled.
The investigator felt the £50 NatWest offered was enough to compensate for the poor 
service Mr A had experienced.
Mr A didnt agree with the investigator. Mr A said he understood why NatWest had originally 
applied the default but should have removed it when his bankruptcy was annulled. Mr A also 
said the £50 wasnt enough to compensate for the service or the data breaches.
Mr A asked for an ombudsman to decide things.
My provisional decision
I didnt agree with the investigator. I thought Mr As complaint should be upheld.
I issued a provisional decision and said:
Theres little dispute Mr A was declared bankrupt and NatWest was right to apply a 
default to the credit card. I think this was the right thing to do and in line with the 
Information Commissioners Offices guidance on defaults.
The issue is whether NatWest should have removed the default when it became 
aware of the annulment, and I think it should have.
When a bankruptcy is annulled its like it never happened, Mr A is no longer insolvent 
and never was. The default was only applied because Mr A was insolvent.
Once NatWest was aware the bankruptcy had been annulled, I think it should have 
removed the default  the event that led to the default had, effectively, now never 
happened. Mr A had also paid the credit card off soon after the bankruptcy, there was 
no other reason for NatWest to default the card.
But theres some dispute about when NatWest knew about the annulment. Mr A says 
he told NatWest soon after it had been annulled. Ive seen no evidence of this and 
NatWest has no record of knowing about the annulment prior to mid-2020.
I wouldnt expect NatWest to find out about the annulment unless Mr A told it. 
Although NatWest found the bankruptcy on a public record, annulments arent 
recorded there unless its specifically requested, and I cant see this was done.
I think the earliest NatWest knew about Mr As bankruptcy annulment was mid-2020. 
This means I dont think NatWest made a mistake leaving the default on record from 
August 2015 to mid-2020.
But, NatWest was aware of the annulment in mid-2020 when Mr A complained. 
And NatWest should, I think, have removed the default by the time it responded 
to Mr As complaint, on 22 June 2020.
Defaults remain on a credit file for six years, so Mr As default would have been 
removed in August 2021. This means I think NatWest unfairly kept the default on Mr 
As credit file between June 2020 and August 2021.
Mr A hasnt provided any evidence of losses hes incurred. Im sure some lending may 
have been more expensive for Mr A whilst the default was recorded.
But I dont think I can consider any losses or distress before June 2020  I dont 
think NatWest made a mistake in recording the default until this date.And its very likely that more recent lending was less and less affected by the default. 
Mr A had settled the default soon after it was applied, and it had been on file for almost 
five years by the time I think NatWest should have removed it.
And it seems Mr A was able to get some lending prior to June 2020. If Mr A 
repaid this lending this would also have helped his ability to get credit going 
forward.
I think the default had a limited impact on Mr As credit file after June 2020.
Mr A clearly explained to NatWest why the default should be removed, and he was, I 
think, correct. Mr A contacted NatWest several times to try and get the default 
removed, but NatWest didnt change its mind.
This was bound to be very frustrating for Mr A as well as time consuming. And Mr A 
then had the worry of the default being on file for a further year when it should have 
been removed. Im sure this made Mr A wary of applying for credit and at a time hed 
specifically checked his credit to make sure it was good.
Because of this I think NatWest should pay Mr A £250 to compensate for not 
removing the default when Mr A approached NatWest in mid-2020.
Mr A says NatWest shared his brothers data with him and this is a data breach. If 
NatWest did share someone elses data with Mr A then hes right, its likely to be a 
data breach. But I have to look at the impact this has had on Mr A.
And I dont believe it has had an impact. The person impacted by the data breach is 
Mr As brother, not Mr A. I dont think I can compensate Mr A for an error made by 
NatWest where hes not experienced a loss or been impacted by it.
NatWest previously sent Mr A a cheque for £50 to compensate for some poor 
service around the time he logged his complaint. This seems a fair amount to pay to 
Mr A for that episode of poor service.
Mr A says he didnt cash the cheque and I think its likely to be more than six 
months old now. Mr A might find it difficult to pay in a cheque thats older than six 
months.
In the circumstances I think NatWest should cancel the cheque, if it hasnt already 
been paid, and pay Mr A a total of £300 in compensation.
The responses to my provisional decision
NatWest responded to my provisional decision and said it wasnt aware Mr As bankruptcy 
had been annulled. NatWest didnt agree with my provisional decision.
Mr A didnt respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered what NatWest said about not knowing of Mr As bankruptcy annulment. 
NatWest has sent me some correspondence between internal departments, and I believe it didnt have proof of the annulment.
But Ive also looked at what Mr A said when he complained to NatWest. Mr A explained his 
bankruptcy had been annulled and wanted the default removed. NatWest responded to this 
complaint without asking for any proof of the annulment.
It seems unfair of NatWest to say it didnt know when it should have asked. Mr A made it 
clear his bankruptcy had been annulled. And if NatWest failed to investigate Mr As 
complaint properly, I dont think thats fair to now hold this against him.
As part of the investigation into Mr As complaint I think its reasonable to think NatWest 
should have asked for any proof Mr A had. And Im persuaded Mr A had a copy of the 
annulment in mid-2020. I also think had Mr A been asked to send it he would have.
I think NatWest should have been aware of Mr As bankruptcy annulment by the time it 
issued its final response on 22 June 2020. So it follows my decision hasnt changed.
Putting things right
I think NatWest should pay Mr A a further £250. Mr A was offered £50 at the time the final 
response was issued, I think its fair NatWest pays this amount too, if it hasnt already paid it.
My final decision
My final decision is National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr A a total of £300 to 
compensate him for the distress and inconvenience hes been caused. If NatWest has 
already paid Mr A the £50 offer made in its final response it can subtract this amount from 
the £300.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 April 2022.
