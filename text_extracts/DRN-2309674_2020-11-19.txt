The complaint
Mr A complains about charges and interest applied to his account by National Westminster 
Bank Plc (NatWest) without his knowledge.
What happened
Mr A says he was unaware NatWest had added interest and charges to his account and that 
he thought had a zero balance. He says he moved address and accepts he didnt tell 
NatWest and was unaware he would no longer receive statements via the mail. Mr A would 
like NatWest to refund the interest and says it has refunded the charges. He says NatWest 
ought to have told him about the balance and that he cant recall using the account to take it 
into the overdraft.
NatWest says its not made a mistake and has acted in line with account terms and 
conditions when Mr As account became overdrawn. It says it told all customers some time 
ago it was moving to paperless statements and says it was Mr As responsibility to manage 
his account and did send him text message and e-mails about the account. NatWest says it 
has refunded the charges as a gesture of goodwill of £150 but says Mr A must repay the 
interest of about £108.
Mr A brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought NatWest had acted in line with the account terms and conditions and that it was up 
to Mr A to manage his account and update NatWest with his correct details.
Mr A doesnt accept that view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NatWest has dealt fairly with this 
complaint and hasnt made a mistake. I appreciate that Mr A will be disappointed by my 
decision.
I have looked at the account terms and conditions which I think Mr A would have agreed to 
when the account was opened. Those terms and conditions say that charges and interest 
will be applied when, as in this case, an account becomes overdrawn. I can see that is what 
took place here, that Mr A used his account which resulted in it becoming overdrawn. So, I 
dont think NatWest acted unfairly in those circumstances by charging interest and fees and 
that it acted in line with those agreed account conditions.
I appreciate Mr A says he didnt realise the account had become overdrawn, but Im satisfied 
this was his account and he is responsible for the management of it and ought to have 
known what the account position was. I also appreciate Mr A says he moved address and at 
some point had a new e-mail address. But Im satisfied that NatWest wouldnt have known 
that unless Mr A updated it and again, I find it was Mr As responsibility to do so.
I think it likely having looked at NatWests records that it did try and make contact with Mr A 
but overall, I think it was up to Mr A to manage his account appropriately. Im satisfied that 
NatWest has acted fairly by refunding the charges in circumstances where I dont think it 
either made a mistake or was required to do so. But it follows that I cant fairly order NatWest 
to refund the interest which I find was correctly applied to the account, and I also think it 
likely it told customers it was using paperless statements.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 December 2020.
