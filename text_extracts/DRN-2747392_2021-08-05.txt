One of our adjudicators looked into Mrs Bs complaint. She didnt think it was wrong
for Lending Stream to have granted loans 1 to 11, so she didnt ask Lending Stream to do 
anything in relation to these loans. 
But the adjudicator thought that loans 12 - 16 shouldnt have been lent due to Mrs B having 
problems managing her money, given the number of outstanding short-term loans she had 
at the time.
Lending Stream agreed with the adjudicators view and it made an offer in line with what was 
recommended. 
Mrs Bs representatives didnt agree and it provided copies of Mrs Bs bank statements. It 
said there was clearly a problem early on due to the rapid uptake of lending. 
The adjudicator considered Mrs Bs representatives comments and then explained the 
following;
the checks Lending Stream did for loans 1  3 were proportionate 
for loans 4  9 she agreed Lending Stream ought to have carried out more in-depth 
checks but based on the bank statements provided the adjudicator still thought 
Lending Stream wouldve provided these loans and
there was a significant break in lending between loans 9 and 10.
Mrs Bs representatives wasnt happy with the outcome as it still felt loans 7  9 should be 
upheld. 
As no agreement could be reached the case has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice
at the time these loans were provided.
After the complaint was passed for a final decision, it was discovered Mrs B was subject to 
an IVA and having emailed Mrs Bs representatives the insolvency practitioner (IP) 
confirmed they had an interest in any refund due. So, Ive made reference to this in the 
redress at the end of the decision. 
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Mrs B could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mrs B. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether Mrs B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this isthe case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre
unlikely to be able to do so without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the new arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all means for Mrs Bs complaint.
Loans 1- 6 and 10 - 11
It appears that both parties have accepted the outcome in relation to these loans. So, I no 
longer think there is an outstanding dispute. But, for the avoidance of doubt I agree with the 
adjudicators findings about these loans for broadly the same reasons. 
For loans 10 and 11, there was a break in lending of around 17 months after loan 9 was 
repaid. This, in my view was a large enough gap to have allowed Lending Stream to treat 
loan 10 as the first loan in a new chain. This gap (along with the other information Lending 
Stream gathered) has led me to conclude the checks were proportionate for these two loans. 
Loans 12  16
Lending Stream has already agreed to put things right for Mrs B in line with the adjudicators 
recommendation.  So, I dont think there is any ongoing dispute about these loans. And for 
completeness Ive outlined in the redress section what Lending Stream has already agreed 
to do. 
Loans 7 - 9
It seems to me the only loans that are in dispute are the ones that Mrs Bs representatives 
remained unhappy about (loans 7  9). This decision will focus on what happened when 
these loans were approved.
The adjudicator concluded that for these loans Lending Streams checks didnt go far 
enough. Had Lending Stream carried out what she considered to be a proportionate check it 
still wouldve provided these loans to Mrs B. Ive considered what the adjudicator has said, 
as well as the evidence of Mrs Bs circumstances at the time of these loans being approved. 
Having done so, I agree with the adjudicator for broadly the same reasons and Ive outlined 
my reasons for doing below. 
For each of these three loans, Lending Stream did the same type of check. It asked Mrs B to 
declare her income, which she declared to be £1,800 per month for each loan. With 
outgoings of between £950 - £1,050 a month. Based on what Mrs B declared she had more 
than sufficient disposable income to be able to afford the repayments she was committed to 
making. 
Lending Stream carried out a credit search for these loans, but I dont think it showed 
anything of concern. It was aware of two defaults on Mrs Bs credit file, with the most recent 
one some 6 months before loan 7. But, there wasnt anything else in the credit check (such 
as number of active credit accounts) that wouldve prompted Lending Stream to 
automatically decline Mrs Bs application for credit. 
So, while the checks Lending Stream carried out may have indicated to it that Mrs B could 
afford the repayments she was committed to making, I think it was clear, given the high number of loans Mrs B had been granted by Lending Stream in  a fairly short period of time it 
needed to be doing more. I dont think it was reasonable by this point to continue to rely on 
what Mrs B was telling it about her circumstances. It ought to have been verifying the 
information it was provided and Lending Stream couldve done this a number of ways, such 
as checking her bank statements or asking for other supporting documentation. 
Mrs B has supplied this service with copies of her bank statements, so I dont think it is 
unreasonable to consider them. Loans 7  9 were all taken in August 2015 and Ive reviewed
Mrs Bs bank statements in the month before these loans were approved. 
The income I can see in Mrs B bank statements is broadly in line with what she declared to 
Lending Stream so this means it had a fairly accurate idea of her monthly income. But, 
looking at the bank statements I dont think Lending Stream wouldve thought Mrs B was 
having (or likely having) financial difficulties. I say this because;
Mrs B appears to be maintaining an account balance, 
there appers to be minimial other debts (credit card, store cards, other high cost 
credit)
there doesnt appear to be any evidence of other use of high cost short term credit 
and 
in my view, there werent any other signs of Mrs B having financial diffutlites. 
So, to me, had Lending Stream carried out, what I consider to be a proportionate check it 
wouldve likely believed Mrs B would be in a position to afford the loans it was providing. 
Ive also considered whether Lending Stream ought to have reasonable concluded the 
lending pattern and history in was sufficient to show that Mrs B couldnt sustainably take on 
these loans. 
Mrs Bs early loans were of fairly low value (and therefore the repayments wouldve been 
fairly low compared to her declared income and outgoings). There is also some break where 
Mrs B isnt indebted to Lending Stream, such as between the end of April to the end of May 
2015 and from the end of May to the end of June 2015. Mrs B spent most of this time, not 
indebted to Lending Stream and these gaps I think demonstrate, in this case, she wasnt 
using these loans to fill a short-term financial hole. 
Ive thought carefully about this, but in this occasion, I dont think the pattern itself is enough. 
But, I do think the pattern supports the fact Lending Stream needed to do further checks, 
which Ive outlined above. 
So, having considered everything Im not going to be asking Lending Stream to redress any 
further loans then what it has already agreed to do. But as I said above, Ive set out for 
completeness what it has already agreed to do in relation to loans 12  16. 
Putting things right
In line with what Lending Stream has already agreed to do to put things right, it should;
Refund all interest, fees and charges on loans 12 - 16.
Add 8% simple interest a year from the date of the payments to the date of
settlement*;
Lending Stream should remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs Bs  credit 
file in relation to loans 12 - 16.Mrs Bs IP has told this service that it has an interest in any refund due. So Mrs B and her 
representatives will need to endure the IP is aware of the refund and any conditions in the 
IVA are met.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires you to deduct tax from this interest. Lending Stream 
should give Mrs B a certificate showing how much tax is deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Mrs Bs complaint in part.
Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) should put things right for Mrs B as directed 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 September 2021.
