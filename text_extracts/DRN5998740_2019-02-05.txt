K821x#15complaint
Mrs F complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) didnt set up a direct debit. This resulted in late 
payment charges and a concern about the effect on her credit file. Mrs F would like more  
compensation than NewDay  has paid.
background
Mrs F says she made a balance transfer  to NewDay at the end of July 2017 to take 
advantage of a promotional interest offer. She says at that time she asked NewDay  to 
amend a direct debit  from a minimum payment to a fixed amount. But she says NewDay  
didnt do this .As a result  her original direct  was declined as it was dormant. She says she 
was charged late payment fees. And lost the promotional interest offer.  
She says she called NewDay when she got a notice of default sums letter in September 
2017. Although  NewDay  said it would refund the late payment charges which it did, she says 
it couldnt confirm  if there  would be any affect on her credit file. 
She says when she got her next statement in October 2017  the two late payment charges 
had been refunded but she had been charged  interest. She says she did the balance 
transfer to avoid getting any interest  charges. She says she called NewDay again and was 
offered £20 compensation. But again  the adviser couldnt confirm  if there would  be any 
adverse effect  on her credit file. She says this was only confirmed when  she got a final 
response letter from NewDay  dated  23 October 2017.
She says although  NewDay  has credited her account with £20 as an apology she doesnt 
feel this is sufficient. She says she was concerned  about the possible effect on her credit file 
as at the time she was in the process  of applying for a mortgage.
NewDay agreed it had made a mistake.  It refunded  the charges, reinstated the promotional 
offer and paid Mrs F £20 compensation.
Our investigator upheld  the complaint. She felt NewDay had taken appropriate action to put 
things right but didnt  feel that £20 compensation was sufficient. She recommended  that 
NewDay pay a total of £150 compensation.
Mrs F accepted this but NewDay  didnt.  It said there  was no late payment marker registered  
so there  wasnt any risk of any negative  credit file information. It also said it hadnt known 
Mrs F was in the process  of getting a mortgage. It asked for proof of this. 
Our investigator pointed  out that her view referred  to Mrs Fs mortgage  application.  She 
discussed this with Mrs F who said her phone  calls with NewDay would confirm  she was 
applying for a mortgage at the time of NewDays mistake.
At this stage Mrs F was unwilling and unable  due to a house move  to provide details of 
her mortgage application.  She was subsequently  able to do so. Although  this was passed 
onto NewDay it didnt  change its view so the complaint has come to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN59987402Theres no dispute that NewDay made  a mistake and didnt set up a direct debit for Mrs F in 
July 2017. Had it done so the direct debit  payment  would have been made, no charges 
would have been applied, the promotional offer would have remained and there would have  
been no concerns  about Mrs Fs credit file.
I agree  with our investigators view that NewDay has been reasonable in putting matters 
right. It refunded  the charges, reinstated the promotional  offer and credited Mrs Fs account  
with £20 compensation. 
I do think some level of compensation is appropriate here  NewDay  made  a mistake which 
caused Mrs F some inconvenience  and upset. The main issue  seems to be what the 
appropriate level of compensation  should be.
I accept NewDays point  that no negative information was recorded on Mrs Fs credit file. So 
its mistake wouldnt have  impacted on Mrs Fs mortgage application.   However Mrs F 
contacted NewDay  on 18 September  2017.At that points the adviser she spoke to couldnt 
any possible  impact on Mrs Fs credit  file. After a further phone call Newday   confirmed there 
would be no impact by letter on 23 October 2017.
Mrs F has now given  us evidence to show during this time she was applying for a mortgage. 
I think she would have  understandably  been  concerned there might be an impact  on her 
credit file. Ive seen the statements NewDay  sent Mrs F and these do make a general  
statement that it might be difficult to get credit in the future due to the failure to make  
minimum payments. So I think Mrs F did have some cause to be concerned.  It took NewDay  
nearly a month to confirm that there  was no impact  I think  thats  quite a long time for Mrs F 
to not know what  the situation was.
I dont accept NewDay was unaware of the mortgage application. Mrs F has said she 
discussed this in her phone  calls with NewDay. I decided not to ask for these phone calls as 
I felt I had no reason  not to accept what Mrs F told us particularly since  she has given us 
evidence of her mortgage  application. The fact Mrs F was in the process of applying for a 
mortgage was also clearly detailed in our investigators view. 
NewDay told us in its response to our investigators view that it incorporates factors 
customers raise  when  reviewing compensation. So I find it disappointing that having 
disputed it was aware of Mrs Fs mortgage  application that, when given proof of this, it didnt 
feel able to review and increase its compensation offer.
I dont feel that £20 is sufficient compensation in this case.  I think the additional  £130  
compensation our investigator recommended feels fair to me. I do believe that NewDays 
mistake. And the time it then took to confirm there would be no impact on Mrs Fs credit  file 
caused Mrs F both inconvenience and distress  during her mortgage application process.  
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
In full and final settlement  NewDay Ltd should pay Mrs F £130 compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 March 2019.
