K821x#15complaint
Mr K complains that Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading  as Sunny, lent to him in an
irresponsible manner.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  
17 September 2019, an extract  of which is attached  and forms part of this final decision.  So, 
I wont repeat that information here.  
In my provisional decision,  I set out why I intended to uphold  Mr Ks complaint  in relation to 
loans six to 20 and what Sunny  should  do to put matters right. I invited both parties to let me 
have any further  comments  and evidence. Neither  Sunny nor Mr K has provided  any further 
comments and evidence.  
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that neither  Mr K nor Sunny have provided  me with anything  further  on the complaint, 
I see no reason to depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.  So, for 
the reasons I set out in my provisional  decision,  I dont think  that Sunny should have given 
Mr K loans six to 20.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr Ks complaint in 
part. I now require Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny,  to:
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans six to 20 and write off any
outstanding interest  and charges on loans  17 and 18;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
deduct from the refund above  any capital  sum still due in relation to loans 17 
and 18 and pay Mr K the balance,  if any. If there  remains an outstanding 
balance owed to Sunny  in relation to loans  17 and 18, Sunny should agree an 
affordable repayment plan with Mr K;
the number  of loans  taken from loan six onwards means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about loans six to 16 and 19 to 
20 should be removed  from Mr Ks credit file. Entries about loans 17 and 18 
should be removed  once the capital  owing on those  loans has been repaid.
Ref: DRN65402542 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr K a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 November  2019.

complaint
Mr K complains that Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Between November 2015 and June 2016, Sunny  gave  Mr K 20 instalment  loans. At the outset, the 
loans were repayable over six months. Mr K hasnt repaid all thats owed in relation to loans  17 and 
18. A summary of Mr Ks borrowing with Sunny is shown as an appendix to this decision.
Mr K says that the number of loans  and the pattern of his borrowing indicate that the loans were not 
improving his financial situation and caused him further problems. He says that he had to continue  to 
borrow to make repayments  for other debt.  Mr K wants a refund of interest and charges  on all the 
loans that Sunny  shouldnt have given to him.
One of our adjudicators assessed Mr Ks complaint. He said that Sunny shouldnt have given Mr K 
loans five to 20. The adjudicator said that by loan five, Mr K had shown signs that he was having 
problems managing  his money and by loan six, the overall pattern of 
Mr Ks borrowing suggested hed become  persistently reliant on short-term loans. The adjudicator set 
out what  Sunny  should do to put matters right.
Sunny didnt  agree with the adjudicator.  It said, in summary:
Mr K used  the loans  in the manner  they were intended to be used  for short-term  
borrowing.
He often  repaid  the loans early.
Its customers are given  a notional  credit limit and are able to take up to four loans up to 
that limit, subject to affordability and creditworthiness assessments.
It undertakes appropriate checks before  each  loan.
The loans were affordable  and sustainable.
Mr Ks overall lending pattern is consistent with the way its customers  use its product for 
short-term needs.
As there was no agreement between the parties, Mr Ks complaint was passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general  approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including all of the 
relevant rules, guidance  and good  industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice, this 
means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr K could repay  the loans 
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
Ref: DRN65402544But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
    the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
    the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
    the greater the number and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans  (reflecting  the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr K could sustainably repay his loans   not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow  this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being  without undue  
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting  
other reasonable  commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it 
follows that a lender  should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont 
be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments 
without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint.
I dont think that Sunny  was wrong to give Mr K loans one to four. Given the repayment amounts, 
what was apparent about  Mr Ks circumstances at the time and his history with Sunny at that point,  I 
dont think it wouldve  been proportionate  for Sunny to ask Mr K for the amount of information needed 
to show the lending was unsustainable.  There wasnt anything in the information Mr K provided or the 
information Sunny shouldve been aware  of, which  meant it wouldve been proportionate for Sunny to 
start verifying what Mr K was saying.
Before loan five, I think the lender shouldve  taken steps to build  a more  detailed  picture of
Mr Ks financial situation. Thats because this was Mr Ks fifth loan in less than three months.  And 
hed repaid  two previous  loans on the same day. But I havent seen anything in the information 
provided which suggests  Sunny wouldve  known  that Mr K wouldnt  have been able to sustainably 
make the repayments for loan five.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Mr Ks lending history  with Sunny, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which  Sunny should reasonably  have  seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt  have 
provided any further  loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ks case, I think that this point was reached by loan six. I 
say this because from loan six onwards, Mr Ks overall  pattern of borrowing  suggested that he had 
become persistently reliant on short-term loans. Sunny gave Mr K a new loan within days  or weeks 
of taking out a previous  loan and sometimes  before hed repaid what he already owed. By loan six, 
Mr K had taken out six loans in a four month period.
Ref: DRN65402545Ive noted what Sunny says but I dont agree that Mr K used the loans as they were  intended  to be 
used. Early  repayment isnt necessarily a sign that the loans are sustainable. Mr K repaid loans early 
in some instances  then soon took out another loan.
Mr K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Sunny.  Loan 20 was taken out seven 
months after Mr Ks first loan with Sunny. Whilst the amounts Mr K was borrowing fluctuated,  the 
pattern of lending itself shows  that Mr Ks borrowing was unsustainable. 
Mr K had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period. I dont think that Sunny should have given Mr K loans six to 20.
I think that Mr K lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan six onwards 
because the sheer number of loans was likely  to have had negative  implications on Mr Ks ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these  high-cost loans.
putting things right  what I intend  to direct Sunny to do
refund all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans six to 20 and write off any 
outstanding interest and charges on loans 17 and 18;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
deduct  from the refund  above any capital sum still due in relation to loans 17 and 18 
and pay Mr K the balance, if any. If there remains an outstanding balance owed to 
Sunny in relation to loans  17 and 18, Sunny  should agree  an affordable repayment  
plan with Mr K;
the number of loans  taken from loan six onwards  means any information  recorded  
about them is adverse.  So all entries about loans  six to 16 and 19 to 20 should be 
removed from Mr Ks credit  file. Entries about  loans 17 and 18 should be removed 
once the capital owing  on those loans has been repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires  Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must  give
Mr K a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
I intend to uphold  Mr Ks complaint in part. I intend to direct Elevate Credit International
Limited, trading as Sunny,  to take the steps Ive set out above.
