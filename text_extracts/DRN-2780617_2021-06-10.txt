The complaint
Miss B and Mr W complain that National Westminster Bank Plc misled them about the 
amount it would lend and their purchase fell through as a result. As theyd agreed to sell their 
house they had to move into a hotel and then live with family until they bought a house. They 
ask that NatWest pays their hotel costs and further compensation.
What happened
Miss B and Mr W accepted an offer to sell their property. They made an offer to buy a 
property for about £170,000. They contacted NatWest about a mortgage. They had a deposit 
of about £30,000, and so needed a mortgage of about £140,000. 
However, the property was valued at £140,000. This meant NatWest would only lend about 
£120,000, based on a maximum loan to value of 85%. Miss B and Mr W were short of about 
£20,000 for their purchase. 
NatWest accepts that when Miss B called to check this its call handler wrongly told her it 
would lend 85% of the purchase price. This was wrong as NatWest uses the lower of the 
valuation and the purchase price to calculate the loan to value ratio. It paid £400 for the 
upset caused by the error. Miss B and Mr W say this isnt enough. 
Miss B and Mr W say they wouldnt have signed contracts for the sale of their property if 
theyd known they needed a larger deposit for their purchase.
Our investigator said Miss B and Mr W had signed contracts for the sale of their property 
before NatWest made the error, and before their appointment with NatWests mortgage 
adviser. NatWest wasnt responsible for their decision to commit to the sale of their property 
before having a mortgage offer for their purchase. The investigator said previous quotes sent 
to Miss B and Mr W said a deposit was needed, and NatWest hadnt led them to believe it 
would offer a 100% mortgage. The investigator said the compensation offered by NatWest 
was fair.
Miss B and Mr W didnt agree.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss B and Mr W say theyd been discussing moving house with NatWest for two years. 
They say NatWest told them it would offer a mortgage up to the valuation amount. They say 
they expected to have to fund the difference themselves if the purchase price was higher 
than the valuation. Miss B and Mr W say they werent told theyd need a deposit of at least 
15% of the valuation. 
This became a problem for Miss B and Mr W in late 2020. They signed contracts for the sale 
of their house on 15 September 2020, with a completion date in early October. They made 
an offer to buy a property which was accepted on 15 September. 
Miss B and Mr W offered a purchase price of £170,000. The propertys home value report 
said the value was £140,000. Miss B had been in contact with a staff member at NatWest, 
and she sent her an email on 16 September 2020 saying theyd had an offer accepted. 
Miss Bs email set out the price, valuation, their deposit (£30,000) and that they wanted to 
borrow £139,000. The staff member sent an email the next day saying she thought theyd 
need a larger deposit, and confirming an appointment was booked with a mortgage adviser.
Miss B called NatWest, to check the position with the deposit. NatWest accepts it made an 
error here: its call handler wrongly told Miss B it would lend up to 85% of the purchase price. 
It should have said it would lend 85% of the value, as this was lower. NatWest paid £400 
compensation for the upset this caused. I think this is fair, and Ive explained why below.
NatWest corrected its error promptly. NatWest had already told Miss B they might need a 
larger deposit. And Miss B says NatWest called her later on the same day to say she 
needed a larger deposit. 
This error was made before Miss B and Mr W made a mortgage application. I appreciate 
that Miss B and Mr W had previously gone through affordability checks to see how much 
they could borrow. But there was no guarantee NatWest would offer a mortgage, or offer 
to lend the amount they needed, until it had completed the application process and 
issued a mortgage offer. 
Miss B and Mr W had already signed contracts for the sale of their property before the 
error happened. So its not fair to say that NatWests error led to them agreeing to sell 
their property.
However, Miss B and Mr W say they were misled before September 2020. Miss B said they 
were never told they needed a deposit, only how much they could borrow. 
Miss B and Mr W didnt have an offer accepted to buy a property until mid-September. 
Before this, when they asked how much they could borrow this was most likely an 
affordability assessment based on their income and expenditure. 
NatWest provided copies of agreements in principle (AIPs) sent to Miss B and Mr W. These 
show a range of property values, loan to values and loan amounts. I dont think its fair to say 
these suggest NatWest will lend 100% of the valuation amount. While Miss B says the AIPs 
they received were different, shes been unable to provide a copy. 
NatWest says it doesnt offer 100% mortgages. It provided evidence of its lending policy to 
support this. I think its unlikely Miss B and Mr W were repeatedly told theyd be able to 
borrow 85% of the purchase price, regardless of the valuation. Or told theyd be able to 
borrow 100% of the valuation amount. 
Miss B and Mr W couldnt make a mortgage application until they had an offer accepted on a 
property. It took some time for Miss B and Mr W to find a property, and their sale had already 
progressed by the time they had an offer accepted. I can understand they didnt want to lose 
their sale. Equally though NatWest isnt responsible for their decision to go ahead with the 
sale before having a mortgage offer in place for their purchase.NatWest provided emails between its staff member and Miss B in mid-2020 discussing 
deposits. At that time, like many lenders, NatWest was requiring larger deposits due to 
uncertainties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. I think Miss B and Mr W were aware of the 
need for a deposit, although they might not have known the amount of the deposit theyd 
need. 
NatWest calculates the amount it will lend based on the lower of the purchase price and the 
valuation. Theres nothing unusual or unfair about that. Im sorry that Miss B and Mr W didnt 
know this, but I havent seen evidence that NatWest gave them incorrect information before 
the phone call in mid-September 2020. 
There was a significant difference here between the valuation amount and the purchase 
price, and this meant Miss B and Mr W needed to find £20,000 more than they expected 
towards their purchase. I appreciate how upsetting this must have been, especially when it 
had taken some time to find a property to buy. Miss B says they arent experienced property 
buyers and were relying on NatWest. Miss B and Mr W might well have planned differently if 
theyd known theyd need a larger deposit. But I havent seen evidence that NatWest misled 
them about this prior to the call in mid-September 2020.
It follows that I dont think its fair and reasonable in the circumstances to require NatWest to 
pay for Miss B and Mr Ws hotel costs or further compensation.  
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint as I find the compensation paid by National 
Westminster Bank Plc fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B and Mr M 
to accept or reject my decision before 8 July 2021.
