K820x#14complaint
Miss B complains  that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA lent irresponsibly when it approved a 
credit card for her with a £3,000 limit. 
background
Miss B says she was invited to apply online for a credit card while  using her PayPal account  
to buy something.  The application asked Miss B to provide basic  information about her 
income and expenditure and PayPal completed  a credit search. Miss B completed the 
application online and was approved for a credit  card with a limit of £3,000.
Miss B says that at the time of her application she had lots of credit and had borrowed to the 
maximum limits allowed. 
Over the following months Miss B used the card for purchases and the balance increased. 
Miss B complained about PayPals  decision to approve her credit card and it responded on 
5 September 2018. PayPal said itd completed reasonable checks before agreeing  to lend 
and provided full details of the credit agreement  to Miss B before she decided  to proceed.  
PayPal agreed to refund one months interest and waive the following four months  interest 
as a gesture of goodwill.  
As PayPal  didnt agree itd lent irresponsibly Miss B referred her complaint to this service. 
During the process of the investigation Miss B contacted PayPal and explained she was 
having trouble  maintaining her payments. PayPal provided details of organisations that may 
be able to help and invited Miss B to get in touch about the problems she faced. PayPal also 
told Miss B she may be able to apply for a payment holiday. 
In December 2018 PayPal wrote to Miss B and offered to increase  her credit limit to £4,000. 
An adjudicator looked at what  had happened  but didnt feel PayPal had lent irresponsibly. As 
Miss B didnt agree her complaints been  passed  to me to make a decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss Bs complaint relates to several issues so Ill look at each in turn. As PayPals decision 
to approve the credit  card limit of £3,000  is the focus  of Miss Bs complaint Ill start there. 
Theres no set list of checks  a lender must  complete before agreeing to provide credit. As a 
service we look at whether a business  has completed proportionate checks to ensure the 
proposed credit is affordable and sustainable. 
In this case, the PayPal application asked Miss B for information about her income and 
overall outgoings, residential  status  and address. PayPal went  on to complete a credit 
search to look at how Miss B handled  the other credit she had. From what Ive seen, I think  
these checks were  proportionate for the type of borrowing here. I appreciate  the information 
PayPal asks for is broad in its nature and income  and expenditure figures arent specific.  But 
Ref: DRN66860352Im satisfied PayPal asked reasonable questions during the application  process to see 
whether the borrowing was sustainable. 
Miss B says that she didnt declare an income of £1,501 to £2,000 and that she wouldve 
declared a dependent.  But, like the adjudicator, Im satisfied that the application was 
completed online without  the involvement of anyone at PayPal. I dont know whether Miss B 
made a mistake when  selecting what information  to input  but Ive not found  anything to 
indicate PayPal  hasnt provided  the information  it was given when  Miss B applied.  
Miss B says PayPal should ask more detailed  questions about income and expenditure but 
this service isnt able to tell a business  how to assess  a credit card application. The 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  doesnt set the rules. Thats the role of the regulator, the 
Financial Conduct  Authority. In this case,  Im satisfied the information PayPal requested was 
proportionate to the borrowing Miss B applied  for. 
PayPal completed a credit search  when Miss B applied. I note what  Miss B says about the 
level of credit she already  had available but Ive not found that all her other accounts were  at 
the maximum that could  be borrowed when she applied. For instance, Miss B had a store 
card that hadnt been used up to the credit limit. Theres  no adverse information  on Miss Bs 
credit file and no missed payments. I note what Miss B says about  the nature of her work 
and her credit file but that doesnt  mean  I think PayPal acted unreasonably by taking that 
information into account during the application.  
Taking everything Ive seen into account, Ive not been persuaded that PayPal lent 
irresponsibly when it approved Miss Bs credit card in December  2017.  
I appreciate Miss Bs experiencing financial difficulties  and finding  it hard to maintain her 
payments. PayPal invited  Miss B to discuss options with it and also provided details of other 
places to get help. Again, I understand the nature of Miss Bs work means shes concerned 
about the effect of any negative information  on her credit file. But from what Ive seen PayPal 
has treated Miss B positively and sympathetically  when shes made contact to discuss  her 
circumstances. Lenders  can consider a range of options for customers in financial difficulty 
but that doesnt mean theyre obliged to refund or waive interest.  From what  Ive seen Im 
satisfied PayPal is willing to work  with Miss B to provide support. 
PayPal offered an increase to the credit limit in December 2018 and I can understand why 
this upset Miss B. I agree that the offer was poorly  timed given the nature of Miss Bs 
complaint and what shed recently told PayPal. But Miss Bs account was up to date and the 
process of offering credit limit increases is largely automated. Miss B has the option of opting 
out of this process if she wishes and she didnt have to proceed with the offered increase. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Miss B but whilst  I agree the offer of an increase was poorly  timed, I 
dont think this is sufficient  to uphold her complaint. 
Ive carefully considered  everything provided by both Miss B and PayPal while reaching my 
decision. Having  done so, I havent found  PayPal  lent irresponsibly or failed to complete 
proportionate and reasonable checks. Im satisfied its acted positively and sympathetically 
when Miss Bs made  contact to discuss her circumstances.  As a result, Im not telling PayPal 
to take any further  action  to resolve  this complaint.  
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  Under the rules of the 
Ref: DRN66860353Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept  or reject my decision 
before 7 March  2019.
