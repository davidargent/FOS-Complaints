The complaint
Mr N complains about National Westminster Bank Plc handled his buy to let (BTL) 
mortgage application. Mr N said NatWests reasons for rejecting his application didnt fit with 
its advertised criteria, and while it was making a decision, interest rates went up. 
What happened
Mr N said he had applied through a broker to remortgage a BTL property with NatWest,
because it was one of a small number of lenders with no minimum income requirement. But
he said NatWest then rejected his application because he didnt have six months of
continuous employment. Mr N said NatWest had breached the FCA principles of paying due
regard to the interests of its customers and treating them fairly, and the principle of
communicating information in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading.
Mr N said his broker obtained an agreement in principle to lend to him, and NatWest then
carried out a free valuation of his property. His broker appealed what Mr N considered to be
a low valuation, but was then told Mr N had failed the lending criteria on length of
employment. He hadnt been in continuous employment for the last six months.
Mr N said he didnt understand why NatWest would book a valuation if he didnt meet the
lending criteria, and he said it had just wasted his time, when he could have been applying
for a deal elsewhere. Mr N said NatWest was cherry-picking its customers using its lending
criteria, which was discrimination. He said its lending criteria, which didnt require a minimum
income but did require six months of continuous employment, were contradictory.
Mr N said he now faced a loss of £7,500 over the next five years of his mortgage, because
interest rates increased while NatWest was making up its mind. He wanted NatWest either
to provide the remortgage he wanted at the booked rate and pay the cost, or pay damages.
NatWest said that when Mr N complained to it, hed said his broker told him the application
was declined on the basis of his credit score. But NatWest said that wasnt why he was
turned down.
NatWest said before it lends, it does check a customers overall financial position, and it
wont lend unless its criteria are met. But here, NatWest said it had rejected Mr Ns
application because he didnt have six months of continuous employment, which forms part
of its current lending policy. He wasnt turned down because of his credit score.
NatWest said Mr Ns broker would have been aware of its current lending guidelines and
policy criteria. Brokers have access to a website for intermediaries where all of NatWests
current lending policies are explained.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said NatWest had explained
the relevant lending criteria to Mr N, and told him his broker would have been aware of
these. He said NatWest is entitled to decide its own lending criteria to determine whether it is
willing to lend or not when considering an application. This is a matter of its commercial
judgement and we would not usually seek to interfere with a banks lending decision unless
somethings gone wrong in assessing the application. Our investigator thought NatWest had
applied its criteria fairly, and he didnt think this was discriminatory.
Our investigator didnt think the lending criteria did contradict the advertising. He understood
Mr Ns point, but he thought NatWests criteria meant something else  that someone did
have to be employed, but there was no minimum income if they were. He also understood
Mr Ns concern that NatWest would carry out a valuation before rejecting his application, but
he said the problems with Mr Ns application could have been picked up by his broker before
it was even submitted to NatWest. He suggested Mr N could raise this with his broker.
Mr N didnt agree. He thought our investigator had missed the point. He said hed asked his
broker to find him lenders who would accept a gap in employment, and NatWest was one of
the ones shed suggested. Mr N applied to NatWest on the basis that it didnt have a
minimum income requirement. It was only some weeks later that NatWest said no. Mr N
repeated that the lenders promotion materials werent clear, transparent and ethical. He said
the criteria NatWest rejected him on wasnt part of its eligibility requirements. And he said
that was unfair. He also said no one could reasonably be expected to be employed for six
months, without any earnings. Mr N still thought that NatWest was cherry picking who it
would lend to, as per its whims and fancies. Mr N wanted us to reconsider.
Our investigator didnt change his mind. He said theoretically you could have nil income but
be employed. Mr Ns application was rejected based on his employment status not his
income level. But he also said that this mortgage, like any advertised product, is subject to
application. Mr N didnt meet NatWests lending criteria, and thats not something we could
change for him.
Our investigator explained that NatWest would only consider Mr Ns employment history
once his application went to its underwriter, after the survey was done. And it had confirmed
that Mr Ns broker would have had access to this criterion.
Mr N still thought it was a double standard for NatWest to advertise no minimum income
then reject the application on its own set of eligibility criteria. And he felt this was misleading
for customers. Mr N said hed discussed this with his broker, and she said she did have
access to NatWests lending policy, but she had relied on what NatWest said, about there
being no minimum income requirement. Mr N wanted his complaint to be considered by an
ombudsman, so it was passed to me for a final decision.
I then reached my provisional decision on this case.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did not propose to 
uphold it. This is what I said then: 
NatWest has been clear about the basis on which it rejected Mr Ns application, and has 
also been clear from the outset that this criterion, six months of continuous employment, 
was available to his broker before his application was submitted.
Mr Ns argument is that he was misled by the criterion that said he needed no minimum 
income. He said that just didnt fit with a requirement for six months of continuous 
employment. Our investigator speculated that it was possible to have six months of 
continuous employment, and no income, although Mr N said that wasnt possible.
I dont think its helpful to speculate on how these two criteria might interact. Our service 
doesnt have absolutely all the details of NatWests mortgage application criteria, so I cant say if NatWest will always insist if someones employed or not. What I can say, is 
that the two criteria NatWest has told it applied here, dont seem to me to directly 
conflict.
There is no minimum income requirement for a BTL mortgage from NatWest. But all that 
means, is NatWest doesnt have a cut-off point for lending based on income, for 
mortgages like this one. Its not requiring its applicants to earn a certain amount before 
they can apply. And Ive not seen anything to suggest that NatWest did apply any 
income criterion to Mr N.
But Mr N has assumed, because NatWest doesnt have a minimum income 
requirement, that means he doesnt have to be able to show a continuous employment 
history. And these just arent the same thing. NatWest has been clear that if an applicant 
is employed, they need to show that their employment has been stable over the last six 
months.
I dont know exactly why NatWest applies that criterion, and what it understands to be 
the benefit of making sure that its employed applicants do have continuous employment 
for the last six months. But I dont think its unfair or unreasonable for NatWest to say 
this, and I do not agree with Mr N that it conflicts with not having a minimum income 
requirement. As Ive said, they just arent the same thing.
Mr N is concerned that NatWest is cherry picking who it will lend to. But NatWest 
doesnt have to give a mortgage to anyone and everyone who applies, even if they can 
show they meet the advertised criteria. As our investigator said, its always likely that 
any application will be subject to a number of further checks by a lender, to make sure 
that theyre lending responsibly. And that in itself is not unfair.
I know Mr N has been inconvenienced by NatWest not saying that his recent 
employment history would rule him out for lending, until a couple of weeks after hed put 
in his application. And he told us interest rates went up during this time. He says this 
happened because NatWests lending criteria werent clear. But NatWest has also said 
that its lending criteria are all available to Mr Ns broker. So it does seem that if she had 
been at all unsure about how the requirement for six months of continuous employment 
would fit with no minimum income requirement, then she could have asked NatWest 
about this at the outset. So I dont think its just NatWests fault that this wasnt picked up 
until later.
I know Mr N will be disappointed, but I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Only Mr N replied.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr N said he didnt agree, and he wanted to highlight issues he didnt think Id taken into 
account. Mr N said NatWest had delayed in processing his application, and he said it was 
damaging the credit files of its customers. He said that if the eligibility criteria had been clear 
and transparent then he would have applied elsewhere at the start. He said that because 
NatWest hadnt been clear and transparent (which he said was a breach of FCA principles) 
he was now facing damage of almost £7,500. And Mr N said that NatWest had blamed its 
agent, the broker, but he said FCA guidance made the principal responsible for its failures if it outsourced tasks to an agent. 
Mr N repeated that NatWest had breached the FCA principles of paying due regard to the 
interests of its customers and treating them fairly, and the principle of communicating 
information in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading.
Mr N quoted extensively from my provisional decision, and he said he wouldnt agree, 
because the criterion of no minimum income should have been clear and transparent. He 
said he had provided tax returns showing his employment history, and additional rental 
income which he felt should have sorted the issue. But he said NatWest had an undisclosed 
policy of a minimum six months employment, and he felt this should have been clear and 
transparent. Mr N said because of this, he had his credit file spoiled as well as all the other 
issues he had highlighted earlier.
Mr N said this was what he wanted us to look into.
I know Mr N thinks NatWests criteria were misleading, because it advertised a no minimum 
income criterion, then rejected his application. But I dont agree. Ill explain why not.
Mr N sent us NatWests brochure for BTL mortgages, and I can see this doesnt set out the 
employment criterion that NatWest then gave as a reason for rejecting his application. But 
NatWest isnt under a duty to provide Mr N with every detail of its lending criteria, in its 
brochure, and in advance of his application. Some criteria wont be important to many 
applicants, and I dont think its unfair or unreasonable here for NatWest not to have included 
those in its advertising materials, so applicants can consider them in advance. And I dont 
think that the exclusion of some lending criteria which are less likely to be relevant to all 
applicants, automatically means that NatWests communications arent clear, fair and not 
misleading. 
As I set out in my provisional decision above, its also relevant that NatWest has told us it 
does make all these criteria available to brokers. So it says Mr Ns broker could have been 
aware of its criteria before making an application for him. 
Mr N says the broker is just performing tasks outsourced to it by NatWest. But I dont agree. 
The broker is responsible themselves for the advice they give. So if that advice wasnt 
suitable for Mr N, then NatWest isnt responsible for that.
Mr N also said NatWest delayed in processing his application. He said that after the initial 
assessment, his application was rejected by NatWest and referred. It was then accepted, a 
mortgage in principle was issued, and he was advised to complete the application. Later, 
credit checks were done and a surveyor was instructed. Mr N said this process took around 
two to three weeks.
NatWests first record of contact from Mr N seems to have been on 5 May, but it doesnt look 
like Mr N requested his lending at this stage. I can see NatWest received some details of Mr 
Ns intended borrowing on 12 May. This initially appears to have been declined, so it seems 
likely that this is the first referral to underwriters that Mr N told us about, prior to his formal 
application. 
Mr N told us he then made a full application. That would involve more detail, and require 
evidence. At this point, on 19 May, NatWest appears to have noted that Mr N had less than 
six months of previous employment in his current role. So, in line with its lending policy, it 
wanted to know when he finished his last job, and when he started this one. NatWest received some further documentation on 20 May, but that information didnt say 
when Mr N started his new job. So NatWest again requested further information. By 24 May, 
that additional information was received, NatWest realised Mr N had quite a long break 
between his last job and this one, and the lending was declined. Thats a little less than two 
weeks from when Mr N first gave NatWest information about the lending he wanted.
I think that Mr Ns application received prompt attention by NatWest. I dont think that 
NatWest delayed in processing Mr Ns application. 
Mr N said NatWest had spoiled his credit file. NatWest may have carried out a credit search 
as part of Mr Ns application, which would then be recorded on his credit file. But I dont have 
any information on this, because this doesnt appear to have been part of Mr Ns original 
complaint to us. I havent been able to see that he raised this with NatWest either. So Im not 
able to add this point in to his complaint now, Mr N would need to give NatWest a chance to 
deal with his concerns about this first, before our service could look into this for him. 
For the reasons set out above, I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the decision I 
originally proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2023.
