The complaint
 Mr P complains that CarCashPoint Limited lent to him in an irresponsible manner.
What happened
 Mr P was given four loans by CarCashPoint as shown in the table below. Each of the loans 
was secured on a vehicle that Mr P owned. It appears that, from time to time, Mr P faced 
problems meeting his repayments on all of the loans. The first two loans were repaid by an 
insurance claim when Mr Ps car, on which the loans were secured, was stolen. And the 
remaining loans have also been repaid. A summary of Mr Ps borrowing from CarCashPoint 
is as follows;

Mr Ps complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. From the information 
CarCashPoint had sent to us she wasnt able to conclude that the checks that had been 
done before the loans were agreed had been sufficient. And she thought that proportionate 
checks would have shown that Mr P couldnt afford to repay any of the loans in a sustainable 
manner. So she asked CarCashPoint to pay Mr P some compensation.
Disappointingly CarCashPoint didnt respond to that assessment. So, as the complaint 
hasnt been resolved informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide. This is 
the last stage of our process. If Mr P accepts my decision it is legally binding on both parties
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Weve set out our approach to unaffordable/irresponsible lending complaints on our website 
and Ive kept this in mind while deciding Mr Ps complaint.
The first three loans were regulated by the Office of Fair Trading, with the final loan being 
regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. But the rules and regulations in force at the 
time CarCashPoint gave each of the loans to Mr P were similar and required CarCashPoint 
to carry out a reasonable and proportionate assessment of whether he could afford to repay 
what he owed in a sustainable manner. This assessment is sometimes referred to as an 
affordability assessment or affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower focused  so CarCashPoint had to think about whether 
repaying the credit sustainably would cause difficulties or adverse consequences for Mr P. In 
practice this meant that CarCashPoint had to ensure that making the repayments wouldnt 
cause Mr P undue difficulty or adverse consequences. In other words, it wasnt enough for 
CarCashPoint to simply think about the likelihood of it getting its money back, it had to 
consider the impact of any repayments on Mr P. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application. 
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount / type / cost of credit they are seeking. 
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any repayments to credit from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet higher repayments from a particular level of income); 
the longer the period of time a borrower will be indebted for (reflecting the fact 
that the total cost of the credit is likely to be greater and the customer is required 
to make repayments for an extended period). 
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed a proportionate check 
shouldve been for a given application  including (but not limited to) any indications of 
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances. Ive kept all of 
this in mind when thinking about whether CarCashPoint did what it needed to before 
agreeing to lend to Mr P.
The information that CarCashPoint has sent us about the checks it performed was limited to 
just the final loan. But, in response to a subject access request from Mr P, CarCashPoint 
also sent him some information about its checks that he has shared with us. From that 
I have been able to determine the checks I think were done before each of the loans were 
agreed.
Before agreeing each loan (although I accept the same information was most likely used 
before loans 1 and 2 given they were only nine days apart) CarCashPoint asked Mr P for 
details of his income, and his normal expenditure. And it appears to have verified some of 
what Mr P said about his finances by looking at copies of his payslips and extracts from his 
bank statements.
Mr P was entering into significant commitments with CarCashPoint. He would need to make 
weekly repayments for periods of up to three years. So I would expect that CarCashPoint 
would want to gather, and independently check, some detailed information about Mr Ps 
financial circumstances before it agreed to lend to him. I dont think that the checks it did 
were enough. I think it would have been proportionate for CarCashPoint to independently 
check the true state of Mr Ps finances before agreeing the loan. In saying that I have considered that CarCashPoint asked Mr P for copies of his bank 
statements. I dont know what CarCashPoint specifically asked Mr P to provide. But from the 
information he appears to have submitted I dont think those statements cover a sufficient 
time period to allow CarCashPoint to derive any great understanding of the true state of 
Mr Ps finances. At most it seems to me they could have been used to verify his income.
But although I dont think the checks CarCashPoint did before agreeing the loans were 
sufficient, that in itself doesnt mean that Mr Ps complaint should succeed. Id also need to 
be persuaded that what I consider to be proportionate checks would have shown 
CarCashPoint that Mr P couldnt sustainably afford the repayments. So Ive looked at fuller 
copies of Mr Ps bank statements, and what hes told us about his financial situation, to see 
what better checks would have shown CarCashPoint.
At this stage I want to be clear that I am not suggesting that this is the exact check that 
CarCashPoint should have carried out. I do think CarCashPoint needed evidence to 
corroborate what Mr P said was happening with his finances. And looking at his bank 
statements is one way of achieving that although there are of course many other ways that 
level of detail could be established. But I think that by looking at Mr Ps bank statements 
I can get a good idea of what better checks might have shown.
It is clear from Mr Ps bank statements that he was struggling with an addiction to online 
gambling. He was making significant and regular payments to a range of online gambling 
sites. As an example, in the month before he took his first loan, he spent well over half his 
normal income on transactions of this nature. I have noted that CarCashPoint did 
acknowledge in its final response that it had found Mr P was paying for a small amount of 
online gaming out of [his] disposable income. And I accept that is how it might have 
appeared from the limited transaction information Mr P had provided. But had CarCashPoint 
probed deeper, as I think it should have, it would have seen the true extent of Mr Ps 
gambling spending.
Mr Ps gambling spending didnt change to any great extent over the rest of the time that he 
was borrowing from CarCashPoint. So I think better checks before the remaining loans 
would have reached the same conclusions as I think should have been reached before 
loan 1 was agreed. Given Mr Ps patterns of spending I dont think it would be reasonable to 
conclude that he would be likely to be able to repay any borrowing in a sustainable manner. 
So I dont think CarCashPoint should have agreed to give Mr P any of the loans. 
CarCashPoint needs to pay Mr P some compensation.
Putting things right
 I dont think CarCashPoint should have agreed to give any of the loans to Mr P. So 
CarCashPoint should;
refund all the interest and charges Mr P paid on the loans
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ps credit file in relation to the loans
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to take off tax from this interest. 
CarCashPoint must give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ps complaint and direct CarCashPoint Limited to put 
things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 January 2021.
