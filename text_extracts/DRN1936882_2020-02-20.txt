Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Hs complaint about  loans 6 onwards and thought  these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss H could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN19368822the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss H could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Hs complaint.
Our adjudicator felt that loans  1  5 shouldnt be upheld, and Miss H appears to have agreed  
with these findings. So as these loans  are no longer in dispute, I havent considered these 
further in my decision. However, I have thought about these loans  when looking at Miss Hs 
overall lending  history with Sunny. 
Having looked  at this overall  pattern of lending Ive thought  about  whether there was a point 
at which  Sunny should reasonably have  seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further loans.  
As the adjudicator explained  and given the particular circumstances of Miss Hs case, I think 
that this point was reached by loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss H was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss H had taken out five loans within  seven months and Miss H 
had been indebted  to Sunny for the entire time. At this point Sunny ought to have 
realised that Miss H was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in her 
income, but to meet an ongoing  need.
 
When Miss H took out loans  2 and 3, she still had her earlier loans  outstanding.  And 
even though she repaid all her outstanding  loans  in April 2016, she took out loan 4 in 
April and on the same day she paid off loans 2 and 3. Loan  5 was also taken out 
before loan 4 was repaid, and the amounts borrowed  over this period was not 
significantly reducing over time.  So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more  likely 
Ref: DRN19368823than not Miss H was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying her previous 
loans was leaving in her finances  and that Miss Hs indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
From  loan 6 onwards  Miss H was provided  with a new loan before settling a previous 
one. 
Miss H wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Miss H 
wasnt able to repay loans 8, 9, 11 and 12 in-line  with her loan agreement. And so 
these loans were sold on to a third party.  Loan 12 was taken out 26 months after 
Miss Hs first and, as said above,  the amounts borrowed  was not significantly 
reducing over time, so Miss H had paid large  amounts  of interest to, in effect, service 
a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
Sunny says that it offered  the consumer the flexibility to take out more than one loan at a 
time, and that doing so didnt mean the consumer  wasnt able to manage  their money. 
Sunny also says that is considered whether the loans were affordable before each 
application was approved  and it didnt find anything to suggest the loans were unaffordable 
or would be unsustainable.
I agree  that taking  out more than one loan at a time is not enough to say that a person is in 
financial difficulty and not able to manage  their money, however, for the reasons outlined 
above, I think there was evidence in this case to suggest Miss H was having  problems.  Even 
though Sunny may have  completed its own affordability checks I think  by loan 6 a pattern of 
repeat lending had developed, and a responsible lender ought not to have lent Miss H any 
further loans from this point.   
I think that Miss H lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Hs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss H borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 onwards and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts, it should buy these back if its able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If Sunny is not able to buy the debts back, then it should liaise 
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A.Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Miss H towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  
anything Sunny has already refunded.
Ref: DRN19368824B.Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payments made by Miss H 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss H originally made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C.Sunny  should  remove all interest,  fees and charges  from the balance  on loans 8,9, 11 
and 12, and treat any repayments made by Miss H as though they had been  repayments 
of the principal on these  loans.  If this results in Miss H having made overpayments then 
Sunny should  refund  these overpayments  with 8% simple interest* calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the 
complaint is settled. Sunny should  then refund  the amounts calculated in A and B and 
move to step E.
D.If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Miss H. However, if there is still an outstanding 
balance then Sunny  should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss H. 
Sunny shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal it has already written-
off. 
E.The overall pattern  of Miss Hs borrowing for loans 6 onwards means any information  
recorded about them is adverse, so you should  remove these loans entirely  from 
Miss Hs credit file. You do not have to remove loans 8, 9, 11 and 12 from Miss Hs credit 
file until these have  been repaid, but you should  still remove any adverse information 
recorded about these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Hs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 March 2020.
