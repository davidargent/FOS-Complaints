K821x#15complaint
Ms M says PDL Finance Limited, trading as Mr Lender (Mr Lender), irresponsibly lent to 
her. She says Mr Lender didnt carry out reasonable checks to make sure she could repay 
her loans in a sustainable manner and whether she was reliant  upon short-term  loans. 
background
This complaint is about five payday loans and five short-term loans Mr Lender provided  to 
Ms M between September 2013  and April 2017. Ms Ms borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date  Repaid Instalments Amount
1 25/09/2013 25/09/2013 1 £200.00
2 01/10/2013 25/10/2013 1 £250.00
3 30/10/2013 25/02/2014 1 £250.00
4 27/02/2014 25/06/2014 1 £200.00
5 26/06/2014 25/09/2014 1 £300.00
6 26/09/2014 25/03/2015 6 £360.00
7 01/04/2015 25/09/2015 6 £650.00
8 08/10/2015 25/11/2015 3 £400.00
9 25/11/2015 24/04/2017 6 £650.00
10 28/04/2017 24/11/2017 6 £290.00
Our adjudicator partially upheld Ms Ms complaint. He thought the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. He thought any interest and charges for loans four to 
ten should be repaid to Ms M. 
In response, Mr Lender disagreed. It said the adjudicator was incorrect about the repayment 
details of loans  one to three and referred  to the usefulness of its rollover  flexibility. 
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN87654282But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  
to meet a higher  repayment from a particular level of income);  
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of 
time during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that 
repeated refinancing  may signal that the borrowing  had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Ms M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ms M didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion that loans one to three shouldnt be 
upheld. Because  of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision  about this lending.  But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Ms M had with Mr Lender. So, it is something I will take into account  when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ms complaint.  Ive decided to uphold Ms Ms 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
As our adjudicator explained, Ms M had struggled  to repay loan three  on time. It was a 
payday loan that was due for repayment  on 25 November  2013. But it wasnt paid until 
25 February 2014  three months late. 
Mr Lender has said such a rollover provides consumers with useful flexibility  in repaying  a 
loan and is not a sign of financial difficulty.  But I dont necessarily think this is right  it could 
equally be a sign that Ms M was struggling  to manage her money. 
Ref: DRN87654283And I think this is emphasised by Ms Ms pattern of borrowing up to the point of her loan four 
application. While Ms M may have repaid her three  previous payday loans on time, the next 
respective loan in the chain was taken  out in a very short  space of time after that  loan one 
was repaid on 25 September 2013 and loan two was taken out on 1 October. Loan two was 
then repaid on 25 October followed very shortly  by loan three  being taken out on 
30 October. I dont  think this behaviour   followed by the delay in repayment of loan three  
is consistent with someone successfully managing their finances.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders  lending history with Ms M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender  should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Mr Lender should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ms case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan five. I say this because:
From loan five onwards Ms M was provided with a new loan within  days  of 
settling a previous one. So, Mr Lender ought  to have realised it was more  likely 
than not Ms M was having  to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying her 
previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Ms Ms indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Ms M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Mr Lender. At 
points during the lending relationship  she borrow up to £650  up from the first 
loan of £200. Ms M had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a 
debt to Mr Lender over an extended period   over three  and a half years.
I think that Ms M lost out because Mr Lender continued to provide borrowing from loan five 
onwards because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Ms Ms indebtedness  by 
allowing her to take expensive credit  intended  for short-term use over an 
extended period of time.
the length of time over which Ms M borrowed was likely to have had negative  
implications on Ms Ms ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans.
So, like the adjudicator Im also upholding the complaint about loans four to ten and 
Mr Lender should  put things  right.
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
refund all interest  and charges Ms M paid on loans four to ten;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative  information about  loan four from Ms Ms credit  file;
Ref: DRN87654284the number of loans  taken from loan five onwards means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So, all entries about five onwards should  be 
removed from Ms Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender  
must give Ms M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Ms complaint. PDL Finance  Limited  
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 March 2020.
