The complaint
Mr P complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) would not consider a consolidation 
loan for him.
What happened
Mr P borrowed £2,800 from Barclays on a personal loan in February 2019. There were to be 
24 payments of £133.76. Mr P made three payments to the loan in February 2019, March 
2019, and April 2019. The payment for May 2019 was reversed, and so wasnt made. No 
further payments were made. In June 2019, Mr P contacted Barclays to say he had lost his 
job and he had applied for income support. A 30-day hold was put on his loan, with zero 
interest. In July 2019, a further 30-day hold was applied and the account was transferred to 
Barclays collections department. On 30 October 2019, Barclays issued a default notice with 
the arrears at £802.56  to be paid within 30 days. No payments were made. On 27 
November 2019, the loan was defaulted and its management was passed to a debt 
collection agency (DCA). The balance was then £2,623.49. Mr P also had a current account 
with Barclays and it was terminated in November 2020 with the balance £614.50.
Mr P complained. He said he had written to Barclays in October 2019 and at other times - to 
ask for a consolidation loan, but theyd ignored his letters. If theyd been dealt with and a 
consolidation loan agreed, the default and the involvement of a DCA wouldnt have 
happened. 
Barclays, in their final responses said they had no record of any letters sent to them in 
October 2019. They agreed Mr P had written to them in January 2020, but by that time the 
loan had been placed with a DCA  prior to that letter. And after that had happened, they 
couldnt consider the consolidation of Mr Ps debts. 
Mr P brought his complaint to us. Our investigator felt that Barclays acted reasonably. She 
said Barclays had applied their processes fairly and reasonably in not offering Mr P a 
consolidation loan. She said there was also a Barclaycard debt. But this was not considered 
as part of the complaint we looked at  as there wasnt any record of that debt being part of 
Mr Ps complaint.
Mr P didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P says he wrote to Barclays to ask for a consolidation loan and if that had been agreed, 
the loan and (later) current account defaults wouldnt have happened. I see that Mr P hasnt 
provided any dates or copies of any letters written to Barclays  other than stating that he did 
write in October 2019 and at other times.
It's important here to consider what Barclays processes were for consolidation loans. They 
told us  and showed evidence - that such loans (called Resolve loans) can only be 
considered and agreed by their collections team  who were managing debts of customers 
in difficulty.  And furthermore, once a debt had been defaulted and passed to a DCA to 
manage, such a loan cannot be provided. Thats Barclays process, and we cant challenge 
that  as thats not our role.
I can see Mr Ps loan went into Barclays collections department on 22 July 2019. And the 
default took place on 27 November 2019. So  for a consolidation loan to be considered by 
Barclays, it wouldve had to have been so between those two dates, because that was their 
process.
Mr P says he wrote to Barclays in October 2019. Barclays have no record of such a letter. I 
have looked at Barclays customer notes (which record all contacts with customers) and 
theres no reference to a letter. I can see there were calls to or from Mr P on 2 July 2019; 15 
July 2019; 16 July 2019; 22 July 2019; and 15 August 2019. If a letter had been received, we 
would normally expect to see that in the notes which would also record its contents. But 
none of the notes mention a letter from Mr P.
Ive gone on to consider that if such a request had been made  would Barclays have 
agreed a consolidation loan. In the call on 2 July 2019, I can see Mr P didnt want to 
complete an income & expenditure schedule. And so  its unlikely that Barclays had 
sufficient information about his circumstances (income, expenses, debts, etc). And they 
wouldve needed that to see if they could agree to the loan. Thats normal practice and a 
reasonable thing to do. I cant see that Mr P provided these details at that time, or up until 
the default in November 2019. So even if Barclays had received a request for a 
consolidation loan, its not clear if it wouldve been agreed on the basis of the information 
that Barclays had.
I can also see that Barclays wrote to Mr P on several occasions to ask him to get in touch to 
discuss his circumstances  on 13 July 2019; 23 July 2019; 21 August 2019; 30 October 
2019 (the default notice); 18 November 2019 (an arrears notice). But unfortunately, I cant 
see that Mr P did get in touch with Barclays to discuss things or make any proposals for how 
he might make payments to his loan. It wouldve been especially helpful if he had done so 
following the end of the two 30 day holds which were agreed in June 2019 and July 2019. 
Unfortunately, the nature of the calls he made to Barclays appeared to involve complaints 
about charges and that the calls he was getting.
I can see from Mr Ps correspondence with us that he feels strongly about his complaint. And 
he will therefore be disappointed by my decision, but having reviewed his complaint - Im not 
going to ask Barclays to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2022.
