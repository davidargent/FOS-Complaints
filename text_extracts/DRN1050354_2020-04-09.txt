K821x#15complaint
Mr W says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny),  irresponsibly 
lent to him. Mr W has said a change in his personal circumstances caused him to get behind 
with essential  household  bills so was borrowing  to make ends meet. He says Sunny should 
have seen that he had got into a trap with the borrowing and had to borrow  more to make 
the repayments with both Sunny and other  short-term credit  providers.

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ws complaint  and thought the loans  from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan 13 onwards.  Mr W rejected 
this offer as well as a later offer from Sunny to uphold the complaint from loan 12 onwards. 
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
Ref: DRN10503542repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr W didnt comment  on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt  be upheld.  
Because of this, I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But the loans were  part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr W had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. After doing  so Ive decided  to uphold  
the complaint  in part. Ill explain why. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point  at which  Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  like the adjudicator, I think that this point 
was reached by loan six. I say this because:
Ref: DRN10503543At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr W had taken out six loans within six months. So Sunny ought to have  
realised it was more likely  than not Mr W was having  to borrow  further to cover  the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ws 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ws first loan was for £250 and loan six was for £200 so there  was no significant  
reduction in the amounts he was borrowing.  At this point Sunny ought to have known 
that Mr W was not likely borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall in his income  but to 
meet an ongoing  need. 
Mr W was repaying some of his loans early  and while I appreciate  this would  have 
saved him interest, it could equally be the behaviour of someone having to juggle 
their finances to make ends meet. This is one of Mr Ws complaint points, so I think  
this is most likely. 
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 15 was 
taken out 16 months after Mr Ws first. And it was for the same  amount. Mr W had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans six to 15 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans six to 15;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  six to 15 should  be removed from 
Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN10503544Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 May 2020.
