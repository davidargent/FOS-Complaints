K821x#15complaint
Mr R says DJS (UK) Limited  trading  as Piggybank  irresponsibly lent to him. He said he had 
other loans  outstanding when he took loans from Piggybank  and so the lending  caused him 
financial difficulty. 
background
This complaint is about four payday  and three  instalment loans (these are loans 4, 6 and 7) 
Piggybank provided  to Mr R between  May 2017  and April 2018. Mr Rs lending history is as 
follows:
loan number date startedamount 
borrowedterm (days) date ended
1 04/05/2017 £800.00 34 05/06/2017
2 08/06/2017 £300.00 24 02/07/2017
3 14/07/2017 £300.00 17 31/07/2017
4 09/08/2017 £600.00 83 04/09/2017
5 04/09/2017 £995.00 27 01/10/2017
6 01/11/2017 £800.00 149 28/02/2018
7 02/04/2018 £1,000.00 120 07/04/2018
Piggybank agreed  that it shouldnt have approved loans 6 and 7. It said that at this time it 
could see that Mr R was using other short  term lenders  and it shouldve  looked into this 
further. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Rs complaint and he also thought  the loans 1 to 5 shouldnt  have 
been given. He said it shouldve been  apparent  that Mr R wasnt  managing his money 
properly at this time.  He also had short term loans with other providers.  
Piggybank disagreed and the complaint was passed  to me  an ombudsman. It said that the 
information it had received  showed  that Mr R did have some  other  debts, but these were 
reducing and he wasnt having problems making the repayments.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Piggybank needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Piggybank should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN32741782the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to also say that Piggybank was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Mr R borrowed  £800 for his first loan and this had a repayment of over £1,000.  Mr R said his 
income was £3,750 and his expenditure was £1,375, this left him with a disposable  income 
of over £2,000.  But this is still a large  amount to lend,  particularly to a new customer. 
So I think Piggybank  couldve  realised at that Mr R might have  some  significant financial 
problems rather than having a short term gap in his finances. And it shouldve  also become 
concerned about  whether it knew enough about  Mr Rs true financial situation.
So I think that it wouldve  been proportionate  to fully review Mr Rs circumstances before 
approving the loan.  This was to make sure that Mr R was in a position  to make the 
repayment to the loan sustainably. And Piggybank needed to do this going forward  when 
Mr R continued to borrow. 
From what  I can see Piggybank asked R about his income and expenditure and looked at 
his credit file so see if he had any other outgoings.  I dont think it fully reviewed his finances.  
So I need to think  about what Piggybank wouldve seen if it had carried  out proportionate 
checks. 
Mr R has provided some  information about his financial  circumstances. This includes his 
bank statements and a recent credit  report. I accept that this isnt exactly  what  Piggybank 
wouldve seen at the time. But I think  it wouldve  found out similar information if it had made 
proportionate checks, so I think  its reasonable to rely on it.
Ref: DRN32741783This shows that Mr R was having  problems managing his money.  At the time he took loan 1 
he had a number  of other short term loans  outstanding. I can see he was very overdrawn.  
And going forward his financial situation didnt improve. He struggled to repay  his other  
creditors as had built up a significant  amount of other debt.  
I think that Piggybank  wouldve found out this information  if it had made proportionate 
checks. And I think it wouldve seen Mr R wouldnt have been  able repay  loans 1 to 5 in a 
sustainable way. So I think that Piggybank shouldnt have given loans 1 to 5 to Mr R and I 
think hes lost out as a result of this.
So Im upholding  Mr Rs complaint about  loans  1 to 5. If Mr R accepts this decision 
Piggybank should also pay the offer it has made  on loans 6 and 7.  
putting things right  what Piggybank needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 1 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 1 to 7 from Mr Rs credit file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Piggybank to take off tax from this interest.  Piggybank 
must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I uphold Mr Rs complaint.
DJS (UK) Limited should put things right by doing  what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 August 2019.
