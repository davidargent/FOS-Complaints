The complaint
Miss A complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have failed to provide a refund for an 
item she ordered but didnt receive. Miss A is also unhappy since she believes the interest 
free period on her account ceased when she raised her complaint.
 
What happened
Miss A made a purchase from a sports shop, which Ill call S, for £205 using her PayPal 
account. She says it was apparently delivered on 1 December 2021. The tracking 
information says the parcel was delivered to the porch but Miss A says she doesnt have a 
porch. Miss A says there was also a picture of the parcel at the front door but she never 
received the delivery. 
Miss A says she contacted S who provided her with the tracking evidence from the courier 
and asked her to complete a claim form. Miss A says she chased S a week later and was 
asked to complete the form again. S told her it would take 28 days for her to receive a 
response. 
Miss A says she emailed PayPal on 22 December 2021 and it told her it would investigate. 
But PayPal denied the claim based on the tracking evidence from the courier. Miss A says 
PayPal refused to re-open the claim and referred her to the courier company. 
Miss A took her complaint to the courier company who told her the item was delivered but it 
wasnt delivered within their guidelines. So Miss A sent this response to PayPal. 
Miss A says PayPal told her to go back to S, but S told her they wouldnt do anything whilst 
PayPal were involved. She says PayPal then sent her to Action Fraud and issued a final 
response letter on 10 January 2022. 
PayPal said on 22 December 2021 Miss A filed an item not received claim. In response to 
the claim S provided it with a tracking number from the courier company which showed the 
item was successfully delivered on 1 December 2021. And so her item not received claim 
was denied and closed. 
PayPal said its records show no interest has been applied to her account and the 
promotional purchase in question was interest free until 1 April 2022. PayPal said correct 
procedures were used and said it acted in accordance with its terms and conditions. 
Miss A wasnt happy with the response from PayPal and so she referred the complaint to 
this service. Our investigator looked into things and upheld the complaint. He said Miss A 
provided compelling evidence to support her version of events. 
PayPal didnt agree with the investigators view. It said Miss A agreed to its terms and 
conditions when signing up to PayPal. So the complaint has come to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where information is unclear or incomplete, as is the case here, I reach my conclusions on 
the balance of probabilities. My decision is based on what I think is more likely to have 
happened than not. 
Ive considered whether PayPal acted in line with their user agreement during the dispute 
and claims process. And Im satisfied it did act in line with them when it declined the claim. I 
say this as it had received information from the courier which stated the parcel was 
delivered to porch. The evidence had met the criteria of PayPals definition of proof of 
delivery. 
So Im satisfied PayPal were entitled under the user agreement of the account, to decline the 
claim made by Miss A. But I do need to also consider what is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of a complaint. In doing so there will be times a strict application of any terms 
and conditions will result in an unfair outcome for a customer. 
I think thats what has happened here. It was only evident after PayPal had closed Miss As 
dispute that the courier had confirmed the item was not delivered correctly and within their 
guidelines. 
Its likely that if PayPal hadnt closed down the claim on the date it did  which it is entitled to 
do when Miss A had the additional evidence from the courier company PayPal would have 
accepted the delivery didnt meet its definition. Im persuaded this information would have 
given PayPal no choice but to uphold Miss As claim.
I think Miss A acted in line with the terms of the user agreement and acted reasonably in 
trying to resolve the issue with the missing item  she contacted the seller, PayPal, the 
courier company, and the police in order to do so. 
When PayPal closed the initial dispute in December 2021 Im satisfied it acted as I would 
expect since the item was delivered in line with its user agreement. But while it was entitled 
to strictly enforce the terms and conditions of the account, in this instance it led to an unfair 
outcome based on Miss As individual circumstances, as the courier then confirmed they 
hadnt delivered the item correctly. 
So I think what is fair here is for PayPal to refund Miss A the purchase cost of the item. I say 
this for the reasons above, that when PayPal were made aware it was given incorrect 
information about the delivery it should have put things right for Miss M. 
Interest on the account 
I have reviewed Miss As statements and the information provided by PayPal. No interest or 
fees have been charged on either the disputed transaction or any other transaction to date. 
My final decision
My final decision is I uphold this complaint. 
To put things right PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must; 
1. Refund £205 to Miss As credit account as thats how she made the payment,
2. Pay simple interest at 8% a year; from the 29 November 2021 (the day after the 
transaction) until the date it makes this payment. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept or reject my decision before 27 June 2022.
