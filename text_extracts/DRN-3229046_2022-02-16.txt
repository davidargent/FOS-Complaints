The complaint
Mrs L complains about the way that some replacement windows and doors, that she paid for 
using a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank Limited, were sold to her. She also 
complains about some issues with the replacement windows and doors. Shes being 
represented in her complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mrs L used a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank that she electronically signed 
in March 2019 to pay for some replacement windows and doors. The loan was for £6,248 
which she agreed to repay by 120 monthly instalments of £113.79. 
Mrs Ls representative complained to Shawbrook Bank in October 2019 about the way that 
the replacement windows and doors and the loan agreement were sold to Mrs L and about 
some issues with the replacement windows and doors. Shawbrook Bank said that it had 
arranged for one of its approved suppliers to inspect and quote for the remedial work 
required which it had approved and was booked but it didnt uphold the other aspects of her 
complaint. Mrs L wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator recommended that her complaint should be upheld in part. She didnt 
consider that the replacement windows and doors had been misrepresented to Mrs L or that 
the agreement had been mis-sold to her but she thought that there were some outstanding 
issues with the replacement windows and doors that needed to be put right. She 
recommended that Shawbrook Bank should pay for the outstanding repairs  she said that 
Mrs L should obtain two more quotes for the required work and that Shawbrook Bank should 
choose which of the three quotes to proceed with. She recommended that Shawbrook Bank 
should also pay £250 compensation to Mrs L for the stress and inconvenience caused.
Mrs Ls representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. Her representative says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
the supplier misrepresented itself as a related company and had Mrs L known that it 
was a new company, that the related company had stopped trading and that it had 
been fined, she wouldnt have purchased the replacement windows and doors;
incorrect information was given on the credit agreement so there was a qualifying 
misrepresentation under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974; and
the documentation used by Shawbrook Bank breaches section 61(1) of that Act 
because its not accurate or in line with the sales contract signed by Mrs L.
Shawbrook Bank says that some issues with the replacement windows and doors have been 
repaired, these are different issues and the repairer that it used would be appropriate to 
assess the remedial work. It has also explained why it wouldnt expect to have to pay any 
compensation for distress and inconvenience for what it says would effectively be a warranty 
claim.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mrs L used credit provider by Shawbrook Bank to pay for the replacement windows 
and doors and, in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right 
to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Ls complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be satisfied 
that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the 
replacement windows and doors and that Shawbrook Banks response to her claim 
under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of 
Mrs Ls claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances  Mrs Ls representative has made many detailed 
points in support of Mrs Ls complaint  Ive considered all of those points but, if I 
havent specifically referred to one of those points, its because Ive focussed on the 
issues that I consider to be relevant to my decision on her complaint;
Mrs Ls representative has provided documents that have been signed by Mrs L 
relating to her purchase of the replacement windows and doors  that includes the 
suppliers terms and conditions which clearly refer to the supplier and say that the 
account option price was £6,248 which Mrs L agreed to pay, a carefree agreement 
which identifies the supplier, a feature home agreement and subsidy analysis which 
also identified the supplier and used a trading style;
under the feature home agreement and subsidy analysis Mrs L agreed to participate 
in a feature home promotion and a feature home price of £6,248 was confirmed for 
the replacement windows and doors;
Mrs L electronically signed the fixed sum loan agreement in March 2019 and it set 
out that the total cash price of the replacement windows and doors, and the amount 
of credit, was £6,248 - and the other required information (including the interest rate, 
the total amount payable and the number and the amount of the monthly 
repayments) were also clearly set out in the loan agreement;
the loan agreement said that the credit intermediary was a company that had 
stopped trading and which was related to the supplier  that was clearly incorrect but 
the supplier was correctly identified on the other documents that Mrs L had signed 
and it was using a trading style that used part of the name of the related company;
Mrs Ls representative has provided a report about some legal proceedings against 
the related company in which it was convicted of using high-pressure sales tactics  
but it hasnt provided a copy of the court judgment so Ive not been able to fully 
consider those proceedings  but those legal proceedings are about the related 
company and not the supplier and they arent enough to show that the supplier used 
those high-pressure sales tactics when selling the replacement windows and doors to 
Mrs L;
I consider that Mrs L would have known, or ought reasonably to have known, that the 
supplier was the company identified on the documents and that the loan was being 
provided to her by Shawbrook Bank  even though the credit intermediary was incorrectly shown on the loan agreement - and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that she was induced into making the order, or entering into the 
loan agreement, by a misrepresentation about the identity of the supplier;
Mrs Ls representative says that the loan agreement isnt accurate so doesnt comply 
with section 61(1) of the Consumer Credit Act  but Mrs L had agreed to pay £6,248 
for the replacement windows and doors, which was the amount of credit provided to 
her under the loan agreement, and Im not persuaded that the error about the credit 
intermediary would be enough to cause the loan agreement not to comply with 
section 61(1) or not to have been properly executed (but that would be for a court to 
decide); 
the replacement windows and doors were installed so Mrs L received the windows 
and doors that shed agreed to pay for but shes complained about the sales tactics 
that were used by the supplier and about some issues with the replacement windows 
and doors;
Mrs L agreed to pay £6,248 for the replacement windows and doors, which included 
the subsidies that were shown on the feature home agreement, and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the supplier misrepresented 
the replacement windows and doors or the loan agreement to Mrs L at that time or 
that it used sales tactics that would cause Shawbrook Bank to have any liability to 
Mrs L under section 75 for the way that they were sold to her;
the terms and conditions say that the supplier would accept a cancellation of the 
contract if it received notice in writing within 7 days and the loan agreement said that 
Mrs L could withdraw from the loan agreement within 14 days  if Mrs L felt that the 
supplier had pressurised her into the sale or used inappropriate sales tactics I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have tried to cancel the order 
and withdraw from the loan within those periods - but Ive seen no evidence to show 
that she did either of those;
Shawbrook Bank arranged for some issues with the replacement doors and windows 
to be repaired but Mrs L has complained about further issues with them and her 
representative arranged for them to be inspected by an independent expert in 
February 2021;
the experts report said that:  the overall fitting of the product is really poor ; 
and:  the windows are not installed correctly or professionally ; and the report 
identified a number of issues with the replacement doors and windows;
I consider it to be more likely than not that there are some further issues with the 
replacement windows and doors that are described in the experts report and that the 
replacement windows and doors werent of a satisfactory quality when they were 
supplied to Mrs L because of those issues;
I consider that to be a breach of contract by the supplier for which Shawbrook Bank 
is liable under section 75 and I find that it would be fair and reasonable for 
Shawbrook Bank to pay and arrange for the replacement windows and doors to be 
repaired as described below.
Putting things right
Our investigator recommended that Mrs L should get three quotes for the required work and 
that Shawbrook Bank should then choose which quote to accept. Shawbrook Banks says 
that it would like the work to be done by the repairer that it used for the other repairs of 
Mrs L's replacement windows and doors. I consider that its fair and reasonable for Mrs L to 
have a choice of the repairers that she gets to quote for the work and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require her to accept repairs by the repairer that 
Shawbrook Bank has previously used for her repairs. I find that our investigators 
recommendation is fair and reasonable in these circumstances and that, when it's received 
the quotes from Mrs L, Shawbrook Bank should then arrange and pay for the repairs 
identified in the experts report to be completed.
Shawbrook has arranged for the replacement windows and doors to be repaired but further 
repairs are required. I consider that to be a result of the suppliers breach of contract and 
that that these events will have caused further distress and inconvenience to Mrs L. I find 
that it would also be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Shawbrook Bank to pay 
£250 to Mrs L to compensate her for that distress and inconvenience. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Ls complaint in part and I order Shawbrook Bank Limited to:
Arrange and pay for the remedial work required on the replacement windows and 
doors to be completed as described above.
Pay £250 to Mrs L to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that shes 
been caused.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2022.
