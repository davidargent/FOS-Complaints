The complaint
Mr K complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
MotoNovo Finance Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality. He also complains that the car 
wasnt correctly described in the dealers advert. Mr Ks complaint is being dealt with by his 
father.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr K under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo Finance 
that he electronically signed in February 2020. Mr K paid £72 for the car to be inspected in 
March 2020 and some issues were identified. Mr K paid £482.54 for some brake parts and 
then paid £336 for the brakes to be repaired in May 2020. He paid for further work on the car 
between then and another inspection of the car in May 2021 and he then sold the car and 
settled the finance. 
Mr K complained to MotoNovo Finance about the issues with the car in March 2021 and he 
said that the car wasnt fit for purpose so he claimed damages of £7,946.57 and other 
compensation of £3,000. It arranged for the documents to be reviewed by an independent 
expert in July 2021. It then said that it would refund to Mr K £72 for the March 2020 
inspection, £125 for the May 2021 inspection and the repair costs from May 2020 of £482.54 
and £336.00, and it offered to pay £250 to him for the distress and inconvenience that hed 
been caused.
Mr K didnt accept its offer and complained to this service. He says that MotoNovo Finance 
should reimburse him for £4,103.09 of his repair costs and pay him compensation for the 
distress and anxiety hes been caused. Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint 
should be upheld. He felt that MotoNovo Finances offer was a very fair offer in this case and 
he didnt consider that the advert for the car was misleading or illegal. 
Mr Ks father, on Mr Ks behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. He has responded to our investigators recommendations in detail and says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that:
the failures with the car should have at least warranted advisory comments when the 
car had an MOT test before it was supplied to Mr K, and the MOT station is an 
affiliate of the dealer - and he believes that the dealer knew of the issues with the car, 
including that it had been modified;
the advert for the car says that: it had been sourced directly from a performance car 
specialist (but hes found out that the it didnt come from a performance car 
specialist); it had a service history and had been serviced and fully mechanically 
prepared (but that cant be true as the car had no airbox and had modified engine 
parts); and the car had been valeted and had a nationwide warranty (but the 
handover was rushed, the documents werent explained properly and no warranty 
was given) and the upgrades referred to are standard items on this model; and
the car wasnt road-worthy when sold, the dealer must have known that, and he feels 
so strongly about this that hed welcome going to court.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
MotoNovo Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr K - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr K was more than eleven years old, had been driven 
for 111,678 miles and had a price of £13,085;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mr K paid £75 for the car to be inspected in March 2020 and the following issues 
were identified as customer advisories: boot release switch pack broken, drivers side 
window faulty, wind noise and rattling when door closes, horn tone odd, air bag light 
on, wheel bolts rusty, AC has no gas, NSF tyre is new but not branded or N rated, 
front bump stops rotten, front damper shafts corroded, pin hole in OSF lower ARB 
link dust cover, front discs worn and corroded and cooling holes blocked, OSR outer 
CV joint leaking grease, front dampers corroded at the top mount and need 
replacing, pin hole in OSR lower ARB link gaiter, front brake discs worn and 
corroded, cooling holes are blocked with corrosion and are aftermarket, rear brake 
discs are after market, OSR out CV leaking grease, car has been painted OS and 
front, and air con requires gassing and diagnosing the leak; 
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr K contacted the dealer about those issues or 
tried to make a claim under the warranty that had been referred to in the dealers 
advert for the car;
Mr K paid £482.54 for some brake parts and paid £336 for the brakes to be repaired 
in May 2020, he had the car inspected again in June 2020 and he paid for numerous 
repairs to the car between then and March 2021 when he complained to MotoNovo 
Finance;
he paid £125 for the car to be inspected again in May 2021 and a number of issues 
with the car were identified and the inspection report says: 
. most of the above listed faults would not meet the required criteria set by 
the 'Ministry of Transport' and would result in a fail notice being issued after a 
MOT test, although at the time of purchase the vehicle had 'passed' the MOT 
test with the only advisory listed as 'undertray fitted'. However the claimant 
has had majority of the rectification work carried out at his own expense. 
Taking into account the purchase date and mileage it appears that the listed 
faults were on-going at the purchase inception. This suggests that the vehicle 
'was not fit for purpose' at the time of purchase;
MotoNovo Finance then arranged for the documents to be reviewed by an 
independent expert in July 2021  the experts report says:
The [May 2021] report  does not indicate that any of the above issues were 
present. It merely states that the vehicle would not meet the current Ministry 
Of Transport tests and appears to just correspond with the issues identified 
[in the March 2020 report]. As such the report offers no supporting evidence that these faults were all in fact present. Whilst there are images to support 
several of the issues on[e] has to consider that the vehicle has covered a 
significant distance, this being in excess of 3,483 miles. Based on the 
information made available we would have to consider that in our opinion 
these conditions were not present or developing at commencement of hire 
and have occurred as a result of general use over the passage of time. We 
therefore do not consider that the selling agents have any liability.
the car had passed an MOT test in February 2020, before it was supplied to Mr K  
Mr Ks father has raised concerns about that MOT test so I have considered the cars 
recent MOT history:
oit passed an MOT test with no advisories in June 2018 when its mileage was 
106,046;
oit passed an MOT test with an advisory about plastic covers fitted to the 
underside in June 2019 when its mileage was 108,966;
oit passed an MOT test with an advisory about a tyre issue in October 2019 
when its mileage was 109,759; and
oit passed an MOT test with an advisory about an undertray fitted in February 
2020 when its mileage was 111,678;
between June 2018 and February 2020 the car passed an MOT test four times and 
was only driven for 5,632 miles;
the car was more than 11 years old and had been driven for 111,678 miles when it 
was supplied to Mr K in February 2020 and I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect the car to be in a condition consistent with that age and mileage  it had 
passed an MOT test earlier that month and, despite Mr Ks fathers concerns about 
that test, I consider it to be more likely than not that the car was roadworthy at that 
time (which is consistent with the previous three MOT tests);
Mr K had the car tested in February 2021 and it failed an MOT test twice because of 
a non-conforming registration plate, a warning light and headlamp issues and it then 
passed the test with no advisories later that month when its mileage was 114,597  
so it was considered to be roadworthy before it was supplied to Mr K and it was 
considered to be roadworthy a year later when it passed an MOT test;
the March 2020 inspection identified a number of issues with the car, including with 
its brakes, and I consider that its more likely than not that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality at that time because of the issue with its brakes  but I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect some of those issues on a car of this age and 
mileage so not all of the issues would have caused it not to have been of satisfactory 
quality at that time;
Mr K paid £482.54 and £336 for the brakes to be repaired in May 2020 and 
MotoNovo Finance has offered to reimburse him for those costs  and to also 
reimburse him for the cost of the March 2020 and May 2021 inspections  it has also 
offered to pay him £250 compensation for the distress and inconvenience that hes 
been caused;
Mr K continued to pay for repairs to the car between May 2020 and when it was sold 
and he was able to drive about 3,500 miles in the car - Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that those repairs were required because the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr K;
Mr K has sold the car so its not possible for it be inspected by an independent expert 
and I consider that the offer that MotoNovo Finance has made to Mr K is fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances;Mr Ks father says that the advert for the car was incorrect and Ive carefully 
considered the points that hes made about it not coming from a performance car 
specialist, it not being fully mechanically prepared, the handover being rushed, no 
warranty being given and the upgrades being standard items on this model;
Mr K would have had the opportunity to inspect the car before it was supplied to him 
and to discuss any concerns or issues with the dealer  and if it was important to him 
that the car came from a performance car specialist I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have asked for more information from the dealer;
the car had passed an MOT test before it was supplied to Mr K and I dont consider it 
to be unreasonable that the mechanical preparation referred to didnt identify all of 
the possible issues with the car;
the advert referred to a nationwide warranty but Mr K paid significantly less for the 
car than the advertised price and Ive seen no evidence to show that the price that he 
paid included a warranty;
I sympathise with Mr K for the situation that his father has described and his feelings 
about the process being rushed but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that the car was misrepresented to him or that he was induced into entering 
into the hire purchase agreement by a misrepresentation by the dealer; and
I also sympathise with Mr K (and his father) for the issues that hes had with the car 
and for the repair costs that hes incurred, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require MotoNovo Finance to pay to 
Mr K more than the amount that its already offered him or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that MotoNovo Finance Limited should pay to Mr K the amounts that its 
offered to him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 March 2022.
