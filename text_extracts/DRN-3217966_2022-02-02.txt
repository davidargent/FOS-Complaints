The complaint
Mrs R (through a representative) has complained that S.D. Taylor Limited trading as Loans 
at Home (LAH) didnt carry out proper affordability checks before it provided her with lending.  
Had it done proper checks it wouldve realised Mrs R was in a debt spiral. 
What happened
Mrs R took 24 home collected loans from LAH between August 2011 and November 2015. A

The cost per week column is the individual cost per loan per week. When loans overlapped 
the cost per week will be greater. For example, when loans 2 and 3 were being repaid, 
Mrs Rs weekly commitment to LAH was £15. 
Following Mrs Rs complaint, LAH issued its final response letter (FRL) on 14 April 2021. 
The FRL explained Mrs R had made her complaint too late about loans 1  18, so LAH 
considered the lending to be time barred. As a result, LAH didnt investigate whether an 
error had been made when it advanced these loans.  
The FRL went on to explain that loans 19  21 shouldnt have been granted and it offered 
compensation to put things right. LAH also confirmed that it would use the refund to offset 
the amounts written off for loans 22- 24. 
Mrs Rs representative told this Service that Mrs R had rejected the compensation LAH 
outlined in the FRL. 
 
One of our adjudicators looked at Mrs Rs complaint. The assessment was split into two 
parts. 
In the first part, the adjudicator concluded that, this Service could investigate loans 1  18, in 
addition to loans 19  24 which LAH didnt raise any time bar concerns. This is because 
while the loans had been complained about more than six years after the event. The 
adjudicator hadnt seen anything to make him think Mrs R had complaint more than three 
years since she was or ought to have been aware, she had cause to complain.  
In the second part, the adjudicator considered whether LAH had done anything wrong when 
it made these loans. He hadnt seen enough to say LAH had made an error when loans 1-5 
were advanced. So, these loans werent upheld. 
But the adjudicator did uphold the complaint about loans 6  24 because in his view, the 
pattern of lending was now harmful for Mrs R. 
Mrs Rs representative acknowledged the adjudicators findings. 
LAH didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment. In its response to the adjudicator LAH 
didnt focus on whether it was wrong to have provided some of the loans, instead it focused 
on whether this Service had the jurisdiction to consider the loans. In summary it said:
It disagreed with the approach this Service had taken with this case.
In this case, LAH told this Service Mrs R received arrears letters between 2011 and 
2017 following periods of either no payments being made, or reduced repayments 
being received. 
LAH couldnt get hold of Mrs R to ask her when she became aware, she had cause 
to complain. Therefore, LAH says there is insufficient information to be able to 
conclude the loans are within this Services jurisdiction. 
No evidence has been provided as to why this case is in this Services jurisdiction 
and as such, LAH hasnt given this Service approval to consider these loans.  
The adjudicator went back to LAH and explained why its comments didnt change his mind. 
He said, copies of the arrears letters LAH says were sent havent been provided and he 
reiterated hed not seen enough to suggest the case was outside of this Services 
jurisdiction. 
 
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
Why I can look into this complaint
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments provided by Mrs R and LAH to 
decide whether we are able to look at all of her loans  including the ones LAH says were outside of this Services jurisdiction. Having done so, I have reached the same conclusion as 
the adjudicator  that I have the power to consider all of Mrs Rs loans. Ill explain why. 
The rules I must apply say that, where a business doesnt agree, I cant look at a complaint 
made more than six years after whats been complained about. Or if later, more than three 
years after the complaint in this case, Mrs R knew, or ought to really have known they had 
reason to complain. This is set out in Dispute Resolution rule 2.8.2R and can be found online 
in the FCAs Handbook.
Loans 1 - 18 were complained about more than six years after they were taken. However, 
Ive not seen anything to persuade me Mrs R was aware or ought to have been reasonably 
aware more than three years before she raised this complaint, that she had reason to 
complain. 
LAH has said that when Mrs R experienced repayment problems which led to arrears being 
sent to her between 2011 and 2017.  Although LAH hasnt said so, I understand these letters 
have been raised, because LAH considers these letters ought to have been enough for 
Mrs R to be aware she could complain. But, I dont think this is enough in this particular case 
to demonstrate that.
I say this because whilst experiencing repayment problems and therefore struggling to repay 
the lending would no doubt have led Mrs R to realise there was a problem (in terms of her 
financial difficulty), Im not persuaded this would have (or ought to have), in itself, made her  
aware that these problems were caused by LAH doing something wrong when it agreed the 
loans. 
I appreciate LAH hasnt been able to get hold of Mrs R, but in this case, but I havent seen 
anything else to persuade me that Mrs R was or ought to have become aware earlier of 
cause to complain more than three years before they complained. 
So, like our adjudicator, I think all of Mrs Rs loans were raised within the time limits I need to 
apply and that I do have the power to consider these loans Mrs R was given. Ill now go on 
and consider whether or not I think all the loans complained about were lent responsibly. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice
at the time the loan was provided.
LAH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate and reasonable checks to make sure 
Mrs R could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that LAH should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mrs R. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult tomeet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to say that LAH was required to establish whether Mrs R 
could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all mean for Mrs Rs complaint.
Loans 1  5
The adjudicator didnt uphold Mrs Rs complaint about these loans. Neither Mrs R (nor her 
representatives) disagreed with the adjudicators findings, so I no longer think these loans 
are in dispute. So, I dont intend to make a finding about them.  But I have kept in mind this 
loan when thinking about Mrs Rs overall lending relationship with LAH.  
Loans 6 - 24
LAH has already agreed that something went wrong when loans 19  24 were granted, and 
Ive taken this into account when looking at these loans.
 
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 6 - 19 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. 
In addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Mrs R, LAH also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Mrs R.
Having looked at the overall pattern of LAHs lending history with Mrs R, LAH should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the 
time it provided loan 6. I say this because:
By loan 6 it was 11 months into the lending relationship and Mrs R had been 
indebted to LAH for the entire time. In my view, Mrs Rs loan history up until this point 
was a clear indication that her underlying financial situation didnt seem to be 
improving. 
Mrs Rs first loan was for £100 with loan 6 being for £200 and at the time loan 6 was 
granted loans 3, 4 and 5 were still outstanding. So, there were no signs that her 
indebtedness was decreasing at this point. 
Mrs R returned for loan 6, was granted when there were three previous loans running 
at the same time. And there was an emerging pattern of new loans being taken on 
the same day that a previous loan was repaid or example loans 2 and 4. From loan 6 onwards Mrs Rs pattern of taking new loans shortly after a previous 
loan had been repaid continued to have multiple loans running at the same time.    
By the point of loan 24, Mrs R was making a commitment to make repayments to 
LAH for almost another year, after already being indebted for just over four years. So, 
Mrs R wasnt making any inroads into what she owed LAH. Loan 24 was also 
significantly larger than loan 1, and loans 22 and 23 were still running, so Mrs Rs 
indebtedness was significantly higher. The amount of time that Mrs R spent indebted 
to LAH meant that she was in effect servicing a debt to LAH over an extended period 
of time.
Based on the statement of account provided by LAH Mrs R was only able to repay loans 1  
21 by refinancing the borrowing into new loans. This further reinforces my view that these 
loans were not sustainable for Mrs R because despite knowing she refinanced her loans, 
LAH still continued to lend to her. 
I think that Mrs R lost out when LAH provided loans 6 - 24 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Rs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the number of loans and time in debt was likely to have had negative implications on 
Mrs Rs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6  24 Ive set out below what LAH 
should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress LAH should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what
might have happened had it not provided lending from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought to
have.
 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs R may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative 
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Mrs R in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Mrs R would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce LAHs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
LAH shouldnt have given Mrs R loans 6 - 24.A. LAH should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs R towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party 
where applicable, but not including anything you have already refunded.
B. LAH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs R 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs R originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. LAH may  if it chooses to  use the total of A plus B to repay any principal which 
it has written-off.
D. You should pay any remaining refund to Mrs R. If there is no refund left and still a 
balance outstanding made up of written-off principal, it would not be fair for LAH to 
pursue this further. 
E. The overall pattern of Mrs Rs borrowing for loans 6 - 24 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so LAH should remove these loans entirely from 
Mrs Rs credit file. If LAH has sold any of the loans it should ask the debt purchaser 
to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to take off tax from this interest. LAH must give 
Mrs R a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Mrs Rs complaint in part.
 
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right for Mrs R as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2022.
