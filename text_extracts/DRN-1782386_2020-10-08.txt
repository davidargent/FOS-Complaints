The complaint
Mr B complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Black Horse Limited, trading as Land Rover Financial Services, wasnt of satisfactory quality. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr B has made other complaints about the car but in March 2019 he discovered that 
the car was corroding when the cause of some warning lights was being investigated 
and he wants to reject it;
Land Rover Financial Services, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for 
ensuring that it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr B - whether or 
not it was of satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, 
including the age and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr B was about three years old, had been driven for 
25,971 miles and had a price of £53,000;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that theres some corrosion on the car (or that 
the car has broken down at least four times) and it was inspected by a 
manufacturers dealer but it said that it was unable to confirm the cause of the 
corrosion or how long it had been there;
I dont consider that Mr B has provided enough evidence to show that the corrosion 
was present when the car was supplied to him or that it wasnt of satisfactory quality 
at that time because of the corrosion or the other issues about which hes 
complained;
the cars mileage when it broke down in March 2019 was 36,695 so Mr B had been 
able to use the car for about 17 months and to drive more than 10,000 miles in it  
Im not persuaded that its likely than hed have been able to do that if the car hadnt 
been of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to him and I consider it to be 
reasonable to expect him to have noticed signs of the corrosion during that time if it 
had been present when the car was supplied to him;
the manufacturers dealer has quoted a cost of £1,200 to repair the corrosion and 
Land Rover Financial Services has offered to pay for that repair  that is more than I 
would have required it to do in these circumstances so I consider that its offer is more 
than fair and reasonable;
I sympathise with Mr B for the issues that hes had with the car and understand his 
frustration and disappointment about the breakdowns and the corrosion  but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of satisfactory 
quality when it was supplied to him  so I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for 
me to require Land Rover Financial Services to allow him to reject the car; and
if Mr B now wants to accept Land Rover Financial Services offer to pay for the 
corrosion to be repaired, I suggest that he contacts it or the dealer  but I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Land Rover Financial Services to pay 
any compensation to Mr B or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 November 2020.
