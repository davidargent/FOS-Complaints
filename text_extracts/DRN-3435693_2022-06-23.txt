The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) incorrectly cancelled a direct 
debit, which meant his mortgage was left unprotected. He wants NatWest to pay the arrears 
on his mortgage protection policy so that the direct debit can be reinstated. 
What happened
Mr D banks with NatWest. He had a monthly direct debit in place to pay for a mortgage 
protection policy. In 2021, Mr D complained to NatWest that his insurer had cancelled the 
policy, as the direct debit had failed in September 2020. He said they wouldnt re-instate the 
policy until the arrears had been cleared, so he wanted NatWest to pay these. 
NatWest responded. They said their records showed they received an online request to 
cancel the direct debit in July 2020; and received a call later that day from Mr D to inform 
them hed cancelled it online, and queried why the money had left his account. NatWest said 
they returned the direct debit claim unpaid as cancelled by customer, and returned another 
in August 2020, with the August recall corresponding with the failed September date 
provided by Mr D. So they said they were right to cancel the direct debit, as this was what 
Mr D had asked them to do. Unhappy with this, Mr D brought his complaint to our service. 
An investigator considered Mr Ds complaint but didnt recommend it be upheld. She said 
she was satisfied Mr D had requested the direct debit be cancelled. She said this was also 
confirmed when Mr D called NatWest to ensure it had happened. So she didnt ask NatWest 
to do anything further. Mr D remained unhappy, so the case was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In order to determine whether or not NatWest were right to cancel Mr Ds direct debit, Ive 
listened to a call that took place between NatWest and Mr D in July 2020. When Mr D called 
in, he explained to NatWest that hed been online to cancel the direct debit, but was 
concerned the money had still left his account. He asked NatWest to confirm if the direct 
debit was now showing as cancelled, and asked if they could try and get the money back for 
him, as he was having a dispute with the third party over payments. He said he would like 
the direct debit cancelled so that they cant take any money moving forward. 
NatWest said that the money had already left the account, so theyd arrange for the payment 
to be recalled, which could take a few days. They said Mr D should also cancel the direct 
debit with his insurer, as otherwise, it was likely theyd continue to try and take the payment, 
and if so, the money would leave the account  albeit it would then be returned. Mr D said he 
would do so, and thanked the advisor for their time. 
So, while I appreciate Mr D is unhappy the direct debit was cancelled, Im satisfied NatWest 
were right to cancel it as per Mr Ds request. NatWest has now provided details for Mr D to 
pass on to his insurer should he wish to reset the direct debit, and Mr D should discuss this 
with his insurer should he wish to do so. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2022.
