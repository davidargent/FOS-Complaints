Mrs R complains that Ferratum UK Ltd lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Mrs R applied for a number of loans and 11 were approved. Some  were payday loans and 
three were instalment loans, the last one of which remains outstanding.  Using  Ferratums 
information I have  created  a brief table of the approved loans with very brief details of the 
rejected applications to place them in context.

The information about income derives  from two sources: £1,251  from an undated  copy  
payslip and £900 net monthly income as it appears on the Ferratum credit  bureau search. 
So its possible that Mrs Rs income  altered.  So the figure entered in the table may not 
correspond with the net income figure for that month. Ferratum  said it used this figure.  
Mrs R has said that Ferratum made her situation worse because  of the interest  that you had 
to pay as soon  as I was paid all my wages were gone, so you end up taking another loan out 
to live it just becomes continuous  lending. 
Ref: DRN10141352Our adjudicator considered the complaint and thought that Ferratum  should put things right 
for Mrs R for all of the loans. Ferratum disagreed and has asked that it be reviewed  by an 
ombudsman. In particular  it has said 
Ferratum feel we lent responsibly and as all loans with the exception  of the current 
one were paid back  on time or early we had no reason to believe [Mrs R] was 
struggling financially. 
On the information we had available we were happy to lend. All loans are set up in 
accordance with the guidelines set by the Financial Conduct Authority and it does not 
seem fair that now we have been  advised  of key indicators  of unsustainability.
No submissions or explanations are forthcoming from Ferratum  about the conclusions our 
adjudicator came to in relation to the figures  he gathered from the credit  bureau searches.
The complaint remains unresolved and so has been passed to me for a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mrs Rs case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mrs Rs complaint  and I have explained why below.
Ferratum needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs R 
could repay  her loans  in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mrs Rs income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mrs Rs complaint. These  questions  are:
Ref: DRN101413531.Did Ferratum, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to 
satisfy itself that Mrs R would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mrs R would have  been  able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mrs Rs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did Ferratum act unfairly  or unreasonably in some other  way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mrs Rs complaint.
Did Ferratum each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy  itself 
that Mrs R would be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mrs R would have been  able to do so?
Ferratum says:
We approved these loans after conducting  an up to date credit check with Call Credit  
(see attached) along with our own internal credit  policy checks.
And goes  on to say:
Our Call Credit checks are automated and built in to the application system. There is 
no manual intervention and data is read by the system and loans approved  or 
rejected depending on the information obtained.
Ferratum also explains that Mrs Rs good  repayment record seems  to have added to its 
assessment of her applications in that her good  record led her to become labelled as one of 
its very best customers. And based  on what it saw from these it decided to lend to Mrs R.
Ferratum has sent to us its credit  bureau search  results and there are about 660 pages with 
many lines of information on each page. It has not analysed these and explained  to us what 
it revealed and what  it relied  on. Ferratum has highlighted the fact that the approval  process  
it relied on was automated. 
I note that Ferratum has not replied to our adjudicators  view disputing the figures  he had 
derived from these search results and presented to it as part of his adjudication.  From  this 
I take this to mean that Ferratum takes no issue with them.
I have read briefly the first part of the credit bureau  search done  for Loan 1, and it does 
reveal to me that Mrs R had several loans and payday loans outstanding, had a joint bank 
account and paid utilities which were held jointly with another  person. I think Mrs R was likely 
going to have to repay  several  hundred pounds for other credit  liabilities  around the time she 
applied for Loan  1.
And the information  Ferratum received from the credit searches cannot  be ignored once it 
has been discovered. So I think that on balance,  Mrs Rs existing liabilities revealed by the 
search results, plus the Loan 1 repayment  plus what must  be some modest living costs such 
as food, rent, travel and such like, lead me to think that Loan 1 was unaffordable. And with 
the information Ferratum had at the time it would have known this. 
After the break in lending, and assuming that Mrs Rs income was around £1,200 in late 
2016, then her application for Loan  2 was for £300 with a repayment figure of £376. This 
Ref: DRN10141354would have been a large part of her income and I think that the proportionate check at this 
stage ought to have included asking  Mrs R about  her regular expenditure, regular credit 
commitments and also about other short term loans she had. 
As I have outlined above, Ferratum relies on the credit search results and seems to have 
accepted our adjudicators views on what  those  reveal and so I think  its likely Mrs R was not 
able to afford this loan repayment for Ferratum.
After Loan 2, in December  2016  Ferratum refused the next three applications where Mrs R 
applied the day she repaid Loan  2 and for the two days  after that. This repeat pattern of 
application is a behaviour  which ought  to have alerted a responsible lender that Mrs R was 
in need of the cash quite  urgently.  
Ferratum seems to rely on the fact that its ability to refuse applications demonstrates the 
robustness of its checks and systems  before lending. But I disagree.  The information 
Ferratum already had about Mrs R, combined  with the fact that on the day (or the days  
immediately after) she repaid Loan 2 she tried three times to get more  credit,  leads me to 
think that Mrs R was showing  signs of reliance on the high-cost short-term  credit market. 
And as Ferratum will have known, the rules and regulations governing  it as a regulated firm 
do not consider  that to be responsible lending. 
So for the Loan 3 application, after so many  refused loans, I think  that the proportionate 
approach ought  to have been  to carry out a full review  of Mrs Rs financial situation. I do not 
think that it did that, but it did have a great deal of information about her from the credit 
bureau search results  it carried out. And our adjudicators view outlined  the situation  
revealed by those results  and Ferratum has not disputed these nor offered any additional  
interpretation of them. So I do not think that Mrs R was in a position  to afford Loan 3.
Just before Loan  4, the same pattern occurred  Mrs R applied  for a loan which  was refused 
and she did that on the day she had repaid Loan 3. Loan 4 was approved  but I think that 
Ferratum had information from its own research which  it ignored  and which  demonstrated 
she was reliant, or becoming reliant,  on this high-cost credit.  Or Ferratum did not do enough 
to carry out a full review  of Mrs R financial situation  which I think  would  have been  
proportionate at this stage. Had it considered the detail  it already had or carried  out the full 
financial review, then I think it would  have seen that she was not able to afford Loan 4.
So I uphold Mrs Rs complaint in relation to Loans 1 to 4. 
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for Loans 5 to 11 because 
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mrs Rs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise 
harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which Ferratum should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Ferratum should  have  realised that it shouldnt have provided any 
further credit. Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Rs case, I think that this point was 
reached by Loan  5. I say this because:
Ref: DRN10141355the amounts  Mrs R was borrowing were  generally increasing,  and Ferratum ought to 
have realised it was likely her indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
it had refused several loans and Mrs R was reapplying for a different amount on the 
same day or the next day; and
Mrs R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Ferratum.  And was in 
effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended  period.
I think that Mrs R lost out because Ferratum  continued  to provide borrowing from Loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Rs indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time; and 
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mrs Rs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  Mrs Rs complaint about  Loans  5 to 11 because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  her indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and she lost out as a result.
Did Ferratum act unfairly  or unreasonably in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude Ferratum acted unfairly  or unreasonably towards Mrs R in some 
other way.  
putting things right  what Ferratum needs to do
Because Ferratum  should not have  given Mrs R the loans she took, its not right that Mrs R 
should have to pay interest  or charges on these, or have them affect her credit file in a 
negative way. Then I think it should do as follows:
refund  all interest and charges Mrs R paid on all the loans; 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative payment information about Loans 1 to 4 from Mrs Rs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 5 means any information recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  Loans 5 to 11 should  be removed from Mrs Rs credit 
file.
Ferratum is entitled  to set off any monies arising  from the redress against any monies  Mrs R 
may owe it, but to be clear this should  only be in respect of the principal sum borrowed. Any 
unpaid charges and interest would need  to be removed first and any payments made to any 
loan treated as if Mrs R had paid down the principal.
If a third party owns any debt then in order to do the set off I have outlined  above, Ferratum 
will need  to repurchase that debt. If it does not do that then it cannot do the set off and the 
full amount due will be repayable to Mrs R directly. And in those circumstances  the third 
party will need to be directed by Ferratum to correct any adverse entries  or to remove  any 
entries on Mrs Rs credit  file, so far as it is able to do so. 
Ref: DRN10141356* HM Revenue & Customs requires Ferratum  to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mrs R a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one. If Ferratum does 
apply the set off then it needs to do that before it deducts the tax. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im upholding Mrs Rs complaint.  
Ferratum UK Ltd should do as I have set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I need to ask Mrs R to accept or reject 
my final determination  on or before 6 April 2019.
