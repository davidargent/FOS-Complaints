K820x#14Complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc recorded a CIFAS  marker  against his 
name. CIFAS  is the UKs fraud alert service.
Background
Mr S had an account with NatWest for several years. On 9 November 2018,  he received a 
payment of £240.00  into his current account from an account  held with Clydesdale bank. 
Clydesdale contacted NatWest to say the payment had been identified  as fraudulent   and 
specifically the payer  had been the victim of an email scam. As a result NatWest  blocked 
Mr Ss account. 
NatWest asked Mr S about  the payment. He told NatWest he didnt know anything  about it. 
And that he hadnt  given anyone his bank details.  NatWest wasnt  satisfied  with 
Mr Ss explanation. So, it closed his account and placed a CIFAS marker against his name.  
Mr S complained to NatWest about  the marker.  But it said it wasnt prepared to remove  it. 
So, he brought his complaint to us. 
Mr S told us that he was expecting a payment for his wages from his ex-employer. And hed 
logged onto his online banking and saw the £240.00 payment. Mr S says he tried to call 
NatWest on 9 November  2018 after hed noticed the payment. But NatWest  was closed. 
One of our investigators  considered Mr Ss complaint but didnt think NatWest  should 
remove the fraud marker. She noted that Mr S had given her a different explanation about  
the payment to the one he gave  NatWest at the time. So she asked him to provide evidence  
of his employment to support what hed said about  the origin of the money. But Mr S didnt 
provide anything. 
The investigator also noted that Mr S had logged onto his online banking on multiple  
occasions after the payment was made into his account  which was at times  when he 
wouldve been able to speak to NatWest  to tell them about  the payment  as it wouldnt have 
been closed. And when  Mr S had called NatWest  it wasnt to speak  to them  about  the 
payment  but was because he wasnt able to access  his account due to the block NatWest 
had put on his account. So she didnt  uphold the complaint. And said NatWest  didnt  need  to 
remove the marker. 
Mr S didnt accept what the investigator said. He said he knows nothing  about the payment. 
And he asked for the matter to be considered  by an ombudsman. So, the complaint  has 
come to me to decide. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have however, reached the same 
conclusion as the investigator did, and for similar  reasons.
I accept that the £240.00 paid into Mr Ss account  on 9 November 2018,  came originally 
from the victim of a scam. The investigations carried out by the victims bank and NatWest 
support this to be the case. And Ive no reason to doubt their findings.  So, Im satisfied that 
Mr S received fraudulent funds into his account.  But that doesnt necessarily mean, that 
Mr S was involved. 
Ref: DRN00120912However, Mr Ss explanation of how the money came to be paid into his account is, in my 
view, not very convincing.  Initially he told our investigator that he was expecting  a payment 
of £350.00 from his employer and that this was going to be his first set of wages. He then 
told the investigator that he was expecting around  £250.00  and that hed been receiving his 
wage payments into the account for a few months. Mr S also said hed received cheques 
from his employer which he cashed  at the post office. But when asked  by the investigator to 
provide evidence of his employment, such as a wage slip, Mr S wasnt able to provide 
anything.
Ive also note that the explanation he gave to our investigator is very different to what he told 
NatWest at the time. Ive listened  to the call recording  of his conversation with NatWest  on 
10 November 2018, and Mr S told NatWest  that he had no idea about the payment. And he 
cant explain  how it came  to be made into his account as he hadnt given anyone  his bank 
details. He made no mention of the payment possibly  being wages he was expecting as he 
told our investigator.  In fact, he didnt mention the payment until NatWest asked him about  it. 
Its clear from the call that Mr S called NatWest because he couldnt access  his account  
and not as hes suggested  to our investigator to speak to them  about  the payment coming 
into his account.
I also cant ignore Mr Ss online activity at the time. I can see that Mr S logged  onto his 
online banking 20 times on the day the money  came  into his account. Including after the 
money was paid in. So, I think  more likely than not he was aware of the money coming into 
the account. And from looking  at the amount of times he was logging  in, I think its more 
likely than not he was expecting the payment. And he was checking  whether it had been 
received. 
From looking  at Mr Ss account  statement I can see that the payment reference against the 
£240.00 wasnt Mr Ss employer but a different name, which  wasnt  related to Ms Ss 
employer. So, I think its reasonable to expect  Mr S to have raised this with NatWest and 
check what the payment  was, if as he says he knew nothing about the payment. But he 
didnt alert NatWest that an unrecognised credit had been paid into his account. 
Of course,  I cant  rule out the possibility that Mr S has been merely nave here. And hes 
been the victim of a scam himself. But hes provided  conflicting  and extremely  limited 
information about the payment into his account.  In short,  I think  it more likely than not that he 
knows more about  the payment into his account than he has been prepared  to tell us or 
NatWest 
In the circumstances, I think NatWest was justified in acting in the way it did. On that basis,  I 
think its fair that NatWest  reported Mr S to CIFAS  for misuse of his account. And Im not 
going to ask it to remove  the marker.
Ref: DRN00120913My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 January 2020.
