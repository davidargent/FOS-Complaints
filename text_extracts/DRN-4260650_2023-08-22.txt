The complaint
Mr R, a sole trader, complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) unfairly 
decided his transaction isnt eligible for a refund under PayPals Seller Protection Policy 
(SPP).
What happened
In September 2022, Mr Rs customer raised a chargeback as they said theyd not received 
the service he started to provide in May 2022. The credit card issuer found in favour of the 
customer and reversed a payment of around Â£4,600 from Mr Rs PayPal account.
PayPal says that for Mr R to have benefited from its SPP, he would have needed to provide 
evidence of fulfilling the customers order. PayPal says that as it didnt receive this evidence, 
Mr R wasnt eligible for a refund. 
As Mr Rs account was then left in a negative position, PayPal instructed a third party debt 
collection agency. PayPal said that going forward Mr R should work with that agency. 
The investigator didnt initially uphold Mr Rs complaint. She explained that PayPal doesnt 
control the outcome of chargebacks so it wasnt wrong to reverse the customers payment. 
The investigator agreed that Mr R didnt benefit from the SPP as hed not provided evidence 
of delivering the service to his customer.
Mr R wasnt happy with the investigation outcome. He said he provided evidence to PayPal 
that his customer had benefited from the service he provided. Mr R sent this service 
screenshots of messages with PayPal detailing the service hed delivered to the customer. 
Mr R said that hed provided the evidence to PayPal using an online form and gave the 
investigator a reference number.
After considering the additional evidence, the investigator issued a second outcome. She 
thought Mr R met the terms of SPP as hed forwarded evidence to PayPal which 
demonstrated that Mr R had delivered the service to his customer. The investigator asked 
PayPal to refund the payment and take the debt back from the debt collection business. She 
also asked PayPal to remove any negative information associated with the outstanding debt 
from Mr Rs credit file.
PayPal disagreed with the investigation outcome. It said it hasnt any record of receiving the 
evidence and that as a minimum it would need to see evidence that the customer either 
received or benefited from the purchase made from Mr R. 
After the investigator forwarded the evidence to PayPal, it said that at the time of the 
chargeback it didnt receive the evidence required and that a ticket was opened to make 
sure the correct decision was made at the time.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In cases like this where the evidence is inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision 
based on the balance of probabilities. That means Ill look at all the available evidence and 
decide what I think is most likely to have happened. 
The decision about the chargeback was ultimately made by the card issuer, not PayPal. So, 
I dont find PayPal was wrong to reverse the payment after the buyer filed a successful 
chargeback claim. However, PayPals SPP means that in certain circumstances, sellers 
dont lose money to chargebacks  this includes where an item has not been received.
Mr R says that he submitted the evidence via an online form as directed by PayPal. 
Unfortunately, Mr R hasnt been able to access his PayPal account to provide further 
evidence of this. However, he has given this service screenshots which show him trying to 
discuss the information he provided with PayPal. 
PayPals SPP means that in certain circumstances, sellers dont lose money to chargebacks 
 this includes where an item has not been received. So, although PayPal could not defend 
the chargeback from the customers credit card company, Mr R could still have been 
covered under PayPals SPP.
The evidence provided by Mr R indicates that the buyer received the service that he sold. 
This includes screenshots of the social media growth gained by the buyer which ties in with 
the minimum follower information which Mr R set out on his business website.  It seems 
likely to me that the buyer did receive and/or benefit from the service Mr R provided. 
Although there is some dispute over whether or when this information was shared with 
PayPal, based on Mr Rs testimony Im satisfied that he provided the information to PayPal 
online as requested, using the reference number that hed been given. 
As I find Mr R did provide the service to his customer, it follows that I agree that he should 
have benefited from PayPals SPP and I uphold his complaint.
Putting things right
To put things right, PayPal should:
Refund Mr R the money that it withdrew from his account in relation to the successful 
chargeback claim; 
Pay Mr R simple interest at the rate of 8% per annum calculated from the day it 
withdrew the money until the date of settlement;
Recall the debt from the debt collection company; 
Remove any negative information from Mr Rs credit file that it has recorded in 
relation to the chargeback amount; and
Direct the debt collection company to remove any negative information that it may 
have recorded about the debt.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I require PayPal 
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to put things right as set out above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 September 2023.
