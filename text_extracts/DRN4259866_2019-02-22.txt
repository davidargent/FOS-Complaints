K820x#14complaint
Ms S is unhappy that The Mortgage  Works  (UK) Plc has appointed receivers  over her buy-
to-let (BTL) property when  it knew she wanted  to apply for an extension of the mortgage 
term.
In order to resolve her complaint  she would like TMW  to withdraw  the receivers, remove  the 
default which has been registered on her credit files, cancel the additional charges which  
have been added to her mortgage and pay her compensation for the loss of income due to 
losing her tenant.
background
On 14 April 2018 TMW wrote to Ms S confirming that the term of her BTL mortgage had 
expired on 31 March 2018. TMW said Ms S would need to make  arrangements  to repay  the 
amount owed. A redemption statement was enclosed.
On 23 April 2018 Ms S called TMW to discuss an extension of the term. It said it would send 
forms in the post to apply for the extension. However, she never received these. 
On 11 July 2018 TMW wrote to her again  in the same terms. She called TMW on 18 July 
2018 saying she hadnt received the term extension  application form. Again she didnt  
receive anything  until she received  a letter dated  18 September 2018  informing her that 
receivers had been appointed. 
Ms S then asked TMW for copies of all letters sent to her. In reply  TMW  wrote  on 1 October 
2018 As requested  please find enclosed file copies of the four letters that were  sent to you 
regarding the expiry of your mortgage  term. The copy letters enclosed were  as follows:
5 September 2017 Notice that the term was due to expire  in six months
10 March 2018 Reminder of expiry, redemption statement for 31 March
14 April 2018 Described above
11 July 2018 Described above
However none of the letters said anything about the application for a term extension.
On 2 October 2018 TMW wrote to Ms S:
Thanks for your request to extend  the term of your mortgage. As you have confirmed that 
you would  be willing to make a capital repayment  in order to reduce your Loan-To-
Value (LTV)  to below  80%, the next steps are as below. Weve enclosed  an application form 
for you to complete  and return to us.
However this letter  related  to a different property, which Ms S didnt own.
Ms S made a complaint  to TMW. It replied on 31 October 2018 accepting that there had 
been a service issue  in not sending a term extension application form to Ms S following the 
telephone conversation on 18 July 2018.  It went on to say:
It is my understanding that you have  recently moved away from your former  
correspondence address [...] .When  deciding  as to whether  our decision to instruct the 
Receivers was correct, I have considered the recent  change  of address and I have 
Ref: DRN42598662concluded we were not made aware  in [sic] the change of address until you informed us on 
24 September 2018. It is my understanding that you have been collecting your mail from 
your former address and some mail may have gone missing. However, as discussed it is 
your responsibility to ensure we are corresponding to the correct address. I confirm  we have 
previously sent letters  to you reminding you the term of the mortgage  for [] had expired. In 
response to your telephone request on 23 April 2018, we wrote to you on 11 May 2018  and 
enclosed a Term Extension application for you to completed [sic]. We did not receive your 
application and hence for [sic] our letter dated  11 July 2018. In response to our letter,  you 
contacted us on 18 July 2018  and asked us to send a Term Extension form to you. We 
informed you that one will [sic] be sent and I as mentioned earlier  we failed on this part of the 
service. However, I do not think it was reasonable for you to wait 8 weeks  for an application 
form when you were  aware of the serious  situation  you were in following our letters dated 
11 July 2018 and 18 July 2018 which informed you of our intention to instruct the Receivers.
TMW said it didnt think appointing the receivers was wrong. The term had expired and to 
dis-instruct the receivers the mortgage would  need to be redeemed either through a sale or 
using Ms Ss own funds.  The application  form sent on 2 October was blank and could have 
been completed by Ms S. TMW  was satisfied it hadnt delayed her in completing and 
submitting the form. TMW offered Ms S £150  compensation for not sending  the application  
form on 18 July.
On 14 December 2018 Ms S complained to this service but our adjudicator  didnt 
recommend the complaint be upheld. Hed obtained from TMW a copy of its letter  of 11 May 
2018 enclosing  a term extension application  form.  It was correctly addressed and he couldnt 
hold TMW responsible if the post wasnt received successfully.
As a result of not receiving the form back TMW wrote to Ms S again on 11 July 2018, 
informing her to make  arrangements to redeem the loan as the term had expired. Ms S rang 
TMW on 18 July 2018,  but during this call she didnt make TMW  aware  that shed already 
requested the term extension form during  her call on 23 April 2018  and hadnt received it. 
The adjudicator said the time between the request  on 23 April 2018 and 18 July 2018 was 
almost three months. He thought this was an unreasonable amount  of time for Ms S not to 
have chased TMW for the forms, considering the urgency of the situation.
Although Ms S was told on the 18 July 2018 call that she would be sent term extension  
forms, these werent sent. However, the adjudicator thought that if they had been,  the 
outcome wouldnt  have been  any different. TMW had sent letters  to inform Ms S about her 
term expiring in September  2017, March 2018,  April 2018, and July 2018.  The situation 
could have been avoided had she acted earlier.  After not receiving the application form in 
response to the 18 July 2018 call, Ms S again didnt make an attempt to chase it. 
However, TMW had acknowledged  its poor service in not sending the form on 18 July 2018 
and had offered  Ms S £150, which the adjudicator thought was fair and reasonable.
Ms S didnt agree and asked for the case to be looked at again. She recalled  being  asked if 
she had a capital  sum which could be put towards the repayment of the mortgage  in order  to 
bring the loan-to-value within the 75% which  would be required if the valuation was low.
She said TMW had lied when it said it had sent out the application  form. It was quite rude 
and extremely rigid.  Ms S was powerless to apply  for a term extension until she had a form.
Ref: DRN42598663She rang TMW when  she received the letter of 14 April and again when she received the 
letter of 11 July, each  time in an effort to find a resolution. She could understand that there 
might be alarm bells had she not been making  her mortgage payments or ignoring  letters, 
but she had made every  mortgage payment for the past ten years on time, never missing 
one and she was responding  to the letters  she had received in order  to find a resolution.
This was her sole business.  She was a good,  responsible landlord, albeit an extremely  busy 
one, which  was why she wasnt chasing  TMW for a form she had asked for, when she 
probably should have. She had funds available to make up any difference necessary  had the 
loan-to-value been too high.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms S says the consequences  of these  events seem unfairly harsh  when she was doing her 
best. However it was her responsibility to ensure she had made arrangements  for the end of 
the mortgage term. Nevertheless she took no immediate action on receipt of the letter of 
5 September 2017. This was the time to start proposing an extension  of the term if she 
wasnt going to redeem the mortgage on expiry.
Nor did she take any action on receipt  of the letter of 10 March 2018.  It wasnt  until 
23 April 2018, some weeks after expiry  of the term, that Ms S called TMW to seek an 
extension. By then she was in default. TMW only registered the default in November 2018, 
which means it had allowed many months to agree a resolution before registering the 
default;
Following the phone conversation on 23 April 2018 Ms S didnt receive an application form 
and should have realised that something was wrong. TMW  says it sent a form on 
11 May 2018. Ms S says thats a lie. But I dont  think it matters whether TMW  didnt send  the 
form on 11 May or whether it did, but the letter was lost in the post. Either way, Ms S knew 
she hadnt received  an application form and that time was running  out.
Ive listened to the call recordings. I agree with the adjudicator that when Ms S called  TMW 
on 18 July 2018  she didnt mention that shed already requested  the term extension  
application form during the call on 23 April 2018 and hadnt yet received it. Nearly three 
months had passed  since  23 April 2018.  I agree this was an unreasonable  amount of time 
for Ms S not to have  chased the form, considering  the urgency  of the situation.
Ms S fairly  accepts, in her reply  to the adjudicator,  that she probably should  have  chased  
sooner. When a mortgage term ends the borrower  is required to redeem the mortgage 
immediately in full and if this isnt done,  they are defaulting on the mortgage. The application 
form sent on 2 October 2018 was blank and could have  been completed by Ms S if she 
wanted TMW to grant a term extension and withdraw the receivers. I assume TMW  wouldnt 
have sent the form if it wasnt prepared to contemplate that.
For these reasons Im not asking TMW to do any more.  I think  the £150 offered for its poor 
service in not sending  the extension application form in July 2018, is fair and reasonable. 
Ref: DRN42598664my final decision
The Mortgage Works  (UK) Plc has already made  an offer to pay £150 to settle the complaint 
and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances. So my decision is that TMW  should  pay 
Ms S £150.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 March  2019.
