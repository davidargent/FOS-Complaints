The complaint
Mrs B complains about the way that some replacement windows, that she paid for using a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank Limited, were sold to her. Shes being 
represented in her complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mrs B used a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank that she electronically signed 
in December 2016 to pay for some replacement windows. The loan agreement showed that 
the cash price of the replacement windows was £4,637 which she agreed to repay by 120 
monthly instalments of £84.45. She also signed the suppliers purchase order form.
Mrs Bs representative complained to Shawbrook Bank in August 2019 about the way that 
the replacement windows and the loan agreement were sold to Mrs B. Shawbrook Bank set 
out in detail its reasons for rejecting that complaint but Mrs B wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She considered 
Shawbrook Banks response to Mrs Bs claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. She didnt agree that Shawbrook Bank had acted unfairly or that it needed to do 
anything more.
Mrs Bs representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. Her representative says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
there is incorrect information on the credit agreement and the sales contract, Mrs B 
wasnt told the truth and had her freedom of choice taken away;
the supplier was taken to court in June 2016, and convicted in June 2017 of using 
high-pressure sales tactics, and if it had told Mrs B the correct information and acted 
honestly she wouldnt have placed the order; 
Shawbrook Bank didnt treat Mrs B fairly; and
the documentation used by Shawbrook Bank breaches section 61(1) of the 
Consumer Credit Act because its not accurate or in line with the sales contract 
signed by Mrs B.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mrs B used credit provided by Shawbrook Bank to pay for the replacement windows 
and, in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim 
against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Bs complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be satisfied 
that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the 
replacement windows and that Shawbrook Banks response to her claim under 
section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Bs 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mrs B signed the suppliers purchase order form which showed an order price of 
£6,357 for some replacement windows - and she selected a lifestyle account which 
gave her a subsidy of £1,720 which reduced the price to £4,637;
Mrs B electronically signed the fixed sum loan agreement and it set out the total cash 
price of the replacement windows as £4,637  it also set out the other required 
information including the interest rate, the total amount payable and the number and 
the amount of the monthly repayments;
Mrs Bs representative says that the loan agreement isnt accurate so doesnt comply 
with section 61(1) of the Consumer Credit Act  but Mrs B had agreed to pay £4,637 
for the replacement windows, which was the amount included in the loan agreement, 
and Im not persuaded that any errors in the other documents would be enough to 
cause the loan agreement not to comply with section 61(1) or not to have been 
properly executed (but that would be for a court to decide);
the order form said that the supplier would accept a cancellation of the contract if it 
received notice in writing within 7 days and the loan agreement said that Mrs B could 
withdraw from the loan agreement within 14 days  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mrs B tried to cancel the order or withdraw from the loan within those 
periods and I consider it to be reasonable to expect that she would have tried to do 
so if she wasnt happy with the way that the replacement windows had been sold to 
her;
Mrs Bs representative has provided a report about some legal proceedings against 
the supplier and it says that the supplier was taken to court in June 2016, and 
convicted in June 2017 of using high-pressure sales tactics - but it hasnt provided a 
copy of the court judgment so Ive not been able to fully consider those proceedings 
 but those legal proceedings arent enough to show that the supplier used those 
high-pressure sales tactics when selling the replacement windows to Mrs B and the 
purchase was made in December 2016  before the date that it says the supplier 
was convicted;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances  Mrs Bs representative has made many detailed 
points in support of Mrs Bs complaint  Ive considered all of those points but if I 
havent specifically referred to one of those points its because Ive referred to the 
issues that I feel I need to refer to for me to be able to reach a decision on her 
complaint;
I sympathise with Mrs B for the way that she clearly feels about her dealings with the 
supplier, and I understand that her representative considers that theres been 
misrepresentation and fraud by the supplier and that Mrs B was lied to, but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier; and
I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to Mrs Bs section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for 
me to require it to refund to Mrs B any of the money that she paid for the replacement 
windows, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her 
complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 April 2022.
