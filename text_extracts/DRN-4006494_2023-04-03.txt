The complaint
Mr Z complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked his bank account. Mr Z says 
this caused him inconvenience and financial loss for which he should be compensated.
What happened
Mr Z had a personal account with NatWest. 
In July 2022, NatWest decided to review how Mr Z was operating his account. Whilst it 
conducted its review the bank blocked Mr Zs access to his account, this meant Mr Z couldnt 
access the funds in his account and no payments could be credited into it. At the time the 
balance of Mr Zs account was just over £5,500. NatWest removed the block from Mr Zs 
account on 8 August 2022. Following this the bank decided to close Mr Zs account and 
wrote to Mr Z giving him 60 days notice. Mr Z withdrew his balance on 9 August 2022. 
Mr Z discovered that his account was blocked when he tried to access his account online 
and couldnt do so. Thinking that there was a technical problem, he called the bank to try 
and find out what was happening with his account. But NatWest wouldnt give him much 
information. Mr Z tried to contact his personal banking manager at NatWest over the next 
few days, hoping hed be able to shed some light on what was happening to his account. But 
he never received a call back. So, Mr Z complained to NatWest.
In response, NatWest wrote to Mr Z and told him it wasnt obliged to provide Mr Z with an 
explanation for its actions. However, NatWest apologised for the lack of contact from Mr Zs 
personal banking manager and refunded charges and fees on Mr Zs account as a gesture 
of goodwill.
Unhappy with this response, Mr Z brought his complaint to our service. He said NatWests 
actions had caused him a great deal of stress and worry. He said he wasnt able to access 
child benefit money in his account and couldnt go on a holiday because the bank blocked 
his account.  He explained that his parents had paid for three airline tickets at a cost of 
£10,000 each, which had been booked via an overseas travel agent, but he had to cancel 
the trip because he didnt have access to funds to pay for the required Covid tests prior to 
travel. So, he wants NatWest to compensate him for the cost of the flights.
The investigator asked NatWest to provide more information about why it had blocked Mr Zs 
account. But NatWest said it couldnt provide anything more than it had already provided to 
us. And maintained that it hadnt treated Mr Z unfairly when it had blocked his account.
The investigator said that based on the limited information the bank had provided, she 
couldnt say the bank had treated Mr Z fairly when it had blocked his account. So, she said 
NatWest should pay Mr Z £100 compensation for any trouble and upset the block had 
caused along with 8% interest on the balance of the account for loss of use of funds. 
NatWest accepted what the investigator said. Mr Z didnt. He said that the amount of 
compensation doesnt adequately reflect the amount of trouble and financial loss hes 
suffered. He wants £30,000 compensation to cover the cost of his cancelled flights.
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has important legal and regulatory obligations it must meet when providing 
accounts to customers. These obligations are ongoing, so do not only pertain to when an 
account is opened. To comply with its obligations NatWest may need to review an account 
and/or restrict its customers access. The terms and conditions of Mr Zs account also permit 
NatWest to block and review an account. 
Whilst I accept NatWest must comply with its legal and regulatory obligations and is entitled 
to block an account under the terms and conditions. NatWest still needs to provide 
information to this service so we can fairly decide a complaint. Despite being asked by the 
investigator, NatWest has failed to provide information about why it blocked Mr Zs account. 
Ive considered what NatWest has said about why it wont provide further information to our 
service about the reasons it restricted Mr Zs account. This service has the power to request 
evidence of this nature under the dispute resolution rules (DISP) and Im not persuaded the 
reasons given by NatWest exclude it from complying with these rules. So, in this particular 
case, because of the lack of information I cant be satisfied that NatWest has treated Mr Z 
fairly when it blocked his account. Taking this into account, I agree NatWest should pay Mr Z 
compensation for the trouble and upset caused by blocking his account. So, Ive looked at 
what Mr Z has said about how the block impacted him.
The timing of NatWests actions was unfortunate. Mr Z has said that at the time he was due 
to fly overseas on 1 August 2022.  And return to the UK on 1 September 2022. Hes said the 
flights, which were paid for by his parents, had to be cancelled because he wasnt able to 
pay for covid tests due to the block on his account. Mr Z has provided a letter from an 
overseas travel agent dated 6 March 2023 who he says was used to organise the trip in 
support of what hes said. The letter states that the flights were cancelled because Mr Z was 
unable to provide covid test results.
Ive considered what Mr Z has said about how NatWests actions impacted him. He says 
NatWest should compensate him for the cost of the flights he says he had to cancel. But 
Mr Z has told us that the flights were funded by his parents. And not him. Ive not seen any 
evidence that there was any arrangement Mr Z had to repay his parents. So, Im not satisfied 
that Mr Z has lost out financially. And I cant award redress for financial losses he hasnt 
experienced. And ask NatWest to compensate Mr Zs parents. I note too that Mr Z had 
access to over £4,000 in another bank account at the time NatWest blocked his account  so 
its not clear to me why he was unable to pay for the required covid tests needed for him and 
his family to travel overseas. 
Mr Z is seeking a large amount of compensation. But for me to award more compensation Id 
have to be satisfied that the block caused an unreasonable level of inconvenience and 
financial loss. Despite being asked by the investigator, Mr Z hasnt provided any evidence to 
support his financial losses. Instead, Ive seen evidence that shows that the costs of the 
flights were met by someone other than Mr Z. So, it wouldnt be fair of me to tell NatWest to 
pay financial loss or compensation for something theres no evidence of.  NatWest agreed to pay £100 compensation and 8% interest for loss of use of funds, as 
recommended by the investigator. Having considered what Mr Z has told us about how the 
block on his account impacted him Ive no doubt this he was caused some trouble and 
upset.  His calls werent returned by NatWest staff, and he was unable to access a benefit 
payment that had been paid into his account in July 2022.
I can see that NatWest has already apologised for Mr Zs personal banking manager not 
returning his calls and refunded him fees/charges as a gesture of goodwill. With this in mind, 
and having looked at all the evidence and circumstances of this complaint, I havent found 
grounds to increase the level of compensation. Im satisfied that £100 compensation along 
with 8% simple interest on Mr Zs balance is fair and reasonable amount of compensation 
and proportionate to the trouble and upset Mr Z was caused. So, while Mr Z may disagree 
with me, I wont be asking NatWest to do anything else to resolve this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I uphold this complaint. To put things right National 
Westminster Bank Plc should: 
pay Mr Z £100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused by the bank blocking 
his account.
calculate interest at 8% simple per year on the balance of Mr Zs account. National 
Westminster Bank Plc should calculate this from 27 July 2022 until 8 August 2022.
HM Revenue & Customs requires National Westminster Bank Plc to withhold income 
tax from the above-mentioned interest. National Westminster Bank Plc should give 
Mr Z a certificate showing how much is taken off if Mr Z asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 May 2023.
