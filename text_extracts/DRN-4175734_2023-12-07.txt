DRN-4175734
The complaint
Ms H has complained that Marks & Spencer Financial Services Plc (MSFS) unfairly 
declined her claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
What happened
Ms H bought some wardrobes from a third party, using finance from MSFS. Unfortunately, 
there were then issues with the installation. The third party made Ms H an offer, in full and 
final settlement, which she accepted. MSFS then declined her claim under section 75, on the 
basis that the complaint had been settled. One of our investigators looked into what had 
happened, but agreed that MSFS hadnt behaved unfairly in declining the claim. Ms H 
disagreed. She explained shed only accepted the settlement offer because of the fear of 
being taken to court, her credit score being damaged, and losing her job. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding it. I know this will be disappointing for Ms H, but Ill 
explain why. Im satisfied that Ms H accepted an offer in full and final settlement of her 
complaint against the third party. So, the complaint that gave rise to the section 75 claim has 
been settled. Accordingly, I agree that it wasnt unfair of MSFS to decline her claim. I 
appreciate that Ms H says she felt she had no choice. But ultimately, it was her decision to 
accept the offer, in the knowledge that it was in full and final settlement.
My final decision
Its my final decision not to uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or reject my decision before 
4 January 2024.
