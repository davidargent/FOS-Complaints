The complaint
Mr F complains that TransUnion International UK Limited (TransUnion) keeps mistakenly 
reporting that hes not on the electoral roll at his current address. 
Mr F wants TransUnion to take steps so that this doesnt happen in the future.
What happened
Mr F complained to TransUnion in early 2021 after his credit file showed him as not being on 
the electoral roll. This was the third time in as many years that a similar thing had happened 
to Mr F.
Mr F explained to TransUnion that his council continues to use an abbreviation for the 
number of his address which most business systems cant easily process. This means that 
other businesses routinely refer to Mr Fs address by a simple numbering system rather than 
the abbreviation used by the council.
When this issue arose in 2019, TransUnion apologised and said that the mistake was due to 
a data-matching error. But in 2021, TransUnion told Mr F that the council had again provided 
it with a different format of his address. TransUnion suggested that Mr F contact the council 
to prevent this from happening again.
Mr F was unhappy with TransUnions response. He was concerned that the problem would 
keep repeating so he came to this service for help. 
Mr F wanted TransUnion to reply to complaints within five working days as per its website. 
And he asked that TransUnion properly consider customers complaints rather than using 
copy and paste responses.
The investigator sent out two views, both upholding Mr Fs complaint. He asked that 
TransUnion pay Mr F £100 to apologise and take steps to prevent the mistake happening 
again.
TransUnion doesnt agree with the investigators recommendation. It said that it had upheld 
Mr Fs complaint due to a service issue, but that TransUnion couldnt stop his council 
changing his details.
As TransUnion doesnt agree with the investigators recommendation, the complaint has 
come to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can fully appreciate Mr Fs upset and frustration. Just when he thinks that the situation is 
resolved, the error reoccurs leading to further work on his part to put things right.
I appreciate that mistakes do happen and that credit reference agencies like TransUnion are 
reliant on the data suppliers to provide the correct information. However, in Mr Fs case, his 
council had previously explained to TransUnion that it had to use a specific address format 
when reporting Mr Fs electoral roll details.
In the past, TransUnion seems to have accepted this explanation from the council. In 2019 it 
told Mr F that: 
Having checked the details we hold for you on your credit file information, I can see 
your lenders and service providers hold a different address format to the format your 
local council holds for you. Unfortunately this can cause matching issues when 
aligning information on your credit file. I am please to advise your Electoral Roll 
information has now been added to you credit file
I do believe that TransUnion has acted in error due to the failure of our data 
matching routines.
TransUnion seemed to recognise that Mr Fs local council uses a different format when 
reporting his address. And that this shouldve been picked up as part of its data matching 
process. 
When Mr F complained in 2021, TransUnion gave him some conflicting information. It told 
him that his credit report did show an electoral roll entry on his credit report. But later, 
TransUnion said that Mr Fs council had given it a different format of his address which 
theyd now corrected. 
I can appreciate that Mr F has been less than impressed by the differing explanations hes 
received from TransUnion. And his council has previously told TransUnion that Mr Fs 
address format is decided by the street naming and numbering section as its their statutory 
authority to do this. This seems to make it unlikely that Mr Fs council will be willing or even 
able to amend the address that it reports.
Considering what TransUnion said in the past about the data matching failure, I think its fair 
to require it to take reasonable steps to ensure that the details provided by Mr Fs council are 
correctly matched in future. 
Mr F says that the mistake has impacted his mental health as well as his credit rating. So, I 
also agree with the investigators recommendation that TransUnion pay him £100 
compensation.
Mr F would like this service to direct TransUnion to treat its customers fairly and reply 
promptly to complaints, but this isnt a direction I can make as part of my decision. This 
service deals with individual complaints about the service someone has received. It would be 
for the regulator  the Financial Conduct Authority  to investigate business practices and 
procedures more generally. I hope that Mr F understands.
Putting things right
TransUnion International UK Limited should:
take reasonable steps to match the electoral roll details provided by Mr Fs council with the information on his credit file; and
Pay Mr F £100 compensation
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I require TransUnion 
International UK Limited to take the steps outlined above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 December 2021.
