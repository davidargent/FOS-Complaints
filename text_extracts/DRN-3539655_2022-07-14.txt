What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
In line with the Payment Services Regulations 2017 and general banking terms, 
HSBC is expected to process authorised payment instructions without undue delay. 
So, as Mr P authorised these payments (even though duped by a scam), the starting 
position is that hes liable. 
But there are some situations where we believe that bankstaking into account 
relevant rules, codes and best practiceought to have identified a fraud risk, so 
should have looked at the wider circumstances surrounding the transaction before 
making the payment. If HSBC failed to do so, and that failure led to a fraudulent loss, 
it might be fair to hold it liable.
In this instance, HSBC identified the very first scam payment for further checking. 
And it does appear out of keeping with Mr Ps usual account activity. It was to a new 
payee, connected to cryptocurrency, and he didnt have a history of making 
payments of this size. So the key question is whether HSBC responded fairly and 
proportionately to the risk it identified. 
Based on the available evidence, I understand Mr P had to call and confirm hed 
requested the payment  but he wasnt asked about the circumstances of this. Im 
not persuaded that was a proportionate response to the risk HSBC identified. A key 
feature of these scams is the consumer is tricked into making the payment, believing 
the investment to be genuine. So checking Mr P knew about the payment wasnt 
enough for HSBC to satisfy itself all was well. 
Id also highlight that, in these types of scams, its common for funds to be 
transferred through other accounts first  such as to purchase cryptocurrency for the 
investment. Thats what happened here. Mr P was directed to set up a wallet with a 
legitimate merchant and to give the scammers access to this, so they could transfer 
the cryptocurrency he bought onto the trading platform. Given that the FCA and 
Action Fraud had published warnings about cryptocurrency scams in mid-2018, these 
are factors HSBC ought to have been aware of when the payments were made in 
2020.
If it had asked reasonable questions of Mr P, I think HSBC would have realised he 
was the victim of a scam. For example, if asked about how hed been contacted and 
how he came to set up the account, Ive no reason to doubt he would have explained 
that hed found the company online, using what HSBC ought to have realised was a 
fake celebrity endorsement. And that the company had directed him to set up, and 
given them access to, his cryptocurrency wallet  so they could transfer these funds 
onto the alleged trading platform. These are clear, well-established hallmarks of a 
cryptocurrency scam. 
On balance, Im satisfied that if HSBC had warned Mr P why this sounded like a 
scam, he wouldnt have made these payments. Whilst he was persuaded by the 
trading platform, HSBC could have explained that its common for such scams to 
involve manipulated software. As an inexperienced investor, I think Mr P would have 
relied on what his bank told him and stopped  preventing his loss. 
Whilst the payments didnt go direct to the scammer, as noted above, thats common 
in these types of scams. Having identified Mr Ps payment as unusual and 
suspicious, if HSBC had intervened appropriately, Ive found it would likely have been 
on actual notice that he would suffer financial harm from fraud. As this loss ought to 
have been in the contemplation of and foreseeable to HSBC, I consider it fair and 
reasonable to hold it liable for the loss.
Ive also considered whether Mr P is partly to blame for what happened. I dont think 
he reasonably foresaw the risk this was a scam. Unlike the bank, he was a layperson 
unfamiliar with these types of scams. He was persuaded by what he thought was an 
endorsement from a public figure; the professional-looking website and trading 
platform; and his ongoing contact with the scammer. Whilst I accept Mr P could have 
done more research, Im conscious that, as time  and the overall amount of his 
investment  went on, he would reasonably be more reliant on the platform and his 
contact with the scammers. In the circumstances, Im satisfied there was no 
contributory negligence.  
Putting things right
HSBC UK Bank Plc should refund Mr Ps loss from his first payment onwards, which I 
understand totals £29,988.41. And it should pay 8% simple interest per year on that amount 
from the dates of payment to the date of settlement.
If HSBC considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customers to deduct income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr P how much its taken off. It should also give Mr P a tax 
deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customers if appropriate. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct HSBC UK Bank Plc to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2022.
