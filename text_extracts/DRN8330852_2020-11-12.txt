K822xcomplaint
Mr W complains that Phoenix Life Assurance Limited (Phoenix)  issued incorrect valuation 
statements relating  to his pension plan,  one of which was used as the basis for his divorce 
settlement. This led to the settlement being incorrect.
background 
Mr W had a Phoenix personal pension plan made up of ten equal segments numbered 000 
to 009. He was able to cash in individual segments. However, Phoenixs  systems struggled 
to account for the partial encashments. Its process  was to place markers on policies in 
such circumstances to ensure that on-going policy values  were then manually calculated to 
account for any encashments.
In June 2016, when the policy  segments were worth around  £155,000 in total, Mr W cashed 
in four segments. However,  Phoenix failed to place the requisite marker on the policy. 
Phoenix issued  a statement in December 2016, stating that the policy value was around 
£190,000. It referred  to segments 000 to 009, despite the fact that 000 to 003 had been  
encashed.
Mr W cashed in two further segments in February 2017 and two more segments in May 
2017. This left two segments  remaining.  
Phoenix issued  an annual statement in late May 2017, stating that the policy  value had been 
around £192,000 at the end of December 2016. 
Phoenix issued  a breakdown of the three  encashment  payments  in July 2017.
Phoenix issued  a further policy value  in mid-November 2017. It quoted the values of 
segments 000 to 009 as around £208,000. It followed this with another  valuation  at the end 
of November 2017 of around £41,800.
Mr W used the £208,000 valuation as the basis for his divorce  settlement. The settlement 
was finalised in January 2018.
Also in January  2018, Mr W cashed  in two further segments. These were, in fact, the final 
two segments. 
In March 2018, Phoenix confirmed that the policy had no value  and Mr W complained.  He 
had understood  that there was around £150,000 remaining. 
Phoenix accepted  that it had quoted incorrect policy values. However, it felt that Mr W 
should have known that the figure of £208,000 was incorrect. It offered £1,100  compensation 
for costs, distress  and inconvenience. 
Mr W referred the complaint to the Financial  Ombudsman Service.  An adjudicator assessed 
the complaint  and considered that Phoenixs  offer was fair. He made  the following main  
points:
Ref: DRN83308522Various segment values had been quoted. It appeared these  had been  correct 
throughout. The errors resulted from Phoenixs system failing to account  for the fact 
that different  segments had been cashed  in prior to November 2017. 
Mr W must have  understood  that the policy  was made up of ten segments. This was 
stated in a number of documents.  He had applied to encash specific  numbers of 
segments. 
For the November  2017 valuation to have been correct, the segment value would 
have to have increased over fivefold since July 2017. In general, the incorrect values  
were clearly  improbable. He didnt believe it had been reasonable for Mr W to rely on 
the November  2017 value in his divorce  settlement. 
Mr W did not accept the adjudicators view. But he has not provided  any further submissions 
for me to consider,  although I have considered the points he made in subsequent 
conversations with the adjudicator. I have  reviewed the complaint taking into account  the 
available submissions and evidence.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It has not been disputed that Phoenix supplied incorrect policy  valuations  at various points in 
time. The material issue to be resolved is what  the ramifications of that were.
Having considered the issue carefully,  I agree with the findings of the adjudicator. I will 
explain why.
  
As the adjudicator discussed in his assessment, Phoenix issued:
A benefit quotation dated 3 February  2016. This set out a current  plan value of 
about £148,000. This value was correct.
A benefit quotation dated 11 May 2016.  This set out that the plan had 10 segments,  
000 to 009. It was confirmed that segment 009 had a value of about £15,000.
An annual statement dated  12 May 2016. This set out that the plan had a total value 
of about £154,000 as at 31 December 2015. This value was correct. It also set out 
there were 10 segments to the plan.
A valuation dated 21 December  2016  that set out the plan was worth  about 
£190,000. (This  was incorrect and the value quoted should have been  about 
£114,000).
A valuation dated 13 January 2017  which set out that a segment  of the policy  was 
worth about £20,000.
A valuation dated 26 January 2017  which set out that two segments  of the policy  
were worth about  £39,000.
An annual valuation dated  28 May 2017  that set out the plan was worth  about 
£192,000 on 31 December 2016.  (This was incorrect as was the quoting of segments  
000 to 009, four of which had already been encashed).
Ref: DRN83308523A valuation dated 10 July 2017 setting out that segments  008 and 009 had a total 
value of about £40,000. 
A retirement benefit calculation dated 16 November 2017. This set out a plan value 
of about £208,000. Segments 000 to 009 were quoted. (This was incorrect).
A Phoenix valuation  dated 30 November 2017. This set out that segments 000 to 009 
were valued at about £42,000.
I have also listened  to the telephone conversations Mr W had with Phoenix about  his 
pension plan and its value.
As discussed, I note that Phoenix  provided  a value to Mr W of about £154,000 as at 31 
December 2015.  Then  in June 2016  Mr W cashed in segments 000 to 003 (nearly  half the 
plan) for about  £63,000. About six months  later in December 2016  Phoenix supplied a 
valuation of about £190,000. 
I think at this point Mr W should have had concerns about the information  he was being 
provided with. Nearly half the policy had been cashed in and yet, after six months, the value 
had (apparently)  increased  from that of 31 December 2015 (before the encashment  took 
place) by about  £40,000. Furthermore Phoenix quoted segments at this time that had 
already been cashed in six months  earlier.
In February and May 2017 Mr W then cashed in four segments which  combined  were worth 
about £80,000.  Mr  W had now cashed in most of the policy.  In July Phoenix said that the 
two segments that remained were valued at about  £40,000 in total and also supplied 
information to Mr W which  set out how many segments  had been  encashed  so far. 
Phoenix supplied  a value of about  £208,000 on 16 November  2017 and referred  to all 
segments being  in force. Mr W then cashed  what were  the remaining two segments of the 
policy for about £42,000 in January 2018.  
As at January  2018  Mr W has taken about £185,000 from a policy that was stated to be 
worth £154,000 as at the end of 2015.  Yet he was supplied with a policy value  of over 
£200,000 in November 2017.  And shortly  after that he supplied  with a policy  valuation  of 
about £40,000, £160,000  less than that set out some two weeks previously.  I think Mr W 
should have known that at least some of the values were likely to be suspect, and certainty 
the value of 16 November 2017  which he says he subsequently used in divorce 
proceedings. Furthermore Phoenix were  informing him at various  points that all his 
segments remained  when that clearly could not be the situation. 
I realise Mr W is not employed in financial services  and therefore it is reasonable for him to 
accept some significant movement in values  perhaps more  than would be expected by an 
individual with more  knowledge of investments and pensions. But, given the encashments  
that had been made,  I think it should  have  been  apparent that some of the values, 
particularly those of December 2016  and November 2017, could not be correct. It was 
therefore not reasonable for Mr W to rely on them. 
I appreciate what Mr W has said about  his circumstances at the time  for example that he 
was travelling a lot and getting divorced. It would have therefore been more  difficult to know  
exactly the position of his pension plan. But I also have  to take into account that it was 
Ref: DRN83308524reasonably apparent that the information he was given was clearly wrong, or at least so 
unlikely to be correct  that the benefit calculation of 16 November 2017 should  have been  
checked and queried. This is bearing in mind a background of, as Mr W says, similar 
administration errors  by Phoenix and telephone  conversations which  suggested that some 
Phoenix employees were  having significant  problems in providing accurate values. 
So I dont  believe that it was reasonable for Mr W to accept the 16 November 2017  valuation 
at face value without querying it in some depth, especially as that value was to be used in 
legal proceedings. If it had been investigated further  I think  the errors in valuation  would 
have been discovered. So I dont believe that I can reasonably order Phoenix to compensate  
Mr W for the ramifications that had as to his divorce  settlement. 
I do sympathise with Mr Ws position  and recognise  that he may feel that I am letting 
Phoenix off the hook  for its actions. He did not make the errors and it is clear that Phoenix 
has caused him considerable inconvenience.  But, for the reasons discussed, I dont believe I 
can order it to pay Mr W a higher value than his plan is actually worth.  In terms of redress  I 
believe the sum it has offered is fair in the circumstances. That is a significant figure in terms 
of an award I might  make for the distress and upset  Phoenixs actions have caused  and I do 
not believe I should award more.  
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ws complaint  that Phoenix  has provided him with incorrect  valuations. But I 
believe the sum it has offered of £1,100 in compensation for that is appropriate and fair in 
the circumstances. Mr W should contact Phoenix if he wishes to accept that sum. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 December  2020.
