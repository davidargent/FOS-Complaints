K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains PayPal Europe Sarl &Cie, SCA will not refund some  disputed transactions.
background
Mr S complained to PayPal about eight transactions made from his account  to two different 
recipients.  Two payments  to MR were made on 30th April and 7th May 2018.  Mr S raised a 
dispute about these on 7th June.
Six payments were made to LC on 7th June,  10th, 12th and 15th July 2018.  Mr S raised these 
disputes on 7th June and 15th July respectively.
Mr S told PayPal  he didnt recognise these  transactions and neither did he know the 
recipients.  But  on 16th July, PayPal told him it was holding him liable for the payments.
The complaint was brought to this service before PayPal had issued its final response.  It did 
this on 24th September and simply said it had found no evidence  of unauthorised access to 
Mr Ss account and was therefore rejecting the complaint.
When our investigator looked  at Mr Ss complaint, he thought PayPal could have  done  more.  
He didnt think the transactions had been authorised  and so he asked PayPal to refund 
them.  Mr S agreed with this, but PayPal didnt and asked  that an ombudsman consider the 
complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint  and based on what  I have seen, I will be 
asking PayPal to refund these transactions.
I have to make a decision based on what I think  is most likely to have happened  here.   If I 
think its more likely  than not that Mr S did not authorise these transactions, then PayPal 
must refund them.
I am satisfied Mr Ss genuine account was used  to make these payments  so I need to 
make a finding on whether I think he consented  to the payments  being made.
I dont think he did consent  for the following reasons:
-Mr S says he doesnt know a MR and LC.  His account is corroborated by the fact 
that he told PayPal  on 7th June that he didnt know a LC.  I think it is unlikely he 
would continue to make payments to this individual  having  told PayPal he didnt know  
her;
-Mr Ss password was re-set on numerous  occasions during the period of the disputed 
transactions.  PayPal  say he should  have been  aware of these resets  because  he 
would have received an email  each time.   I cant be satisfied he did  but I think  it is 
unlikely Mr S himself would have reset his password so many  times;
-PayPal say the devices used to make the transactions  included several different 
mobile phones.   Mr S says he only made  payments  via a computer and on one 
occasion, using  a phone;
Ref: DRN22311812-The IP addresses for the transactions were  not local to Mr S and had not been used 
on his account  before from the information provided  by PayPal.  Our investigator 
thought one of the IP addresses recorded  came  from abroad  but I dont think  thats 
right.  They all appear to be from the UK but not local to Mr S;
I do have concerns that Mr S didnt pick up on the earlier transactions for some  weeks. I am 
also concerned  that he may have received emails from PayPal each time his password was 
reset and does  not appear  to have queried this.  He continued to use his PayPal  account  
throughout the time of the disputed transactions  and PayPal has told us he would have 
been prompted about a password  change through this process too.
But as I set out at the start of my findings   I need  to decide what is more  likely than not to 
have happened.  I dont  need to be sure.  So, for all these reasons given above, I think it is 
more likely than not that Mr S did not authorise these transactions.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
PayPal Europe  Sarl &Cie, SCA must  refund the transactions which  amounted to £1600.  It 
must also pay 8% interest on this figure  from the date of loss until the date of settlement.
In addition, it must pay a further £100 for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 October  2020.
