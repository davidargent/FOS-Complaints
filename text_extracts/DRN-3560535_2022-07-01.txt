The complaint
Mr B complains about credit provided to him by Klarna Bank AB (publ) (Klarna) for a 
purchase he made in July 2019.
What happened
In 2019 Mr B says he was looking at ways of increasing his earning potential and came
across an advertisement, on social media, for training courses provided by a company that I
will call H.
Mr B says he sent H his contact details and he received a call back from it. He then signed
up for a course that cost £900.00 funded by way of running-account credit with Klarna (with
a credit limit of £930.00).
On 11 July 2019 H sent Mr B a receipt for his purchased course. This purchase receipt,
which Mr B accepts he received, said:
Thank you for your payment for your [course]
Thanks for your payment.
Please be aware this payment [£900.00] has not come out of your account yet, but will come
out in monthly payments of £80.80 over 12 months. The first payment will be required in 30
Days time from todays date [11 July 2019]. You will receive an email from Klarna and you
must log into your Klarna account to make a manual payment.
The Buyer may cancel any order for Goods for any reason up to 14 days from booking
unless the training has already been booked and confirmed
Cancelation fee requests after 14 days; a cancelation fee of 40% course fees will apply. The
right to cancel does not apply if the consumer has already confirmed dates for the booking.
On 11 July 2019 Klarna says it sent Mr B his counter signed credit agreement.
The credit agreement said:
You have a right under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to withdraw from this Agreement
without having to give any reason. To exercise your right of withdrawal you must give notice
of your intention to withdraw from the agreement before the end of 14 days
You must repay the amount of credit provided under this Agreement, together with interest,
without delay
Please note that withdrawing from your Agreement with us will not terminate your purchase
agreement(s) with the Supplier(s). Your rights in relation to your agreements with Suppliers
are governed by those agreements and the legislation relating to them.
In August 2019 Klarna says it sent Mr B a notice to say his monthly statement was ready,
and payment was due by 31 August 2019.
In August 2019 Klarna says it sent Mr B his August statement. The balance was £908.60
(£900.00 purchase plus £8.60 interest). Mr B was requested to pay (by 31 August 2019) a
minimum payment of £17.60 or an interest-saver payment of £80.80.
In September 2019 Klarna says it sent Mr B a notice to say that his monthly statement was
ready, payment was due by 30 September 2019 and payment for August 2019 hadnt been
received.
In September 2019 Klarna says it sent Mr B his September statement. The balance was
£931.27 (£908.60 previous balance plus £12.00 fee plus £10.67 interest). Mr B was
requested to pay (by 30 September 2019) a minimum payment of £49.27 (£31.67 plus
£17.60) or an interest-saver payment of £173.60 (£80.80 plus £80.80 plus £12.00).
In October 2019 Klarna says it sent Mr B a notice to say that his monthly statement was
ready, payment was due by 31 October 2019 and payment for September 2019 hadnt been
received.
In October 2019 Klarna says it sent Mr B his October statement. The balance was £953.61
(£931.27 previous balance plus £12.00 fee plus £10.34 interest). Mr B was requested to pay
(by 31 October 2019) a minimum payment of £80.61 (£31.34 plus £49.27) or an interest-
saver payment of £266.41 (£80.80 plus £80.80 plus £80.80 plus £12.00 plus £12.00
plus 1p).
In November 2019 Klarna says it sent Mr B a notice to say that it hadnt received the
minimum payment for the last three monthly statements and a default notice would be sent
by post. And to avoid termination of his account Mr B needed to pay at least the minimum
amount requested in the default notice.
In November 2019 Klarna sent Mr B a default notice, which Mr B accepts he received. Under
cover of this notice Klarna said (amongst other things) that if it didnt receive payment of
£112.47 by 30 November 2019 it reserved the right to terminate the agreement and demand
immediate repayment of the full amount outstanding.
Under cover of the same, Klarna sent Mr B his November statement. The balance was
£976.47 (£953.61 previous balance plus £12.00 fee plus £10.86 interest). Mr B was
requested to pay (by 30 November 2019) a minimum payment of £112.47 (£31.86 plus
£80.61).
On 14 November 2019, according to notes provided by Klarna, Mr B contacted it to say he
wanted contact details for H so he could cancel his order with it.
On 14 November 2019 H contacted Mr B to say that it was sorry to hear that he wanted to
cancel the course he had purchased in July 2019. It then went on to say that Mr B could
continue with the course or cancel at a cost of £360.00 (40% of £900.00) and it should let it
know what option he wanted to take up. Mr B didnt go back to H.
On 21 November 2019 Mr B wrote to Klarna. In summary he said:
English isnt his first language.
He felt pressured into purchasing the course by H and simply followed its instructions
when doing so.He understood the course would cost him approximately £80 per month based on
attendance.
He tried to cancel the course with H on or around 21 July 2019 as he had purchased
a (cheaper) course with another provider. However, he was unable to do so because
he had no phone number for H and its provided email address didnt accept incoming
messages.
He was unaware he had entered into a credit agreement (regulated by the Consumer
Credit Act 1974) with Klarna until he received its default notice.
Klarna gave him credit without any affordability assessment.
In early 2020, and having not received Mr Bs letter dated 21 November 2019, Klarna sent
Mr B a termination notice, which Mr B accepts he received.
In March 2020 Klarna received Mr Bs letter dated 21 November 2019. Following receipt of
this letter Klarna marked the purchase of £900 as being in dispute and asked Mr B, on a
number of occasions, for further information in respect of it.
On 24 April 2020 and having not received the further information it had requested from Mr B
Klarna moved the dispute marker from the purchase of £900.
On 17 June 2020 (not 2021 as previously stated) Klarna sent Mr B its final response letter 
(FRL). Under cover of this FRL Klarna explained it didnt believe it had done anything 
wrong.
Sometime in 2021, and having received nothing further from Mr B, Klarna sold the debt on to 
a third party.
Mr Bs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that
Klarna had indeed done nothing wrong.
Mr B didnt agree with the investigators view and so his complaint was passed to me
for review and decision. I issued a provisional decision on this case in June 2022. In 
summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Mr B has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in 
their entirety. However, I trust that Mr B will not take the fact that my findings focus 
on what I consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in 
considerably less detail, as a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to 
address every point raised. The purpose of my decision is to set out my conclusions 
and reasons for reaching them.
I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
Mr B says he was pressured into signing up to the course by H. However, on the 
balance of probabilities, Im not persuaded this was the case. I say this because it 
was Mr B who approached H to say he was interested in the course that he ultimately 
purchased (rather than H cold calling him) and Mr B was always free to hang up the 
call that was made to him by H if he didnt wish to proceed.Mr B says he was unaware he had entered into a credit agreement with Klarna until
November 2019 when he received a default notice from it.
I accept I cant say for certain that Mr B is incorrect in his submission that he received
nothing from Klarna until November 2019, when he received its default notice. But 
Klarna has provided our service with a copy of the agreement, a number of monthly 
statements and a number of statement/payment reminders (amongst other things). 
And having examined these Im satisfied they were all correctly addressed to Mr B 
(whether sent by post or email) and Ive seen nothing that would lead me to conclude 
they werent sent or that they were returned to Klarna undelivered. Therefore, on the 
balance of probabilities, Im not persuaded that Mr B was unaware that he had 
entered into a credit agreement until November 2019 as he submits.
Mr B says he tried to cancel the course with H on, or around, 21 July 2019 but he 
was unable to do so.
Mr B says he had no phone number for H, but I can see that one (together with a full 
postal address) was provided to him by H under cover of its receipt dated 
11 July 2019. Im also conscious that Mr B was successful in contacting H in 
November 2019. Therefore, on the balance of probabilities, Im not persuaded that 
Mr B tried to cancel the course with H on, or around, 21 July 2019 as he submits. For 
the sake of completeness, I would also add that Ive seen nothing that would lead me 
to conclude that Mr B contacted Klarna before November 2019 either.
Notwithstanding that Mr B submits he was unaware till November 2019 that he had 
entered into a credit agreement with Klarna, he also submits that Klarna failed to 
carry out adequate affordability checks before granting him the credit.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible 
lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on 
our website.
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching 
questions that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Bs 
complaint in this respect.
These two questions are:
Did Klarna complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr B 
would be able to repay the credit without experiencing significant adverse 
consequences?
- If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
- If not, would those checks have shown that Mr B wouldve been able to do 
so?
Did Klarna act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
The rules and regulations in place required Klarna to carry out a reasonable and
proportionate assessment of Mr Bs ability to make the repayments under his 
agreement. This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability 
assessment or affordability check.Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in 
this context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
Klarna has said that:
The application was accepted on [11 July 2019]for a purchase of £900. [Mr B was] 
a new consumer who had a successful individual match to the bureau data and had a 
credit score high enough for us to accept [him]. [Mr B] also passed our credit checks 
which include[d] having no recent bankruptcies, no county court judgements and no 
payday loans. [His] annual income was [declared as being] £12,500 which 
wedeemed enough to make [the credit] affordable... According to the data at the 
time of application [Mr Bs] calculated monthly disposable income was £256.85.
I think these checks were proportionate given the value of the credit (£930.00) 
granted and the monthly repayment required (£80.80 or £17.60 a month).
Taking everything into account, Ive come to the conclusion that the checks Klarna 
carried out on this occasion were proportionate and there wasnt enough of concern 
in the information it gathered which should have prompted it to make further 
enquiries of Mr B before granting him the credit that it did.
It follows I dont think Klarna was wrong to grant the credit it did to Mr B. And I 
havent found any evidence that it acted unfairly or unreasonably towards him in 
some other way.
I appreciate Mr B will be disappointed. But given what I say above Im satisfied that 
Klarna, in the particular circumstances of this case, has done nothing wrong.
Mr B has also raised concerns that his letter of 21 November 2019 didnt receive a 
response from Klarna for several months. But Im satisfied that this was simply 
because it wasnt received by Klarna until March 2020. And once this letter was 
received by Klarna it responded in a timely and appropriate manner, including 
making further enquiries of Mr B before sending a FRL in June 2020.
But even if I wasnt of this view Im not persuaded that this in itself has caused Mr B a 
loss or prejudiced him in any other way.
For the sake of completeness, I would add that Mr B might want to consider liaising 
with the third party that has purchased his debt from Klarna and with H about the 
possibility of securing some sort of refund in respect of the course he purchased. But 
of course, this is ultimately a decision for Mr B.
Klarna didnt respond to my provisional findings.
Mr B responded to my provisional findings to say that he was considering paying the third 
party, on to whom the debt had been sold, 40% but provided nothing else for my 
consideration.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Given Klarna didnt respond to my provisional findings and given Mr B has provided nothing 
materially new for my consideration, I see no good reason to depart from my provisional 
findings and I now confirm them as final.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2022.
