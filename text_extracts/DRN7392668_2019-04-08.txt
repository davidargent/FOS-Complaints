K821x#15complaint
Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC (CEN), trading as Pounds to Pocket and QuickQuid, lent 
to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr H had a number of loans from CEN. Ive set out some of the information CEN  provided 
about these loans in the appendix to this decision.
An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part. She didnt 
think CEN was right to have approved  any of the loans from and including loan 3 onwards.
CEN didnt  agree with the adjudicator. But it did agree to settle the complaint in the way she 
proposed for loans  4-6, 8, 9, 13 and 14 (it had already made  an offer on loans 6 and 14 in its 
final response letter). Mr H declined to accept this offer.  The complaint has therefore  been 
passed to me to decide.
Theres been no further dispute  about  loans 1 and 2 and QuickQuid hasnt withdrawn its 
offer in respect of the loans mentioned above.  So Ill only be considering the loans still in 
dispute  loans 3, 7, 10-12 and 15-17  (including  the top-ups).
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
When CEN first lent to Mr H the regulator was the Office of Fair Trading (OFT)  and relevant 
guidance included  its guidance on irresponsible lending (ILG). From 1 April 2014 onwards 
the regulator was the Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA) and relevant regulations  and 
guidance included  its Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC). The ILG and CONC contained 
similar guidance for lenders about responsible lending. 
Among other  things, the regulations said lenders should carry out affordability  checks  which 
are proportionate in the circumstances of the loan. The regulations also said repayments 
should be sustainable (i.e. repayable from the borrowers income or savings)  and that 
lenders shouldnt allow a borrower to enter into consecutive credit agreements  where it 
would be unsustainable  to do so. 
The same guidance  also noted that payday  loans are not appropriate for borrowing over long 
periods of time as their purpose is to help deal with a temporary cash  flow problem 
(ILG 6.25 and CONC 6.7.21-22G).
With the above in mind,  Ive considered whether  CEN carried out proportionate checks 
before lending. If I find it didnt, Ill go on to think  about what proportionate checks would 
likely have shown. Ive also considered whether the pattern of lending in itself was such  that 
CEN ought to have  realised further  lending  would be unsustainable or otherwise harmful  for 
Mr H.
loan 3
Ref: DRN73926682There had been  a substantial gap between  loans 1 and 2 and so I consider  loan 2 was the 
start of a new chain  of lending. So loan 3 is the second loan in the second chain of lending.
There was a gap of only one day between loan 2 and loan 3 and the amount Mr H borrowed 
was £550, repayable in a single repayment of £653. Mr Hs income was recorded  as £2,500 
a month. CEN didnt  ask Mr H about  his expenditure and although  it carried  out credit checks 
it hasnt provided the results of these.
The largest repayment was over 25% of Mr Hs declared income of £2,500. I think that was 
too high for CEN to assume it was likely to be sustainably affordable  without looking at 
Mr Hs other  regular expenditure and his short-term and regular credit commitments. So 
I dont think CEN carried out proportionate checks before approving  loan 3.
Our adjudicator set out in detail what she thought  CEN wouldve found out had it asked Mr H 
about his usual living costs. Ive independently  reviewed these figures and agree with them. 
These came to £1,080 for his mortgage, council  tax, food and other regular  bills. His regular 
financial commitments  were  £1,180  a month.  Its possible  some  of this should  be excluded  
as this figure included  £450 of transfers to his partner and Im not persuaded this is 
something Mr H wouldve thought to tell CEN about.  If I were to exclude  those transfers,  
Mr Hs regular credit commitments were a little over £700. Mr H also owed a little over £200 
to another short-term  lender. Overall,  Mr Hs total monthly commitments were around  £2,000  
 leaving him with disposable income  of about £500  a month.
On this basis, I dont think  CEN  wouldve approved loan 3, had it carried out proportionate 
checks, as the largest payment of £653 exceeded Mr Hs disposable  income.
loan 7
For loan 7, I think proportionate checks wouldve included CEN asking Mr H about his 
income and expenditure (including his living costs, regular and short-term credit  
commitments). And given how long Mr H had been borrowing for and how many loans he 
had, I think CEN ought to have also taken steps to independently verify Mr Hs income and 
expenditure. As CEN  didnt do this, Ive taken into account information from Mr Hs bank 
statements to decide what I think proportionate checks  would likely have shown.
Had CEN asked for proof of Mr Hs income, I think it wouldve likely seen it was about what 
he declared  £2,500  a month. His usual  living costs were much like Ive set out above for 
loan 3 at around  £1,080 a month.  His regular financial commitments  were around £1,100 a 
month  this time Ive included the £450  regular transfer to his partner as I think  its likely 
CEN wouldve become  aware of it had it asked  for proof of his expenditure.
So taking into account Mr Hs regular living  costs  and regular  financial commitments,  I dont 
think proportionate checks wouldve indicated that loan 7 was sustainably affordable for Mr H 
as the largest  payments were  £500-£800.
loans 10-12, 15-17 (including  top-ups)
Mr H continued to borrow from CEN without a significant break for a substantial  period of 
time. Our adjudicator thought that the pattern of borrowing alone was enough to suggest  the 
lending wasnt sustainably  affordable for Mr H.
Ref: DRN73926683Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, Ive also thought about 
whether the overall pattern of lending increased  Mr Hs indebtedness  in a way that was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful. If I think the pattern  of lending alone was enough for 
CEN to have  become aware the lending wasnt sustainable or was otherwise harmful, I dont 
think it is necessary to recreate individual, proportionate  affordability  checks  for these loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached.  And 
was reached by the time of loan 10, if not before. I say this because:
Mr H wasnt  really making any inroads  into breaking the cycle  of borrowing  and was 
in effect paying large amount of interest to service his debt over a long period of time
the amounts  Mr H was borrowing were  generally  not decreasing, and on the 
occasions when  they did decrease  Mr H would  often borrow large  amounts again  
shortly after repaying  the smaller amounts. Where the loans do decrease (e.g. loan 
10) Mr H still goes  on to borrows large amounts overall in a short period of time.  For 
example, loans 10-13 were all approved within about a month and Mr H borrowed 
£2,500 in this time,  the equivalent of a months  salary. So CEN  ought to have 
realised it was likely his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
Mr H took out a large number of top-ups on loan 15 and a large  number of 
drawdowns on his FlexCredit  account, which supports that, even towards the end of 
the lending relationship,  he wasnt freeing himself of the need  to keep borrowing
I think that Mr H lost out because CEN continued  to provide borrowing from loan 10 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Hs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im upholding  Mr Hs complaint about  loans  10-12 and 15-17 because  the overall pattern 
of lending increased his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise  harmful 
and he lost out as a result.
Ref: DRN73926684putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 3-17a
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 3-9 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 10 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  from loan 10 onwards  should be removed  from 
Mr Hs credit file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  CEN  to take off tax from this interest.  CEN  must  give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right be taking the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 May 2019.

The table below is included for information only and to provide a simple overview of the lending  
history. Some  figures have been rounded.
Notes:
Loan  1 was an instalment loan with a contractual term of 364 days, repayable in 12 monthly  
instalments of about £189. The loan was provided under CENs  Pounds to Pocket brand.
Loan  16 was an open-ended agreement, known as a QuickQuid FlexCredit  account. Mr H 
was able to make  drawdowns up to a credit limit and repay  those  drawdowns in up to ten 
monthly instalments. The credit limit was £1,500   and the largest contractual  minimum 
monthly payment (assuming the full amount was drawn down  at once)  was about  £580.  Mr H 
made 15 drawdowns totalling £3,361. Mr Hs FlexCredit account was terminated by 
QuickQuid on 15 December 2014   the FlexCredit product was due to be withdrawn from all 
customers as of 1 January 2015.
The remaining loans were all QuickQuid payday loans, repayable  in 1-3 payments. Where 
there is more than one payment, the final payment is capital and interest and the first 
payment(s) interest only. Some of the loans were topped-up  this is where extra  funds are 
borrowed during the course of the credit agreement. Top-ups are denoted  with both a letter 
and a number in my table.
