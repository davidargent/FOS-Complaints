The complaint
Mr B complains about delays and poor service he received from PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA (PayPal) when trying to recall two payments. 
What happened
On 3 January 2020 Mr B made a £3,000 payment from his PayPal account to his current 
account. Mr B made a £1,000 payment to the same account on 4 January 2020. But Mr Bs 
bank had changed the details of its accounts and the funds were sent to its old processing 
partner (A). 
Mr B contacted PayPal and asked it to recall his funds. PayPals bank attempted to recall the 
funds without success. Mr B contacted PayPal, his bank and is processing partner to try and 
locate his funds. 
On 28 February 2020 A responded to a complaint Mr B had made and said it had attempted 
to return the £3,000 payment to PayPal but it had been sent back. A advised that the 
information supplied in the £3,000 recall request was wrong and said it hadnt received a 
request for the £1,000 payment at all. A confirmed the £3,000 payment was being returned 
to PayPal. 
Mr B went on to refer his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
were able to arrange for Mr Bs funds to be returned to his PayPal account in May 2020. The 
investigator looked at Mr Bs complaint and upheld it, asking PayPal to pay him £100 
because of delays and problems with the way his recall requests had been handled. He 
thought PayPal couldve done more and contacted A directly to provide the information it 
requested after the recall request was declined. PayPal didnt accept and said it had tried to 
assist Mr B in retrieving his funds. As PayPal asked to appeal, Mr Bs complaint has been 
passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Mr B was so concerned as the sums involved here were significant. Mr 
B has pointed out that he was without £4,000 for around five months which was very 
distressing. Im really pleased to see that our investigator was able to liaise with the various 
parties involved and that Mr Bs funds have been returned to him. 
Ill start by talking about Mr Bs losses. Hes asked for 8% interest on the £4,000 for the 
period it wasnt available to him. But I would normally award that type of compensation 
where someone has lost out on interest they would likely have received from an investment. 
Thats not whats happened here. Mr B was attempting to transfer funds he held within his 
PayPal account to his current account. Whilst I note the comments Mr B has made to our 
investigator, I havent been persuaded that I can award interest on the funds. 
Our investigator upheld the complaint on the basis that he felt PayPal could have done more 
to assist Mr B in getting his money back. I agree. I note the evidence of contact with A that 
PayPal has forwarded, but I think its clear that Mr B was caught in a difficult position as both 
businesses claimed the appropriate action had been taken. But this complaint relates to 
PayPals actions and I agree with the investigator that it could have done more to help Mr B. 
PayPal has confirmed that after a recall request failed for the £3,000 payment a message 
was received from A. The message advised that the recall had been declined and asked for 
further contact. But PayPal hasnt sent in anything to show that message was followed up 
with A. In addition, PayPal has forwarded various messages it says show it tried to help Mr B 
but I think the level of contact and information provided was poor. I agree with the 
investigator in that PayPal could have done more to help Mr B get his money back. 
 Im satisfied that PayPals actions did cause inconvenience to Mr B and I agree with their 
view that £100 fairly reflects the impact on him. 
In response to the investigator, Mr B asked me to consider increasing the award to around 
£500 to reflect the long standing nature of this issue. I do understand why Mr B is upset and 
that he was without his funds for an extended period. But I dont think its fair to place 
responsibility for the payments initially going missing on PayPal and there was always going 
to be a degree of inconvenience getting them back. In addition, it does appear that 
somewhat inconsistent information has been provided by each of the businesses involved. 
Ive only looked at PayPals actions in relation to this complaint. Having done so, Im 
satisfied that £100 is fair in all the circumstances. 
Ive considered the points raised by both parties. Having done so, Im going to endorse the 
investigators recommendation to uphold this complaint and for PayPal to pay Mr B £100 for 
the distress and inconvenience caused. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay 
Mr B £100. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 November 2020.
