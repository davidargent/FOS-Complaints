The complaint
Ms M complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their failure to process a refund 
into her bank account correctly.
What happened
Ms M held an account with PayPal, which she used to make a purchase with a retailer, who 
Ill refer to as X. In March 2022, she received a refund of £986 into this account from X. So, 
PayPal processed this refund back onto the card linked to her account.
But Ms M says this refund wasnt received into the bank account linked to the card. And she 
explained the card itself had expired. She explained to PayPal that her bank, who Ill refer to 
as N, had stated no refund had ever been received and so, she wanted the refund to be 
processed again.
But PayPal provided Ms M with an ARN number, linked to the refund transaction, which they 
thought would help N locate the payment. And they explained they had processed the refund 
correctly and so, wouldnt process it again. Ms M was unhappy about this, so she raised a 
complaint.
Ms M thought PayPal had failed to process the refund correctly, as she hadnt received an 
email to confirm the refund. So, she thought PayPal should refund her the £986 as well as 
compensate her for the upset shed been caused.
PayPal responded to the complaint and didnt uphold it. They thought they had processed 
the refund correctly, as they had done with other refunds received from X previously. And as 
they hadnt received the refund amount back into Ms Ms account, they were satisfied it had 
been received by N. So, they thought N were responsible for the loss of the funds and so, 
they didnt think they needed to do anything more. Ms M remained unhappy with this 
response, so she referred her complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They didnt think theyd seen 
any evidence to show PayPal had made an error when processing the refund. And as the 
refund hadnt been returned to PayPal, which N wouldve been obliged to do if there was an 
error, they didnt think PayPal were responsible for the missing funds. So, they didnt think 
PayPal needed to do anything more.
Ms M didnt agree, and she reiterated her belief that it was PayPal, and not N, responsible 
as she didnt receive an email confirming the refund. As Ms M didnt agree, the complaint 
has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the upset this complaint has had on Ms M. Its not in dispute that 
Ms M is owed a £986 refund from X. And as this refund was paid to PayPal by X directly, I 
can understand why Ms M feels PayPal are responsible for the refunds whereabouts and 
more importantly, the upset shes been caused having been without the funds for an 
extended period of time.
But for me to say PayPal should pay Ms M the refund amount, plus any additional interest or 
compensation, Id first need to be satisfied that, on the balance of probability, they are the 
party responsible for the lost refund. And in this situation, I dont think they are.
When deciding who I think is responsible for the lost refund, Ive thought about what Id 
expect PayPal to do and more importantly, which parts of the process they are able to 
control and influence.
In this situation, Id expect PayPal to receive the funds from X and ensure they are sent to 
the correct bank details they hold for Ms M. And I think they have in this situation.
I can see on 8 March 2022; the funds were received into Ms Ms PayPal account from X. 
And I can see on the same day, the funds were transferred out to Ms Ms account using the 
card details linked to the account. Ive also seen that PayPal followed this same process for 
earlier refunds from X, where Ms M did receive the refund. So, I think PayPal followed the 
process Id expect, and I cant see that theyve made any errors here.
While I recognise Ms Ms card details related to an expired card, PayPal wouldnt have 
known this before processing the refund into Ms Ms account. And N have confirmed any 
refund made towards an expired card would still be received into her active account. So, I 
dont think PayPal taking this action is likely to have caused the funds to go missing.
And as PayPal didnt receive the funds back into the account following the refund, which N 
wouldve been required to do if there was an issue, Im satisfied the funds most likely 
reached their intended destination. And most importantly, I dont think PayPal had any 
responsibility for, or were able to influence or control, the processing of these funds after 
theyd left Ms Ms account with them.
Because of this, I dont think the missing funds are the responsibility of PayPal. Nor do I 
think I can say these funds went missing due to anything PayPal did wrong. Because of this, 
I dont think it would be fair for me to say they should cover the cost of the reimbursement to 
Ms M and so, I dont think they need to do anything more.
I understand this isnt the outcome Ms M was hoping for, or potentially the one she feels is 
most likely to be correct. I recognise Ms M didnt receive an e-mail which is likely to have 
aroused suspicion, but I dont think this lack of an internal e-mail is evidence a transaction 
didnt take place, when I can see the funds left the account. In a transactional dispute such 
as this one, where Im unable to say for certain exactly where and when the funds went 
missing, I must base my decision on logic and what I think is most likely to have happened. 
And this is what Ive done on this occasion.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Ms Ms complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 November 2022.
