The complaint
Mr P complains that his international payment was delayed by National Westminster Bank 
Plc (NatWest).
What happened
Mr P asked NatWest to send a payment of INR49000 (rupees) to India. His account was 
debited with £557.81 on 19 May 2020. The charge was £15. It was received on 26 May 
2020.
Mr P complained. He said he was advised the payment to a member of his family would be 
received the next day  and it wasnt. Also, the amount received by the beneficiary was only 
INR48174. This was very embarrassing for him. 
NatWest said the payment was sent by them within a day - on 20 May 2020, following some 
security checks. So  theyd followed their processes. They refunded the charge paid by Mr 
P of £15.
Mr P brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said NatWest had acted fairly. They made 
the payment within the timescales set out in their terms and conditions (1-2 days). The delay 
was down to the overseas intermediary bank used by NatWest, so the payment wasnt 
received until 26 May 2020. She said INR49000 was sent by NatWest, so any difference in 
the amount received was due to charges made by the intermediary bank.
Mr P asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P has complained that he needed the payment to get to India quickly  it wasnt, and this 
caused him great embarrassment in the eyes of his family  which I can appreciate. He says 
he was assured it would get there the next day. And when it eventually arrived, less than 
INR49000 was received  only INR48174.
Ive looked at NatWests terms and conditions. They say they would make payments to the 
Rest of the World (outside Europe) within 1-2 business days  which they did, as it was 
made the day after Mr Ps instructions. Also, NatWest wanted to ask some security 
questions about the payment. This was to protect customers in general from fraud  which 
theyre entitled to do. So, the payment was sent by NatWest after these checks were done  
on 20 May 2020. We asked NatWest about why the payment wasnt then received until 26 
May 2020. And - the delay that occurred was down to the overseas bank that NatWest used 
to complete the payment  its normal for a UK bank to have to use another bank to do this. 
Unfortunately, NatWest have little control over that aspect of the transaction. 
I looked at the charges for the payment. NatWests terms say that their charge was £15 
excluding Agents charges  so in other words, the overseas bank can also make their own 
charges. And thats what happened here  and why less than INR49000 was received. 
Mr P told us he was assured the payment would be sent immediately and received the next 
day. Ive listened to the call between him and NatWest when various security questions were 
asked. Mr P then asked if the payment would be sent straight away. NatWests call handler 
said he would ask for it to be released today  but in all fairness, he didnt commit to when 
the money would be received in India. Ideally, I think that he couldve gone further and 
explained more about the process and the involvement of another, overseas bank in the 
process  so Mr P understood what was going to happen. 
But  overall, having reviewed what happened here, I think NatWest acted fairly and 
reasonably. Theyve refunded the charge of £15 paid by Mr P, which I think was the right 
thing to do.
So  and I can appreciate that Mr P will be disappointed by my decision, I wont be asking 
NatWest to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 May 2021.
