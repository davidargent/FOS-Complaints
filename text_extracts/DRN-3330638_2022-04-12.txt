The complaint
Mr A is unhappy that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited (VWFS) terminated the 
hire purchase agreement he had with them. 
What happened
On 22 January 2020 Mr A was supplied with a used car through a hire purchase agreement 
with VWFS. Mr A paid an advance payment of £3,000 and the agreement was for £27,080 
over 49 months; with 48 monthly payments of £417.45 and a final payment of £12,920 if Mr 
A wanted to keep the car. 
Mr A missed the payment for June 2020, and he didnt pay this until August 2020. He then 
missed the payments for October 2020, December 2020, and January 2021, clearing these 
arrears on 13 February 2021. The payments due for February and March 2020 were also 
missed, with Mr A clearing these arrears on 1 May 2020. However, the payments due for 
April to September 2021 werent paid. Because of this, VWFS terminated the agreement on 
25 September 2021 with arrears totalling £2,504.70. On the same day, Mr A paid VWFS 
£2,087.25 to partially clear the arrears.
Mr A complained to VWFS, saying that he hadnt received any communication about the 
arrears. And, after clearing the arrears, they still terminated the agreement. VWFS said 
theyd sent Mr A several warnings, and they hadnt heard from him. So, they thought theyd 
terminated the agreement in line with their warnings.
Mr A wasnt happy with this, and he brought his complaint to us for investigation.
Our investigator said that Mr A was over six months in arrears when the agreement was 
terminated. And the payment he made after termination only cleared part of the arrears, 
whereas he was required to clear the full balance at that stage. So, he didnt think the 
payment stopped the termination.
The investigator also said that, while VWFS didnt have a valid phone number for Mr A, they 
notified him by email and post of the arrears, the default, and the termination. And, as they 
were required to provide this information to Mr A in writing, he didnt think VWFS had done 
anything wrong. 
Mr A didnt agree with the investigator. And hes asked for an ombudsman to make a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have reached the same overall conclusions as the investigator, and for 
broadly the same reasons. If I havent commented on any specific point, its because I dont 
believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
In considering this complaint Ive had regard to the relevant law and regulations; any 
regulators rules, guidance and standards, codes of practice, and what I consider was good 
industry practice at the time. Mr A was supplied with a car under a hire purchase agreement. 
This is a regulated consumer credit agreement which means were able to investigate 
complaints about it. 
Ive seen the statement for Mr As account, and its clear from this he was in arrears from 
June 2020 onwards. And, at the point the account was terminated, his account was six 
months in arrears.
Between 7 July 2020 and 21 August 2021, VWFS sent Mr A 11 arrears letters. VWFS also 
sent him a default notice on 26 January 2021. This asked him to clear the outstanding 
arrears by 22 February 2021. Which he did on 13 February 2021. A further default notice 
was sent on 29 April 2021, asking for further arrears to be cleared by 22 May 2021. And this 
wasnt done. All these letters were sent to the same address we have on file for Mr A.
VWFS also sent Mr A an email (to the same email address we have on file for him) on 24 
August 2021. In this email they said theyd been trying to get in touch with him and asked 
him to call them back. Mr A didnt respond to this email.
Given the above, even though VWFS had the wrong phone number, Im satisfied that they 
provided him with sufficient information about the arrears on his account. And I think its 
highly unlikely that all the letters and the email werent delivered. So, Im satisfied that Mr A 
was reasonably aware of the situation on his account and what action VWFS would take if 
the arrears werent cleared.
As a result, Im also satisfied that VWFS acted reasonably by terminating Mr As account on 
25 September 2021. And I dont think that him partially clearing the arrears after the account 
had been terminated alters this. So, I wont be asking VWFS to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons explained, I dont uphold Mr As complaint about Volkswagen Financial 
Services (UK) Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 May 2022.
