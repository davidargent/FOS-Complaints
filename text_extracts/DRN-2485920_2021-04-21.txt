The complaint
Mrs C complains that TSB Bank plc wont refund to her any of the money that she paid for a 
holiday. 
What happened
Mrs C used her TSB Bank credit card in July 2019 to pay Â£2,358 for an overseas holiday for 
her and her family. There were some issues with the use of the sun-loungers around the 
pool at the hotel so she complained to the hotel, the travel company and then made a claim 
to TSB bank under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
It said that a breach of contract or misrepresentation had not been proven and that it was 
unable to raise a chargeback as the issues related to the quality of accommodation. Mrs C 
wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service and says that she should 
receive compensation for financial loss, inconvenience and distress. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She said that she 
hadnt seen enough evidence that there was a breach of contract or misrepresentation for 
which TSB Bank would be liable.
Mrs C has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says she was 
offered a voucher but hasnt received it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
TSB Bank issued its first response to Mrs Cs complaint in August 2019 and it said 
that no breach of contract or misrepresentation had been proven as the original 
transaction and documents were in the name of the travel agent and any breach of 
contract would be between Mrs C and the holiday company;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Cs complaint about TSB Bank, I must be satisfied that 
section 75 applies, that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
holiday company and that TSB Banks response to her claim under section 75 wasnt 
fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Cs claim under 
section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
its clear that the issues that Mrs C has described about the use of the sun-loungers 
around the pool at the hotel impacted her enjoyment of the holiday and caused her 
distress and inconvenience  and I sympathise with her for that;
even if section 75 did apply in these circumstances, Im not persuaded that the 
hotels failure to properly apply the pool rules or the issues that shes described are 
enough to be a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company;
TSB issued another final response letter to Mrs C in March 2020 in which it said that 
it would be unable to raise a chargeback for her dispute;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made - but if 
the right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and, if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
I dont consider that there was a reasonable prospect of a successful chargeback 
claim in these circumstances as I consider that the issue didnt give rise to a 
chargeback claim and that, if a claim had been made, it would have been 
successfully defended;
I dont consider that TSB Bank acted incorrectly by not making a chargeback claim in 
these circumstances;
Mrs C says that she was offered a voucher that she hasnt received  but Ive seen 
no evidence to show that the voucher was offered to her by TSB Bank and I dont 
consider that it has any liability to her for that voucher;
I consider that TSB Bank has responded to Mrs C claim fairly and reasonably in 
these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require to reimburse it to refund 
to Mrs C any of the money that she paid for the holiday, to pay her any other 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2021.
