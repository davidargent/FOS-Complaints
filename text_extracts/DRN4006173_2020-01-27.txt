K821x#15complaint
Miss C complains that TSB Bank  plc made  several mistakes when she tried to carry out a 
credit card balance transfer.
background
Miss C says in November 2018  she transferred  £1,600 from her TSB credit  card account to 
another provider  but it was returned.  She tried again in December and it seemed as though  
everything was alright until TSB recalled the money  in March 2019.
TSB said itd had a number of IT issues and it became aware that some  balance transfers 
hadnt been carried out. It said that on 19 November 2018 Miss C completed a £1,600  
balance transfer  with another provider. The transfer was rejected on 11 December 2018 and 
re-credited to her account. It wrote to her the following day and offered her £25. It said Miss 
C contacted it again  and it paid her £100  compensation for any distress and inconvenience 
itd caused her. And it paid £19 to cover expenses. On 12 July 2019  it reviewed Miss Cs 
complaint and paid her a further  £31.
In response to further requests for information from this Service  TSB said the original  
balance transfer  on 19 November 2018  failed.  It resent the balance transfer on 28 
November. It said it made  a bank transfer reversal on Miss Cs TSB card on 11 December 
2018. But it didnt  recall the funds  from the other provider until 4 March 2019.  In the 
meantime on 15 December 2018 Miss C tried again  to make a balance transfer with her 
other provider which  was successful. 
Our investigator didnt  think TSB had done enough to resolve Miss Cs complaint. So he 
thought it should pay her another £200  compensation.
TSB disagreed. It said itd already paid Miss C £175.  And it said shed benefitted from having 
the additional funds with her other  provider  for three months. It thought she shouldve  been 
aware that it hadnt  recalled the £1,600 in December.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Miss C originally contacted TSB on 28 November to ask why the balance  transfer  wasnt 
showing on the bank  statement  with her other provider.  TSB explained it was having IT 
problems and paid her £25 compensation. On 12 December  2018 it wrote to her to 
apologise and confirm itd paid her £25. It suggested  she contacted  it if she still wanted to 
make the transfer.
On 15 December 2018 Miss C contacted it again because she was still unhappy that the 
transfer hadnt taken place. TSB said again  it was having IT issues  and offered her £119. 
TSB arranged a new balance transfer  and the complaint was closed.
Ref: DRN40061732At the beginning  of March 2019 TSB recalled £1,600 from Miss Cs other provider. She 
contacted TSB on 12 March 2019.  TSB told us she was unhappy with the chain of events. 
It sent her a letter dated 12 July 2019  with an offer of £31 and an assurance  that the 
balance transfer has now been  processed  correctly meaning the issue  is now resolved. I 
dont think thats  enough. 
TSB said Miss C shouldve realised what the issue was and she benefitted from the 
additional funds  in her account  with the other provider. So it didnt think it should  do anything 
more. But I dont agree. TSB didnt make any attempt to explain to her why it took three 
months for it to recall the money. Its not for Miss C to try and work out how and why this has 
happened. She wanted an explanation and TSB didnt give it to her. 
Looking at the information TSB sent us I can see that after Miss C phoned it on 24 July 2019  
after she received  its offer of another £31 it seems  to have accepted that the issue still 
hadnt been resolved.
So I agree with the investigator that its fair and reasonable for TSB to pay her a further  £200  
for the distress and inconvenience this has caused  her.
my final decision
My decision  is that to put matters right TSB Bank plc must pay Miss C an additional  £200  
compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 February  2020.
