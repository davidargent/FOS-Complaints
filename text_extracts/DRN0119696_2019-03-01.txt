K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) are being  unreasonable  by 
not accepting  his documents as valid identification.
background
Mr M says hes held an account with PayPal for fifteen years  and used  it for purchases over 
800 times.  In July 2018, his account  was blocked  by PayPal. PayPal  told Mr M that he 
needed to provide proof of identity  to unblock the account. It explained they needed this 
information to comply with anti-money  laundering regulations (regulations). 
Mr M provided copies of his latest credit card statements and various  other documents.  
Whilst PayPal accepted these documents as proof  of his address they required  other  
documents to verify his identification, which Mr M said he couldnt provide.  Mr M was able to 
provide a Freedom Pass which does have his photo and an expiry date. PayPal declined to 
accept this as valid identification but did offer to accept a birth certification instead. Mr M was 
unable to provide  the documents PayPal asked for. And considered  his Freedom  Pass was 
suitable identification. As he remained  unhappy  with PayPals response, he referred his 
complaint to our service.
Our investigator didnt  think the complaint should be upheld. He considered PayPal had 
acted reasonably in asking  for proof of Mr Ms identity as part of its compliance obligations. 
And it had been  willing  to accept his birth certificate when he was unable to provide the other 
information it had initially asked for. 
Mr M disagreed with the investigators view. So the matter has been passed to me for a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And having  done so, Im not going to 
uphold Mr Ms complaint. Ill explain why. 
Let me start by saying  I know Mr M has raised  a number of points during his contact with this 
service and the business. Although I may not mention every point hes raised,  Ive 
considered everything  he has said but limited my findings to the areas  which impact on the 
outcome of the case.
On opening the account with PayPal, Mr M agreed to the terms in the user agreement which 
contains the following: PayPal reserves the right to request additional information from you, 
other than what is referred to in this Agreement, to allow it to comply with its anti-money  
laundering obligations. You agree to comply with any request for further information as we 
reasonably require to enable  us to comply with our anti-money laundering obligations. This 
may include, without  limitation, requiring you to fax, email or otherwise provide to us certain  
identification documents.
PayPal asked for documents such as a passport or driving licence for the purpose  of 
verifying Mr Ms identity, which he was unable to provide. Due to these difficulties, I note 
Ref: DRN01196962PayPal agreed to accept  a birth certificate instead. But Mr M feels strongly that his 
Freedom Pass is better identification  than a birth certificate and PayPal are being 
unreasonable by not accepting it. But considering its regulatory duties, which are onerous, I 
dont think PayPal is being unreasonable in deciding what it considers to be valid 
documents. And the documents  PayPal  deem  acceptable are commonly  used  for identity 
checks. Further, I dont  think  PayPal are under any obligation to accept Mr Ms 
Freedom Pass as verification of his identity even  if other organisations would do so.
I appreciate Mr M has held a PayPal  account for fifteen years. I know hes unhappy  with the 
explanation as to why PayPal need  this information now  but as it has said, it is for 
compliance purposes and they have informed Mr M of this. And I dont think having an 
account for a long time means  PayPal is acting unreasonably  by asking for identification at 
different times.
Mr M refers to a previous similar complaint with our service  where  he says the outcome was 
different. But we consider all complaints  on an individual basis. And this is what  Ive done in 
this case.
I know Mr M is concerned about how PayPal  will handle his information. If he has concerns 
about this, he may want to raise these matters with the Information Commissioners Office 
who deal with complaints of this nature.
So all things  considered, whilst I appreciate Mr M will be disappointed with this outcome, for 
the reasons Ive outlined above, Im not upholding his complaint.
my final decision
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 April 2019.
