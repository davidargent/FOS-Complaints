K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) was 
irresponsible to lend to him.
background
Mr S had five loans from Sunny between August 2017 and June 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 18 Aug 2017 £100 6m £33.35 28 Feb 2018 27 Oct 2017
2 22 Feb 2018 £50 187d £16.67 28 Aug 2018 13 Mar 2018
3 13 Mar 2018 £200 168d £59.96 28 Aug 2018 28 Jun 2018
4 10 Apr 2018 £350 171d £106.65 28 Sep 2018 16 Jun 2018
5 13 Jun 2018 £50 168d £15.00 28 Nov 2018 16 Jun 2018
Mr S says Sunny should have carried out better  checks before lending to him. He says the 
high repayments  meant  he was unable to pay priority bills and he had to borrow  again.
Sunny says it carried out affordability and creditworthiness checks  and considered  it acted 
responsibly when  approving Mr Ss loans.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He said Mr Ss borrowing 
pattern suggested  he was struggling to make  repayments when he applied  for loan 5. He 
says hed had four loans in less than four months  with no break in lending  and earlier  loans 
were outstanding. Our adjudicator said loan 5 interest (plus 8% statutory interest) should be 
refunded and that related  adverse information  should be removed from Mr Ss credit file.
Sunny responded to say, in summary,  that its checks showed loan 5 was affordable and 
there were no indications he was struggling financially. It added  that Mr S was borrowing 
from it for fewer than ten months which is consistent  with the purpose of short-term  lending.
my provisional findings
I issued my provisional decision to Mr S and to Sunny  on 8 November 2019.  I summarise  my 
findings here:
I was satisfied that Sunnys checks went far enough for loans 1 to 3, and that it was 
reasonable for it to have found  the repayments  were affordable;
As loan 4 was Mr Ss third loan in quick  succession, it was for significantly more 
money and loan 3 was still outstanding,  I considered Sunny should have asked Mr S 
whether he had any other  outstanding short-term  loans;
As there  was nothing  in the available  information  to suggest Mr S had any short-term  
lending with other providers, I couldnt  conclude Sunny was wrong  to approve loan 4;
By the time Mr S applied for loan 5, I considered  his pattern of borrowing should have  
indicated to Sunny that he might be having difficulty managing  his money  and it 
needed to do better  checks;
Ref: DRN68165982But I couldnt see that better checks would have shown loan 5 was unaffordable to 
Mr S;
I also considered Mr Ss pattern of borrowing, but I couldnt conclude  that, in itself, 
should have indicated the repayments  were unsustainable. I said that because:
othere was almost four months  between loans 1 and 2;
othere were no late payments on any of the loans;
oloan 5 was for significantly less money than previous loans.
So my provisional decision was that I did not uphold the complaint.
Sunny responded to say it accepted my provisional  decision. It further  clarified that it did ask 
Mr S about  his credit commitments at the time of loan 4 and carried out further checks with 
credit reference agencies.
Mr S did not respond to my provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Sunny accepted my provisional decision, and Mr S provided no further  information,  I see 
no reason to depart from my provisional decision.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 January 2020.
