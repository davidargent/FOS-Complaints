K820x#14complaint
Mrs G says HSBC  UK Bank Plc (HSBC) mis-sold her a payment protection  insurance  
(PPI) policy.
background and summary to complaint
Mrs G bought the policy in 1999 at the same time as taking out a loan. Due to the time that 
has passed, its not clear  how Mrs G applied for her loan and PPI policy.  
The policys  one-off upfront  premium of £760.95  was paid in advance  by being added  to the 
loan (a single premium)  where it attracted interest  over the term of the loan. The loan was 
repayable over a 48 month term and the policy term matched that of the loan.  The monthly 
loan repayment  was £154.78  with the PPI costing  an additional £20.41 making  the total 
monthly repayment £175.19.  
The policy provided  cover  for Mrs G for disability, unemployment and life  subject to its 
exclusions and limitations. It offered to repay  Mrs Gs monthly loan repayment for the 
remaining term of the loan in the event of a successful disability claim and up to 12 months 
in the event of unemployment. 
At the time,  Mrs G was self-employed as a market trader. She has told us she was not 
entitled to any sick pay and didnt have any other means of repaying her loan should she be 
unable to work. Mrs G has said she was in good health at the time of the sale. 
HSBC has sent us screenshots to show that the loan account closed in 2002, and a linked, 
subsequent, loan account closed  in 2007.
Mrs Gs representative has made lengthy and substantial representations on her behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have  read and considered  them all carefully. In 
summary, Mrs Gs representative says:
HSBC failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the time. In those 
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on 
handling PPI complaints  under  DISP  APP 3, it should be presumed  Mrs G wouldnt 
have taken out the policy and the complaint should be upheld.  Mrs Gs 
representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that presumption;
The policy excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress,  which  are some  of the 
most common reasons people  are off work. This significantly reduced  the value of 
cover;
The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a 
successful claim  meant the policy was of inherently poor value as shown by the low 
claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good  faith means HSBC should  have 
told Mrs G about  the poor value;
 
The cancellation terms  were  unfair;
Ref: DRN88164252The common law duty of utmost good faith also means HSBC should  have explained  
the significance  of the exclusions  and limitations of cover  to Mrs G and the impact  
they would  have had on her chances  of making  a claim; and
The information Mrs G received was misleading. These policies were promoted as 
providing peace of mind, but the number of exclusions and limitations on the scope of 
the cover  meant this was untrue.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint  both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Mrs G disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  for 
several reasons.  
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; relevant regulators rules, guidance  and standards;  relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mrs Gs. I dont intend to set that out in 
much detail here but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Gs complaint
This sale took place  in 1999 before the General Insurance Standards Council (GISC) 
published its code  of practice in June 2000  and before the sale of general insurance 
products like this became  regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC code, the FSAs (and 
FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses  and insurance conduct rules (ICOB and 
ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint,  nor is the FCAs Perimeter  guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself concluded  in 2003 and the linked, subsequent loan, concluded  in 
2007. That means the unfair relationship provisions set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit 
Act, the Supreme Court judgment in Plevin  about s.140 of that Act and the rules and 
guidance made by the FCA about the handling  of complaints about the non-disclosure of 
commission in light of the Plevin judgment, arent  applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at that time, which Im satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular,  The Association of British Insurers  General Insurance Business 
Code of Practice for all intermediaries  (Including  Employees of Insurance Companies) other  
than Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. 
Ref: DRN88164253The ABI code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries  
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected  of 
intermediaries like HSBC  at the time. So Im satisfied I should  take the ABI code and these 
other publications into account  when  deciding, what is in my opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of Mrs Gs case.  
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including:  the law relating to 
negligence, contract  (including the express  and implied duty on professional advisers to give 
advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence; the law relating to the utmost  duty of good 
faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness). 
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  Im also required  to take into account  what 
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Office of the Banking  
Ombudsman  might have been expected  to reach  in relation to an equivalent complaint. I 
note that under the Banking  Ombudsmans terms of reference the Ombudsman  was 
required to decide  complaints by reference  to what was, in his opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances   and that the Ombudsman was required to observe any applicable 
rule of law or relevant judicial authority. 
Im also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first issued 
by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating  to the sale 
of PPI. This sale took place before insurance  mediation became a regulated activity, so 
HSBC was required to take into account  the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were  
guidance when  considering Mrs Gs complaint. 
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me that the key questions I need  
to consider in deciding  what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all circumstances of this 
complaint, are:
-If HSBC gave advice,  whether  it advised  Mrs G with reasonable care and skill  in 
particular, whether the policy  was appropriate  or suitable for her, given her needs 
and circumstances.  
-Whether HSBC gave Mrs G sufficient, appropriate and timely information  to enable 
her to make an informed choice about  whether to take out the policy,  including  
drawing to her attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading  way  
the main provisions of the policy and significant  limitations and exclusions.  
Ref: DRN88164254-If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Mrs G, I 
must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Mrs G suffered loss or 
damage and what  I consider would amount to fair compensation for that loss or 
damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mrs G and 
HSBC, Ive decided  not to uphold Mrs Gs complaint.  Ive set out my reasoning  below. 
did Mrs G know she had a choice?
HSBC had to make  it clear that the PPI policy was optional. 
The sale took place  a long time ago, so neither party has been able to provide a copy  of 
Mrs Gs actual application,  but I have seen a copy of a PPI application form HSBC says was 
used around the time Mrs Gs policy was sold. The application form is separate  from the loan 
and Mrs G would have  had to sign it to confirm she had decided  to take PPI. Weve seen a 
number of similar sales from around the same period and this is consistent with our 
knowledge of how HSBC sold PPI.
Taking everything into account,  I think its more likely that Mrs G knew the policy was 
optional and she agreed to take it out without undue  pressure. 
did HSBC provide  advice?
Neither party could  confirm whether Mrs G received  any advice, so in fairness to her, Ive 
considered the case on the basis that advice was given.
This means  HSBC had to advise Mrs G with reasonable care and skill, in particular whether 
the policy was appropriate or suitable given her needs and circumstances.
the advice
I dont know what steps HSBC took to establish  whether  the policy was a suitable  
recommendation for Mrs G. It seems Mrs G cant remember  clearly what  happened and 
there is no record of what the adviser discussed  in relation to the policy.  The adviser likely 
had some limited information about Mrs Gs financial  circumstances, but there is no specific 
evidence to show the adviser took steps to establish whether Mrs G would  have been  caught 
by the significant exclusions and limitations which might have meant  the policy did not fully 
meet her needs.  For example,  there  is nothing to suggest HSBC considered whether Mrs G 
had any pre-existing medical conditions.
Overall, on the balance of probabilities Im not persuaded HSBC  did all it should have done 
to determine whether  the policy was suitable  for Mrs G given her circumstances. So Im not 
persuaded HSBC  advised  with reasonable care and skill.
While Im not persuaded HSBC did all it should have done to make  sure the policy  was 
suitable for Mrs G, I do think its more likely than not that the policy  was ultimately  suitable  
for her. In reaching  that conclusion Ive taken  into consideration:
-Mrs G met the eligibility criteria  for the policy.
Ref: DRN88164255-Mrs G had a need  for the policy  she would not have received any sick pay if she 
was unable to work  due to illness, she would not have received any redundancy pay 
and she didnt have  any savings  she could fall back on. The policy would have 
helped Mrs G manage the consequences  were  she unable  to work.
-The monthly cost of the policy appears  to have  been affordable for Mrs G.
-The exclusions and limitations didnt make the policy unsuitable  for Mrs G. Mrs Gs 
was self-employed,  but the terms and conditions of the policy  did not make  it difficult  
for her to claim.  And she hasnt told us about  any pre-existing medical conditions that 
could affect her ability to claim. There were also no additional restrictions  on cover for 
mental health or back problems.
-Although a pro-rata refund  would not have been  paid if Mrs G cancelled the policy 
early, there is nothing to suggest (at the time) that Mrs G had plans to repay the loan 
early. The purpose  of the loan was not debt consolidation or anything  else which 
might suggest a need to repay  the loan early,  or that this was likely to happen. 
Ive also considered whether, when providing  advice,  HSBC gave Mrs G sufficient 
information about the cover provided by the policy to enable her to understand what  HSBC  
was recommending to her and make an informed decision  about  whether to follow that 
advice and take out the policy.
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not that Mrs G was given a broad description of what the 
policy was intended  to cover (that is that the policy would protect her payments if Mrs G was 
unable to work through accident,  sickness and unemployment.)  I have reached this 
conclusion because of what  the example loan agreement HSBC has provided said about  
PPI. And I think Mrs G knew  that the single premium being  added to the loan was £760.95, 
the interest added to the premium was £219.64,  the total cost was £980.59  and the monthly 
cost was £20.41 (as this information would have, in my view,  been made sufficiently  clear  on 
the loan agreement Mrs G signed.)  
But the evidence  from the time of sale doesnt tell us whether  HSBC gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit, or about the exclusions or limitations  before 
Mrs G agreed  to take out the policy. 
Overall, having considered the parties  representations about what  happened,  while Im 
satisfied the policy was a suitable recommendation for Mrs G Im not persuaded HSBC  did 
enough to present information about the policy it was recommending in a way that was fair 
and reasonable to Mrs G. Im not persuaded HSBC  gave  Mrs G all of the information  she 
needed about the policy to make an informed decision  about  whether to follow the 
recommendation and take it out.
Ive considered how my findings interact  with the FCAs  list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out at DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, I am persuaded there  were  significant  failings in this case.
Ref: DRN88164256In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Mrs Gs representative has raised a number 
of general points in regard  to the requirements on a business when providing information  in 
PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like Mrs Gs. Ive considered  
these carefully and summarised them  as:
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mrs Gs representative considers to be poor 
value  and the fact that much of the premium went  to the business  rather than the 
insurer. 
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just 
told Mrs G about  the limitations and exclusions, it should have gone further and 
explained the significance of them to her. 
Im not persuaded by Mrs Gs representatives  views on this. The duty of utmost good faith in 
insurance law imposed a duty on both parties  to the contract  to disclose material facts  and 
not to make  material misrepresentations. While I cant be certain what  a court  would say  I 
think its unlikely a court would  find that this extended to the insurer  having  to disclose the 
claims ratio information or explaining  the significance of the limitations and exclusions in the 
way Mrs G has suggested.  And taking into account  the law, industry  codes and standards of 
good industry practice applicable to this complaint,  I dont think its fair and reasonable to 
conclude that HSBC ought to have done  either. 
What effect did HSBCs  shortcomings  have on Mrs G? To what extent did Mrs G suffer 
loss or damage as a result?
Ive found that HSBC  didnt do all it should  have done when it sold this policy to Mrs G. So I 
have gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude Mrs G 
suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer  this, I must decide  whether or not Mrs G 
would have still taken  out the policy, had HSBC done things properly. 
While Im not persuaded HSBC took the steps  it should  have  done  to establish whether the 
policy it recommended  was suitable for Mrs G, I have found  that the policy was ultimately 
suitable for her.
In those circumstances it seems to me that, whether  or not Mrs G has suffered loss or 
damage in this case primarily depends  on whether, if HSBC had explained things properly, 
Mrs G would have acted  differently, or whether she would have taken out the policy in any 
event.
Mrs G says she wouldnt have taken it out and believes I should presume this to be the case 
given the significant failings identified  above.  Ive considered  the representations of both 
sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
Deciding whether  to follow advice to take out insurance requires the consumer to weigh up a 
number of factors before  deciding  whether to proceed. Effectively the consumer has to 
weigh up the advice to take out the policy, the cost of doing so given the benefits offered in 
return and the potential consequences they will suffer if they do not have insurance, should 
the risks come  to fruition.
Ref: DRN88164257The evidence in this case suggests that Mrs G had some interest in taking out payment 
protection insurance. By this I mean  when HSBC  advised her that there  was a suitable 
product she could buy that would protect  her loan payments in the event she was unable  to 
work because of accident, sickness and unemployment, she concluded she wanted that 
product. But she made that decision based on incomplete information, meaning what  she 
thought she was getting is not exactly what she got. 
As I explained earlier, Im satisfied from the evidence about  Mrs Gs circumstances at the 
time of the sale that the policy was not fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her.
As Ive also already explained, the information Mrs G was given about the cost was clear. 
But the information about other aspects of the policy, such as the benefit of the policy and 
the limitations and exclusions  wasnt as clear  as it should have been.  
Im not persuaded HSBC made clear exactly what Mrs G would  get back in return in the 
event she made a successful claim. But I think its unlikely  Mrs Gs expectations about what 
the policy would pay in the event  of a claim (an amount sufficient to meet her loan 
repayment) were significantly different to what the policy actually did.
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mrs G thought she had bought and 
what she actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to medical  conditions that Mrs G knew  about or 
ought to have known about  before the start date of the policy.  Or, any medical 
condition she received treatment, advice or was referred for investigation during the 
12 months before the policy start date and which recurred within  12 months  of the 
policy start date; 
The policy limited, and in some situations,  excluded unemployment  cover  if Mrs G 
wasnt a permanent employee;
The policy did not provide a pro-rata  refund if Mrs G repaid the loan early and the 
policy was cancelled,  so it wouldve been more expensive for Mrs G to have done so; 
and
I do accept there is a possibility the limitations and exclusions  above might well have caused  
Mrs G pause for thought   and may well have  caused her to conclude  the policy wasnt as 
good as she thought and she might have decided not to proceed. The limitations on the 
cover, when  coupled  with the other shortcomings in this sale, might  have  dissuaded some  
consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mrs G from taking out the policy. 
The evidence about Mrs Gs circumstances  at the time of sale shows  that the policy  wasnt 
fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. She was eligible for its benefits and it provided 
cover that, despite its limitations and exclusions, couldve proved valuable  to her should  the 
insured risks have  become a reality. Although Mrs G was self-employed  when  the PPI was 
taken out, it wouldnt  have been any harder  for her to make a claim if she became 
unemployed than someone who was permanently employed. And I havent  seen  any 
evidence to suggest she wouldve been caught by any of the significant exclusions.  So I still 
think she had some good reasons to take the policy out.
Ref: DRN88164258The policy didnt exclude back or mental  health conditions or place  any additional restrictions  
or more  onerous evidential requirements  in the event of a claim on those grounds than 
would have applied  to any other  disability  claim.  And I think  its unlikely Mrs G would have 
expected to make a disability claim on the policy without first providing some  evidence to 
support that claim.
Having considered all of the evidence  and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not Mrs G would still have taken out the policy. The policy was suitable  for her, was 
sufficiently close to what its likely she thought she was getting  and provided benefits that 
would help her manage  the consequences  were  Mrs G made redundant, or unable  to work 
through accident or disability. In the circumstances I consider it more likely than not Mrs G 
would have taken  out the policy  in any event notwithstanding the limitations on cover.
Mrs Gs representatives say the rules  about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 3) 
make it clear  that, where  a significant  failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have  taken out PPI, unless  there  is evidence  to outweigh  the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration, so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
Ive thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, Ive found it would be reasonable to conclude there were 
substantial flaws in the sales process. 
In those circumstances, DISP App 3 says it should be presumed Mrs G would  not have 
bought the PPI she bought unless, in the particular circumstances of the complaint, there is 
evidence to rebut the presumption. 
Im satisfied, applying DISP App 3, its reasonable to conclude the presumption is rebutted in 
the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking  into account Mrs Gs 
circumstances as detailed  above, I consider it reasonable to conclude  the position  Mrs G 
found herself in as result of the sale was the same  position she would have been in had the 
breach or significant failings not occurred. 
Mrs G believes  the presumption may only be rebutted  when the flaws in the sales process 
were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were  highly material and we have failed to give 
proper weight to the evidence  including her own comments  that she would not have taken 
out the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out at DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because  I do not consider, in this case,  that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mrs G in the position  she would have been in if she had 
not bought the policy.  
Ref: DRN88164259That is because,  while I accept it is possible that she would not have taken out the policy,  I 
am satisfied  that of the two possibilities, its more  likely than not that she would still have 
taken out the PPI had she been  given clear,  fair and not misleading  information about the 
policy she was buying. So Im not persuaded it would  be fair and reasonable in those  
circumstances, to conclude HSBC should  pay Mrs G compensation, as that would put her in 
a better  position than she would have been in if everything had happened  as it should have 
done. 
Im also aware that Mrs G thinks HSBC misrepresented the terms of the policy  in how it 
described the PPI. Whilst I accept  there  is a possibility a court  might conclude  some of 
HSBCs statements misrepresented the contract, in my opinion the reason why HSBC  failed 
to act fairly  and reasonably was not because of what it did or didnt say in the information it 
provided  but because  the overall information  HSBC gave Mrs G, in the way it did, was 
insufficient to meet  the standards I consider it fair and reasonable to expect it to have met in 
1999 when providing information  about an insurance  policy.  
Ive also thought about the approach Mrs Gs representative  says a court might take if it 
were to find HSBC negligently  misrepresented the contract to Mrs G and about  the remedy a 
court might award if it were to find that HSBC had been in breach  of its duty of utmost good  
faith. But this doesnt persuade me to alter my conclusions  about what is fair and reasonable 
in all the circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this case.  For the reasons Ive already set out I dont think it would be fair 
and reasonable to put Mrs G in a better position  than if everything had happened  as it should 
have done.
my final decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 May 2021.
