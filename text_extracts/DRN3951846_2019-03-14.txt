K820x#14complaint
Mrs K says Bank of Scotland  plc (trading as Halifax)  mis-sold her a payment protection  
insurance (PPI) policy alongside a personal loan.
background
Mrs K took out a PPI policy with a mortgage  in 1990. She paid a monthly amount for the 
policy.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs K disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Ks case.  
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Ks complaint because:
Theres nothing to suggest that Bank of Scotland didnt make Mrs K aware that she had 
a choice about buying the PPI, or that she didnt  choose to take it. 
Bank of Scotland recommended the PPI to Mrs K, and it seems  to have been right for 
her based on what Ive seen of her circumstances at the time. The PPI wouldve made  
her loan repayments for up to two years  if she was unable  to work. This wouldve 
protected any employee benefit  payments she received (so she could use that for other 
things) and wouldve  continued after those payments had stopped.  
Its possible that Bank of Scotland couldve explained the cost of the policy better than it 
did. But even if it had, I think Mrs K would still have bought it. 
Its possible that Bank of Scotland didnt  point out the main things the policy didnt cover.  
But Mrs K doesnt  appear to have been  affected  by any of those things. 
Ive taken into account Mrs Ks comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Ks complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs K to accept 
or reject my decision before 14 April 2019.
