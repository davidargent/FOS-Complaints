The complaint
Ms W complains that Black Horse Limited (Black Horse) calculated her loan arrears 
incorrectly. She also complains about three letters sent in respect of those arrears.
What happened
Ms W entered into hire purchase agreement with Black Horse in June 2016 for a new car 
and two insurances. The cash price of the car was £40,303 and the cash price of the 
insurances was £898. Ms W paid the dealership a £5,000 deposit. Under the terms of the 
agreement, and everything else being equal, Ms W undertook to make 48 monthly payments 
of £501.97 (£480.59 plus £21.38) followed by one monthly payment (in the event the car was 
to be kept by Ms W rather than returned by her) of £19,846  making a total repayable of 
£48,940.56 (inclusive of the deposit) and £43,940.56 (exclusive of the deposit).
On 29 May 2019 Black Horse sent Ms W a default notice (arrears balance of £1,331.74).
On 29 May 2019 Black Horse sent Ms W a default notice (arrears balance of £59.24).
On 30 May 2019 Black Horse sent Ms W an arrears notice stating that her account was in 
arrears by £1,390.98 
In June 2019 Ms W complained to Black Horse about the three letters she had received from 
it. In the same month, Black Horse responded to say it was satisfied it had done nothing 
wrong.
Ms Ws complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that Black 
Horse had indeed done nothing wrong.
Ms W didnt agree and so her complaint has been passed to me for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I can confirm that Ive come to the same conclusion as the investigator and 
for the same reasons. 
Ive looked at Ms Ws payment history and I can see that prior to the letters dated 29 May 
and 30 May 2019 being sent to her she had made payments totalling £16,177.97 compared 
to payments required of £17,568.95 (35 x £501.97), giving an arrears balance of £1,390.98 
(£17,568.95 less £16,177.97).
So, with the above in mind, and given that if the sums under cover of the two letters dated 
29 May 2019 (one being in respect of the car finance and one being in respect of the 
insurances finance) are added together gives a figure of £1,390.98  the same as the sum 
noted under cover of the 30 May 2019 letter  Im satisfied that the content of all three letters 
were correct.
Finally, and for the sake of completeness, I would add that Im satisfied that Black Horse 
dealt with Ms Ws enquiry and complaint appropriately and in line with its various regulatory 
obligations, including those quoted by Ms W.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 April 2021.
