Complaint
Mr C has complained about personal loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) provided to him. He says the loans were unaffordable and were therefore 
irresponsibly lent to him.
Background
118 118 Money provided Mr C with a loan for £3,500.00 in June 2018. This loan had an APR 
of 169.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of 
£8,282.64, including interest, fees and charges of £4,782.64, was due to be repaid in 24 
monthly instalments of just over £344. This loan was settled with some of the proceeds from 
loan 2.
118 118 Money then provided Mr C with a second loan for £2,541.29 (£2,041.29 went 
towards settling the outstanding balance on loan 1) in November 2019. This loan had an 
APR of 99.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of 
£4,669.68, including interest, fees and charges of £2,128.39, was due to be repaid in 24 
monthly instalments of just under £200. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mr Cs complaint and she thought that 118 118 Money 
ought to have realised that it shouldnt have provided Mr C with his loans. So she thought 
that Mr Cs complaint should be upheld. 
118 118 Money didnt respond to our adjudicators assessment. So the case was passed to 
an ombudsman for a final decision as per the next step of our dispute resolution process. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Cs complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything Ive decided to uphold Mr Cs complaint. Ill explain 
why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mr C could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
Im concerned that 118 118 Moneys own checks showed that Mr C was already significantly 
indebted and a significant proportion of his monthly income was already being taken up by 
repayments to existing credit commitments. Furthermore, the credit checks also showed that 
Mr Cs overall indebtedness and the amount of cash advances hed taken out on his credit 
card had significantly increased between the applications for loans 1 and 2. I think that 118 
118 Money ought to have been concerned as to why Mr C had an apparent want or need for 
so much credit in a relatively short period of time. 
All of this leaves me persuaded by what Mr C has said about already being in a difficult 
financial position at the time. And while its possible Mr Cs financial position reflected his 
choices rather than financial difficulty, Id add that the evidence provided appears to show 
that this is because his income was significantly lower than 118 118 Money believed it to be, 
in the absence of any reasonable or plausible arguments from 118 118 Money, Ive been 
persuaded to accept Mr Cs version of events here. 
As this is the case, I do think that Mr Cs existing financial position meant that he was 
unlikely to be able to afford the repayments to these loans, without undue difficulty or 
borrowing further. And Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would more 
like than not have shown 118 118 Money that it shouldnt have provided these loans to Mr C. 
As 118 118 Money provided Mr C with these loans, notwithstanding this, Im satisfied it failed 
to act fairly and reasonably towards him. 
Mr C ended up paying interest, fees and charges on loans he shouldnt have been provided 
with. So Im satisfied that Mr C lost out because of what 118 118 Money did wrong and that it 
should put things right.
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Mr C
Having thought about everything, 118 118 Money should put things right for Mr C by:
refunding all interest, fees and charges Mr C paid on his loans;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Mr C to the date of settlement
removing any and all adverse information it recorded about these loans from Mr Cs 
credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Cs complaint. Madison CF UK Limited 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 July 2023.
