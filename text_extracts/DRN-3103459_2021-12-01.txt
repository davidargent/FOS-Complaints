The complaint
Miss M complained that National Westminster bank had placed markers on her credit file, 
relating to a small debt she didnt know about, which were having a significant impact on her 
ability to borrow. She told us about the wider impact this had on her life.
What happened
Miss M said markers on her credit file were causing her problems. She said these related to 
a small debt that NatWest didnt tell her about, which resulted in a default on her name. She 
told us how this was impacting her. She said the debt related to a student loan overdraft that 
she thought she had paid off. 
Miss M said NatWest didnt do all it could have done to alert her to the debt. And once she 
found out about it, she took immediate steps to pay it back. But she said this has been 
affecting her credit file for years, and a default on her file will now affect her for years to 
come. She said shed also devoted a lot of time to resolving this, and NatWest had been 
very unhelpful. 
Miss M wanted the default removed, or at least moved to an earlier date that reflects the 
actual time of the debt. And she wanted us to consider asking NatWest to pay compensation 
of over £50 for the stress and impact this has caused her financially and personally.
NatWest said Miss M previously had a current account with an overdraft. To keep an 
overdraft, NatWest said it does require regular payments into the account. The last credit 
into Miss Ms account was in August 2016. NatWest said Miss M told it she thought the 
overdraft had been cleared off when she stopped using it but NatWest said it wasnt sure 
how she could have come to this conclusion.
NatWest said in October 2017, the account was passed to the collections department, when 
Miss M owed about £550. NatWest had tried to contact Miss M by post and phone, but with 
no success. So it sent a default notice on 29 March 2017, it wrote to Miss M again on 16 
April 2017 (after calling her the same day without success) to remind her about the default 
notice, and then started the whole process again of asking her via letter and telephone to 
contact it. 
But NatWest said Miss M still didnt get in touch. So NatWest issued another default notice 
on 20 December 2017, followed by a formal demand notice on 22 January 2018. It then 
transferred the matter to the recoveries department on 15 February 2018 and a default was 
correctly registered on Miss M's credit file.
NatWest said it was Miss Ms responsibility to make sure her address and phone number 
were up to date. If she didnt get its letters, that wasnt NatWests fault. She started to make 
payments to the debt when NatWests debt collection agents traced her, in April 2019. 
NatWest then refunded £388.13 of interest and charges that built up in the years before the 
account was closed, as a gesture of goodwill. The debt was paid off in early 2020. Miss Ms 
debt now shows as fully satisfied, but the default remains on her credit file, dated at 
February 2018. 
NatWest had paid Miss M £50, because it hadnt always been helpful when she got in touch 
to try to pay this debt off.
NatWest thought it had done enough to put things right.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld in part. He said it was fair for 
NatWest to default Miss Ms account, after shed stopped paying towards the debt. He didnt 
think that Miss M could just assume the debt was cleared, based on the length of time shed 
been paying. And he said it was Miss Ms responsibility to keep her contact details up to 
date. NatWest had tried to contact her when she stopped paying, and our investigator 
thought NatWest had taken reasonable steps to tell Miss M about the possible default. 
But our investigator thought NatWest had waited too long to default Miss Ms debt. The 
Information Commissioners Office (ICO) says when a consumer is at least three months 
behind with their payments then a default may be registered. And the ICO would expect a 
default to be registered by the time the consumer is six months behind with their payments.
Miss Ms payments stopped in September 2016, but a default wasnt applied until January 
2018, which is sixteen months later. Our investigator said NatWest shouldve applied a 
default by March 2017. Our investigator noted that NatWest sent a default notice around this 
time, and he thought NatWest should have then applied the default, instead of allowing the 
account to accumulate further charges.
Our investigator said he didnt know why Miss M still had missed payment markers on her 
credit file from NatWest. It has since become apparent that these relate to a separate credit 
card debt. NatWest is looking into this, and if Miss M does wish to refer that issue to us in 
future, then our service will look at that issue separately. 
Our investigator didnt think NatWest needed to remove the default entirely, or compensate 
Miss M because shed been unable to get other credit. But he said it did need to move the 
default date to March 2017; and if it hadnt reported Miss Ms account as fully satisfied to all 
credit reference agencies it should do so.
Miss M didnt agree. She felt that our investigators view suggested NatWest hadnt done 
anything wrong. She wanted to stress how unhelpful NatWest had been when she was trying 
to deal with this debt. She also wanted to let us know the impact that this default was having. 
NatWest also disagreed. It said it hadnt defaulted Miss Ms account in March 2017 because 
a payment was made to the account in April 2017. Thats why NatWest had then restarted 
the process, instead of going ahead with a default.
Our investigator said some of the impact on Miss Ms credit file may be because of the newly 
uncovered problem with her credit card. Miss M still thought that the default for her current 
account should be removed from her credit file. But our investigator didnt think that the 
customer service problems Miss M had experienced were enough for him to say that the 
default should be removed. He noted that NatWest had made a sizeable refund of interest 
and charges on the overdraft. 
Our investigator wrote to NatWest and said he thought the payment onto Miss Ms account 
in April 2017 was just an automated credit. Miss M hadn't done anything to the account, or 
contacted NatWest. So our investigator still thought it would be fair to move the default back. NatWest reviewed its decision, and said it would do as our investigator suggested. It has 
written to us to say that the default has been backdated, and the debt noted as satisfied with 
all credit reference agencies. But Miss M still hadnt agreed that this resolved her complaint. 
She wanted the default to be removed, and as no agreement on this had been reached, the 
case was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
Miss M has accepted that shed stopped paying towards her current account debt before the 
overdraft was paid off. She told us that she had text alerts set up, and she expected these to 
warn her if anything had gone wrong. But NatWest has shown us that the text alerts wouldnt 
warn Miss M of an upcoming default.
I think that NatWest did then make reasonable efforts to contact Miss M, and I dont think its 
NatWests fault that these efforts werent successful. 
As Miss M was still being charged for borrowing, and shed stopped paying towards this 
debt, the amount she owed was increasing month on month. I dont think that it was wrong 
for NatWest to default Miss Ms current account debt.
Because I dont think that NatWest was wrong to put this default on Miss Ms credit file, I 
dont think it has to pay Miss M compensation for any impact this default has had on her 
ability to borrow. 
But I agree with our investigator that NatWest should have acted sooner than it did. I can 
see from Miss Ms statements that she last paid money into this account in August 2016. So 
I also think that this debt should have been defaulted by March 2017. I dont think that an 
automated refund of fees ought to have delayed this default. I am glad to see that NatWest 
has accepted this, and has now confirmed it has already amended the default date. This will 
now come off Miss Ms credit file much earlier. And she may also find that an older default 
has much less of an impact on her credit rating in the meantime.
I understand Miss M found NatWest unhelpful when she tried to get information about this 
debt. I make no comment here on any confusion with her other, credit card, debt. Thats not 
what Miss M complained about here, and NatWest hasnt yet had a chance to look at this. 
So I leave that for any possible future complaint that Miss M may choose to make about this. 
I note that NatWest has accepted it provided Miss M with some poor service, because at 
least some of its advice about the current account was conflicting. Its paid £50 in 
compensation for that. But NatWest has also made a sizeable refund of almost £400 onto 
Miss Ms debt, which refunds her for several years of interest and charges on the account. 
And it has marked the debt as fully satisfied as a result of this refund, when a debt which is 
cleared by a refund might usually be marked as partly satisfied (because Miss M herself 
didnt pay all the money that was owed, some of it was covered by the refund).
I dont think that NatWest had to do either of those things, and because it has done so, I 
wont ask NatWest to pay Miss M additional compensation for the difficulties she 
experienced in getting information and advice about her current account debt.I know Miss M will be disappointed, but I think NatWest has already done enough to provide 
a fair and reasonable outcome to her complaint about her current account debt. And 
because of that, I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 December 2021.
