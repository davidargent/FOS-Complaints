K821x#15complaint
Mr W says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
says Sunny failed  to identify that he was in a cycle of short  term lending  and the loans 
werent helping  his longer term financial needs. Mr W thinks  Sunny shouldve seen this and 
not lent to him. 
background
This complaint is about 28 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr W between May 2014 and 
November 2017.  There is a table at the end of this decision which  shows some of the 
information Sunny has provided about  the lending. 
Before bringing  the complaint to this Service, in response to Mr Ws complaint, Sunny  
agreed that it shouldnt  have  approved  some  of the lending. It made  an offer of 
compensation in respect of loans 1, 16, 18 and 25 to 28. Mr W didnt accept  this offer.  
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He agreed with Sunnys offer in respect  of 
loan 1. He also thought  that it shouldnt have approved  loans 7 to 28. 
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It didnt think  that by loan 7 enough  time had 
passed to reasonably say that Mr W was persistently reliant on short term lending. And it 
took into consideration that he was repaying more than one loan at a time. It did agree that it 
should have done things  differently after approving loan 12. So it offered compensation on 
this basis. 
Mr W didnt accept this offer and so the complaint has been passed to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN30682262the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
The loan payments being affordable on a strict  pounds and pence  calculation might be an 
indication a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt  automatically 
follow this is the case. The industry  regulator defines sustainable as being  without  undue  
difficulties and, in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. Ive decided  to uphold  Mr Ws 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Mr W didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 2 to 6 and Sunny agrees that 
it shouldnt have approved loan 1 and loans 13 to 28. Because  of this I dont think  there is 
any ongoing disagreement about  these  loans. So I wont be making  a decision about this 
lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr W had with Sunny. So they are 
something I will take into account when considering the other  loans he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 7 to 12 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  
history with Mr W, with a view to seeing  if there was a point at which Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
at this point Sunny  ought to have  realised Mr W was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. In the current chain of lending  Mr W had taken out six loans within nine 
months. So he wasnt really borrowing over the short term anymore and Sunny ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not he was having to borrow  further  to cover 
the hole repaying  his previous loans  were leaving in his finances  and that his 
indebtedness was now unsustainable
and at this point Sunny ought to have known that Mr W was not likely borrowing to 
meet a temporary  shortfall in his income but to meet  an ongoing need 
Mr W took loans 2 to 6 without a significant  break in the lending.  And he had more 
than one loan running at the same time. And from loan 7 onwards  Mr W was 
provided with a new loan within days or weeks of settling a previous one 
Mr W was clearly having problems making inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. 
His overall indebtedness had increased to £400 by loan 4. This had decreased by 
loan 6 but was rising  again at loan 7, and as I said above  this was nine months into 
the current lending  relationship. Mr W had paid interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period
Ref: DRN30682263I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 7 to 12 and Sunny should  put things right for this 
lending as well as paying the offer it has made in respect of loans  1 and loans 13 to 28.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loan 1 and loans 7 to 28;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan 1 from Mr Ws credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 28 should be removed from 
Mr Ws credit file.
If Mr W still owes Sunny any of the principal balance  he borrowed on loans 27 and 28 Sunny 
should remove all the interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. Sunny  should  
then re-work the account as if all payments made by Mr W went to towards  the principal. But 
importantly, Sunny needs to make sure that Mr W doesnt repay more  than the principal 
amounts borrowed.  
If after doing this Mr W hasnt repaid the principal he borrowed,  Sunny can deduct  this from 
the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr W has already  paid enough to repay  the principal 
then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple*  interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement.
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Mr W.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ws complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 December 2019.
