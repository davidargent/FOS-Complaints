K822xcomplaint
Mrs B complains NewDay Ltd didnt apply  a payment she made  to her credit card account, 
and this caused her a financial  loss, inconvenience, and upset.
background 
NewDay says it didnt  receive Mrs Bs October 2018  credit  card payment, so it applied  a £12 
late payment fee and sent her a default notice. However,  Mrs B complained that she had 
made a payment of £107 towards her account in a shop, from her debit card.
NewDay agreed to refund  the late payment fee and the interest that had been applied  to the 
account as a result of Mrs Bs payment not being  received. But it said Mrs B hadnt provided 
sufficient evidence to show the £107 payment  had been made, so at that stage,  it wasnt  
prepared to credit her account  with the disputed  funds. Mrs B remained unhappy, so she 
referred a complaint to this service.
Mrs Bs complaint was considered by one of our investigators,  and she thought  it should  be 
upheld. Although the receipt given to Mrs B in the shop  didnt have an account number, our 
investigator didnt  think  there was anything more Mrs B could do. She was satisfied Mrs B 
had confirmed with both the shop  and her bank the payment had gone  through; and she 
noted NewDay had several £107  payments unallocated to an account due to the lack of 
reference numbers.  So, our investigator  thought  NewDay should  credit £107 to Mrs Bs 
account and remove  any adverse information  from her records  in relation to the missed 
payment.
NewDay maintained  it was unable to link the unallocated payments to Mrs Bs account, but it 
agreed to our investigators recommendations. NewDay also explained that Mrs B had since 
failed to make further monthly payments from January 2019 onwards,  and it said the further  
associated late payment fees and adverse records would remain.
Mrs B went  on to ask our investigator about  compensation  for the distress  the situation  had 
caused. NewDay maintained the issue hadnt been caused by its error, but it offered Mrs B 
£50. Mrs B said she would accept £100, but NewDay declined and our investigator thought 
the £50 offer was fair. Mrs B wasnt prepared to accept £50, so her complaint has been 
passed to me to decide. 
NewDay has since clarified  that Mrs B stopped using her account after December 2018,  but 
because the £107 payment hadnt yet been  credited,  a debt remained outstanding. Mrs B 
refused to make any further payments whilst this dispute was ongoing, and as a result,  
NewDay applied late payment fees between  January and April 2019. 
Following our investigators recommendations, NewDay credited £107 to Mrs Bs account.  
However, this left an outstanding balance, which was solely made up of the late payment 
fees and interest  that had accrued between January and April 2019. No further fees or 
interest was applied after April 2019  and the account remained inactive.
NewDay has now offered  to adjust the account balance to nil and arrange for any adverse 
information to be removed from Mrs Bs credit  file as a result  of no further payments being  
made after December  2018.
Ref: DRN36907382my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
For the reasons  outlined  by our investigator, on balance, I accept that Mrs B made  the £107 
payment. But in my view,  it remains unclear  which business is at fault for the funds  not 
reaching her account, i.e. NewDay,  Mrs Bs bank, or the shop where the payment was 
made.
Nonetheless, because  I accept the payment was made, I consider it fair and reasonable for 
NewDay to credit Mrs Bs account  with £107, and to take action which  ensures she isnt 
disadvantaged by the payment not being received in October 2018. 
NewDay has already:
-removed any adverse information it reported about the October 2018 missed payment;
-refunded the late payment fee and interest from October 2018 to the account;  
-credited the account with £107;  and
-offered 50 compensation
NewDay has also now agreed  to:
-clear the outstanding balance  which is solely made up of further  late payment fees and 
interest that accrued due to the £107 not being credited to the account sooner; and
-remove any adverse information  it reported  from January 2019 onwards
Having reviewed Mrs Bs credit card account  statements from October  2018 onwards,  Im 
satisfied the above actions ensure she hasnt been  disadvantaged by what  happened.
NewDay accepts it could  have done  more to help Mrs B locate the missing payment when 
responding to her complaint. I also acknowledge  the situation has been inconvenient and 
upsetting for Mrs B. However,  Ive not seen or been told anything  that persuades me to 
increase the £50 compensation  NewDay offered   particularly  as it hasnt been shown 
NewDay caused the initial issue. 
Overall, Im satisfied an outcome has been  reached  thats fair to both parties.
Ref: DRN36907383my final decision
I appreciate Mrs B will remain  disappointed, but for the reasons Ive set out above, I uphold  
this complaint. 
My final decision is NewDay Ltd should:
-clear Mrs Bs outstanding balance;
-compensate Mrs B £50 (if this hasnt yet been paid); and
-remove any adverse information  reported  from January 2019 onwards
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2020.
