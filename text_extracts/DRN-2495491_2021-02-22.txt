The complaint
Ms C complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should have refunded a payment made 
from her account.
What happened
Ms C signed up to a subscription to a service provider based in the US which had an 
introductory offer of $1.99 for three months then $34.99 a month after this. She says she did 
not intend to continue the subscription after the introductory offer but because she forgot to 
cancel it, $34.99 was debited from her PayPal account.
Ms C asked PayPal to cancel the subscription and refund the $34.99 paid. They cancelled 
the subscription but did not refund the payment as it wasnt cancelled before the offer ended, 
so she complained to them.
PayPal said she had authorised the subscription and they honoured the payment as per her 
billing agreement/PayPal user agreement. They acted as the payment provider and 
completed an authorised payment. So they didnt think they had done anything wrong.
Ms C brought her complaint to us as she felt PayPal had not done a thorough investigation 
and should refund the payment as she hadnt intended to take the full subscription. Our 
investigator did not uphold the complaint as she thought PayPal had done nothing wrong, as 
they acted on the instructions agreed.
Ms C disagreed with this and asked for the decision to be reviewed by an Ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms C is clearly very unhappy with this situation and has raised a number of concerns with 
what the service provider has done. Im aware that she has brought a complaint against the  
service provider with the relevant authorities. But I want to start by saying that this service 
cant investigate that complaint and so I can only focus on the role of PayPal here.
PayPal only had a limited role in acting as a payment service provider here. They arent 
responsible for the service and subscription that Ms C is unhappy with. PayPal have 
explained that Ms C confirmed the billing agreement and so they made the payments in 
accordance to this agreement.  The PayPal user agreement explains that Ms C could cancel 
billing agreements at any time with immediate effect by contacting them. This needs to be 
done in sufficient time to stop the payment before its processed. Theyd be able to cancel 
future payment but not the current transaction. In this case, Ms C cancelled the billing 
agreement after the payment was made so PayPal werent able to cancel it in time. 
I think that PayPal acted fairly, as when Ms C contacted them to say she forgot to cancel the 
subscription they cancelled the subscription in a timely manner. But PayPal explained that 
they couldnt refund the payment as it was cancelled after it was made. PayPal were never 
responsible for the increase in subscription - that was an agreement between Ms C and the 
service provider. So although I understand her frustrations around not cancelling this sooner, 
I dont think PayPal can be held responsible for this.
So, considering everything, I think PayPal have acted as I would expect them to here. I know 
Ms C will be disappointed, but it follows that I wont be asking them to do anymore.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 March 2021.
