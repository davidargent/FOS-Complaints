The complaint
Mrs V is unhappy ManyPets Ltd didnt send her vouchers she was entitled to following the 
renewal of her pet insurance policy in December 2022. 
What happened
Mrs V renewed her policy with ManyPets in December 2022. I understand as a reward for 
renewing she should have received £30 in vouchers. As Mrs V hadnt received her vouchers 
she contacted ManyPets. 
Around the same time she made a claim for a condition affecting her pet. Although the claim 
was agreed by her insurer, sadly her pet subsequently had to be put to sleep. Mrs V 
continued to contact ManyPets to try and obtain her vouchers and made clear how unhappy 
she was at having to pursue this issue at a difficult time. She was also unhappy ManyPets 
continued to ask for the name of her pet during calls as part of its security questions which 
she found distressing. 
In response to her complaint ManyPets said the voucher should have been sent by 21 
March 2023.  It accepted Mrs V hadnt been given clear information about this when she 
called and in any case the voucher hadnt been correctly applied when her policy renewed. It 
also accepted there had been other customer service issues and it would have been better 
to leave notes on Mrs Vs file to ensure alternative security questions were asked when she 
called. ManyPets said it would ensure the voucher was now sent and it would send a further 
voucher to the value of £40 to her. 
Our investigator agreed Mrs V hadnt received the service she should have expected from 
ManyPets. And taking into account that this was a particularly difficult time for her she 
thought it should pay £100 in recognition of the distress and inconvenience she was caused. 
Mrs V didnt think that was enough to recognise the impact of everything ManyPets had got 
wrong. ManyPets agreed to increase the compensation to £140. Mrs V thought it should pay 
£200. So I need to reach a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Mrs Vs voucher should have been emailed to her four weeks after her policy 
had been active for 45 days. I dont think its in dispute she wasnt given clear information 
about that when she first contacted ManyPets. And, as the voucher hadnt been correctly 
applied to her account, it wouldnt have been sent to that timeframe in any case. 
I appreciate that led Mrs V to make repeated calls to ManyPets to try and resolve the issue. I 
also recognise this was at a time when she was dealing with a condition affecting her pet 
(which sadly meant he later had to be put to sleep). I dont doubt that will have been 
distressing for her. I agree it would have avoided further upset if ManyPets had taken steps 
to ensure Mrs V was asked different security questions after her pet had been put to sleep. 
Ive gone on to think about what ManyPets should do to put things right. I appreciate Mrs V 
thinks it should pay her £200. But the focus of her response is on what ManyPets got wrong 
rather than the impact on her. And its that which I need to consider. I do accept this was a 
particularly distressing time for Mrs V but the loss of her pet would of course have been 
extremely upsetting regardless of anything ManyPets got wrong. I appreciate its failings are 
likely to have exacerbated her distress but taking everything into account I think the £140 its 
now agreed to pay (plus the voucher its already sent her) does enough to put things right. 
My final decision
Ive decided to uphold this complaint. ManyPets Ltd will need to pay Mrs V £140. Under the 
rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs V to accept or reject my 
decision before 27 September 2023.
