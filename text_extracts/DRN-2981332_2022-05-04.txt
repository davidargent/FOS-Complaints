The complaint
In summary, Mr S has complained that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua, irresponsibly provided 
him with a credit card and credit limit increases. 
What happened
In January 2015, NewDay provided Mr S with a credit card. The initial credit limit was £600. 
In April 2015, the credit limit was increased to £1,500 and in November 2015 it was 
increased to £1,800. The initial interest rate on the card was an APR of 29.7%. 
In its response to Mr Ss complaint, NewDay explained why it thought the credit card was 
affordable when it was first approved. It also thought the limit increase in April 2015 was also 
affordable. But it didnt think the limit increase in November 2015 should have been 
provided.  And as a result, it upheld his complaint in part. 
Mr Ss concerns were reviewed by one of our investigators. He explained that he thought the 
checks NewDay had carried out were proportionate when the card was taken out and the 
credit limit incresed. And he didnt think the limit increase in April 2015 was provided 
irresponsibly. He thought the refund in respect of the November credit limit increase had 
been carried out correctly. But he thought that in addition, NewDay needed to remove any 
adverse data in relation to the November 2015 credit limit increase and pay Mr S £100 for 
the upset he had been caused. 
In response, NewDay explained why it disagreed with the investigators recommendations. It 
didnt think negative data from 2015 should be removed.
As NewDay didnt agree with the investigators assessment of the complaint, it has been 
passed to me to review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to considering unaffordable and irresponsible lending complaints 
on our website - including the key relevant rules, guidance, good industry practice and law. 
And Ive considered this approach when deciding Mr Ss complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold Mr Ss complaint. Ill explain why.
There are several questions that Ive thought about when deciding if NewDay treated Mr S 
fairly and reasonably when it provided him with the credit card.
1) Did NewDay complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr S 
would be able to repay his credit card account in a sustainable way? 
2) If not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown at the time? 
3) Ultimately, did NewDay make a fair lending decision?  
4) Did NewDay act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Did NewDay complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr S would 
be able to repay the credit provided to him in a sustainable way? 
The rules that NewDay had to follow, required it to carry out checks that would enable it to 
reasonably assess, whether Mr S could afford to repay the credit card he was wanting to 
take out. This is often referred to as an affordability assessment. 
 
The rules dont set out what specific checks it needed to carry out, but they did set out that 
those checks needed to be proportionate to the circumstances of the application. I think what 
this meant in practice, was that the scope and extent of NewDays checks needed to take 
into account things such as the amount of credit being provided, the interest rate, Mr Ss 
financial circumstances and any indications of customer vulnerability.  
The checks NewDay needed to carry as part of its affordability assessment, had to be 
borrower focussed. What I mean by this, is that the checks needed to consider whether 
paying back the credit would cause Mr S any difficulties or have any adverse consequences 
for him. They would also need to take account of factors such as the amount of credit being 
provided, the interest applied on the credit card account, the monthly repayments and the 
total charge for the credit. This isnt an exhaustive list. 
And because of the above, I think reasonable and proportionate checks needed to be more 
thorough if Mr S had a low income. This would reflect that it could be more difficult for him to 
make the loan repayments with a low income. 
NewDay would also need to be more thorough with its checks if Mr S was on a lower income 
as it could more difficult to make monthly repayments on a low income. 
With these principles in mind Ive thought about whether NewDay completed reasonable and 
proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr S would be able to make repayments on his 
credit card account in a sustainable way.
In summary then, the circumstances of the credit card application are as follows:
Mr S was applying for a credit card which had an APR of 29.7%. 
Mr S was recorded by NewDay as having a gross annual income of approximately 
£40,000 a year when the card was taken out.
The initial credit limit was £600 which was then increased to £1,500 and £1,800. 
NewDay has said it did carry out some checks prior to approving Mr Ss credit application 
towards the end of January 2015. This seems to have been based on Mr Ss completed 
application form which included information about his income and carrying out a credit 
search. From the information I have it looks like the information NewDay obtained that Mr S 
had no outstanding CCJs or previously defaulted debt, hadnt any active pay day loans and 
no accounts that were in arrears. 
The initial credit provided was relatively modest taking into account the information NewDay 
had about Mr S. And I think in the context of the amount of credit being offered, Mr Ss 
financial circumstances and the information NewDay had from the checks it carried out, I 
believe NewDays checks were reasonable and proportionate. And that based on the information it had, it wasnt unreasonable for it to conclude that Mr S would be able to 
sustainably afford to repay the credit.
Ive also considered the subsequent limit increases. A few months later in April 2015, the 
credit limit was increased to £1,500. This was a significant increase on the original credit 
limit provided. This was a very short time after the initial credit had been provided. And it 
looks like NewDay obtained similar information to that which it had obtained in the January. 
This showed that Mr S had been managing his account within his credit limit with no arrears. 
He had total credit balances of just over £500. So, I dont think it was unreasonable based 
on the further information NewDay obtained and taking into account Mr Ss management of 
the account for NewDay to have increased his credit limit in April 2015.
NewDay accepts that it shouldnt have increased the credit limit again in November 2015. 
So, I dont need to make any findings in respect of liability regarding that credit limit increase. 
Ive considered the details of the loss calculation provided by NewDay. Im satisfied from the 
information provided to me that it has been carried out in line with this services approach to 
redress for cases such as this. But I dont agree with its arguments in respect of the 
correction of Mr Ss credit file. 
NewDay accepts that Mr S shouldnt have been provided with the increased credit limit in 
November 2015. And he only had the increased credit limit as a result of NewDay providing 
him with that additional credit. Its not clear if his increased spending was sustainable from 
other funds that he might have had. And its possible that his spending from that point may 
have been supported from other borrowing. So, I see no reason to depart from our 
recognised approach to compensation in this case.
Putting things right
In addition to the compensation payments it has made to Mr Ss credit card account, 
NewDay should remove any adverse information from Mr Ss credit file from November 2015 
onwards in relation to the credit card account. NewDay should also pay Mr S £100 in respect 
of the distress and inconvenience he has been caused by NewDay increasing his credit limit 
when it shouldnt have.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive set about above, my decision is to uphold Mr Ss complaint about 
NewDay Ltd. In addition to the compensation it has already paid, if Mr S accepts my 
decision; it needs to compensate Mr S by doing what Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 June 2022.
