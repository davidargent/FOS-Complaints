The complaint
Miss C says NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, irresponsibly lent to her.
What happened
Miss C applied for a credit card in March 2017. It was approved with a limit of £1,200 and 
she was given five subsequent credit limit increases by NewDay. 
The first increase in July 2017 was for £900 taking the limit to £2,100; the second in October 
2017 was for £1,000 increasing the limit to £3,100; the third in March 2018 was for £750 
increasing the limit to £3,850 and the fourth in May 2019 raised the limit by £1,200 to £5,050. 
The final increase was in January 2020 for £750 taking Miss Cs credit limit to £5,800.
Miss C says if NewDay had carried out proper checks it would have seen the credit was 
unaffordable. Its lending has made her financial position worse.
Our investigator upheld Miss Cs complaint in part. He said the initial lending decision was 
fair as was the first limit increase in July 2017, but from that point onwards it was most likely 
the increases would be sustainably unaffordable for Miss C and so they should not have 
been given.
NewDay disagreed. It said, in summary, the significant rise in debt at the time of the second 
increase was a hire purchase agreement costing £212 a month  so a single loan for a high 
value item. Miss C managed the extended credit for nearly three years after the third 
increase. And Miss C switched her direct debit from full payment to £100 from August 2017, 
but she was still paying more than the minimum required. In January 2018 she amended it 
again to only make the minimum contractual repayment.
As an agreement wasnt reached the complaint was passed to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to unaffordable/irresponsible lending - including all the relevant rules, 
guidance and good industry practice - is set out on our website and I have followed it here.
NewDay is required to lend responsibly. It needed to conduct checks to make sure that the
credit facilities it was giving to Miss C were affordable and sustainable. Such checks need to
be proportionate to things like the credit limits it offered Miss C, how much she had to repay
(including interest and charges) each month, her borrowing history with it and what it knew
about her circumstances. But there is no set list of checks it had to do.
This means to reach my decision I need to consider if NewDay carried out proportionate
checks at the time of Miss Cs card application and each limit increase; if so, did it make fair 
lending decisions based on the results of its checks; and if not, what better checks would 
most likely have shown. I also need to think about, bearing in mind the circumstances at the 
time of each additional advance in credit, whether there was a point at which NewDay ought 
reasonably to have realised it was increasing Miss Cs indebtedness in a way that was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful and so shouldnt have provided further credit.
The card application and initial limit
When Miss C applied for the credit card NewDay asked about her employment and 
residential status and for details of her gross annual income. It carried out a credit check to 
understand her credit history and existing credit commitments. NewDay has shared the 
results of these checks.
They show that Miss C declared an income of £20,800 and that she had £600 of debt. She 
had six active accounts that were all up-to-date. She did have some historic defaults but 
given the amount of credit, Miss Cs declared income a, low level of indebtedness and the 
fact all of Miss Cs active accounts were up-to-date I dont think it would have been 
proportionate for NewDay to have carried out a fuller financial review. So I think it was 
reasonable for NewDay to conclude the card and its repayments would be sustainably 
affordable for Miss C.  It follows I dont think NewDay was wrong to give Miss C the card.
The first credit limit increase in July 2017
NewDay offered Miss C a credit limit increase of £900 to £2,100 in July 2017. I think this was 
a significant increase and NewDay needed to be sure Miss C could sustainably repay a 
balance of £2,100 within a reasonable period of time. NewDays submission suggests that its 
decision to increase the credit limit on Miss Cs account was largely based on her account 
management. I have some concerns with this approach as its not clear to me why a 
borrower who is able to successfully manage a given credit limit can then automatically be 
deemed, without further checks at the time of the decision, to be able to successfully 
manage a higher limit. It seems to me that this logic would likely lead to continually 
increasing limits, unless or until problems arise.
But notwithstanding this, at the time of the first limit increase I can see that Miss C had 
repaid her account each month (NewDay has confirmed she had a full balance direct debit at 
this time) and the balance had been significantly under the limit in the months since the 
account was opened. So I can to an extent see why this may have led NewDay to conclude 
that Miss C was managing the account well. And although I dont think that this, in itself, 
means that NewDay knew Miss C was in a position to sustainably repay an increased 
balance within a reasonable period, I find that the decision to increase Miss Cs credit limit at 
this time wasnt unreasonable. In addition, NewDay could see that Miss Cs external 
borrowings had decreased by around 20% over the same time period.
It follows I dont think NewDay was wrong to give the first limit increase to Miss C.
The second credit limit increase in October 2017
Following the same approach, NewDay increased Miss Cs limit to £3,100 in October 2017. I 
wont comment on the proportionality of the checks as even based on the information it 
gathered I think NewDay made an unfair lending decision. Miss Cs account balance had 
increased five-fold since the previous credit limit increase, and she had reduced her monthly 
payments. It could see Miss Cs external debt had risen significantly from £6,265 to £19,055 
at the time of this limit increase. NewDay argues this was mainly a hire purchase agreement 
 so for one high value item - but this does not change the amount of her income Miss C 
would now need to spend on servicing her debt. And I think this was most likely much too 
high a percentage for it to be sustainable. In these circumstances I find it was irresponsible for NewDay to further increase her indebtedness.
It follows I think NewDay was wrong to increase Miss Cs limit in October 2017. 
In these circumstances, I think that NewDay ought to have realised that any subsequent 
extension of her available credit might have been unsustainable, especially in light of what 
Ive already said about the possibility of the amount owing taking up a significant portion of 
Miss Cs income. By January 2018 Miss C had changed her payment behaviour to only 
make the minimum payment and she was making no inroads into reducing her external debt 
either. So I think it was clear Miss C was going to struggle to repay what she owed 
sustainably  even without further increases  within a reasonable period of time. NewDay 
argues that Miss C managed the extended credit for nearly three years after the third 
increase. But as it has not shown that it knows she did this without borrowing to repay, or 
suffering some other financial detriment, this does not change my conclusion.
It follows I think NewDay was wrong to provide the subsequent three limit increases. 
This means Miss C went on to pay interest and charges on four advances of credit that 
shouldnt have been provided to her. So Im satisfied that she has lost out as a of what 
NewDay did wrong. And NewDay now needs to put things right.
Putting things right
NewDay should:
rework Miss Cs NewDay account to ensure that from October 2017 interest is only
charged on the first £2,100.00 outstanding, all late payment and over limit fees
should also be removed;
if an outstanding balance remains on Miss Cs account once all adjustments have 
been made NewDay should contact Miss C to arrange a suitable repayment plan for 
this; 
if the effect of all adjustments results in there no longer being an outstanding 
balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments and returned to Miss C 
along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from the date they were made 
until the date of settlement; and
amend Miss Cs credit file to remove all adverse information recorded from October 
2017 to date.
If NewDay has sold the debt it should first try to buy it back. If it cant do this it must work 
with the new owner to achieve the same outcome as the steps set out above.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest. NewDay must give
 Miss C a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
I am upholding Miss Cs complaint in part. NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, must put things 
right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 July 2022.
