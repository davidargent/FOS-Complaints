K821x#15Complaint
Mr N says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him.
Background
This complaint is about one running  account credit  facility  and twenty-eight high-cost short 
term credit  instalment loans that Sunny provided  to Mr N between  July 2014 and July 2018. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ns complaint and thought  that he shouldnt have been provided 
with instalment loans  5 to 28. Sunny disagreed. So the complaint was passed  to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the key relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr N could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided. Having 
looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr N, I think that Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that Mr N was unlikely to have been  able to make his payments  in a 
sustainable manner  by the time it provided Mr N with instalment loan 5. 
Ref: DRN08056592I say this because  Sunny initially transitioned  Mr N from a facility  which  its own product 
literature said shouldnt  be used  for extended periods to a series of instalment loans which  
had the same effect. Mr N then went on to exhibit a borrowing pattern of taking out further 
loans not too long after repaying previous ones. And some of them were even provided 
when Mr N already had an amount owing to Sunny. In my view Mr N was displaying  a 
borrowing pattern  consistent  with someone who may have been in financial difficulty rather 
than to cover  a short term need.
Sunny continued  lending  to Mr N even  when this pattern  was repeated  and in circumstances 
where it ought reasonably to have realised  that any further loans were more likely than not 
unsustainable for him. 
Mr N had to pay interest  and charges on loans that Sunny shouldnt  have provided him with. 
So I think that he lost out and Sunny should  put things right.
Putting things  right  what  Sunny needs to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr N paid on instalment  loans 5 to 28;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number of loans  provided means that any information recorded about instalment 
loans 5 to 28 is adverse.  So all reference  to these loans  should  be removed from Mr Ns 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr N a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ns complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr N compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 June 2020.
