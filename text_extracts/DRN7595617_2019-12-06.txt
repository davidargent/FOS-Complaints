K821x#15complaint
Miss L complained about the amount Mulsanne Insurance Company Limited  charged  for her 
car insurance policy.
background
Miss L bought her policy through a broker. The annual cost of the policy was £1,765.15, 
made up as follows:
Insurance premium  (charged by Mulsanne) £1,790.10
Service charge £   363.38
Personal accident cover £     29.95
£2,183.43
less broker discount £   418.28
£1,765.15
As Miss L paid by monthly instalments through a loan agreement, the total amount payable  
over the year was £2,097.00. The policy started  on 2 November  and Miss L decided to 
cancel it with effect from 9 January after she bought a new car.
The broker  told Miss L that shed need  to pay a further £331.69  for the period shed been  
insured for under the policy. This was calculated as follows:
Balance owing on the loan £1,165.13
Broker cancellation  charge £   125.00
£1,290.13
less insurance premium refunded by Mulsanne £   958.44
£   331.69
Miss L complained as she wasnt happy  with this given how much shed paid already. 
Mulsanne said it had acted in accordance with the terms and conditions  of the policy.
my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision which explained why I thought the complaint should be 
upheld. The main  points  from my decision are repeated below.
I only looked at how much Mulsanne had charged for the insurance. What  the broker  had 
charged was being  investigated under a separate complaint.
The policy said that if it was cancelled after the initial 14 day cooling off period the 
premium payable for the time on cover  would be calculated  in line with a scale  (which 
was detailed in the policy).  It also said that Mulsanne would charge a £20 administration 
fee. Miss L was insured for 68 days. According to the scale,  that meant Mulsanne would 
refund 60% of the premium  which in turn meant the policyholder had to pay 40% of the 
total premium.
The annual premium  charged by Mulsanne was £1,790.10. So Mulsannes refund  after 
cancellation should have been £1,074.06  (£1,790.10 x 60%)   meaning Miss L had to 
pay £716.04 to Mulsanne for the insurance cover  it provided. Id seen screen shots  from 
Mulsannes computer  system showing that it refunded £1,051.66 to the broker.
Ref: DRN75956172Mulsanne charged £22.40 for the administration fee  which  I understood was the £20 
plus 12% insurance premium tax. I asked Mulsanne  what work it did to justify the charge 
 particularly as it was the broker who administered the sale,  set up and cancellation of 
the policy. This was because irrespective of what a policy said, I considered it unfair for a 
business to charge  an administration fee unless it could show what the work it did was. I 
noted the broker had also charged an administration fee, and I thought  it was unfair  for 
both businesses to charge  a fee for the same  work.
Mulsanne explained that the fee covered  the electronic data interchange cost for 
receiving each  policy transaction  and the initial costs of setting  up the policy.  However, it 
agreed in this case to waive the charge. Waiving the charge  would  effectively add £22.40 
to the £1,051.66 already  refunded   bringing  the total refund up to £1,074.06. Overall, I 
thought that was a fair resolution  to the complaint  as it meant the amount  charged by 
Mulsanne was equal  to what  the policy said it could charge for the period  of time it 
insured Miss L.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I didnt receive anything further  from Miss L or Mulsanne. So as theres nothing further for 
me to consider, my final decision remains as outlined in my provisional  decision  for the 
same reasons.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  I require Mulsanne Insurance  Company  Limited  to pay Miss L 
£22.40, plus interest  at a rate of 8% simple  per annum calculated from 9 January 2019  
(when the policy was cancelled).
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 January 2020.
