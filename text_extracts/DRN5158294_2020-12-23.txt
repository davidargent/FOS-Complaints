K820x#14Complaint
DCL, a limited company,  complains WorldPay (UK) Limited unfairly ended its merchant 
services agreement and withheld  a £40,000 card payment. DCL wants the payment 
returned.
Background
On 29 March 2018 DCL entered into a merchant services agreement  with WorldPay  to take 
card payments from customers.  DCL  says it leases cars. Mr I and Mr A are directors of DCL 
and represent  DCL in bringing this complaint.
WorldPay decided to review DCL after the first card payment was made.  It asked DCL to 
evidence the nature of its business and asked for a number of documents. WorldPay  wasnt  
satisfied by what it received, and under  the terms of its agreement, it gave  DCL two months 
notice to end the agreement.
During this time, DCL took a card payment for £40,000. It says the payment was for damage 
caused to a vehicle it leased to a customer.  WorldPay decided  to deny DCL access the 
payment. It wasnt satisfied by what DCL had submitted  to establish the purpose of the 
payment.
Mr I and Mr A brought the complaint to our service.  An investigator decided  not to uphold the 
complaint. They found:
-The terms of the merchant services agreement allow WorldPay to withhold funds 
indefinitely. These  are terms DCL accepted when agreeing to the contract.
-WorldPay was able to terminate its relationship with DCL under the contract, and the 
decision was within its commercial discretion.
-It was open to Mr I and Mr A to provide further  information to WorldPay.
Mr I and Mr A disagreed with the outcome. They provided further information to evidence  the 
payment was made to pay for damage  caused  to one of DCLs vehicles. But WorldPay  again  
decided the information wasnt enough  to release the payment.
Mr I and Mr A asked  for a final decision  from an ombudsman. So, the complaint  has been 
given to me to decide.
 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive decided  not to uphold DCLs 
complaint for these  reasons:
-WorldPay could terminate its relationship with DCL under  the terms of the merchant 
services agreement. It gave sufficient  notice under  those terms. And Im satisfied this 
represented a reasonable period of time for DCL to make alternative arrangements.
Ref: DRN51582942-The terms of the merchant services agreement allowed  WorldPay to hold funds from 
DCL in specific circumstances. Ive reviewed  those terms and based on all the 
information Ive seen, Im satisfied WorldPay could rely on them.
-WorldPay has wide legal and regulatory  obligations it must  balance when providing a 
service to its customers. And sometimes its obligations continue  even after a 
customer relationship  has ended.  With this in mind,  I find WorldPay  was able to 
review DCLs account, and it could take reasonable steps to meet its responsibilities. 
If WorldPay didnt act where appropriate,  it could risk serious sanction. 
-I understand DCL says its provided  all it can to establish the basis for the payment. 
But on balance, I find WorldPay can still withhold the payment. Based on the 
information Ive seen, I understand WorldPays ongoing concern and I find its 
decision reasonable. My finding doesnt  of course  prevent  DCL from pursuing the 
matter in court, if it rejects my decision.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive given above,  Ive decided not to uphold  DCLs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr I and Mr A to 
accept or reject my decision  before  23 January 2021.
