The complaint
Mr P complains that Ford Retail Limited (trading as TrustFord)  mis sold him a Personal 
Contract Purchase (PCP) in relation to the interest due  on the final balloon payment. He 
would like compensation for the stress and inconvenience.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them here. 
Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so , I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these 
reasons:-
TrustFord has accepted Mr P was misled into believing he could extend his 
agreement for a further two years at 0% interest to cover the outstanding balloon 
payment (OBP)  when this was not the case.  
TrustFord made two offers to Mr P. One allowed him to  retain the car  on the 
financial basis he originally agreed to. The second offer which Mr P accepted allowed 
him to return the car, have  a refund of all of his monthly payments and the full value 
of the part exchange. I felt these two options were fair resolutions to Mr Ps 
complaint.
I dont think its reasonable to expect TrustFord to pay Â£2,500 compensation as Mr P 
would like. I accept there has been some inconvenience to Mr P . But I feel this has 
been reflected in the refund of all the monthly payments Mr P has made. And as 
there were no issues with the car  so Mr P has had use of the car whilst his 
complaint was being looked at.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 October 2020.
