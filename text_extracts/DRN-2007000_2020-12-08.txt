The complaint
Mr S complains that LeasePlan UK Limited held him liable for a balloon payment after he 
sold his van to a third party.
What happened
In February 2014 Mr S entered into a hire agreement with LeasePlan. The agreement was 
for 60 months.
In February 2019 Mr S asked LeasePlan if he could sell the van to a third party. It said he 
could and issued him with a settlement quote. In March 2019 Mr S sold the van to a third 
party and provided the third party with LeasePlans bank details so the third party could pay 
the balloon payment.
Mr S received an email from LeasePlan confirming that the vehicle contract had been 
terminated and that the new keeper section of the V5 had been sent to the third party.
LeasePlan subsequently contacted Mr S and told him he was liable for the balloon payment 
because the third party hadnt paid.
Mr S raised a complaint. In response, LeasePlan said it hadnt received the balloon payment 
and responsibility fell on Mr S as the lease holder.
Mr S was unhappy with the response and complained to this service.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. He said he couldnt see anything in the terms and 
conditions which stated that liability fell back to the leaseholder in the event of uncleared 
funds. He said liability for the balloon payment should be waived for Mr S.
LeasePlan didnt agree. It said Mr S was obliged to pay the balloon payment under the terms 
and conditions of the agreement.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the sales invoice dated 1 March 2019 provided by Mr S. This gives details of 
the third party and includes LeasePlans bank details for the third party to make payment.
Ive also looked at the email sent by LeasePlan to Mr S dated 26 March 2019. This confirms 
that the agreement has been terminated and that the V5 will be issued to the new keeper.
I can also see that Mr S paid the sales fee and received a refund of his road tax.
Taking all of the above into account, Im satisfied that it was reasonable for Mr S to believe 
that the third party had made payment and that the agreement had been terminated. Hes 
explained that he handed the van over to the third party having received this email.
LeasePlan has said that Mr S remains liable for the balloon payment under the terms and 
conditions of the agreement. However, I dont think its fair for LeasePlan to terminate an 
agreement, confirm termination to the customer and then later seek to recover payment of 
sums due under it. 
LeasePlan has said that it didnt receive funds from the third party. But it has acknowledged 
that when Mr S called to check that payment had been made, he was advised that the 
account had been cleared. LeasePlan has also said that it told Mr S that it had issued the V5 
to the third party. It says it was after this that the third-party payment was returned by the 
bank.
Putting things right
LeasePlan should waive the balloon payment as against Mr S. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. LeasePlan must waive the balloon payment 
as against Mr S.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2021.
