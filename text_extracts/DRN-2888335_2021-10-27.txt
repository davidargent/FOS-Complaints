The complaint
Mrs L and Mr W complain about errors and delays when they applied for a mortgage with 
National Westminster Bank plc. They ask for compensation and sincere apologies.
What happened
Mrs L and Mr W applied to NatWest for a mortgage in July 2020. They say NatWest asked 
for information that wasnt necessary, changed its lending terms, sent the mortgage offer to 
the wrong solicitor and caused other delays. Mrs L and Mr W say they paid for a 
homebuyers report which wasnt carried out and since moving in theyve found many 
problems with the property.
Our investigator said while NatWest made errors the compensation it paid (£900 in total) 
was fair and reasonable. It was entitled to ask Mrs L and Mr W for evidence of their income. 
While NatWest made an error when it didnt instruct a full survey, Mrs L and Mr W were 
aware of this before they exchanged contracts and decided to proceed anyway. Our 
investigator said it wasnt fair to require NatWest to pay for repairs to Mrs L and Mr Ws 
house.
NatWest accepted it caused a delay when it sent the mortgage offer to the wrong solicitor. It 
said it would pay further compensation for Mrs L and Mr Ws rent and storage costs if they 
provided evidence.
Mrs L and Mr W didnt agree. They said their bank statements (for their accounts with 
NatWest) are proof of their rental and storage costs. Mr W said theyd already spent £6,000 
on repairs with more to do and if theyd had the benefit of a survey theyd have negotiated a 
lower purchase price. They asked to see the independent report on the property arranged by 
NatWest.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest made errors with Mrs L and Mr Ws mortgage application. I have to decide what 
compensation is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
Problems with the survey/valuation
Mrs L and Mr W asked for a homebuyers report. NatWest instructed a desk top valuation 
instead. This was an error. NatWest refunded the difference in cost. However, Mrs L and 
Mr W say they have financial loss due to the error. They say there are problems with the 
property that will cost money to sort out. And they missed the chance to re-negotiate the 
purchase price.
NatWest arranged for a homebuyers report to be carried out in late October 2020. This 
identified work needed to the property. The surveyor said the property is considered to be a 
reasonable purchase at the agreed price of £130,000, provided you are prepared to accept 
the cost and inconvenience of dealing with the various repair/improvement works reported. 
The valuation of the property didnt change as a result of the more detailed survey. So it 
seems the work needed didnt affect the value, or was taken into account in the original 
valuation and the purchase price.
Mr W said he asked for a homebuyers report so hed be aware of the costs of work needed 
and could negotiate with the vendor. This suggests he expected some work was needed. 
Some of the problems (such as with the boiler) might have been revealed by the vendors 
responses to questions from Mrs L and Mr Ws solicitor, a usual part of the conveyancing 
process. Mr W and Mrs L said when they moved in there were gaps in the windows and 
damage to the ceilings, which is likely to have been visible when they viewed the property (if 
they did). It seems likely Mrs L and Mr W knew some work to the property was needed. 
I can understand that Mr W and Mrs L wanted to know what works were needed, and how 
much this might cost. Mr W said they didnt know a homebuyers report hadnt been done 
until their solicitor said they were ready for completion, by which point it was too late to 
change matters. But I think Mr W and Mrs L must have known a homebuyers report hadnt 
been carried out by early August as NatWest responded to their complaint about this on 7 
August 2020. This was more than a month before contracts were exchanged on 11 
September 2020, so it would have been possible to arrange a survey if that was what they 
wanted to do. It seems though that Mrs L and Mr W decided to go ahead without a 
homebuyers report.
Even if Mr W and Mrs L had received a homebuyers report, theres no guarantee the vendor 
would have agreed a lower price.
I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to pay compensation for the cost of 
repairs and improvements to the property, or any discount Mr W might or might not have 
negotiated with the vendor.
Mr W said they hadnt received the independent report arranged by NatWest in late 2020. 
The homebuyers report dated 27 October 2020 was sent to Mr W and Mrs L by the surveyor 
 in fact Mr W sent a copy to NatWest. NatWest asked another firm of surveyors for its 
comments on this. Our investigator sent a copy of these comments to Mr W in April 2021. 
Im not aware of any other reports relevant to this, and I think its unlikely there are any.
Timescales and delays
Mrs L and Mr W applied for a mortgage on 1 July and NatWest issued an offer on 24 July 
2020. NatWest sent the mortgage offer to the wrong solicitor. It re-sent the offer to the 
correct solicitor on 10 August. Mrs L and Mr W exchanged contracts and completed their 
purchase on 10 September 2020.
Given the wider circumstances at that time due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I dont think the 
mortgage took an unreasonably long time overall. But there was an unnecessary delay of 
just over two weeks caused by NatWest sending the mortgage offer to the wrong solicitor. 
Mrs L and Mr W say that they had to pay rent and storage for an extra month because of this 
delay. NatWest said it would compensate them for part of this cost if they provide evidence. 
Our investigator asked Mr W and Mrs L for receipts or statements, but they didnt agree to 
provide this. Mr W said NatWest could see the payments on Mrs Ls NatWest bank 
statements which he said are easy enough for it to find. Before issuing this decision I gave Mrs L and Mr W another opportunity to send evidence of 
their rent and storage costs. Again, they didnt provide evidence. Without evidence of the 
costs (such as invoices, receipts, bank statements or emails evidencing what Mr W and 
Mrs L paid) I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to make a payment to 
Mr W and Mrs L. 
Asking for unnecessary information, changing lending criteria and other errors
Some of the issues Mrs L and Mr W complain about werent errors. NatWest was entitled to 
ask for evidence of their income and didnt have to rely on looking at the bank accounts they 
have with it. And its entitled to make a commercial decision about its lending criteria  such 
as the deposit it requires. I dont think it was unreasonable for NatWest to make some 
changes to its criteria and processes to take account of the pandemic. 
However, NatWest did make errors. Mrs L and Mr W were told wrongly their application was 
declined. They asked to cancel their application. Instead their application was re-submitted 
which they say they didnt ask for (although they did then proceed with the mortgage). They 
were told their complaint hadnt been logged. NatWest sent the mortgage offer to the wrong 
solicitor.
What does NatWest need to do now?
Ive explained why I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to pay 
compensation for Mr W and Mrs Ls storage or rent costs, or the costs of works on the 
property or any discounts they might have agreed with the vendor. 
NatWest paid £900 compensation to Mrs L and Mr W for the upset and trouble its errors 
caused, as follows:
£300 for not making its process clearer.
£250 for errors that led to it sending the mortgage offer to the wrong solicitor.
£100 for not instructing the right type of survey/valuation. 
£250 for the time taken to investigate their complaint. 
Having considered what both parties have said, I think this is fair and reasonable 
compensation in the circumstances for the inconvenience and upset caused. 
Mr W and Mrs L arent happy with the apologies they received from NatWest, which they say 
are generic. They ask that each person at NatWest they dealt with provides a sincere 
apology. Im not going to require NatWest to do this. I cant see that an apology which 
NatWest is required to make will be any more sincere or meaningful than the apologies it 
has already voluntarily made.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. This is because I find the compensation 
paid by National Westminster Bank PLC is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L and Mr W to 
accept or reject my decision before 24 November 2021.
