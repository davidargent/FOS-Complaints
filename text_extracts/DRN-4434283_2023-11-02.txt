The complaint
Mrs B complains that NewDay Ltd failed to prevent a payment of £159.09 being taken from 
her account; and that it has handled things poorly and caused her distress and 
inconvenience.
What happened
The background to this complaint is well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything 
here. In brief summary, Mrs B has explained that in April 2023 she saw a product she was 
interested in on Facebook from a merchant Ill call S; to get a price, she had to fill in certain 
details; she clicked confirm; then before she knew it, she had a message on her phone from 
NewDay asking if she recognised a transaction of £159.09 to S. This led to Mrs B and 
NewDay speaking on the phone, and NewDay cancelling the transaction. But the same 
payment was subsequently then allowed through. 
Ultimately, Mrs B has remained unhappy with NewDay, so she referred her complaint about 
NewDay to us. Our Investigator wasnt able to resolve things informally, so the case has 
been passed to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusion as our Investigator and for materially the 
same reasons. That is, Im satisfied NewDays offer to resolve this complaint is fair and 
reasonable. I acknowledge the strength of Mrs Bs feelings on the matter and I can see shes 
been really upset about things. But I have to be reasonable. I think in this case NewDay 
could have done better, but overall £100 compensation is fair. Ill explain why. 
First let me clarify what this decision is about. I understand NewDay has given Mrs B the 
£159.09 back (in amounts of £158.69 in May 2023 and 40p very recently; if NewDay hasnt 
yet refunded the 40p it should do so now). So, Mrs B hasnt suffered a direct loss from the 
payment now. I understand the final outcome of the chargeback may have been pending but 
this seems to now be settled in Mrs Bs favour. So, this decision isnt about a direct loss from 
the payment, and if the chargeback failed for any reason that would be a matter for Mrs B to 
raise separately with NewDay in the first instance. Instead, what this decision is about is 
Mrs Bs dissatisfaction with how NewDay handled things and the distress and inconvenience 
she says it has caused her. 
I understand Mrs B says she was expecting the payment to be approximately £50 (not 
£159.09); and so when NewDay first messaged her asking if she recognised the transaction, 
she responded to say she didnt (because it was for the wrong amount). This led to Mrs B 
and NewDay speaking on the phone. During this call, NewDay explained the transaction had 
been flagged by its fraud prevention system. Mrs B then said that she did recognise the 
transaction but she didnt want it to go through, saying I dont want it to go through, yes, 
sorry, I made a mistake. I was looking at it, it got a bit complicated, and I pressed send and I 
didnt want to. NewDay said, Thats not a problem, the transaction itself was declined so it 
hasnt gone through. NewDay went on  following checks such as sending a One Time 
Passcode to Mrs B  to clear the restriction on her account the flag had implemented, so 
Mrs B could spend on her card again. And it told Mrs B that if she gave it five to ten minutes, 
her card should be back to normal, so if she wanted to go ahead with the transaction again 
(which Mrs B said she didnt) then she could do so. 
Mrs B is very upset because I understand she says she went away from this call thinking the 
payment couldnt now be taken by S. But then a payment of £159.09 to S was nonetheless 
taken from her account. However, I have to be fair and say this is not what NewDay told 
Mrs B exactly. Ive no doubt, however, that with the benefit of hindsight, NewDay would wish 
it had, during the call, been absolutely clear with Mrs B that it had declined the first 
attempted transaction from S, but that because it was removing the restriction from her 
account caused by the flag so she could spend again, S could attempt the transaction again 
(to take payment for the order Mrs B had placed) which wouldnt then necessarily be 
declined. 
However, I have to be reasonable and proportionate here. When a business like NewDay 
messages a customer like this to check whether they recognise a particular transaction, it 
would be normally primarily checking whether the payment stems from unauthorised activity 
by a third party not initiated or recognised by the customer. And in some cases, it might be 
looking into whether its customer is at risk of financial harm from a scam. In other words, 
NewDays intervention here would not have been from the perspective of supervising 
genuine transactions between a consumer and merchant. So whilst I understand Mrs B has 
questioned what the point would be of NewDay contacting her and cancelling the transaction 
if a fraudster could just put the payment through again (with success), I dont think thats fair 
here. Mrs B didnt say she was being scammed or that someone else must have made the 
transaction. She said shed made a mistake and didnt want the payment to go through. 
NewDay said thats okay because the payment declined anyway. And I think it was 
reasonable enough, from the information Mrs B gave it on the call, for NewDay to feel 
comfortable that the £159.09 payment didnt stem from unauthorised activity by a third-party, 
and that Mrs B wasnt actively being scammed; but instead, shed simply gone online and 
instructed a payment which she now wasnt happy with. So I dont think it acted 
unreasonably. 
Ive thought about what Mrs B has said about NewDay indicating in a later call with her that it 
would have suspicions about merchants like S. But I think this was part of NewDay trying to 
figure out and talk through what might have happened with Mrs B before everything was 
clear. However, in this call NewDay was talking as though the transaction wasnt genuine, 
when this is not exactly what Mrs B told NewDay on the first call  instead she said she had 
made the transaction in error and she wanted it cancelled. That is not the same thing as 
saying she did not recognise the transaction at all. And Ive not seen anything to make me 
think NewDay reasonably ought to have thought at the outset that there was something 
untoward about the merchant before the £159.09 was then taken from the account, which its 
important to note, stemmed from Mrs Bs earlier activity and I understand the merchant was 
attempting to take payment again so it could process Mrs Bs order (and as the parties are 
aware, S subsequently did process Mrs Bs order and send it to her. And Mrs B returned this 
to S and sought a refund through chargeback which NewDay assisted with).
So, whilst Ive considered everything Mrs B has said, Im satisfied NewDays offer to pay 
Mrs B £100 compensation is fair and reasonable. I say this because:
As Ive explained above, I can understand how the (second) payment of £159.09 
ended up going through. NewDay could have been clearer about this. But bearing in 
mind what Mrs B said on the phone, I can understand why it did what it did.Ive listened to the calls between Mrs B and NewDay and I think NewDay genuinely 
tried its best to help resolve things for her. For example, it explained at an early stage 
that it declines (as it puts it) per transaction unless a customer is actively being 
scammed, which Mrs B apparently wasnt; so whilst it stopped the first transaction, 
this wouldnt automatically prevented future attempts. I think it did its best to help this 
make sense to Mrs B, in circumstances where she was very upset, and I think it was 
sympathetic.
There was always going to be some level of distress and inconvenience involved in 
trying to recover the money through the chargeback process. 
NewDays final response letter wasnt the best. But overall, in this case, I cant say it 
would be fair or proportionate for me to tell NewDay to pay Mrs B more than £100 for 
distress and inconvenience given what Ive said, irrespective of Mrs Bs point about 
this only amounting to £85 in reality due to her costs.
I appreciate Mrs B will be very disappointed. And as Ive said, I acknowledge her strength of 
feelings on the matter. However, I think after Mrs B initiated the transaction there was 
realistically always going to be some level of distress and inconvenience involved. I dont 
think I can fairly hold NewDay responsible for that beyond the £100 it has already offered. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold this complaint in part and I direct NewDay Ltd to pay 
Mrs B £100 compensation for distress and inconvenience (if its not already done so).
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2023.
