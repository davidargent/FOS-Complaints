The complaint
Miss F complained because NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, increased her credit limit. She 
said NewDay didnt check she could afford to pay it back.
Miss F wants NewDay to refund all interest charged on her card, and to remove all negative 
information from her credit file.
What happened
In February 2018, Miss F applied for a NewDay credit card, because she wanted to improve 
her credit score. She told NewDay that she was employed and earned £17,000 a year and 
had an unsecured debt of £1,000. NewDay checked that she had no defaults, no adverse 
public records, no pay day loans, and no accounts in arrears. So it opened a new account 
for Miss F with a credit limit of £250. 
NewDay increased Miss Fs credit limit four times:
- In July 2018, from £250 to £800
- In December 2018, from £800 to £2,300
- In April 2019, from £2,300 to £3,300 and 
- In October 2019, from £3,300 to £3,700.
Before each increase, NewDay sent Miss F a letter giving her 40 days notice that it planned 
to increase her limit. The letters all gave her the option of not increasing the limit. They 
included this wording, or similar wording:
Make sure you can afford it
We always try to make sure were lending responsibly. So before you decide what to do, its 
important to carefully consider whether you need, or can afford, a higher limit. A higher limit 
may offer greater flexibility and convenience but it can also increase the risk of taking on too 
much debt, which may be costly, or take a long time to pay off.
In June 2020, Miss F asked for a credit limit increase to £4,500, but NewDay refused. In July 
2020, she asked for a credit limit increase to £4,000, but NewDay refused that too.
On 26 August 2020, Miss F contacted NewDay to say she was in financial difficulties.  She 
was working fewer hours because of the Covid pandemic. NewDay set up a three month 
payment holiday, which it later extended.
In February 2021, Miss F complained to NewDay. She said that you just carried on 
increasing my limit without ever asking me just like a gift. Miss F said NewDay hadnt 
checked she could afford to pay back the money and probably all you could see is that I am 
responsible and always pay back my debt. She also said that her only income was around 
£1,300 a month, and she had a bank loan for £5,000 and a large overdraft, which she was 
trying to balance with regular outgoings. She said shed just been scraping by when NewDay 
kept giving her more money she couldnt afford to spend. Miss F said she had constant 
anxiety and was worried about paying her bills and being able to afford food.
NewDay didnt uphold Miss Fs complaint. It said that every time there had been an increase, 
NewDay had given her the chance to refuse them. And it said that every time it had offered 
an increase, it had checked:
- whether Miss F had exceeded her current limit
- whether there were late or missed payments
- what payments Miss F had made
- the proportion of the credit limit shed used
- how she used the credit limit
- management of any other NewDay accounts
- any internal and external repayment plans
- any Pay Day loan history
- arrears status of external accounts
- overall external credit which Miss F had accessed to and used.
NewDay said that based on these factors, it had offered the credit limit increases correctly. It 
also said that when Miss F told them about financial difficulties in August 2020, it had set up 
a payment holiday. It pointed out that Miss F hadnt previously told them about any impact 
on her mental health, and said it had a specialist team which could have provided support if 
shed asked. NewDay said that in the light of Miss Fs comments, it had closed her account 
for more spending, but shed need to carry on making payments by the due date each month 
to pay off the balance. It said its customer care team would be in touch, and provided details 
of charities which could help with budgeting and a way of repaying credit.
Miss F wasnt satisfied and complained to this service. She said that NewDay had assumed 
that because she hadnt failed to make any payments, she wasnt in difficulties. She didnt 
think NewDay had carried out any credit checks before the increases. She said her income 
was about £1,330 a month, and shed borrowed money to pay her credit card, and she now 
had a bank loan for £5,000, a £3,000 overdraft, and another loan for £6,000. Miss F said she 
did take responsibility and shouldnt have applied for the credit card in the first place. The 
Covid pandemic hadnt helped because she was working fewer hours, and had constant 
anxiety about her debts.
Miss F asked for all interest to be refunded, and any negative information to be removed 
from her credit file.
Our investigator didnt uphold Miss Fs complaint. She said that NewDay had obtained 
detailed information from the credit reference agencies before each increase. And Miss Fs 
statements didnt show any evidence that she was struggling financially  her account was 
being managed very well. The credit reference information showed that Miss Fs overall 
indebtedness increased significantly from around December 2019  but that was after the 
final credit limit increase.
Miss F was still unhappy. She said that shed had to borrow money to pay off part of her debt 
to NewDay. She felt it was unfair to say that the fact she was paying each month meant she 
wasnt struggling financially. Miss F said that paying by credit card was, for her, the definition 
of financial difficulty. She believed that NewDay should have asked her for details of her 
income and outgoings. Miss F also said that shed applied to NewDay for a loan, before she 
applied for the loan she took out in December 2019  and NewDay had refused her, but had 
kept increasing her credit limit on her credit card. Miss F said shes suffered sleepless nights 
and anxiety, worrying about what would happen if she didnt make payments, and how to 
buy food and everyday essentials.
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear that Miss F is so worried about her financial situation. I hope shell feel able 
to contact one of the debt charities which are listed in NewDays final response letter, as well 
as NewDays own customer help team. Debt charities can work with people to go through a 
budget, and work out a way of dealing with debt. I hope this will help Miss F, but my job is 
just to look at whether NewDay acted unfairly towards Miss F when it offered her the four 
credit increases on her card.
There isnt a set list of checks which a lender has to carry out, but the rules and guidance 
say that checks have to be reasonable and proportionate.  The Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA), which regulates consumer credit, sets out that lenders should carry out reasonable 
and proportionate checks before agreeing any lending.
Ive looked at what NewDays records show it looked at, when it offered Miss F the credit 
limit increases between July 2018 and October 2019. NewDays spreadsheet shows a 
number of elements which it considered. Miss Fs NewDay payment history showed that she 
made payments on time, and usually paid significantly more than the minimum payment. 
There were also no missed payments, defaults or arrangements to pay, recorded anywhere 
on her file.  There were no pay day loans. The large loans to which Miss F refers were taken 
out in December 2019, after NewDays four credit limit increases.
I see that Miss F says she applied to NewDay before taking out the large December 2019 
loan, and it refused. It also refused her requests for more credit in summer 2020. I think 
these refusals also indicate that NewDays processes did involve checks and it didnt just 
accept all requests for increased lending.
Miss F believes NewDay should have checked her income at the time of the credit limit 
increases. I understand why she feels this, and a lender takes a risk if it doesnt check a 
customers income. But here, none of the data, from Miss Fs NewDay account, or her other 
financial data, indicated any problem with affordability between July 2018 and October 2019. 
Taking into account the fact that there was no adverse data on Miss Fs credit file when 
NewDay checked it, and shed been managing her account well with no missed payments, I 
find that between July 2018 and October 2019 there was no reason for NewDay to be 
concerned that Miss F would find the new limits unaffordable or unsustainable. 
Ive also seen copies of the letters which were sent to Miss F before each credit limit 
increase was set up. These do give her the option of turning down the increase  together 
with a warning to take care before taking on a higher limit. So I cant say that NewDay 
should have known, between July 2018 and October 2019, that Miss F would find the 
increases unaffordable. The data shows that it was only after that, that Miss F began to have 
financial difficulties. 
So I dont require NewDay to refund all interest charged under the terms and conditions of 
the account. And credit file data has to be reported accurately, so I dont require NewDay to 
remove any adverse credit information.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or reject my decision before 10 November 2021.
