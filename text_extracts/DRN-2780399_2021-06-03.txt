The complaint
 Mrs B complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) didnt agree to a refund for a 
purchase.
What happened
In May 2020, Mrs B bought a diamond ring online for £750, and paid via PayPal. When she 
received it, she said it wasnt what she thought shed agreed to buy and opened a claim with 
PayPal in October 2020. She said she would accept a refund of £375 if she could keep the 
ring. PayPal declined the claim in November 2020 as she hadnt returned the ring to the 
seller.
Mrs B complained that PayPal hadnt dealt with her claim fairly. PayPal didnt ask her for any 
evidence. She couldnt speak to their disputes team directly and didnt get a response to her 
complaint. She said the advertisement had said the ring was hallmarked, with a clarity of 
VS1 and weight of diamonds 0.75/0.85. But when she received it- it wasnt hallmarked and 
had a lower grade of clarity and weight of diamond. She said to PayPal that she would 
accept a refund of £375 if she could keep the ring  but PayPal then said she had to return 
the ring to the seller to get this  so she wouldnt have the ring and be out of pocket. Mrs B 
couldnt take the ring to a jeweller immediately to have it looked at because of the pandemic.  
PayPal referred to their User Agreement. They said they considered Mrs Bs claim didnt 
qualify for its Buyer Protection as the item was properly described but didnt meet Mrs Bs 
expectations -  i.e. it was Buyer Remorse  that is, Mrs B simply didnt like the ring, as 
opposed to it being considered as Significantly Not as Described (and so would get Buyer 
Protection). They agreed with the seller that Mrs B could have a refund of £375 if she 
returned the ring. When she didnt do that by their deadline (15 November 2020), they 
declined her claim. PayPal said to us that Mrs B had taken a long time to lodge her claim  
five months.
Mrs B brought her complaint to our service. Our investigator looked at what had happened. 
He couldnt understand why PayPal had agreed to the refund of £375 if Mrs B returned the 
ring  that made no sense, as she wouldnt have the ring and wouldve lost half her money. 
Based on what Mrs B had shown him - he considered that the item was Significantly Not as 
Described  and therefore qualified for PayPals Buyer Protection. PayPal should allow Mrs 
B to return the ring to the seller for a full refund and pay £75 to Mrs B for distress and 
inconvenience.
PayPal didnt agree and asked that Mrs Bs complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The critical issue here is  PayPal say that Mrs B simply didnt receive what she was 
expecting to get  that is, she didnt like the ring - and that it was properly described by the 
seller. If that were the case, then Mrs B wouldnt get PayPals buyer protection  as their 
User Agreement says PayPal Buyer Protection may apply when you encounter these 
specific problems with a transaction:
You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an Item Not Received 
claim), or
You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a 
Significantly Not as Described claim).
PayPal said that Mrs B received the ring she paid for, but it didnt meet her expectations  
and their User Agreement says in those circumstances An item may not be considered 
Significantly Not as Described if:. The item was properly described but did not meet 
your expectations.
PayPal saw Mrs Bs comments to the seller when she opened her dispute which said 
The ring is lovely, I dont dispute that but it is not what I thought I had purchased. I would 
accept a refund to the value of a second hand ring of that quality with no hallmark and SI 
quality stones or will send back for a full refund.  They appear to have interpreted this to 
mean that the ring was as described, but she simply didnt like it  and so she didnt get the 
benefit of the Buyer Protection. And so, PayPal agreed that Mrs B could have half of the cost 
back if she returned the ring to the seller. 
I can see that PayPal didnt ask for any evidence from Mrs B. She paid for the ring to be 
examined and reported by a jeweller. Weve seen the report. It says the ring wasnt 
hallmarked, had a clarity of S1 and weight of diamonds of 0.69. And - Ive seen the 
correspondence between Mrs B and the seller before the sale was completed - which 
said the ring was hallmarked, with diamond clarity of VS1 (i.e. better than S1) and weight 
of diamonds 0.75/0.85 (i.e. heavier). So  the ring as supplied didnt match what the 
seller claimed. Its unfortunate that PayPal didnt ask for and review this evidence. To 
me, this clearly shows that the ring was Significantly Not as Described  and qualifies for 
PayPals Buyer Protection.
PayPal have said that Mrs B didnt raise her dispute for five months  and that was 
unreasonable. But Ive not found anything about time limits in PayPals User Agreement. 
And, Mrs B has said to us that she wasnt able to go out to a jeweller because of her and 
her familys medical condition  this is understandable.
So, I dont think PayPal acted fairly and I think they should ask the seller to reimburse 
Mrs B the full price of the ring  provided she returns it to the seller. And, because shes 
clearly suffered some distress and inconvenience, PayPal should pay £75 in recognition 
of that.
Putting things right
 PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should:Agree that Mrs B returns the ring to the seller and is reimbursed for its cost - £750
Pay compensation of £75 to Mrs B for distress and inconvenience.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should:
 Agree that Mrs B returns the ring to the seller and is reimbursed for its cost - £750
Pay compensation of £75 to Mrs B for distress and inconvenience. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 July 2021.
