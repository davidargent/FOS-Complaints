The complaint
Mr I complains Evergreen Finance London Limited trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk 
(MoneyBoat) lent to him irresponsibly. He also says MoneyBoat delayed updating his credit 
file.  
What happened
Mr I took four instalment loans, ranging from £200 to £350, between May 2017 and October 
2017. 
Our adjudicator didnt think it was wrong for MoneyBoat to have granted the first three loans. 
But he said that loan 4 shouldnt have been lent.
 
MoneyBoat agreed loan 4 shouldnt have been lent. And following further discussion, it 
agreed to write off the loan and remove adverse information about the loan from Mr Is credit 
file. Mr I accepted the offer on 9 January 2020 and the adjudicator informed MoneyBoat 
about the acceptance the same day.
 
It appears MoneyBoat cleared Mr Is outstanding balance on 10 January 2020. But it said, 
for one credit reference agency, it was unable to ask for the loan to be removed from the 
credit file. So, it asked Mr I to arrange a dispute with the credit reference agency. Mr I didnt 
think this was a reasonable request. 
Ultimately, the credit reference agency removed the loan from the credit file in November 
2020 following a request from MoneyBoat. 
Our second adjudicator didnt think MoneyBoat did all it couldve done to update the credit 
file. So, he thought MoneyBoat should pay Mr I £100 for the trouble and upset caused. 
MoneyBoat hasnt responded to the assessment.
 
It appears Mr I agrees with the adjudicators assessment. But he would like the fact that 
MoneyBoat hasnt responded to the second adjudicators assessment to be considered.    
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
To be clear Im not considering here which loans were irresponsibly lent as the issue is no 
longer in dispute. Both Mr I and MoneyBoat accepted the adjudicators assessment about 
the loans, this being that MoneyBoat was wrong to lend loan 4. Mr I then accepted the offer 
to write off loan 4 and to remove adverse information about the loan from his credit file. 
I can see that MoneyBoat decided in the end to remove the loan entirely from Mr Is credit 
file. But I dont think this affects the outcome of the complaint as to whether it took 
reasonable steps or not in updating the credit file. 
 
As our adjudicator has explained, lenders (such as MoneyBoat) that supply data to credit 
reference agencies are required to ensure that the data is accurate, up to date and that it 
meets agreed quality standards. And lenders should take reasonable steps to do so. 
Ive reviewed what the adjudicator has said about the way MoneyBoat handled the removal 
of loan 4 from Mr Is credit file and what has happened with Mr Is complaint up until now. Im 
satisfied that the adjudicator has considered everything that has happened. And I agree that 
the complaint should be upheld for broadly the same reasons as the adjudicator.
MoneyBoat accepts that it doesnt have anything to support its position that the onus was on 
Mr I to raise a dispute with the credit reference agency in question. And this credit reference 
agency has told this Service that for MoneyBoat to make a change to Mr Is credit file it 
would need to ..simply contact us to request the change. 
So, given what the credit reference agency has said, it seems that MoneyBoat couldve been 
in a position to update the credit file. But it didnt do this until 9 September 2020. 
Subsequently the credit reference agency confirmed removal of the loan on 30 November 
2020.
I recognise Mr I could have contacted the credit reference to raise a dispute and this may 
have resulted in the credit file being updated sooner. Im satisfied though that MoneyBoat 
failed to administer the removal of the loan properly. Given what the credit reference agency 
told us it appears there was no need for Mr I to raise a dispute and it seems MoneyBoat 
could have reasonably asked for the loan to be removed when Mr I accepted the offer. 
Fortunately, it doesnt appear that Mr I suffered an actual financial loss because of the delay 
(such as increased lending costs). And whilst I appreciate, he is disappointed MoneyBoat 
hasnt responded to our latest assessment, this hasnt affected the progress of the 
complaint. 
Putting things right
Overall, Im satisfied that the award of £100 proposed by the adjudicator is a fair outcome in 
the circumstances. The £100 award considers the fact that Mr I went through unnecessary 
trouble and upset whilst waiting for his credit file to be updated.
So, I think it would be fair for MoneyBoat to pay Mr I £100 for the trouble and upset caused 
by the delay in updating his credit file.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Mr Is complaint in part. 
Evergreen Finance London Limited trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk. should put things right as 
directed above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 September 2021.
