The complaint
Mr and Mrs C complain that GE Money Consumer Lending Limited has rejected the claim 
that theyve made under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Their complaint is 
being dealt with by their representative.
What happened
Mr and Mrs C entered into an acquisition agreement to buy a timeshare membership in 
October 2007. They also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with GE Money at the 
same time to pay Â£15,000 towards the cost of the timeshare. Their representative made a 
claim to GE Money in October 2017 under section 75 that the timeshare had been mis-sold 
to them.
GE Money said that the debtor-creditor-supplier relationship required for a claim under 
section 75 didnt exist in these circumstances and that any claim that they might otherwise 
have had was time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980. Mr and Mrs C werent satisfied with 
that response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. He said that Mr 
and Mrs Cs misrepresentation claim had more than likely exceeded the relevant time limits 
set out in the Limitation Act so it wasnt unreasonable for GE Money to take that into account 
when responding to their section 75 claim. He also considered any claim that they might 
have under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act but said that they would have had six 
years from the date the finance agreement ended to make such a claim  but the finance 
agreement ended in 2008 and their claim wasnt raised until 2017, which was more than six 
years after the agreement ended.
Mr and Mrs Cs representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It says, in summary, that:
the timeshare company operated in a fraudulent way to cause harm to consumers 
and went into administration in November 2020;
the timeshare company and GE Money were operating an unfair relationship;
Mr and Mrs C did make their claim within three years of becoming aware that they 
could make a claim, which was in time under sections 11 and 14 of the Limitation 
Act; and
the sales experience that has been evidenced by Mr and Mrs C mirrors other 
complaints which have been made to this service.
GE Money says that it agrees that the complaint has exceeded the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act but it objects to this service considering section 140A and extending the scope 
of the complaint beyond what was included in the complaint letter.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with most of the conclusions reached by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of, or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs C referred their complaint to this service within six years of the event 
complained of  which is GE Money turning down their section 75 claim - but I need 
to consider whether it has acted fairly in saying that the Limitation Act applies to their 
claim;
in this decision Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Cs claim as only a 
court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not GE Moneys 
response to that claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Cs claim to GE Money is that the timeshare was misrepresented to them 
and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them (their 
representative has said in response to our investigators recommendations that the 
timeshare company has gone into administration which is likely to also put it in 
breach of contract  but that didnt form part of their claim to GE Money so Im unable 
to consider it in this decision - if they want to complain about a breach of contract 
they should first make a claim to GE Money and then, if theyre not satisfied with its 
response, they may be able to make a separate complaint to this service);
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, GE Money would be expected to 
consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time limits set out in 
the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and 
to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr and Mrs C could have made a claim to the timeshare company or 
GE Money about the misrepresentations that induced them into buying the timeshare 
when they entered into the acquisition agreement in October 2007 (whether or not 
those misrepresentations were made fraudulently) as that was when they entered 
into an agreement based on the misrepresentations of the timeshare company and 
suffered a loss as they entered into the loan agreement with GE Money to pay for the 
timeshare;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or GE Money 
 but they didnt make a claim against GE Money until October 2017, about ten years 
later;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that Mr and Mrs C made a claim to GE Money 
within three years of becoming aware that they could make a claim - but when they had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist them for the purposes of the 
Limitation Act  sections 11, 11A and 14 of that act extend the time in some 
circumstances where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause 
of action accrued, but that is only for claims brought for personal injury, defective 
products or negligence and I cant see that Mr and Mrs C would have such a claim 
against GE Money;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that the way in which the timeshare company 
and associated companies were set up was fraudulent, which was considered by a 
court in the relevant country and it held that the corporate structures were set up in a 
fraudulent spirit and that the parent company was liable for the damages that would 
have been awarded against its subsidiary - in some cases actions based on a fraud 
have longer limitation periods  but I cant see that the timeshare company ever 
withheld from Mr and Mrs C information about how its subsidiary or associated 
companies were structured or made any representation (whether true or false) about 
that, so I dont consider that the timeshare companys corporate structure changes 
the limitation period that Ive set out above;
GE Money didnt consider Mr and Mrs Cs claim under section 75 as it said that the 
debtor-creditor-supplier relationship required for such a claim wasnt present in these 
circumstances and that any claim that they might otherwise have had was time-
barred under the Limitation Act  I consider that it was a fair and reasonable 
response for it to say that their claim was time-barred under the Limitation Act and, 
as I agree that their claim is more than likely time barred, I dont consider that theres 
any need for me to assess whether or not there was a debtor-creditor-supplier 
relationship in these circumstances;
our investigator also considered any claim that they might have under section 140A 
of the Consumer Credit Act and concluded that any such claim wouldnt have been 
made within the time limits set out in the Limitation Act - but I make no finding on that 
as Mr and Mrs Cs claim to GE Money was only made under section 75 (and didnt 
include a claim under section 140A) so Im unable to consider a complaint about 
section 140A in this decision;
if Mr and Mrs C want to make a complaint about GE Moneys response to their claim 
under section 140A, they should first make a claim to it under that section and then, if 
theyre not satisfied with its response, they may be able to make a separate 
complaint to this service (but I would have expected their professional representative 
to have included a claim under section 140A in Mr and Mrs Cs original claim to GE 
Money and their complaint to this service - and its my view that any such claim 
would now also be time barred); and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs C for the issues that theyve had with their timeshare 
and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require GE Money to refund to them any 
of the money that they paid under the fixed sum loan agreement, to pay them any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 10 December 2021.
