K821x#15complaint
Mr W has complained about short-term loans granted  to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as Quick  Quid (Quick  Quid  or the lender). Mr W says the loans were  not 
affordable and were  irresponsibly lent.
background
Quick Quid agreed nine loans for Mr W in the period August 2015 to July 2017. The loan 
terms varied with Mr W making between one to three repayments.  Some of the information  
Quick Quid provided about  these loans is shown in the table below. Mr W asked for 
additional credit  when he borrowed loans 2, 5 and 9 and these are shown  in the table  as 2a, 
5a etc.

*Estimated disposable income
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ws complaint  and recommended that Quick  Quid refund 
the interest and charges that he paid from loan 4 onwards. Quick Quid didnt agree with this 
recommendation and so the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have also taken into account the law, 
any relevant regulatory  rules and good  industry practice at the time.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when  Mr W borrowed the loans in 
question. Its rules and guidance say that Quick Quid needed  to check  that Mr W could afford 
to meet  his repayments for his loans in a sustainable  manner.  This means  being  able to 
meet his repayments  out of his normal income without having to go without or borrow  further.  
The regulations arent  prescriptive  about what checks Quick Quid needed to carry out. But 
the checks needed to be proportionate to the circumstances. In general,  Id expect a lender 
Ref: DRN74675702to require more  assurance the greater the potential risk to the consumer  of not being able to 
repay the credit in a sustainable  way. 
So, for example,  Id expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying  out more detailed 
checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
So, as our adjudicator  did, Ive thought  about  whether or not the checks  Quick Quid carried 
out were proportionate  and, if not, what proportionate checks  might have shown. 
Before I explain my findings, I want to address a point Quick  Quid made in response to our 
adjudication. It said that that after 1 March 2015  it implemented an affordability assessment 
in line with the regulators guidance and because of this it didnt lend irresponsibly from this 
date. Our adjudicator  replied that the role of this Service  is to not only have regard to the 
regulations in place at the time but also the law, industry practice and all available evidence  
to decide what  is fair and reasonable in the circumstances  of the complaint. 
I fully agree with our adjudicator here. As Quick Quid  is no doubt aware, this Service is 
required to take into account wider considerations  in making  determinations on complaints. 
As the FCA handbook sets out in the rules  and guidance relevant to dispute handing (DISP 
3.6.1R): The Ombudsman  will determine  a complaint by reference to what is, in his opinion,  
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of the case. 
And DISP  3.6.4R goes  on to explain  that
In considering what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of the case,  the 
Ombudsman will take into account:
(1) relevant:
(a) law and regulations;
(b) regulators' rules, guidance and standards;
(c) codes of practice; and
(2) (where appropriate)  what  he considers  to have been good industry practice  at the 
relevant time.
So, I am required to consider more than the rules and guidance set out by the regulators  in 
making my determination on a complaint.  And I would not be acting in accordance with my 
statutory role if I only considered the extent to which Quick Quid  complied with rules and 
guidance set out by the FCA in my determination. 
loans 1 and 2
Having looked  at everything, I agree with our adjudicator  that the checks  Quick  Quid carried  
out before  agreeing Mr Ws first two loans  (and the additional borrowing he took out on his 
second loan) were  proportionate. Mr W had told Quick Quid  that his monthly income was 
£1,150 and his expenses  came to £625.  I understand that Quick Quid  carried  out a credit  
check each time, though  I dont know what these checks  would  have shown as it hasnt  
provided the results, apart from a summary of the most recent check.  Given  the information 
Mr W provided, the repayments for these loans (see table)  would have seemed affordable to 
Ref: DRN74675703Quick Quid. And, as this was early  on in their lending relationship,  I cant  say there was 
anything else to suggest at this point  that Quick Quid should have done anything  further  or 
that was wrong  to lend on these occasions.  
loan 3
Our adjudicator found that Quick  Quid didnt carry out proportionate checks  from loan 3 
onwards. They explained that a proportionate  check at loan 3 would have included not only 
asking Mr W about his usual expenses but also asking about any other payments, such as 
other short term loan commitments,  that might have impacted on his ability  to meet his 
repayments for loan 3 when they fell due. 
I agree  with our adjudicator here. I think Quick Quid should have been prompted to do more 
than it had done up to this point,  given the increased amount of this loan and that Mr W had 
topped up his second loan and then come back so quickly for a third.  This suggests  Mr W 
may have  become dependent  on this type of borrowing to meet an ongoing need. 
I dont plan to make any finding on whether or not Quick Quid  did in fact carry out 
proportionate checks here because I can see from Mr Ws bank statements that had 
Quick Quid gathered information about his other short term commitments it would probably 
still have agreed  to lend to him on these occasions.  This is because the level of outstanding 
short term loans from other providers wasnt enough  at this point for Quick  Quid to find this 
loan unaffordable,  given  that Mr Ws stated income  and expenditure remained unchanged.  
loans 4 to 9
Mr W asked for a fourth  loan in early March 2016.  Quick Quid  again  gathered  information  
about his income  and expenditure, which remained  unchanged.  It also checked his credit  
file. I can see from a recent credit file record Mr Ws provided that he had a County Court 
Judgement against  him in October 2015.  Bearing  this in mind  and that Mr W had been  
borrowing from Quick Quid for over six months, I think  the lender ought  to have done more  
here and, as with loan 3, gathered information  about  any outstanding short term lending 
Mr W might  have had. And by this point  I dont think it was fair for Quick Quid  to continue to 
rely on the information Mr W provided without taking steps to verify it. I cant see that it did 
this so I dont think  its checks were proportionate here.
Mr W went on to borrow  a further  five consecutive loans and, for the same reasons, I dont 
think Quick Quid carried out proportionate checks for any of these. Ive noted that 
Quick Quid provided information  in response to our adjudication  in the form of estimated 
disposable income figures for loans 4 to 9 and Ive included these figures in the loan table. I 
dont know how it calculated these  or how it used them  in its assessment. So Im not going to 
comment further on them, except  to note that these figures are lower than Mr Ws stated  
disposable income (of £525 to £625) and in most  cases lower  than the highest  loan 
repayment. 
Mr W has provided his bank  statements  and Ive looked at these to see what proportionate  
checks would likely  have shown for loans 4 to 9. Mr W told Quick  Quid that his monthly 
income was £1,150 (rising to £1,250  for his last loan) and that his monthly expenses  came to 
£625. But had Quick Quid sought a more comprehensive picture of Mr Ws finances, I think  
its likely  it would have learnt that his expenses  were generally  higher than hed said and that 
he was borrowing from other short term lenders  throughout  this time. This meant he didnt 
have enough disposable income to meet his loan repayments. Armed with this knowledge,  
Ref: DRN74675704Quick Quid wouldnt have  lent to Mr W because the loan repayments werent likely to be 
sustainable for him, and so I think it needs to put this right.
I have considered that loans 4 to 9 were due to be repaid  over two or three payments. 
Quick Quid says that Mr W would have signed  a declaration to say that he was aware  that 
the final repayment may be more than his usual disposable  income  and that he may need to 
save to meet  this. I dont  think this removes Quick Quids responsibility to check  that Mr W 
could meet his repayments in a sustainable  way. I can accept that it might not be 
unreasonable early  on in the lending relationship to think that Mr W could be in a position  to 
meet his loan repayments when they fell due. However, all Mr Ws loans were taken out 
within weeks of repaying a previous one. So by the time he came  to ask for his fourth loan 
and beyond, I dont think it was reasonable for Quick Quid to lend to Mr W on the basis  that 
he was in a position to potentially save money over the loan term.
what Quick Quid should  do to put things right
Ive concluded  that Quick  Quid was irresponsible to have agreed to Mr Ws loans taken  out 
from March 2016  to July 2017, loans 4 to 9 in the loan table. In order  to put Mr W back in the 
position he would have been in, had it not agreed to these, Quick  Quid  should: 
-refund all interest  and charges Mr W paid for these loans including  interest and charges 
on additional  advances;
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to the 
dates of settlement;
-remove any adverse information about these loans from Mr Ws credit file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick  Quid to take off tax from this interest. The lender 
must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ws complaint  in part and require CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as Quick Quid  to 
put things right for him as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 July 2019.
