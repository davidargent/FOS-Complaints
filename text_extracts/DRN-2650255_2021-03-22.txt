The complaint
Through her representative, Mr W, Miss E has complained about a mortgage shortfall debt 
owed to The Mortgage Business Plc (TMB). The complaint is as follows:
in 2016, after sending TMBs solicitors (referred to here as S) a cheque for £1,060 which 
was cashed, Miss E thought this was in full and final settlement of her outstanding debt;
TMB is still chasing Miss E for the debt, which has caused her considerable distress.
What happened
The evidence in the case is detailed, running to several hundred pages of documents. Ive 
read everything, and its apparent that some parts of the evidence are less relevant to the 
underlying case than others. There are also a lot of duplicated documents and repetition of 
arguments. In what follows, I have, by necessity, summarised events in rather less detail 
than has been presented.
No discourtesys intended by that. Its a reflection of the informal service we provide, and if I 
dont mention something, it wont be because Ive ignored it. Itll be because I didnt think it 
was material to the outcome of the complaint. This approach is consistent with what our 
enabling legislation requires of me. It allows me to focus on the issues on which I consider a 
fair outcome will turn, and not be side-tracked by matters which, although presented as 
material, are, in my opinion peripheral or, in some instances, have little or no impact on the 
broader outcome.
Miss E had a mortgage with TMB, held jointly with another party (who has not joined in this 
complaint). The property had been repossessed and sold by TMB, leaving a shortfall debt of 
just under £8,800, for which Miss E was jointly and severally liable. 
In 2016 Miss E was in contact with TMB about this and in July 2016 she sent a cheque for 
£1,130 to TMB. The cheque was returned by TMB, which said she would need to contact its 
solicitors. Miss E then sent a cheque for £1,060 to S, saying that this was her payment in full 
and final settlement of the shortfall debt. Miss Es letter said that, if the offer wasnt accepted, 
her uncashed cheque should be returned.
In September 2019 Miss E complained again to TMB, because shed been contacted by 
debt collectors about the shortfall debt. Miss E said that her cheque for £1,060 had been 
cashed, and so had been accepted in full and final settlement of the debt.
TMB said in its final response letter that it had written to Miss E in June 2017 explaining that 
the cheque hadnt been accepted in full and final settlement and so TMB had instructed debt 
collectors to recover the outstanding balance.
Dissatisfied with TMBs response, Miss E referred the complaint to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service. She raised other issues about the possession and sale of the property 
and about Ss actions. TMB didnt agree to us looking at those matters, saying they were out 
of time, as theyd been covered in previous final response letters sent in September 2016. 
TMB also didnt change its stance in relation to the cheque for £1,060.
An investigator looked at the complaint. She found that the issues covered in the two final 
response letters from September 2016 had been brought to us more than six months after 
the date of the final response letters and there were no exceptional circumstances to explain 
the delay.
With regard to the complaint about the cheque for £1,060  which Miss E said had been 
cashed and so had been accepted by TMB in full and final settlement  the investigator was 
satisfied that TMB had explained to Miss E that this hadnt been agreed as a full settlement. 
The investigator didnt think it was wrong for TMB to tell Miss E to make her offer to S, 
because S were acting for TMB. She didnt think that by telling Miss E to contact S, TMB 
was suggesting the offer would be accepted. 
But she thought that it was fair for TMB to reimburse Miss E for the £1,060. Thats because 
Miss E had said when she sent the cheque that it shouldnt be cashed if it wasnt agreed that 
it was her full settlement. The investigator asked TMB to pay £100 compensation for trouble 
and upset.
TMB responded with further evidence, showing that S had sent a refund cheque to Mr W in 
January 2017 for £1,060, and that this cheque had been cashed. 
The investigator reviewed the matter again. Having done so, she didnt think the complaint 
should be upheld or that any compensation should be paid. She noted that TMBs 
contemporaneous records differed from Mr Ws recollection of events. The investigator was 
satisfied that S had sent a cheque to Mr W for the refund due to Miss E of £1,060 enclosed 
in a letter dated 25 January 2017. She was satisfied from the endorsement on the back of 
the cheque that this had been paid into a bank account.
Given this, the investigator was satisfied that there was no additional refund due to Miss E, 
as this had been paid in 2017, or that TMB should pay any compensation.
Mr W, on behalf of Miss E, didnt accept the investigators findings. He said that what he 
personally takes issue with is that TMB suggested an offer be made to its solicitors, without 
suggesting it might not be accepted, but suggesting a figure of £1,000. It was then 
reasonable to assume that if that offer was made, it would be accepted. Mr W also says that 
a conversation with S proved that the offer had not been declined by S.
As the matter remains unresolved, it falls to me to issue a final decision on the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First, Im satisfied that we cant consider any of the issues covered in the two final response 
letters sent in September 2016, as they werent referred to us within six months of the dates 
of those letters, and there are no exceptional circumstances that would allow me to waive 
the time limits.
The issue in this complaint is whether TMB and/or S led Miss E to believe that her offer of 
£1,060 had been accepted, or whether it was reasonable for Miss E to believe that it had 
because TMB cashed the cheque. Ive noted Mr Ws comments setting out his personal views on TMBs actions. But Mr W isnt 
TMBs customer; his role is to represent Miss E and to put her complaint to us, in the same 
way as other consumers might instruct a solicitor or accountant to represent them. So 
although I acknowledge Mr W has strong opinions on how poorly he believes TMB and S 
have acted, I can only consider whats happened in relation to Miss E, not Mr W.
Ive reviewed TMBs contact notes. These are contemporaneous, meaning they were 
recorded at the time of the events. In the circumstances, Im satisfied that they are an 
accurate record of what happened. There is nothing commercially sensitive in these notes, 
so I have set them out in full, with names redacted where appropriate. I think these explain 
clearly and in chronological order what happened and where any confusion might have 
arisen.

30/01/2017  Cheque was cashed by [Mr W] (Confirmed by account on 10/11/2020 
[redacted]).
From the notes, Im satisfied that on 21 July 2016 S rejected Miss Es offer of £1,130 made 
on 18 July 2016 and returned her cheque. S explained that it needed to see details of 
Miss Es income and expenditure before being able to consider any offer.
A further cheque for £1,060 was sent on 8 September 2016. This was drawn on Mr Ws 
account and was received by TMB on 9 September 2016. Unfortunately it was cashed in 
error. Miss E was told this offer had not been accepted just over a week later, on 
16 September 2016. A refund was made to Miss E by way of a cheque in her name. But as 
the cheque for £1,060 had been drawn on Mr Ws account, the cheque sent to Miss E was 
never presented by Miss for payment. 
Im not persuaded that TMB or S misled Miss E that her offers made in July and September 
2016 had been accepted. There was nothing wrong in Miss E being asked to re-submit any 
offers alongside details of her income and expenditure, so that proper consideration could be 
given to them. I acknowledge Miss E was probably hopeful that her offers would be 
accepted, but Im satisfied she was told early on that they hadnt been.
Mr W argues that, by cashing the cheque, TMB had accepted the offer and that it was 
reasonable for Miss E to believe this. But by the time Mr W told TMB that the cheque had 
been paid from his account (16 January 2017), Miss E had known for several months that 
her offer had been declined and that shed been sent a refund cheque. Its unfortunate there 
was a mix-up with the original cheque being cashed in error by TMB. But TMB put this right 
by immediately issuing a refund, albeit initially to Miss E rather than Mr W, and later 
correcting this. 
In the circumstances, Im satisfied that no further refund is due to Miss E. Im also satisfied 
that a payment for trouble and upset isnt appropriate either. Thats because Im satisfied 
that Miss E knew shortly after both cheques were sent that her offers hadnt been accepted 
and so Im not persuaded that it was reasonable for her to assume the matter was closed.
Mr W has raised some further questions about the balance TMB is claiming is still 
outstanding. That doesnt form part of this complaint and so Miss E will need to contact TMB 
about this. It would be helpful if TMB could send Miss E a statement showing how much is 
due, with a breakdown if necessary.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.This final decision concludes the Financial Ombudsman Services review of this complaint. 
This means that we are unable to consider the complaint any further, nor enter into any 
correspondence about the merits of it.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 April 2021.
