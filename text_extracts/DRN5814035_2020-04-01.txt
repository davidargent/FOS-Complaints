K821x#15complaint
Mr M says Elevate Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny),  irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr M says Sunny  didnt carry out sufficient credit checks and he was unable to make  
the loan repayments without undue  difficulty. The borrowing placed him in a worse financial 
position.

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ms complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given because by this time the pattern of borrowing suggested 
Mr M was persistently reliant  on short-term lending. 
Sunny disagreed and didnt think the complaint  should be upheld.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me to decide in my role as 
ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN58140352But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr M didnt  comment  on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt  be upheld.  
Because of this, I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But the loans were  part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr M had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint. Like the adjudicator I dont think any 
further borrowing  should have been given to Mr M from loan six. Ill explain why.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 
six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. At loan six Mr M had taken  out six loans  within five months. So Sunny  
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr M was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that 
Ref: DRN58140353Mr Ms indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr Ms first loan was for £100 and loan six was for £100.   I think  at this point Sunny 
ought to have known that Mr M was not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall 
in his income but to meet an ongoing  need.  
Mr M was often  provided with a new loan within days of settling a previous one. As 
examples, loan four was taken the day after loans one and three were repaid. Loan  
six was taken the same  day as loan two was repaid and loan seven was taken the 
same day as loans four and five were repaid.  A strong indication  that Mr M was 
borrowing further to repay existing borrowing, so his financial  position was 
unsustainable. 
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  11 was 
taken out 13 months after Mr Ms first. And it was for the same amount. Mr M had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
 I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans six to 11 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  six to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  six to 11 should  be removed from Mr Ms 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 May 2020.
