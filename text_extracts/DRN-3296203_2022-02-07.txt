The complaint
Mr L complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA withheld a payment he was trying to 
make to a merchant until he provided documents to prove his identity.
What happened
Mr L has used PayPal to make payments for a several years. In August 2020 PayPal 
emailed Mr L to let him know his account was temporarily limited, and hed be unable to 
make payments until he logged in to submit identity documents. Mr L first thought this might 
be a scam, but later felt he didnt see a reason to submit this information and in any case 
didnt think he had the technical knowledge to do so.
In September 2020 he attempted to pay a merchant using PayPals guest checkout feature. 
The payment was taken from his bank account but didnt reach the merchant. Mr L 
contacted PayPal to find out what had happened. PayPal told him that they had restricted his 
use of their platform until they received the identity documents. They said Mr Ls payment 
would be retained until the information they asked for was provided.
Mr L didnt think this was fair and raised a complaint with PayPal. He asked for his payment 
to be made, and for him to be compensated £50. PayPal looked in to what happened but 
didnt feel theyd done anything wrong. They said they had followed their correct process in 
trying to verify their customer, and when Mr L created his account, he agreed to provide 
information such as this when asked for.
Unhappy with this response Mr L referred the complaint to our service. While the complaint 
was with our service PayPal received the documents they asked for and unblocked the 
account. The pending payment to the merchant was then sent through  but Mr L had 
already resolved the situation with the merchant directly and thought this money should have 
gone back to him.
Several investigators at our service have looked at this complaint and issued their 
assessments. The most recent assessment concluded that PayPal hadnt done anything 
wrong. They said PayPal were entitled to review Mr Ls account, and ask for proof of identity, 
and hadnt done anything wrong by retaining the payment until they received the documents. 
They also felt PayPal hadnt done anything wrong by completing the payment after the 
account block was lifted. Overall, they didnt ask PayPal to do anything further.
Mr L disagreed with this. As no agreement could be reached the case has been passed to 
me to decide. Having reviewed the complaint, I felt it should be partially upheld and issued a 
provisional decision which said:
Electronic money institutions, like PayPal, do have certain legal and regulatory obligations to 
ensure they hold enough information to identify and understand who their consumers are. 
This is important in protecting both PayPal and the wider financial industry from money-
laundering and financial crime and failing to have relevant information can lead to financial 
businesses suffering serious penalties.
PayPals terms of use also say they can ask for information from their consumers. Ive 
reviewed what PayPal asked Mr L for  proof of identity and address  and dont consider 
this to be particularly unusual or onerous to ask for.
I appreciate that Mr L had been a user of PayPal for a number of years without providing this 
information. But this doesnt mean PayPal werent entitled to ask for this information, or that 
theyve been unreasonable in doing so. Im satisfied that if Mr L didnt wish to provide PayPal 
with proof of his identity and address, then theres no further obligation on them to continue 
allowing him to use their service. I dont think PayPal have done anything wrong here.
But Ive gone on to consider the payment that Mr L attempted through PayPal, that PayPal 
retained. By the time he was attempting this payment Mr L had been made aware that his 
PayPal account was limited. 
PayPal have suggested he was trying to subvert the block by using the guest account 
feature. But considering the amount and nature of the payment Im not convinced this was 
down to any malicious intent on his part. I also note that the email he received about his 
account being blocked doesnt mention anything specifically about guest accounts.
In any case, PayPal took the money from Mr Ls bank account but didnt pass it on to the 
merchant. PayPals position is that they did this to prompt him in to supplying the requested 
information. But he didnt want to. Its then acceptable for PayPal to decide that since hes 
not complying with their terms and decline to pay the merchant. This is in line with PayPals 
user agreement.
However, it seems unreasonable then for PayPal to hold on to Mr Ls money indefinitely. I 
havent seen anything to suggest there were any particular concerns about this payment, 
especially considering the value and intended recipient. So, it seems to me the most 
reasonable action would be to return the funds to source, and Ive seen nothing to suggest 
this wouldnt have been possible. 
After this Mr L made it very clear that he didnt want to continue using his PayPal account, 
and asked for it to be closed and his money returned to him. However, PayPal continued to 
insist they would not release the funds until the received documentation from him. I can 
appreciate why Mr L found this situation frustrating and upsetting.
When PayPal did receive copies of the documents, they released the funds, but to the 
merchant. But by this time from the correspondence Ive seen PayPal ought to have been 
aware Mr L had resolved the issue with the merchant directly. PayPal have commented that 
once initiated a payment can only be cancelled by the recipient. But in this case weve 
already seen PayPal have the ability to hold on to the payment, so Im not sure it would have 
been impossible for the payment to be cancelled and the money returned directly to Mr L. 
Instead Mr L has been inconvenienced in having to arrange a refund directly to the 
merchant.
Overall, while Im satisfied that PayPal were within their rights to block Mr L from using their 
service, I dont think it was fair or reasonable to retain Mr Ls funds as long as they did. And 
Im satisfied that Mr L has suffered distress and inconvenience from this. Considering the 
circumstances, I think Mr Ls request of £50 is reasonable.
Mr L responded to say he accepted my provisional decision. PayPal did not respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im still minded to partially uphold Mr Ls complaint, for the same reasons 
as put in my provisional decision.
Its reasonable and within PayPals user agreement for them to request identity documents 
from Mr L, and if not received to restrict or block the use of PayPal services.
However, it is unreasonable for PayPal to collect the payment from Mr L, and then hold on to 
it indefinitely when there doesnt seem to be any particular concern around the source of 
funds, or merchant. I also find it unreasonable for PayPal to release the funds to merchant 
when they would have been aware that Mr L had resolved the payment with them directly.
Overall, Im satisfied PayPal have caused Mr L a degree of inconvenience for which they 
should pay compensation, and Im still minded that £50 is a fair reflection of the level of 
inconvenience caused. 
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Sie, SCA should pay Mr L £50.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 March 2022.
