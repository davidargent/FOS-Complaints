The complaint
Mrs Gs complaint is about being declined for a lease agreement by Lex Autolease Ltd 
(Lex). 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
I dont think the approved application was the same as the initial one. I say that 
because Ive seen screen shots of Lexs system and its clear the approved 
transaction was listed as a replacement transaction and the initial one wasnt. 
That would change the credit application and I dont think Lex were then assessing 
the same detail. Its for Lex to decide whether to approve an application for credit and 
I cant say theyve been unreasonable to reject the first application or accept the final 
application. They were made on different premises.
Lex dont have to approve finance applications even if the consumers credit scores 
are excellent. The decision to advance credit is one for them to make and it wouldnt 
be fair for me to say otherwise. They have a responsibility to assure consumers can 
afford the lending they provide and on the basis of the first application they didnt 
think that was the case. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or reject my decision 
before 5 August 2020.
