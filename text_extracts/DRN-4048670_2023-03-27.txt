The complaint
Mr S complains that RiverStone Insurance (UK) Limited has declined to cover costs being 
claimed by the opposing party following the conclusion of legal proceedings under his legal 
expenses insurance policy.
Mr S policy was originally underwritten by another insurer, but RiverStone took over these 
liabilities. Solicitors and claims handlers have also acted on RiverStone and the previous 
insurers behalf during the course of Mr S claim. Where I refer to RiverStone in my decision, 
this should be taken to include the previous insurer where appropriate and those handling 
and reviewing the claim.
What happened
Mr S held an after the event legal expenses insurance policy with RiverStone. He was 
making a claim for personal injury. The details of that claim arent relevant to my decision.
Mr S legal claim was unsuccessful, and the other party (M) sought to recover its costs from 
Mr S. Those costs would be covered by the policy.
As no offer had been received from Mr S, K or RiverStone, M obtained a Default Costs 
Certificate (DCC) in September 2016. This stated Mr S was liable for Ms costs totalling 
£83,852.94.
After reviewing the information available, RiverStone agreed to cover Ms costs up to 2 
January 2014 as it said Mr S, and his solicitors (K) had received information then that the 
claim didnt have reasonable prospects of success.
RiverStone appointed a cost agent to seek to negotiate Ms costs. In 2020, the cost agent 
said M had declined to negotiate and so payments totalling £73,326.21 had been made by 
RiverStone to cover the costs M had incurred up to 2 January 2014.
Mr M subsequently received correspondence from M demanding the payment of the 
remainder of the costs, as well as interest totalling £16,097.14, which had been accrued 
since the Default Costs Certificate was issued in 2016.
K, on behalf of Mr S, complained to RiverStone. They said that RiverStone should have 
raised Points of Dispute (POD) before the DCC was issued to challenge the costs claimed 
by M. They also said that RiverStone should be liable for the interest accrued as this had 
built up during the time when RiverStones appointed cost agent had been dealing with the 
matter.
When RiverStone rejected the complaint, Mr S approached our service. Our investigator 
didnt think RiverStone had done anything wrong. Mr S didnt agree and asked for an 
ombudsmans decision.
I reviewed the complaint and considered that Mr S complaint should be upheld in part. I 
issued a provisional decision, the details of which are below. RiverStone has responded to 
that provisional decision. No response has been received from Mr S or his representatives.
My provisional decision
In my provisional decision, I said:
Mr S complaint isnt about whether RiverStone acted reasonably when it declined to cover 
any costs after 2 January 2014. It seems to be accepted that K had received an assessment 
that Mr S didnt enjoy reasonable prospects of success and in line with the policy terms and 
conditions, RiverStone wouldnt have continued funding Mr S proceedings if it had been 
aware of this. Thats a fair position.
The complaint Mr S refers to us is that before the DCC was ussed, RiverStone didnt dispute 
the costs being claimed. In the absence of any challenge to the costs, the DCC was issued 
for the full amount claimed by M. RiverStone says it was unable to dispute the costs claimed 
as the requested information from K wasnt received in time for it to meaningfully challenge 
M's claim.
It doesnt seem to be disputed that RiverStone was regularly asking K for information relating 
to Mr S claim, and that all of the required information wasnt received until after the DCC 
had been issued. I cant see that any action, or failure to act, on the part of RiverStone was 
the reason for the DCC being issued. I think its fair to say RiverStone couldnt assess its 
position regarding liability for the claim until it had all the required information, which it didnt 
receive before the DCC was issued.
I also agree its unreasonable to expect RiverStone to have challenged Ms costs before the 
DCC was issued in the absence of all of the information it needed to make an assessment 
regarding the extent of its liability.
In December 2016, RiverStone appointed the cost agent, informing K of this. The 
correspondence from the cost agent in 2020 indicates that M had originally indicated it was 
prepared to negotiate the costs but had since declined to engage further. Payment of the 
costs to 2 January 2014 was made. After this, M wrote to Mr S about the remaining amount, 
and also said that interest amounting to £16,097.14 had been accrued since 2016, was 
unpaid, and was continuing to accrue.
I dont think its reasonable for RiverStone to refuse to have any further involvement 
regarding the interest being sought. The interest has accrued since 2016. RiverStone has 
been aware throughout of the costs and amounts outstanding. The DCC, which it was in 
receipt of, said that in the event that the amounts stated werent paid then interest could be 
added.
Riverstone appointed the cost agent to seek to negotiate the costs, when it knew the DCC 
had been issued and so its reasonable to say it was aware that interest could be added to 
the amounts due. The cost agent wasnt able to negotiate a settlement. M now seeks 
interest for the period when the costs were unpaid.
Im unaware of any further court order or other documentation requiring that interest be 
added to the amounts stated in the DCC. The DCC itself says interest may be added. Im not 
in a position to comment on whether the interest is being sought fairly or not, nor whether the 
amounts being sought and rates referred to by M are reasonable.I think RiverStone should be acting to resolve the interest on the amounts it covered under 
the policy. It seems to me it had a choice as to whether to settle the costs in 2016, or seek to 
involve the cost agent. It chose to appoint the cost agent and so any additional amounts 
which become reasonably, or legally, due on its liability because it did so should be met by 
RiverStone. There was a risk in seeking to negotiate the costs that interest could 
accumulate. It seems unfair to me for that risk to be passed to Mr S in its entirety. 
Mr S (via his solicitors K) was aware that the cost agent had been appointed.  Its also 
reasonable to say that he (or at least K as his representatives) were aware of the DCC and 
its statement that interest could be charged on the amounts stated.
Im satisfied Mr S would have had some possible benefit from the involvement of the cost 
agent in that the proportion of the costs that he was liable for would be subject to the same 
assessment and attempts to negotiate. Mr S has been charged for some of the cost agents 
fees. In light of this, Im satisfied the cost agent was acting for both Mr S and RiverStone. I
think its fair to say he should bear some of the risk involved in appointing the cost agent  
so Im satisfied that interest reasonably accrued on the portion of the costs hes liable for 
isnt something RiverStone needs to cover.
To put things right here, RiverStone will need to assume liability for the interest amounts 
accrued on the £73,326.21  that being the total of Ms costs that it has covered. That 
doesnt, in my view, require it to pay those costs now (although it may choose to do so). If 
RiverStone disputes the application of interest, the dates its been charged from and to or 
the rate applied, I think its fair to say it may do so.
At the end of any related proceedings or discussions with M about this point, it may be 
established that an amount of interest is due. If thats the case, then RiverStone will need to 
pay that amount  even if this means the policy indemnity limit is exceeded. This is because, 
as Ive outlined above, the decision to proceed with the negotiation of the costs, which 
seems to be the primary driver of the interest accruing, was made by RiverStone. It wouldnt 
be reasonable for RiverStone to say that the indemnity limit had been exhausted and pass 
some of the costs it would otherwise be liable for to Mr S.
Mr S also received a letter from M detailing that a very significant amount of interest was 
due. While I acknowledge that, in line with my findings, he would have been liable for some 
amount of interest, the figure would have been much lower. I think that receiving a letter with 
such a large figure would have caused him distress. To recognise this, I think RiverStone 
should pay £250 compensation to Mr S.
The responses to my provisional decision
Mr S hasnt responded to my provisional decision. RiverSkills response outlined why they 
disagreed with my conclusions.
RiverSkills response can be briefly summarised by the following points:
Mr S had delayed sending it the file, and that was why the DCC was issued.
If the file had been provided in good time, it would have sought to appoint a cost 
agent before the DCC was issued.
It paid £48,000 on account while the cost agent was in contact with M in order to 
minimise interest.
It had paid the cost agents invoice, even though it had been sent to Mr S for 
payment.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive carefully considered all the points raised by RiverStone in response to my provisional 
decision. Ive also reviewed my provisional findings. I remain satisfied that the complaint 
should be upheld in part, for the reasons I previously gave. I dont intend to repeat my 
findings in detail, but will address the points raised by RiverStone briefly.
I note RiverStones points about the delays to the file being provided, and the impact this 
had. Ive addressed why I dont think RiverStone is responsible for the DCC being issued, 
and dont consider any delays or inactions on their part contributed to that. I havent upheld 
Mr S complaint on that point. What I have said is that, once the DCC had been issued, it 
was RiverStones decision to appoint the cost agent and so any additional costs which 
become reasonably due on its liability should be covered by RiverStone. Ive outlined my 
reasons for this.
I can also see that RiverStone hasnt sought to limit its liability because of the alleged delays 
in providing the file by Mr S. It hasnt said the cost agent would have been able to get a 
reduction in Ms costs if the DCC hadnt been issued. The only limit it placed on its liability 
was to say that it wouldnt cover costs incurred beyond January 2014, a point which wasnt 
disputed by Mr S.
I think its fair to say that if RiverStone is now seeking to say that the delay in providing the 
file prejudiced its position in that without the delay it would have paid less costs, then that 
should have been its position from the outset. It hasnt done so. Its paid all the costs sought 
by M up to the date it would have cut off cover.
I acknowledge RiverStone made a payment of £48,000 on account while the cost agent was 
in contact with M. That it was to seek to limit interest charges is noted, but I think this again 
highlights that RiverStone was aware, or should have been aware, that interest was likely to 
accrue because of its decision to appoint the cost agent. If thats the case, then it follows that 
its fair for liability for those additionally accrued amounts to fall on RiverStone. 
The £48,000 payment will, I assume, impact the interest amounts, but the calculations which 
have led to the claim by M are unknown to me and would presumably be the subject of 
challenge and discussion moving forward between the parties. Ive said that RiverStone 
should only be liable for interest on the amounts its paid. The £48,000 payment will be taken 
into consideration as part of the relevant calculations in due course.
Finally, Im aware the invoice for the cost agent was passed initially to Mr S. RiverStone paid 
this. Im unsure of the relevance of this to my decision about liability for the interest being 
claimed by M. The invoice wasnt the subject of any complaint made by Mr S about 
RiverStone.
My final decision
Its my final decision to uphold this complaint in part. In order to put things right, RiverStone 
Insurance (UK) Limited must:
Assume liability for interest accrued on the costs paid to M totalling £73,326.21.
Pay £250 compensation to Mr S. Riverstone must pay this amount within 28 days of 
us telling it Mr S accepts our decision. If it doesnt, then it must pay simple interest at 
a rate of 8% from that date to the date of final settlement..Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 April 2023.
