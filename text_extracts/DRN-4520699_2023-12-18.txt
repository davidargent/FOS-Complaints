The complaint
Mr O complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) restricted his account in April 
2022 without explanation  and then closed it. He says this has caused distress and 
inconvenience, financial loss and impact to his credit file.
What happened
This complaint only deals with Mr Os sole named current account. Mr Os complaint about a 
joint account he had with someone else is being handled under separate complaint 
reference number at this service.
On 29 April 2022, NatWest blocked Mr Os account. The restriction was removed on 
12 May 2022. Mr O complained to NatWest.
In its responses, NatWest said it had taken this action in line with its regulatory obligations 
and terms of account. And it doesnt have to provide an explanation for doing so. NatWest 
accepted it had provided poor customer service and apologised.
On 1 September 2022, NatWest told Mr O that all his accounts, including the joint one, 
would be closed on 31 October 2022. NatWest gave him two months notice.
Mr O has made several points about how NatWests actions have impacted him. Its not 
straight forward to separate this from his other complaint, but some of the main points which 
are relevant to this complaint are:
- He missed some payments which NatWest have charged him for, and has affected 
his credit rating
- He has a young child, and he was unable to provide food for them due to not having 
any access to funds
- Mr O has had to lie that he was unwell as he couldnt afford petrol or to pay for client 
lunches. Hes also had to take out high-cost loans as his credit score was impacted
One of our Investigators looked into Mr Os complaint. In relation to this complaint, they said 
the block was applied in line with the terms of the account, and regulatory obligations 
NatWest must meet. The review and block were done correctly and without delay. So 
NatWest did nothing wrong, and so it doesnt need to do anything to put things right.
Mr O did not agree with what our Investigator said. So the complaint was passed to me to 
decide. I then sent both parties my first provisional decision on this complaint. For ease of 
reference, here is what I said I was planning to decide:
First provisional decision  sent October 2023
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im planning on upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
Banks in the UK, like NatWest, are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to 
meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to 
restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
When carrying out such a review banks are under no obligation, that Im aware of, to explain 
why it has taken the action is has. This includes when restricting an account. But if a 
complaint about it is referred to this service, then NatWest should show us what those 
reasons are and the evidence it has. That way we can determine if NatWest has acted in line 
with its obligations and done so fairly and reasonably.
Despite several requests to NatWest to give us the information we need to decide this 
complaint, it has failed to do so. That means I dont have enough information to conclude 
NatWest applied the restrictions fairly and in line with its obligations.
So, to be clear, based on the limited information I have, I find that NatWest did not act fairly 
when restricting Mr Os bank account.
Mr O only complained about his account being closed more recently. Broadly speaking, 
NatWest is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with it. But 
before NatWest closes an account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the terms 
and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account, which NatWest and Mr O had to comply with, say 
that it could close the account by giving him at least two months notice. And in certain 
circumstances it can close an account immediately or with less notice.
NatWest gave Mr O two months notice to close his account. But it hasnt explained to this 
service why it did so  nor has it provided any supporting evidence. So I cant say it acted 
fairly when closing the account.
This brings me onto what I think NatWest needs to do to put things right given Im currently 
minded on deciding it hasnt shown its actions were fair, and in line with its obligations.
Ive looked through Mr Os bank statements and it appears its used mainly as an expenses 
account and the credits into it are mainly from himself, friends and family. I also note that 
some regular payments to certain creditors are made from it. I cant see any wages or salary 
payments. So because of that Im persuaded it wasnt Mr Os main account.
As Mr O had no access to this account from 29 April 2022 till 12 May 2022, and NatWest 
hasnt shown it has reason enough to restrict it, Im satisfied that any charges applied by it 
during this period should be refunded. I also think Mr O has been deprived of his funds, so 
NatWest should pay 8% simple interest on them for the period of the block.
If Mr O can show NatWest clear evidence of being charged any late fees by creditors who he 
had regular payments set-up from this account, NatWest should refund any such charges.
As I said, Im satisfied this wasnt Mr Os main account. So I think the impact to not having 
access to it is somewhat mitigated here. But Mr O says he wasnt able to put petrol in his car 
and had to lie about not being well to attend work due to not having access to his funds.
Given this account appears to be used mainly for expenses, Im persuaded it being blocked 
has some impact on Mr O. Im satisfied £150 is fair compensation for the distress, inconvenience and embarrassment NatWests actions caused Mr O.
Its possible Mr O missed payments to his creditors during this time for regular payments he 
had set-up. This may have affected his credit rating. So, to put things right, I think NatWest 
should give him a letter explaining that it unfairly caused payments to be missed from this 
account from 29 April 2022 until 12 May 2022
I then set-out what NatWest should do to put things right. This included paying 8% simple 
interest for the period Mr O was deprived access to his funds, refund of fees and charges 
applied during the restriction, charges from third parties for failed direct debits/standing 
orders and £150 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. I also said 
NatWest should send Mr O a letter saying its error caused Mr O to miss payments from 
29 April 2022 until 12 May 2022.
I then asked both parties to send me any further comments and evidence for me to consider 
before I reach my decision. NatWest sent me new information to consider, and after 
considering this I sent both parties another provisional decision in November 2023. In this 
provisional decision, I said I was now planning to not uphold Mr Os complaint. For ease of 
reference, here is what I said: 
Second provisional decision  sent November 2023
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im now planning on not upholding this complaint. I know this is a different 
outcome to that which I was planning on reaching in my previous provisional decision. So, Ill 
explain why.
Banks in the UK, like NatWest, are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to 
meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to 
restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
I know Mr O would like an explanation. But NatWest are under no obligation, that Im aware 
of, to do so. Id also add that our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may 
treat evidence from banks as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it 
contains security information, or commercially sensitive information. Some of the information 
NatWest has provided is information that we consider should be kept confidential.
NatWest is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with it. But 
before NatWest closes an account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the terms 
and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account, which NatWest and Mr O had to comply with, say 
that it could close the account by giving them at least two months notice. And in certain 
circumstances it can close an account immediately or with less notice.
Having looked at the information given to me by NatWest, Im satisfied it was entitled to 
close the account in the way that it has done.
In my previous decision, Id said based on the limited information I had, that the complaint 
should be upheld. And because of that I thought NatWest needed to compensate Mr O for 
the deprivation of funds, distress, inconvenience and refund any fees including failed 
payment ones. I also said NatWest should give Mr O a letter that enables him to show his creditors that any failed payments, and adverse credit because of that, was because of 
NatWests errors.
But having looked at the new evidence presented to me, and given I think Barclays acted in 
line with its obligations and terms of account when restricting and closing the account, I can 
see no basis on which I might make an award against NatWest.
So Im not going to ask NatWest to compensate Mr O for any trouble and upset this may 
have caused. Nor for being deprived of his funds, and any fees to be refunded to him. It 
follows I wont also be asking it to send a letter that it had made an error given I no longer 
think it did
I then set a deadline for both parties to make any new submissions for me to consider before 
I decide this complaint. NatWest said it had nothing further to add. Mr O hasnt responded. 
As the deadline for responses has passed, I will now decide this complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint. The reasons for doing so are 
contained in my latest, and second provisional decision sent in November 2023  as above. 
But for simplicity and to avoid any confusion, heres a summary of my key findings: 
NatWest restricted Mr Os account in line with its legal and regulatory obligations 
NatWest is under no obligation to explain why it took the actions it did 
NatWest was entitled to close Mr Os account in the way it did, and did so in line with 
the terms of the account 
As NatWest didnt do anything wrong, I see no basis for it to pay Mr O compensation 
for the financial loss, distress and inconvenience he says he suffered. Nor does 
NatWest need to give Mr O a letter for his creditors to show it made errors 
My final decision
For the reasons above, I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 January 2024.
