The complaint
Mr H complains his life protection policy with Phoenix Life Limited shouldve provided 
£30,000 life cover when he reached the age of 65, but instead it reduced to £15,000. 
What happened
 In 1975, Mr H took out a life assurance policy with a business I will call company A. Phoenix 
later took on responsibility for the policy, which was sold as a double protection plan that 
provided a sum assured that halved when Mr H reached age 65. When he took out the 
policy Mr H says he was told the sum assured was £30,000 and this was doubled up to 
£60,000 until he reached age 65. Mr H raised a query about the sum assured in 2003, and 
company A wrote to him and told him that if he died before age 65 the policy would pay 
£60,000, but if he died after age 65, it would pay £30,000.
In early 2020, when Mr H was aged 80, Phoenix sent him a statement showing the sum 
assured was £15,000 and not the £30,000 Mr H was expecting. Mr H complained to Phoenix 
and they provided a final response upholding the complaint in part. Phoenix said company A 
had made a mistake when they sent the letter in 2003 as the policy terms and conditions 
stated the sum assured reduced when Mr H reached 65 by 50%. They added the original 
sum assured was £30,000, which meant that the sum assured after age 65 reduced to 
£15,000. Phoenix apologised the letter issued in 2003 was incorrect and offered to pay Mr H 
£200 to reflect the trouble and upset this had caused him.
Mr H didnt accept the offer from Phoenix and brought his complaint to our service where 
one of our investigators looked into things for him. Our investigator thought the policy initially 
had a sum assured of £30,000 and didnt think he could reasonably conclude Mr H had been 
misled about this. The investigator thought the letter company A sent Mr H in 2003 was 
incorrect and consequently Mr H had to redraft his Will.  Our investigator thought the offer 
Phoenix made to pay Mr H £200 for the trouble and upset caused by the 2003 letter was fair 
and reasonable. However, he also thought Phoenix should refund what Mr H paid to have 
his Will redrafted as a result of the error and that Phoenix should add 8% simple interest per 
year from 6 November 2020 until they make the payment.
Mr H didnt agree with our investigator and asked for an ombudsman to decide his 
complaint. Mr H says he is suspicious of the documentation Phoenix have provided and that 
the agent who sold the policy told him the sum assured was doubled to £60,000 to age 65. 
Phoenix accepted what our investigator suggested as a remedy. They said they would re-
issue the cheque for £200 they had previously sent as it hadnt been honoured because it 
was presented after six-months. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 There are three key areas to this complaint, and I will address each of them in turn, but for 
much the same reasons as the investigator, Im satisfied that Phoenix made a mistake in the 
2023 letter and they need to take steps to put this right. But, I dont consider the policy was 
mis-sold and I will now explain why.
The double protection cover.
The original policy document from 1975 is no longer available, but Phoenix have provided a 
copy of the policy schedule from micro-fiche records they hold. Mr H believes Phoenix 
should be directed to provide the original document, or at least a better copy of it, as it is 
unreadable in some places. However, Im satisfied the copy Ive seen provides enough 
information for me to conclude what the initial sum assured on the policy was. Ive also been 
provided with a copy of the terms and conditions that apply to the policy.
The sum assured on the copy policy document is £30,000. The terms and conditions of the 
plan say if Mr H died before reaching age 65 Phoenix would pay the sum assured shown on 
the face of the policy. So, if Mr H had died before age 65 Phoenix wouldve paid the sum of 
£30,000. However, the terms and conditions go on to say that when Mr H is aged over 65, 
Phoenix will pay half of the sum assured, which in this case would be a payment of £15,000. 
Mr H asked me to consider section 7 of the terms and conditions as this refers to attached 
benefits. It says, The Sum Assured or other benefit granted under the Attached Benefits 
shown on the face of the Policy will be paid in addition to the Sum Assured under the Basic 
Plan in accordance with the provisions (if any) relating to that Attached Benefit. The specific 
information on the face of the policy schedule is impossible to read, but I can see that there 
is information in the Basic Plan section sum assured and premium boxes, but there is 
nothing in the Attached Benefits boxes. So, although Ive considered Mr Hs comments, Im 
not persuaded there were any attached benefits to this policy, and section 7 doesnt apply.
Neither the policy terms and conditions nor the copy policy persuade me the sum assured 
was ever £60,000, although I appreciate this is a conclusion Mr H reached. I consider its 
crucial that the terms and conditions dont say the sum assured is doubled before age 65, 
instead they say the sum assured is halved after age 65. The sum assured on the policy 
document Ive seen is £30,000, so Im therefore satisfied this was the double protection the 
policy referred to and it halved to £15,000 at age 65.
The policy was mis-sold.
Mr H says he was told by the agent who sold the policy that it provided £30,000 life cover 
that doubled up to £60,000 until he reached the age of 65. Phoenix have provided copies of 
the policy application their agent completed, along with the documents Ive already referred 
to, and these support the sum assured was £30,000 and it halved to £15,000.
The sale of the policy took place in 1975, and for me to decide the policy was mis-sold at the 
time I would need to be reasonably sure the agent told Mr H the sum assured was initially 
£60,000, reducing to £30,000 when he reached aged 65. Whilst Ive considered Mr Hs 
recollection of the events and what he says he was told, the sale of the policy happened 
more than 45 years ago, and I dont consider it would be fair and reasonable to consider 
these comments in isolation, and the documents Ive seen make no reference to £60,000 
cover being provided. So, Ive considered all the documentation provided by Mr H and 
Phoenix alongside Mr Hs recollection of what he was told. I have some empathy with Mr H 
here, and I accept the way the policy documents referred to double protection could have 
the capacity to cause misunderstanding or confusion, and this was no doubt compounded by 
the 2003 letter sent by company A. However, from what Ive seen and heard Im not 
persuaded it was likely the policy was mis-sold.The 2003 letter from company A.
Ive read the letter from company A and I want to make it clear to Mr H that it does indeed 
confirm the policy had a sum assured of £60,000 that reduced to £30,000 when he reached 
age 65. However, as Ive explained earlier in my decision, this isnt what the policy 
documents said. So, Im satisfied this letter was more likely issued by someone who 
misunderstood the terms of the policy. Phoenix say this letter was incorrect and accept that 
Mr H relied on the information it contained.
Im satisfied the life cover provided by this policy is important to Mr H as he wrote a Will 
incorporating the benefits due from the policy on his death. I considered whether Mr H 
wouldve cancelled the policy in 2003 if he had been aware the life cover was only £15,000 
rather than £30,000. Im satisfied its likely he wouldve continued with the policy at this 
reduced sum assured. My conclusion in this regard is supported by Mr H taking steps to 
retain the policy when he found out the sum assured was lower than he thought, and then 
changing his Will to incorporate the £15,000 sum assured. However, this resulted in Mr H 
experiencing some trouble and upset, and importantly, having to pay for his Will to be 
amended, which I dont consider Phoenix took into account in their final response.  
Putting things right
Im not persuaded the policy was mis-sold to Mr H and Im satisfied it provided £30,000 life 
cover up to age 65 and £15,000 thereafter. However, the letter of 2003 caused Mr H some 
trouble and upset. In my opinion the £200 offer made by Phoenix didnt address the full 
impact on Mr H. He incurred specific costs he wouldnt have incurred if the letter had 
correctly stated the sum assured before and after age 65. Ive decided Phoenix should pay 
Mr Hs costs for the redrafting of the Will he completed in November 2020 in addition to the 
£200 for trouble and upset the 2003 letter caused. 
My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and order Phoenix Life Limited to:
Pay Mr H the costs of redrafting his Will to put him back in the financial position he 
wouldve been in if the 2003 error hadnt occurred;
Add 8% simple interest per year from 6 November 2020 until the date payment is made; 
and,
Pay Mr H £200 to make up for the trouble and upset the 2003 letter caused him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 April 2021.
