The complaint
Mr Y complains about a buyer dispute claim with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
(PayPal).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute so I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
For me to say PayPal did something wrong, Id need to be satisfied that they failed to act 
within the terms of the accounts User Agreement. Or, if I feel like they did work within these, 
that it was unfair for it to not refund the money as part of the buyer dispute in the 
circumstances of this complaint. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case, Ill explain 
why. 
Mr Y signed up to PayPals User Agreement when he opened his account.
Within the User Agreement, it states 
IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify 
as part of the settlement of your claim. PayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to 
reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.
It goes on to say.
Step 4: Comply with PayPals shipping requests in a timely manner, if youre filing a 
Significantly Not as Described claim. PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the 
item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to 
provide proof of delivery.
I appreciate Mr Y made a purchase from an international seller and this has meant 
the return shipping costs are high. Mr Y wouldve been aware of the possibility that 
he would need to pay any additional shipping costs to return the item through a buyer 
dispute claim, as its listed in the User Agreement. Mr Y choose to go ahead with 
the purchase knowing this information. 
PayPal emailed Mr Y asking him to return the item for a refund. 
Having considered the information supplied by both Mr Y and PayPal, and in the 
circumstances of this complaint, as Mr Y hasnt been able to provide proof of a 
return delivery, Im satisfied PayPal havent treated Mr Y unfairly or against terms of 
the User Agreement when it hasnt refunded Mr Y as part of the claim. 
Mr Y has said that PayPal have broken the Equality Act. Ive thought about this point 
carefully and Ive taken this into account because its relevant law. But my remit is to 
decide cases on a fair and reasonable basis. So, if Mr Y wants a decision that 
PayPal have breached or broken the Equality Act 2010, then hed need to go to 
court.
I have thought about the points Mr Y has raised in relation to why he thinks PayPal 
have broken the Equality Act though. Mr Y appears to have come to this view 
because he says PayPal didnt respond to his emails. From looking at the point in 
time when Mr Y raised the dispute with PayPal, Ive seen no information to evidence 
that it did fail to reply. PayPal looks to have raised a claim in a reasonable amount of 
time and then responded to Mr Y.I can also see that following a call from a PayPal 
advisor, Mr F asked for a final response letter on the 14 April 2023 and this was sent 
on the same day. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 October 2023.
