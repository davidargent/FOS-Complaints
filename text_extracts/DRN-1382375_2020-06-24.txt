The complaint
Mr N says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr N says he was already struggling with other debts he had and the lending as 
unaffordable for him. 
What happened
This complaint is about 22 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr N between March 2015 
and January 2019. There were several chains of lending. Mr Ns borrowing history is as

When Mr N complained to Sunny, and before he brought his complaint to us, it offered to 
write off the outstanding balance on Mr Ns account which totalled £145.49
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ns complaint and thought the loans from loan eight 
onwards shouldnt have been given as it looked as though Mr N was becoming persistently 
reliant on this type of credit. 
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicator but did offer to uphold the complaint about loans 17 to 
22. We put the offer to Mr N, but he didnt wish to accept it.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for a decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr N could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr N could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr N didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to seven shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr N had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why.
I should first clarify the chains of lending during the relationship. I am satisfied there were 
three chains of lending.  Loan one, loan two and then loans three to 22. I say this because I 
dont think its unreasonable for Sunny to have assumed that Mr N had overcome whatever 
financial circumstances had caused him to take high-cost credit in the first instance after 
loan one when there was a five month break before Mr N returned for further borrowing at 
loan two. And then there was a four month break before Mr N took loan three. A break in a 
chain of lending in effect, starts the clock ticking again on what we would consider to be 
proportionate checks a business should carry out when taking into account the length of the 
borrowing relationship with a consumer. But I dont think the same can be said for the breaks of two months between loans eight and 
nine, the break of three months between loans nine and ten and four months between loans 
17 and 18. I say this because of the length of time of the borrowing relationship and the 
number of loans that Mr N had taken. By the time Mr T took loan nine his borrowing 
relationship with Sunny had been for 15 months and loans seven and eight were still 
running. And by the time there were breaks after loan nine and loan 17, the borrowing 
relationship had been going on for even longer. 
So, I will be treating the lending as three chains. Loan one, loan two and then loan three 
onwards. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr N, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ns case, and like the adjudicator, I think that this 
point was reached by loan eight. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr N was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Not taking account of loans one and two, Mr N had taken out six loans 
within four months. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr N 
was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Ns indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mr Ns first loan in the third chain of lending, loan three, was for £100 and loan eight 
was for the same amount.  At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mr N was 
not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an 
ongoing need. 
 
When Mr N took loan eight, loans six and seven were still outstanding so Mr Ns 
indebtedness to Sunny was increasing, and so were his monthly repayments. 
 
And Mr Ns borrowing behaviour suggested that he was becoming reliant on these 
loans and that they were unsustainable for him. He took three loans within two weeks 
of each other in May 2016  loans four to six  but loans four and five were repaid 
the same day that loan six was taken which would suggest Mr N was juggling his 
finances. 
 
Mr N wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 22 was 
taken out 34 months after Mr Ns first loan in the third chain of borrowing. Mr N had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Mr N lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan eight 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ns indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr N borrowed was likely to
have had negative implications on Mr Ns ability to access mainstream credit and so
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans eight to 22 and Sunny should put things 
right.
Putting things right
A. Sunny should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr N towards
interest, fees and charges on these loans, not including anything Sunny has already
refunded.
B. Sunny should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by
Mr N which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr N originally
made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Sunny may  if it chooses to  use the total of A plus B to repay any principal
which Sunny has written off.
D. Sunny should pay any remaining refund to Mr N. If there is no refund left and still a
balance outstanding made up of written off principal, it would not be fair for Sunny to
pursue this further.
E. The overall pattern of Mr Ns borrowing for loans eight to 22 means any information
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely from
Mr Ns credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr N a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ns complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
