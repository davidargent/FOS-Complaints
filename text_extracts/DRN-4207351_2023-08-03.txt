The complaint
Ms S complains MoneyGram International Limited (MoneyGram) closed her account 
without warning nor explanation, causing her distress and inconvenience. 
What happened
In February 2022, MoneyGram deactivated Ms S account and/or profile without any notice. 
Ms S says she has had the account and used it without issue for many years. She adds that 
she uses MoneyGrams account services to send money to her family, especially for critical 
provisions for her elderly parents. 
Unhappy with what MoneyGram did, Ms S complained. In its final response, and in 
summary, MoneyGram said: 
- It is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations globally, including various 
privacy, data protection and compliance rule and regulations. All transactions are 
subject to careful review and on-going monitoring
- To meet its compliance requirements, MoneyGram actively review transactions and 
may put account restrictions in place. Due to security reasons, it is not able to 
provide detailed information on its verification process or reopen Ms S online profile
Ms S referred her complaint to this service. One of our Investigators then looked into the 
complaint, and they recommended it be upheld. In summary, some of the key findings they 
made were: 
- MoneyGram hasnt specified which specific term it relied on when deciding to close 
the account. So its not possible to conclude MoneyGram acted in line with the terms 
and conditions of the account 
- MoneyGram hasnt provided enough evidence to show why it took the actions it did. 
So in the absence of any evidence to show why it closed Ms S accounts without 
warning, its not possible to say its actions were fair or reasonable  
- Its understandable MoneyGram may not want us to share sensitive information with 
Ms S, but unless its shares this with us, its not possible to say it acted fairly 
- MoneyGram should reinstate or offer Ms S a new account, and pay her £250 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience it has caused 
Ms S accepted what our Investigator said. MoneyGram initially didnt respond, but later said 
following a review, it had now decided to reinstate Ms S account and profile. But it did not 
agree to pay Ms S any compensation as recommended by our Investigator. 
This complaint has now been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint. Ill explain why. 
Financial businesses, like MoneyGram, are strictly regulated in the UK and must take certain 
actions in order to meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry 
out ongoing monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means they 
need to restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
Given the obligations MoneyGram must follow, Im satisfied it acted in line with these when 
reviewing Ms S account with it. 
MoneyGram is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with it. 
But before it closes an account or a profile, it must do so in a way which complies with the 
terms and conditions of the account.
MoneyGrams terms say: 
We may terminate or suspend the access to a Profile at any time, including without 
limitation, if: (a) the Sender attempts to transfer or charge funds from a credit or debit card 
that does not belong to the Sender; (b) the Senders card issuer attempts to charge back a 
Transfer on the basis of a dispute related to a Transfer; (c) the Sender provides incorrect or 
false information about himself, its debit or credit card details or about a Recipient; (d) the 
Sender has breached these terms and conditions; (e) we determine that the Profile has been 
inactive for a substantial time period; or (f) we believe that a Transfer has been used for an 
unlawful purpose.
Ms S would like to know why MoneyGram took the actions it did. Im aware of no obligation 
under which I or MoneyGram should give this information to Ms S. But MoneyGram does 
need to tell us what those reasons are and provide sufficient evidence to show it acted fairly 
and in line with its terms of account. 
From the information Ive been given, Im not satisfied MoneyGram had reason enough to 
take the action of closing Ms S account down in the way it did. MoneyGram has 
subsequently said, and after our Investigators involvement, that upon reviewing the account 
again, it will re-open it. But to be clear, I havent seen enough to be persuaded it should have 
been closed at all in the first place. 
Ms S says she supports her family and friends financially, and most importantly, pays for 
medical and food costs for her elderly parents who live abroad. Ms S says that not having 
use of her MoneyGram account, given shes been using it for so long, has caused her 
severe distress and inconvenience. Shes talked about having to utilise her family to find 
other ways of getting funds to her parents. 
I can understand this matter would have distressed Ms S and caused her worry. I also note 
that the account wasnt reopened for around a year, which I think has compounded the 
inconvenience Ms S has suffered. 
So after weighing everything up, Im satisfied £250 is fair compensation for the distress, 
inconvenience and likely embarrassment Ms S suffered. My final decision
Ive decided to uphold this complaint. To put things right, MoneyGram International Limited 
should re-open Ms S account if it hasnt already, and it should pay her £250 compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 August 2023.
