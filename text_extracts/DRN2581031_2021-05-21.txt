What has Mr M said?
Mr M says he received a message from an American lady who asked for his help because  
she was in Nigeria with no access to money.  She explained that she had some gold and 
would pay him back. Then, when she was travelling  back to America, she said shed been 
stopped at the airport because she needed to pay tax on the gold. The gold was released 
and sold but the lady said she needed to pay for a Nigerian  business account to allow the 
proceeds to be transferred to her in America. There were lots of other people assisting the 
lady and dealing with Mr M, including a bank manager and an accountant. Mr M was 
promised that he would  get back more  money  than he lent to the lady.
He hadnt used the MoneyGram service before, and he was given a plus card so that his 
details could be found quickly.
He told the cashiers  at the MoneyGram locations  he used that the payments were  for an 
investment, but they didnt ask any questions  or discuss the payments further with him.
When he kept receiving  requests for more money, he discussed  the situation  with a family  
member, and it was then that he realised he might have been  scammed. He reported  the 
matter to MoneyGram, but it did not provide a substantive  response,  so he referred a 
complaint to this Service.
What did our investigator say?
From what  hed seen, our investigator  thought  that MoneyGram ought to have been 
concerned that Mr M was at risk of being scammed by the time he made the payment to 
receiver 2 on 3 August  2017. And he thought the scam couldve been prevented if 
MoneyGram had asked Mr M some  appropriate questions. So he recommended  that 
MoneyGram refund all the payments Mr M made  from 3 August 2017  and pay 8% interest.
Ref: DRN25810313What has MoneyGram said?
MoneyGram has said:
Fraud warnings are provided at the top of all send forms so that customers dont fall 
victim to common  scams such as this. They warn customers  not to send money  to 
strangers and/or people they havent  met personally, or for investments. Customers  
are required  to acknowledge  the warnings and agree to the terms and conditions  of 
the transfer before a payment is processed.
MoneyGram cannot provide send forms for all the payments Mr M made.  It has 
provided the form for the payment sent to receiver 3 on 15 August 2017 and says 
that Mr M signed  the acknowledgement  agreeing  to its fraud  warnings and terms and 
conditions.
MoneyGram is commonly used to transfer money abroad.  Mr M didnt complete the 
transfers all at once,  and the amounts were  not large sums, so its not likely that the 
processing agents wouldve been suspicious.
MoneyGram has no way of regulating any agreement between a sender and 
receiver, and it shouldnt be held liable to compensate Mr M for the acts of a 
fraudster.
Its MoneyGram Plus Program is a service  which  allows  for faster transaction  
processing. Customer information is stored so that customers  can select sender and 
receiver information quickly  without  completing  new send forms. Fraud  warnings are 
still provided for each  transfer.
My provisional decision
I issued my provisional decision on 31 March 2021.  In reaching my decision, I considered all 
the available  evidence and arguments  to decide  what was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. When considering  whats  fair and reasonable, Im required 
to take into account:  relevant law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; 
codes of practice; and, where appropriate,  what I consider to have been good  industry  
practice at the relevant time. 
I said its not in dispute  that Mr M was the victim of a scam. He instructed the payments and 
he is presumed liable for his loss in the first instance under the Payment Services  
Regulations 2009. But thats  not the end of the story.
There are circumstances  in which additional  checks should be made  before  a payment is 
processed, or in some cases a payment  should  be declined  altogether, to help protect 
customers from the possibility of financial harm. MoneyGram has a duty to exercise  
reasonable care and skill, and pay due regard to the interest of its customers   striking  a 
balance in the extent to which it intervenes  in payments, against the risk of unduly 
inconveniencing or delaying legitimate payment requests.
MoneyGram has pointed  to its fraud warnings,  particularly the warnings against  sending 
money to strangers, or for investments. But even if Mr M saw them,  I didnt think  generic 
fraud warnings went far enough in the circumstances. 
I appreciated that cashiers may not always have  access to a customers transaction history 
when processing  payments,  and that they may not have had prior dealings  with a customer.  
But Mr M was signed  up to the MoneyGram Plus Program, and by the very nature of it, I 
presumed the scheme gives cashiers some insight  into a customers  transaction  history.  I 
Ref: DRN25810314said its unclear when Mr M signed up to the scheme, but the send form and receipt  
MoneyGram has provided this Service with show that he was signed up by 15 August 2017. 
And he regularly  used the same MoneyGram locations from the outset to make the 
payments. So I was persuaded that in this case, the cashiers involved would have  had some  
knowledge of Mr M and the payments  he was making.
I acknowledged what MoneyGram has said about the relatively  low value of the payments, 
and I understood  that the MoneyGram service is commonly used to transfer money abroad. 
But Mr M sent 19 payments to 5 different receivers in the space of 6 months. There was no 
regular pattern to the payments, as I might expect  to see if a customer  was regularly 
transferring money  to family members  in their home country for example. And I thought  that 
other details  about  the payments, including the frequency of them,  was unusual too. On     
15 August 2017  alone, Mr M sent 3 payments within just over an hour to 3 different receivers 
from 3 different MoneyGram locations.  Overall,  I thought the pattern, frequency  and send 
from/to details of the payments ought  to have indicated that Mr M was at risk of financial 
harm.
I pointed out that Mr M ticked a box on the send form MoneyGram has provided to show his 
payment was for an investment/savings. I didnt know whether  hed ticked  the same box on 
the send forms for the other payments,  because  those  forms havent been provided. But hes 
said he told the cashiers that the payments were for an investment, so I thought it 
reasonable to assume that he did in absence of any evidence to the contrary. I said its 
unusual to invest via money transfer, and investment scams are not uncommon.  In fact, 
sending money  for an investment is one of the things the generic  fraud  warnings 
MoneyGram has pointed  to attempt to discourage. So again,  I thought  there was information  
available to the cashiers which ought to have indicated that Mr M was at risk of financial 
harm, and I thought  it was likely  that this information was available  from the first payment.
I explained that I wouldnt have expected MoneyGram to interrogate  Mr M about the 
payments, and I acknowledged  that the main perpetrators  here are the fraudsters, but I 
didnt think MoneyGram went far enough  in the circumstances.  This type of scam wasnt  
uncommon at the time and, considering the generic fraud warnings  MoneyGram has 
highlighted, it seemed  that it was aware of this. But opportunities  to intervene and discuss 
the payments  in more detail were missed  when I thought they ought  reasonably  to have  
been taken. It doesnt  appear  that Mr M was provided with a cover story,  and he was truthful 
about the reason for sending the payments according to his testimony and the send form 
thats been provided. So I was satisfied he would have spoken  freely if hed been asked 
some questions. And if hed been told about  the prevalence of investment scams,  in 
consideration of the questions asked and answers given, its reasonable to think that he 
wouldnt have made the payments, the scam  would have unravelled, and he wouldnt have 
lost his money. So I was persuaded  that this complaint should be upheld  and MoneyGram  
should reimburse all the payments Mr M made, along with the related  transaction fees  and 
pay 8% simple interest per year from the date of each payment to the date of settlement.
I also thought  it appropriate to make  a modest  award of £200 for the trouble and upset Mr M 
has experienced in this protracted matter. Whilst I was mindful that his loss was ultimately  
caused by the callous  acts of fraudsters, I thought that MoneyGram could have prevented  
the payments,  and it could have acted with more care and urgency in dealing with Mr M.
I invited Mr M and MoneyGram to send  me any further information they wanted me to 
consider in making my final decision.
Ref: DRN25810315Responses to my provisional decision
Mr M replied to let me know  that he agreed with my provisional decision. But MoneyGram 
didnt agree. It said, in summary:
It followed the appropriate procedures and acted  reasonably  in processing the 
transactions.
Mr M failed to observe  and comply with the warnings he was given in relation to the 
type of scam he fell victim to, so MoneyGram  isnt liable for his loss according to the 
terms and conditions  he agreed to.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry  to hear that MoneyGram  doesnt  agree with my provisional findings. But in 
responding, I dont  think its given me any new information that I havent  already had an 
opportunity to consider. And, as Mr M has accepted my provisional  decision without 
providing any new information either, I see no reason to depart from the conclusions  I set out 
in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint and instruct  
MoneyGram International Limited to:
refund  all the payments Mr M made, along  with the related transaction fees  and 
pay 8% simple interest per year from the date of each payment to the date of 
settlement*.
pay Mr M £200 for any trouble and upset this matter has caused him over a 
prolonged period.
*If MoneyGram considers its required by HM Revenue  & Customs to take off income  tax 
from the interest, it should tell Mr M how much its taken off. It should also give him a 
certificate showing this, if he asks for one, so that he can reclaim the tax from HMRC if 
appropriate.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 June  2021.
