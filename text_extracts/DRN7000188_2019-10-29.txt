Mr M says MYJAR Limited  shouldnt have provided him with loans because he was in a debt 
spiral and these loans werent  affordable  for him. 
background
Mr M took 8 loans from MYJAR  between March 2016 and December  2017.  A summary of

In our adjudicators most recent findings  he thought MYJAR had treated Mr M fairly when it 
provided the first three loans. 
However, the adjudicator didnt think the fourth  loan, and any subsequent loans shouldve  
been provided. The adjudicator felt that by that point  a pattern of lending had been 
established which shouldve  indicated to MYJAR  that Mr M wasnt  able to sustainably repay 
his loans.  
Mr M hasnt  said whether he disagrees  with the adjudicators  most  recent  findings.  
MYJAR didnt accept the adjudicators findings  because it believed the information it 
provided to us showed that these loans  were suitable for Mr M.  As no agreement could be 
reached, the case has been passed  to me for a final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks in order to figure out 
whether Mr M could repay  the loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN70001882But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So MYJAR was required  to establish whether Mr M could sustainably  repay  his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  Mr M could 
sustainably make his repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint. 
Mr M and MYJAR both appear  to have accepted the adjudicators findings about the first 
three loans.  So I wont  be making a finding  about these loans in this decision as they are no 
longer in dispute. But, I have kept in mind that these  loans were granted when thinking about 
the overall lending relationship. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of MYJARs lending history  with Mr M, and I think that 
MYJAR should reasonably have seen that Mr M was unlikely to have been able to make his 
loan repayments  in a sustainable  manner by the time it provided loan four. I say this 
because:
Mr M continued  to be provided  with new loans after he had repaid previous ones. 
And normally for increasing  amounts. So MYJAR ought  to have realised it was more  
likely than not Mr M  was having to borrow further to cover the hole the repayment of 
his previous loans  left in his finances  and that Mr Ms indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably. 
Mr M wasnt reducing the amounts he owed to MYJAR. For example, loan 8 was 
taken out over 18 months after Mr Ms first loan was approved, and the value of this 
loan was for more  than six times  the sum of his first loan.  
I think that Mr M lost out because MYJAR  provided  loans 4 - 8 because:
the loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time;  
and
Ref: DRN70001883the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ms ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im partly upholding Mr Ms complaint and MYJAR should  put things right as set out 
below.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  4 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove all entries about  loans 4 - 8 from Mr Ms credit file. The period of time Mr M 
owed MYJAR money means that any information still recorded about  loan these 
loans is adverse. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ms complaint. 
MYJAR Limited should put things right for Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 November  2019.
