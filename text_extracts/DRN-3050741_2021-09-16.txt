The complaint
 Miss T complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wont close her account to 
enable her to open a new one. 
What happened
Miss T opened a PayPal account in 2015. In 2018, PayPal placed a limitation on her account 
while it conducted a review and asked Miss T to provide identification. Following this review, 
PayPal realised that Miss T had opened her account when she was under 18 and this was 
against its terms and conditions. Because of this, it told Miss R it had permanently limited 
her account. PayPal explained that if Miss T wanted to continue using PayPal, shed need to 
open a new account using a different email address. 
Miss T tried to remove the bank account linked to her PayPal account and close the old 
account, but wasnt able to do so. She complained to PayPal about this. PayPal responded 
to her complaint setting out why it had permanently restricted her account, but it didnt 
address the issue about not being able to remove her bank account details or being unable 
to close the account. Miss T contacted PayPal a number of times and was often sent generic 
responses not addressing the problem. 
Unhappy with this, Miss T referred her complaint to us in March 2021 where one of our 
investigators looked into the complaint. Following our involvement, PayPal removed the 
bank account details from Miss Ts PayPal account, but she was still unable to close the 
account.  
Our investigator wrote to PayPal setting out her findings. She thought PayPal had failed to 
understand why Miss T was unhappy. She recommended PayPal close the account, as per 
Miss Ts request and that PayPal should pay Miss T £50 compensation for not resolving the 
problem shed had for over five months.
Miss T accepted this, but PayPal didnt agree. It again explained why Miss Ts account 
would be permanently limited and said Miss T would need to open a new account using a 
new email address. The complaint has now been passed to me to make a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I agree with our investigator that PayPal hasnt understood Miss Ts concerns. Miss T hasnt 
complained about the fact that PayPal restricted her account. She complained that she 
wasnt able to remove her bank details or close the account. PayPal has since removed the 
bank details.
Our investigator has again asked PayPal why it cant simply close Miss Ts account. PayPal 
didnt answer this but again explained why it was correct to permanently restrict the account.
Miss Ts complaint is that she wants her account to be closed. It seems to me that this 
should be a simple task, so its not clear to me why, despite numerous requests, PayPal 
hasnt explained why it cant or wont do so. It follows that I dont think its responses have 
been reasonable, so Im going to tell PayPal to permanently close Miss Ts account.
PayPal has already explained to Miss T that if she then wants to continue to use its services, 
she will need to open a new account with a different email address. I know Miss T would like 
to use the same email address she had linked to her previous account, but this is not 
something I can insist upon. I think PayPal is entitled to say that if Miss T wishes to continue 
using its service, she needs to set up a new account with a different email address. 
Miss T contacted PayPal on a number of occasions for help in removing her bank details, 
but it didnt listen to her concerns or answer her questions. Because of this, I think its 
prolonged this process and caused Miss T unnecessary inconvenience. I agree with our 
investigator that she should be paid compensation in this regard, and £50 seems a fair 
amount. 
Putting things right
PayPal should permanently close Miss Ts PayPal account (the account this complaint is the 
subject of) and write to her confirming its done so. It should also pay her £50 compensation 
for the reasons set out above.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to put things right as set 
out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2021.
