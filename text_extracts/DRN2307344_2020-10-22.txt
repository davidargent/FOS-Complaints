K820x#14complaint
VR complains that FirstPort Insurance  Services Limited incorrectly  increased the sum 
insured on its buildings insurance  policy causing it to be over-insured and to pay an inflated  
premium.
 
background
VR is a company  that represents the interests of the leaseholders of a complex of flats. It 
ensures that the property is properly managed and maintained  by outsourcing  the 
responsibility to a professional property management company, F. F has acted as 
managing agent  since  the developments completion in 2012. VR is a non-profit company 
managed by four directors acting voluntarily. This complaint is brought on behalf  of VR by 
one of its directors, Mr C. 
F retained the services of FirstPort, an insurance broker, to arrange buildings insurance for 
the blocks of flats within the complex. Since 2012 FirstPort placed the insurance with an 
insurer, E. The policy provided by E includes a valuation agreement  whereby E will 
periodically value  the blocks of flats within the complex in order  to maintain an up to date 
rebuild sum insured.  Between  valuations, the sum insured is revised at renewal by the index 
linking provided  within the policy. E provides the valuation service  free of charge. 
Independent of any process E had in place within the insurance policy, F arranged  for the 
property to be valued by an independent  surveyor on 27 July 2017. It appears F passed this 
valuation on to FirstPort and instructed that it be used for the purposes of insuring the 
property. FirstPort  followed Fs instructions  and the sum insured on the insurance policy was 
increased, which resulted  in an increased premium.
In November 2018, E undertook a new valuation (at VRs behest) which resulted in a 
downward revision of the sum insured  and a consequent reduction in the premium VR was 
asked to pay. In January 2019,  VR was asked to provide E with a formal,  signed request to 
reduce the sum insured despite  not being  asked to provide it with one when the sum insured 
was increased in July 2017. 
VR complained to FirstPort. VR said itd never  asked for the third-party  valuation  to be 
undertaken, or for the sum insured  to be revised. It said that, as a result,  the buildings were 
over insured  by more  than £2.5m for over 18 months  during  which  time it paid £4,816.85 
more in premium than it needed to. So, it said it wanted FirstPort to reimburse  this amount. It 
also said that it wanted to see the written instruction FirstPort had given to E to increase the 
sum insured in July 2017.
FirstPort looked into VRs complaint but didnt  think itd done anything wrong. VR appointed 
a new broker to act on its behalf and complained to this service. 
VR complains that FirstPort failed  to act in its best interests by failing  to place its building  
insurance on the best available  terms, thereby causing it to suffer a financial loss. When VR 
complained to FirstPort, it says that FirstPort was unhelpful and uncooperative in responding 
to its queries. 
Specifically, VR says that FirstPort  used  a valuation carried  out by an independent third-
party valuer (rather than E) for which it was charged an un-necessary fee (that fee 
subsequently being refunded to VR). VR says that it never requested, consented or agreed 
Ref: DRN23073442to the third-party  valuation  or the resultant upward  revision of the sum insured and the 
associated premium (between July 2017  and January 2019), that it led to. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt think FirstPort had handled the 
complaint unreasonably.
 
VR disagreed with our investigators  findings and asked for the complaint to be referred  for 
an ombudsmans decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have no jurisdiction over F, the propertys managing agent. Nor can I hold FirstPort 
responsible for any consequences of any actions undertaken  by F, such as arranging  an 
independent valuation. 
Mr C says only the client can decide  what the sum insured should be and that VR never  
accepted the increase that was arranged by F. Im not privy to the express nature of Fs 
authority - thats between VR and F. However,  I am satisfied that F was acting  as VRs 
representative when  selecting and commissioning FirstPort to source insurance for the 
property. In that situation, it was not unreasonable for FirstPort to accept and follow 
instructions from F. 
VR says it never agreed to the valuation. As I said, I dont  know the terms of the 
arrangement between VR and F but from the limited  information I have about it, its 
reasonable to think that F was acting  within the scope of the agreement it had with VR to 
arrange a valuation. That VR itself didnt commission the valuation  that was subsequently 
forwarded to, and acted on by FirstPort, isnt the fault of FirstPort. It seems  to me that all 
FirstPort did was receive  a valuation from its instructing  client and then used it to arrange 
cover.
From what  its told us, it was usual practice for FirstPort  to receive  valuations  F had arranged  
directly from the third-party valuer  (not only for VRs  complex of flats but for other properties 
too) and for it to then act on any change in a propertys valuation  by making sure the sum 
insured was adequate to cover the rebuild cost identified in the valuation. 
My understanding is that, prior to the issue with the third-party valuation, VR didnt deal 
directly at all with FirstPort, rather everything was dealt with on its behalf by F. So, when 
FirstPort received the third-party valuation on VRs property  as part of a batch of other 
valuations from Fs usual valuer, it acted  on the information received as it always had done: 
by making sure the sum insured on the policies it was placing matched the valuations it had. 
That FirstPort hadnt had an instruction  to do so directly from VR doesnt mean it was acting 
unreasonably or failing in its duty of care to VR. FirstPort dealt  with F to whom VR had 
outsourced the management and maintenance of its property.
So, Im unable to agree with VR that the lack of a direct instruction from it to FirstPort 
demonstrates itd failed to act in VRs best interests.  Whatever the arrangement between VR 
and F was about  the annual insurance  placing  and the arrangements for periodic valuations 
of the blocks of flats,  they were just that: an arrangement between VR and F. I cant  
Ref: DRN23073443reasonably conclude that FirstPort  did anything  wrong here. If there is any liability for the 
valuation and its consequences, it doesnt seem to reasonably  lie with FirstPort. 
And any failure by F to act on the valuation it received, given  the index linked value of the 
buildings in July 2017 was £9m lower than the third-party valuation, would, as FirstPort said,  
have left it exposed  to a potential professional negligence  claim for leaving  VR significantly 
underinsured. So, I dont think it was wrong for FirstPort  to rely  in good faith - on the third-
party valuation it was provided with by F and to use it to make  sure the sum insured was 
adequate. Of course, E acted on FirstPorts instructions  but FirstPort was acting  on the 
instructions of F in the best interests of VR. 
This complaint is about the actions  of FirstPort and I cant say that Ive seen any evidence 
that its done anything wrong. It acted on the instruction of VRs agent to ensure  the rebuild 
sum insured was adequate in light of an up to date independent valuation. I cant  agree that 
it failed to liaise directly  with VR when VR had delegated responsibility for managing the 
property to F with whom  FirstPort had dealt over the years.  That VR itself didnt agree to 
increase the sum insured or pay a higher  premium isnt the fault of FirstPort. It took its 
instruction from F. Any disagreement about  an independent valuation being commissioned 
and the resultant increased sum insured and premium should,  I think,  be more reasonably 
directed by VR to F. 
I dont think FirstPort failed  in any duty to VR by not getting its specific  authority to increase 
the sum insured in July 2017. The fact VRs specific written authority to decrease  the sum 
insured in January 2019 was needed was because the decrease  was contrary  to the 
independent valuation FirstPort had received in July 2017 (and which  the 2018 indexed  
linked renewal was based on). Without  explicit authority to decrease the sum insured, 
FirstPort would potentially  have  been  exposed to a professional negligence claim in the 
event the buildings were underinsured and a claim being made. The two situations  are, I 
think, very different.  
VR says that when  it raised its concerns with FirstPort,  it was consistently unhelpful, 
uncooperative and obstructive and that it failed to deal with its concerns in a timely way. Ive 
seen the email exchange between the two of them and Im unable to share  VRs  view about 
FirstPort. I think it endeavoured to answer the questions VR asked as best it could. Im 
unable to agree that it was consistently unhelpful or obstructive, for example,  I think it 
answered VRs queries about whether the valuation included VAT.  I do think, however, that 
FirstPorts response to VRs  complaint couldve been more  comprehensive.
I appreciate that my decision will come as a disappointment to VR but, taking all the 
circumstances of this complaint into account,  I cant fairly conclude  that FirstPort has treated 
VR unreasonably.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C on behalf  of 
VR to accept  or reject  my decision before 22 November 2020.
