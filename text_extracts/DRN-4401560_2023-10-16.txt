The complaint
Mr S complains that Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money incorrectly recorded 
a default on his credit file.
What happened
In late 2022, 118 118 Money incorrectly recorded a default on Mr Ss loan account. Mr S 
contacted several credit reference agencies (CRAs) and asked that a dispute be raised. 118 
118 Money sent a credit account amendment to the CRAs in early January 2023 and the 
credit file was corrected in March. Mr S complained to 118 118 Money, and it provided an 
apology for the error, along with an offer to pay Mr S £60 for the upset this had caused him. 
Mr S told 118 118 Money that he didnt feel this amount reflected the emotional stress and 
inconvenience hed experienced and also the time it took to remove the default. 118 118 
Money then paid Mr S £150 and confirmed the credit file amendment was completed on 10 
March.
Mr S brought the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service and one of our 
Investigators looked into things. Based on the limited information available at the time, the 
Investigator thought 118 118 Money should pay Mr S a further £100 as there was no 
evidence it had taken steps to amended Mr S credit records with the CRAs.
As Mr S and 118 118 Money didnt accept what the Investigator thought, the complaint was 
passed to me to decide. I noted that at least one of the CRAs had amended Mr Ss credit 
file, so I felt I needed more information from 118 118 Money to establish what steps it had 
taken to amend Mr Ss credit file. I reached the same outcome as the Investigator, but as Id 
received further evidence to consider, I issued a provisional decision and asked Mr S and 
118 118 Money if they had any further comments for me to consider. My provisional decision 
said:
Theres no dispute that 118 118 Money registered a default on Mr Ss loan account, 
and that it apologised to Mr S for this error in its first response letter. So, I only have 
to decide whether the actions taken by 118 118 Money to rectify the mistake were 
reasonable and that any remedy is fair in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr S raised a dispute with the CRAs in mid-December and it seems more likely than 
not that the CRAs raised disputes with 118 118 Money. Mr S says that two CRAs 
didnt receive a response from 118 118 Money, but Mr S also says at least one of the 
CRAs did amend his credit file. Because of this I felt I needed more information from 
118 118 Money to establish what steps it had taken to amend Mr Ss credit file.
118 118 Money has now provided evidence that persuades me it told the CRAs in 
early January 2023 of its error, and that the removal of the default was completed by 
10 March. I intend saying that theres no evidence to persuade me the CRAs were 
waiting for a response from 118 118 Money after 9 January. It seems the CRAs may 
have initially been waiting for information after they raised their disputes, but I intend 
saying Its more likely than not 118 118 Money confirmed the amendment on 9 
January.
It took three months for Mr Ss credit file to be corrected. Although I can see that 118 
118 Money took reasonable steps to put the matter right, this still meant Mr Ss credit 
file was impacted for three months. I intend saying 118 118 Moneys error caused Mr 
S stress and inconvenience during this period. Regardless of 118 118 Money saying 
the error was rectified in its expected timescales, the payment of £150 it has already 
paid Mr S doesnt reflect that Mr Ss ability to obtain credit during this period would 
have been restricted. Therefore, I intend saying 118 118 Money should pay Mr S a 
further £100 to reflect this and the additional distress and inconvenience this caused 
him.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both Mr S and 118 118 Money accepted my provisional decision and provided no further 
comments for me to consider, Ive decided to adopt my provisional decision as my final 
decision.
My final decision
Ive decided that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money should pay Mr S a 
further £100 to resolve this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 November 2023.
