DRN-4086925
The complaint
Mr F complains a Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax branch released sensitive account 
information to an unauthorised third-party.
What happened and what Ive decided
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr F had an ongoing dispute with Halifax over various unrelated matters. I have considered 
these matters separately. Given Mr Fs specific personal circumstances the dispute caused 
him a great deal of distress. His social worker was aware of the dispute and, as I understand 
it, attempted to assist him.
Again, as I understand it, the social worker liaised with Mr Fs local branch over what had 
happened and next steps. While Mr F is concerned about the information the social worker 
knew, I dont find there is enough here for me to conclude there was anything more to this 
matter than Halifax attempting to assist Mr F, via his social worker.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 May 2023.
