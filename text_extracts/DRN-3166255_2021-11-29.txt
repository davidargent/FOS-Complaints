The complaint
Mr K complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) didnt reduce his overdraft limit.
What happened
Mr K had an overdraft limit of £2,000 with Barclays. In June 2021, he asked for it to be 
reduced to £500. Barclays wrote to him in June 2021 and August 2021 to say he had a limit 
of £500. But due to an error, his account was left with a limit of £2,000. Between 23 August 
2021 and 24 August 2021  he went overdrawn by up to £1,159. Mr K called Barclays on 25 
August 2021 and asked for the difference between £500 (his requested overdraft limit) and 
the balance of £1,159 - to be written off.
Mr K complained. He said that because Barclays didnt reduce his overdraft limit, hed spent 
more than he wanted to. He was a pensioner with health problems and was in financial 
difficulty. When he called Barclays on 25 August 2021, he said he had a gambling problem.
In their final response, Barclays said theyd discussed Mr Ks complaint with him, and 
thought theyd resolved it. During our investigation, they told us that Mr Ks overdraft limit 
wasnt reduced as it should have been  because of a staff error. They apologised and paid 
compensation of £200. They didnt know about Mr Ks gambling problem previously  and to 
help him with that, they placed a restriction on his account so he cant now use the card for 
gambling, and theyve put a limit on his cash withdrawals. 
Mr K brought his complaint to us and our investigator looked into what had happened. He 
concluded that it was Mr Ks responsibility to check his account and manage his money. Mr 
K checked his account on the mobile app three times a week, and he could also check his 
balance on the ATM, or though telephone banking. He thought the compensation paid by 
Barclays was reasonable.
Mr K didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I was sorry to learn of Mr Ks personal circumstances.
I can see that Barclays made an error  which theyve admitted. Mr K asked that his 
overdraft limit was reduced from £2,000 to £500 in June 2021  but it wasnt and stayed at 
£2,000 until he called Barclays to complain on 25 August 2021. He believed that because of 
this, he should not have to pay the difference between the balance he went up to and the 
requested limit of £500.
Ive looked at Mr Ks account. And  he maintained his account well within the requested 
limit of £500 from May 2021 to 23 August 2021. In fact, for almost all of the time Mr Ks 
account had a credit balance. But on 23 August 2021  his balance went up to £1,102 
overdrawn and then on the following day, the balance was £1,159 debit. After that, on 25 
August 2021, the balance reduced to £424 overdrawn.
But - I think that Mr K had a responsibility to manage his spending and keep a check on his 
balance. Mr K told us hes not good with computers  but I can see that he used the ATM 
fairly often  and he couldve checked the balance on the machine easily  or called 
Barclays telephone banking to check his account. Barclays told us that he checked his 
account three times a week on his mobile banking app. 
Mr K told Barclays that he had a gambling problem  and I can see that he made several 
payments for that purpose. We dont make a judgement on how customers spend their 
money  but I was pleased to see that Barclays have tried to help Mr K by placing a 
restriction on his card so it cant be used for gambling, and theyve also placed a limit on 
ATM cash withdrawals. 
Barclays apologised and have paid £200 compensation. I think that was the right thing to do 
in the circumstances of Mr Ks complaint. But  having reviewed what happened here, my 
decision is that Barclays dont need to do anymore.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 December 2021.
