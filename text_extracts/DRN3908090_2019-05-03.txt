complaint
Miss C complains about loans CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) lent her. She says 
she couldnt afford the loans.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 8 April 2019 where I set out a detailed 
background to this complaint. Ive attached  my provisional decision to this final decision and it 
forms part of this decision.
I gave both parties the opportunity to provide further comments  before  reaching a final 
decision. Miss C has accepted my decision and hasnt provided further comments. QuickQuid  
has disagreed  and provided further comments.
In summary  QuickQuid has said:
It had provided information  about  its lending process and affordability checks. 
It didnt see there  was evidence Miss C was dependent on these loans as there were 
breaks during  her lending and her loan amounts fluctuated. 
QuickQuid has also suggested  that Miss C may have complained due to word  of mouth and 
not because the loans  were unsustainable  for her.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also thought carefully about QuickQuids response to my provisional decision and having 
done so, my conclusions remain  unchanged. Ill explain why below.
In my provisional decision,  I explained  that Id considered QuickQuids entire lending process 
document it provided and reminded it that this service had on a number of occasions 
responded to that point. On that basis I reminded it about its obligation to learn from previous 
decisions wed issued on the subject. I wont be going into details about  the lending  process  
here but as I stated  in my provisional decision,  the lending  process  QuickQuid provided isnt 
specific to Miss Cs complaint and doesnt show that it made fair lending  decisions  in her case. 
And so Ive considered what QuickQuid did in Miss Cs specific  situation.
Miss C complained before QuickQuid approved loan 12a and regardless of whether it thought 
her complaint was generic or not, I think it wouldve been responsible  and prudent  for 
QuickQuid to stop lending to her after she complained. As QuickQuid should be aware,  a 
complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction and so it could conclude that Miss C was 
dissatisfied with the way the previous loans were lent and I cant  see how giving her another 
loan was reasonable in the circumstances. Regardless of why she complained,  QuickQuid 
shouldve acted reasonably and taken  her expression of dissatisfaction into account when it 
made the subsequent lending decision.
Im surprised QuickQuid has said it didnt see evidence that Miss C was dependent on these 
loans. As stated in my provisional  decision,  when QuickQuid originally responded to Miss Cs 
complaint it accepted she was dependent on the loans from loans 5 to 9. In my opinion  that 
dependence continued throughout the lending as Miss C was repeatedly borrowing new loans 
and on every occasion she was taking additional  borrowing with each loan.
Ref: DRN3908090I considered the breaks in lending QuickQuid  has raised in my provisional decision and said:  
QuickQuid has argued that there was a break  in Miss Cs borrowing between  loans  9 and
10. And I can see that there was a gap of around two months between when Miss C repaid 
loans 9 and when she borrowed loan 10 and Ive thought carefully about this gap and having 
done so, I dont think this gap was sufficient to break the lending chain. I say this because  in 
my opinion two months isnt significant enough  to have given QuickQuid the confidence that 
Miss C was no longer  dependent  on these  loans and the need  she had to fill in her finances 
had now been  resolved.  And even though she did take a two month break her borrowing 
increased from that point on.
This break was the longest  and I dont find that its significant to show  that Miss C ceased 
dependency on the loans. It follows that I think the shorter  gaps are even less significant to 
have convinced QuickQuid that Miss Cs circumstances changed,  particularly given the length 
of time shed  been borrowing and when she borrowed she was frequently topping-up.
Ive also thought about the fluctuating loan amounts and having done  so, I can see that during 
the period in question Miss C topped-up every  loan she borrowed and the lowest  initial amount 
borrowed was £200  more than her first loan. And these initial  amounts  increased quickly  with 
the top-ups and so on average Miss C was borrowing at least  £400 in total for each one 
(original loan + top-up)  during the period. For some of the loans the total principal  borrowed 
was as high as £850. I think QuickQuid  shouldve questioned why she needed to top-up every  
loan and increase her borrowing on so many occasions. This is, to my mind, the pattern of 
someone who was dependent on the loans and needed to borrow  repeatedly to fill gaps in their 
finances.
While I understand that my conclusions will be disappointing for QuickQuid I hope my 
explanation helps it understand why I havent  changed my mind.
Miss Cs overall pattern of borrowing was unsustainable regardless of why she initially  
complained and as QuickQuid  continued  lending when it ought to have realised that her level 
of indebtedness  was increasing  and a pattern of dependency had been established, shes lost 
out and so QuickQuid needs to put things right.
putting things right   what QuickQuid needs to do
 refund all interest and charges Miss C paid on loans 5 to 11;
 pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were  paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
 as theres an outstanding balance on loans 12/12a, QuickQuid should remove  any 
interest and charges applied  to this loan and should treat all payments Miss C made 
on this loan as capital  repayments. QuickQuid  may deduct any outstanding capital 
balance but may only do this if it still owns  the loan,
 the number of loans taken from loan 5 means  any information recorded about  them  is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 5 to 12a should  be removed from Miss Cs credit 
file.
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must  give 
Miss C a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
my final decision.
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Miss Cs complaint in part 
and require CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN3908090Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 May 2019.

complaint
Miss C complains  about a number of loans she was lent by CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading
as QuickQuid).  She has said she was dependent on these loans and couldnt afford to repay  them.
background
Miss C was borrowing from QuickQuid from February 2016 to August 2017. The loan amounts 
varied from £150 to £400. QuickQuid has provided  information  about  the loans  which Ive set 
out as an appendix to this decision.
Miss C topped  up some loans and she did this more than once on a number  of loans. 
Miss C hasnt fully repaid  all her loans and there is an outstanding balance  on loan 12a.
Miss C complained  to QuickQuid in July 2017 and QuickQuid lent her loan 12a in August
2017, after she complained.
QuickQuid didnt uphold Miss Cs complaint  fully, it said it carried  out sufficient checks and didnt 
think the loans were  unaffordable.  However,  QuickQuid said it thought  that from loans
5 to 9, Miss C was dependent on these loans  and offered to refund the interest on those  loans  
and offset it against  her outstanding balance  on loan 12a. Miss C didnt  accept  the offer and 
referred her complaint to this service.
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint  and thought that QuickQuids checks  for loans 1 to 
3 went far enough  but that QuickQuid should have done more before agreeing  to lend loans 3a 
onwards. Our adjudicator thought  that a pattern in Miss Cs borrowing had developed from loan 5 
and QuickQuid shouldnt have given her loan 6 and all the subsequent  loans.
QuickQuid didnt agree  with our adjudication  and responded by saying it implemented changes 
to its affordability assessment in March 2015 and so because of those  changes, Miss Cs loans 
were lent responsibly.
As the complaint hasnt been resolved, its come to me  an ombudsman  for a decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general  approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website  and Ive 
taken this into account in deciding  Miss Cs case.
In response to our adjudication,  QuickQuid has said:
We started implementing changes  to the affordability assessment in June 2014 and all the changes 
were completed by Feb 28th 2015. Starting 1st March 2015 before Miss [C] borrowed these  loans, 
QuickQuid had implemented an affordability review that is consistent with the FCA Handbook and 
that was in place at the time we received  authorisation by the FCA. We confirm  that this assessment 
was conducted properly and individually for each of the loans you are recommending.
And that:
since 1st March 2015,  QuickQuid implemented  affordability review,  which involved collecting 
and validating  income and expense  details from customers, in line with the FCA Handbook.  As 
such, we believe  loans issued post 2015 were affordable.
Ref: DRN39080905It provided further detail  about the checks it had made when it approved loans  from 2015 
onwards in a document  called CEU Lending Criteria  and Proportional  Checks. And this response 
didnt change  our adjudicators opinion.
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic argument directly  and through  earlier final 
decisions. So Im not going to expand on this point any further  here, though Ive considered  it 
alongside everything else in making my decision.
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance in how 
complaints are to be dealt  with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular  
DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses  procedures  for complaint handling should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result  of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively applied 
in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination  by the Ombudsman to the individuals  in the respondent  who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman  concerning complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals 
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance  produced by the FCA, other relevant regulators and the Financial 
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals  dealing with complaints in 
the respondent. 
And so my decision focusses on the specifics  of Miss Cs complaint and what  both parties have 
said about this.
And Ive decided to uphold Miss Cs complaint in part and have explained why below.
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice this 
means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss C could repay her 
loans in a sustainable  manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such  as how much was being 
lent, the repayment  amounts  and Miss Cs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be reasonable and 
proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender  should  fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would include 
where:
 a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion  of 
their income
 the amount, or amounts,  due to be repaid are higher
 there is a larger number  and/or frequency of loans
 the period of time during which  a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN39080906Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there are three key questions for me to consider in order to 
fairly and reasonably determine Miss Cs complaint.  These questions are:
1. did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Miss C would  be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would  those 
checks have shown that Miss C would have been able to do so?
2. taking into account  the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Miss Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise 
harmful?
3.  did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  all of these questions and what they mean for Miss Cs 
complaint.
did QuickQuid,  each time it lent, complete reasonable  and proportionat e checks to satisfy itself 
that Miss C would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those  checks  have shown 
that Miss C would have been able to do so?
QuickQuid has told this service that before lending to Miss C, it searched her credit  file, asked her 
about her monthly  income and monthly living  costs including regular credit commitments. QuickQuid 
says it didnt  find anything on Miss Cs credit file that concerned it. Miss C hasnt been able to provide 
this service with her credit  file or further information about her circumstances at the time so I cant say 
whether there was adverse information on her credit file that shouldve concerned QuickQuid.
From the information QuickQuid has provided, Miss Cs declared income was £2,000 
throughout her borrowing from QuickQuid and her normal  living costs  until loan 12 were
£275, this included:
   housing  - £50
   utility  £75
   transport - £50
   food - £75
   other  expenses  £25
From loan 12 onwards, Miss Cs living costs increased  to £325  as she now had to pay £100 towards  
her housing.
Ive thought  carefully about the checks QuickQuid has said it carried out before it approved  each of 
her loans and having done so, I think the checks it carried  out for loans 1 to 3 went far enough.
These loans  were lent in the early stages of Miss Cs relationship with QuickQuid and I havent seen 
anything to persuade me that QuickQuid shouldve  been  doing  more at this stage. The loan 
repayments were low compared to Miss Cs income and taking into account  her declared income 
and expenses,  it was reasonable for QuickQuid to think she was in a position  to sustainably afford  to 
repay these  loans.
However, by the time Miss C applied for loan 3a, she had been borrowing continuously for around 
six months and was due to repay around a quarter of her declared income, I think QuickQuid 
shouldve been taking its checks  further  by understanding more about Miss Cs outgoings and 
what the burden on her available income  would  be before agreeing to lend.
As stated above, Miss C hasnt provided further information  about her circumstances at the time of 
the loans and so Ive relied on the information  QuickQuid  provided from the time and from what I can 
see, Miss Cs disposable income was over £1,700 which meant that her maximum repayment of 
£500.40 and £224 for loans 3a and 4 were  affordable.
Ref: DRN39080907So while I think QuickQuids checks for loans  1 to 3 went far enough,  it shouldve done more before 
agreeing to lend loans 3a onwards. And from the information Ive seen,  I cant  say loans 3a to 4 were 
unaffordable for Miss C. So Im not upholding  Miss Cs complaint about  loans 1 to 4.
I havent recreated individual,  proportionate affordability  checks  for loans 5 to 12a because
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain  why this is the case in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern  of lending 
increase Miss Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise  harmful?
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending  to see if there was a point at which QuickQuid 
should reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable,  or otherwise  harmful. And so 
QuickQuid shouldve  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further lending.  Given  the 
particular circumstances of Miss Cs case, I think that this point
was reached by loan 5. QuickQuid in its final response letter agreed that Miss C had become 
dependent on the loans  from this point and I agree  this is the case. I think  that even  beyond loan 9, 
Miss C continued  to be dependent on these  loans.
I say this because the amounts Miss C was borrowing were  generally  increasing,  and she was 
regularly requesting additional borrowing  on the original loan advances. Miss C was generally  
topping  up twice on each loan and for loan 10, she topped  up three times.
QuickQuid ought to have  realised it was likely her indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Miss C wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed  lender and was in effect paying 
large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended period.  I think QuickQuid could 
reasonably have believed that by this stage Miss C was using the loans as a supplement for her 
income and as she was borrowing continuously for around a year and half, it shouldve realised that 
she was not using these  loans for their intended  purpose of short  term cash flow.
QuickQuid has argued that there was a break in Miss Cs borrowing between loans 9 and
10. And I can see that there was a gap of around two months between when Miss C repaid  loans 9 
and when she borrowed loan 10 and Ive thought carefully about  this gap and having done so, I dont 
think this gap was sufficient to break the lending  chain.  I say this because in my opinion two months 
isnt significant enough  to have given QuickQuid the confidence that Miss C was no longer 
dependent on these loans and the need she had to fill in her finances had now been resolved. And 
even though she did take a two month break her borrowing increased from that point on. So I think 
Miss C continued  to be dependent on the loans through to loan 12a.
Also, from what  I can see, Miss C was demonstrating repayment  difficulties from loan 10 and I think  
the regular need to top-up her loans  suggests that she was struggling  to manage her finances.  I can 
see that Miss C raised her complaint about affordability of the loans before loan 12a was approved 
and even though shed indicated  to QuickQuid that she was unable
to afford  her previous  loans, it still lent her loan 12a.
In these circumstances  and as a responsible lender QuickQuid shouldnt  have  continued  to lend to 
Miss C and as QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 onwards,  she has lost out 
because:
 these  loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness  by allowing her to 
take expensive credit  over an extended period of time
 the sheer number of loans (loans including top - ups) was likely to have had negative
implications on Miss Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans
Ref: DRN39080908So Im upholding Miss Cs complaint about loans 5 to 12a because the overall pattern of lending 
increased her indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and she lost 
out as a result.
did QuickQuid  act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive carefully  thought about everything provided. Having done so, Ive not seen anything here that 
leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly  or unreasonably towards Miss C in some other way.
