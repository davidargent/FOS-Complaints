The complaint
Miss D says Advanced Payment Solutions Limited trading as Cashplus lent to her 
irresponsibly. She says that Cashplus didnt check if the loans were affordable for her. If it 
had done it wouldnt have lent to her.

This complaint is about 18 payday (iAdvance) loans, and six CreditBuilder loans, Cashplus 
provided to Miss D between August 2012 and August 2013. Ive outlined some of the

Our adjudicator didnt uphold Miss Ds complaint about the Creditbuilder loans (not included 
in the loan table above). This is because no interest was attached to them. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ds complaint about the iAdvance loans. She thought 
that it was evident that the consumer was having problems managing the loan repayments 
from loan 5 onwards. And that the lending pattern itself was harmful after loan 8.  
Cashplus disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It said that there was no persuasive 
evidence of reliance on the lending. And there was gap of over a month between some of 
the loans which was significant here. The loans were all for one off purchases which means 
they were used correctly. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Cashplus needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss D 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Cashplus should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Miss Ds complaint in part and Ive explained why below.
Miss D didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion not to uphold loans 1 to 4 (iAdvances in 
the loan table above) and the Creditbuilder loans. So, I dont think there is any ongoing 
disagreement about these arrangements. Because of this Im not making a decision about 
this lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Miss D had with Cashplus. So, 
they are something I will take into account when considering the other loans she took.
Loan 5 was Miss Ds fifth payday loan in a short period of time. She was taking a loan and 
repaying it around every two weeks and there were no significant breaks in the lending up to this point. So Cashplus shouldve made sure that Miss D could sustainably repay this 
lending. 
Having looked at the information supplied by both sides about Miss Ds circumstances, I can 
see that her income seems to be around £125 a week and it came mainly from benefits. So 
the loan repayments, given that she taking more than one loan a month, representative a 
high proportion of this.  
And Miss D looks to be using the loans to prevent her going overdrawn at times. So, Im not 
persuaded she was just using this lending for one off purchases. I think this shows she was 
generally struggling to make ends meet rather than occasionally needing extra funds to 
make a purchase. 
And, as Cashplus has noted, Miss D was spending what looks to be a reasonably significant 
proportion of her income gambling. So, the loan repayments, to some degree, would have 
been dependent on her gambling returns which isnt sustainable. 
So, having looked at all of the circumstances surrounding loans 5 to 7, I think a proportionate 
check wouldve likely shown that Miss D was having problems managing her money and she 
would struggle to repay these loans without further borrowing. 
I think that Cashplus shouldnt have given loans 5 to 7 to Miss D and I think shes lost out as 
a result of this. So Im upholding her complaint about loans 5 to 7.
And going forward. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Cashpluss lending history with 
Miss D, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Cashplus should reasonably have 
seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Cashplus should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ds case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 8. I say this because:
at this point Cashplus ought to have realised Miss D was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss D had taken out eight loans within around four months. So 
Cashplus ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss D was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loans was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Ds indebtedness was increasing unsustainably,
Miss Ds first loan was for £50 and loan 8 was for £100, double the amount. At this 
point Cashplus ought to have known that Miss D was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need, 
right from the start Miss D was provided with a new loan as soon as an existing loan 
was repaid. There were a short breaks between loans 8 to 9, and 11 to 12, but I dont 
think these breaks were long enough for Cashplus to think that all of this lending 
wasnt continuous, or part of one chain of borrowing,
Miss D wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Cashplus. Loan 18 
was taken out a year after Miss Ds first. Miss D had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect, service a debt to Cashplus over an extended period.
I think that Miss D lost out because Cashplus continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ds indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
timethe number of loans that Miss D borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Miss Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 8 to 18 and Cashplus should put things 
right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Cashplus should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it stopped lending to Miss D from loan 5, as Im satisfied it ought 
to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Miss D may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Miss D in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Miss D would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Cashpluss liability in this case for what 
Im satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
Cashplus shouldnt have given Miss D loans 5 to 18.
A) Cashplus should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss D towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B) Cashplus should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss 
D which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss D originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Cashplus should pay Miss D the total of A plus B.
D) Cashplus should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Miss Ds credit file in 
relation to loans 5 to 7. The overall pattern of Miss Ds borrowing for loans 8 to 18 means 
any information recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely 
from Miss Ds credit file. If Cashplus has sold any of the loans Cashplus should ask the debt 
purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Cashplus to deduct tax from this interest. Cashplus 
should give Miss D a certificate showing how much tax Cashplus has deducted, if she asks 
for one.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Miss Ds complaint.
Advanced Payment Solutions Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 March 2021.
