The complaint
Mr A complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA reversed a payment he received 
following a chargeback on a sale he made.
What happened
Mr A sold an item on a third party site and received £3,640 into his PayPal account. Mr A 
refunded the buyer £250 as he couldnt ship batteries to the buyer, so Mr A says this was the 
amount they agreed for the refund.
The buyer contacted Mr A days after he received the item and said that part of the item was 
broken. Mr A says the amount in dispute was a further £250. The buyer raised a chargeback 
with his card provider for £3,390. PayPal informed Mr A of this and Mr A sent evidence to 
PayPal that the item had been delivered, pictures of the item and messages showing he had 
tried to help the buyer fix the issue. 
The buyers chargeback claim was successful so £3,390 was debited from Mr As PayPal 
account which resulted in him having a negative balance. Mr A complained to PayPal but 
they did not uphold his complaint. Mr A brought his complaint to our service. Mr A feels that 
the buyer should not have been able to raise a chargeback as the sale was over three 
months before the chargeback was made.
Our investigator did not uphold Mr As complaint. She explained that his complaint was 
about PayPal and we couldnt investigate the underlying dispute with the buyer or the third 
party site where he sold the item and we dont have the authority to challenge the 
chargeback provider. Our investigator said that in situations like this, Mr A may have been 
eligible under PayPals Seller Protection policy, but as the dispute was raised as an item 
significantly not as described then the payment was ineligible for this protection. Our 
investigator explained that a chargeback can be raised within 120 days of purchase which is 
what happened here. Mr A asked for an Ombudsman to review his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A has made a number of points to this service and Ive considered and read everything 
hes said and sent us. But, in line with this services role as a quick and informal body Ill be 
focusing on the crux of his complaint in deciding whats fair and reasonable here.
During our investigation into his complaint, Mr A raised a point which wasnt part of his 
original complaint. He said that his PayPal account had been closed recently without 
warning and he was concerned about this. Our investigator explained that he would need to 
raise this separately with PayPal as they hadnt had a chance to investigate the new 
complaint about the closure. So Ill just be focusing on the original complaint he referred to 
us here.
Mr A will have needed to agree to the PayPal User Agreement when he became a PayPal 
User. So Ive considered what the PayPal User Agreement says regarding chargebacks: If 
the payer used a card to fund the payment to you the payer could pursue a chargeback 
with the card issuer. The card issuer, not us, determines whether the payer is successful 
when they pursue a chargeback. You can find out more about chargebacks by reviewing our 
Chargeback Guide, accessible via the PayPal Security Centre and the section called: 
Selling Safely. The PayPal Security Centre is accessed via the PayPal website. We charge 
you a fee for receiving a chargeback claim.
So Im satisfied that the agreement is clear that its the card issuer of the payer (the buyer in 
this case) who determines whether the payer is successful or not. Unfortunately for Mr A, the 
buyers card issuer determined the outcome in the favour of the buyer when they upheld the 
chargeback and £3,390 was removed from Mr As PayPal account. As our investigator 
explained to Mr A, the chargeback was brought within the required timeframes. I dont think 
its fair to hold PayPal responsible for the chargeback being successful and Ill explain why. 
PayPal kept Mr A up to date at each step of the claim. They also allowed him to provide 
evidence to defend the chargeback claim, but PayPal did not determine the outcome of the 
chargeback  it was the card issuer.
Next Ive looked at what else the User Agreement says in regards to how PayPal might be 
able to assist Mr A. The PayPal User Agreement says: PayPal Seller Protection may also 
apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer. So as 
the transaction was reversed because of a successful chargeback Ive looked to see if Mr A 
would be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection. But unfortunately he isnt. The Seller 
Protection states the following is not eligible for Seller Protection: item where the buyer 
claims (either with us or their card issuer) that the item you sent isn't what was ordered 
(referred to as a  Significantly Not as Described claim).
Mr A has brought concerns to us about a debt collection company contacting him as hes 
showing a negative balance in his PayPal account. PayPal have said that they have 
temporarily ceased collection efforts but he does owe this money to PayPal. Ive looked at 
the PayPal User Agreement regarding insufficient funds and it states: if there are insufficient 
funds in your balance to cover your liability, we reserve the right to collect the amount you 
owe us by deducting the amount (or any part of it) from any payments received in or money 
you add to your PayPal account. Otherwise you agree to reimburse us through other means. 
We may also recover amounts you owe us through legal means, including, without limitation, 
through the use of a debt collection agency. So I am persuaded that PayPal are entitled to 
use a debt collection agency to recoup the funds which Mr A owes them. 
So Im persuaded that PayPal have acted fairly and in line with their PayPal User Agreement 
which Mr A would have agreed to these conditions when becoming a PayPal User. I t follows 
that I wont be asking PayPal to do anything further.
My final decision
I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 August 2021.
