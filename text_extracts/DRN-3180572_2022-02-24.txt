The complaint
Mr B complains about online security measures National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
introduced to instruct online payments. 
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. In summary, I said: 
- NatWest introduced a new step for customers when making online payments. This 
included asking questions about online payments and providing Effective Warnings 
about fraud and scams.
- After attempting to make an online payment to an existing payee, Mr B complained 
about the change in process and questions NatWest had introduced. NatWests 
responses to Mr Bs complaint focused on the Confirmation of Payee process.
- Mr B said NatWests terms meant it shouldve given prior notification of its intention to 
change its process for making online payments and that the questions asked were 
intrusive.
- An investigator looked at the complaint but didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly by 
introducing further steps and questions when making online payments. The 
investigator also said complaint handling wasnt something this service could 
consider. 
- Mr B asked to appeal and his case was passed to me. I issued a decision that said 
the Financial Ombudsman Service cant consider cases about complaint handling. 
- I issued a follow up decision but didnt uphold Mr Bs complaint. I said the 
introduction of the Effective Warnings by NatWest was in line with the Contingent 
Reimbursement Model code. 
- The introduction of Effective Warnings and additional questions required to make 
online payments was reasonable. I also said NatWest was free to decide how its 
systems work, including what questions to ask when making an online payment. 
- I didnt find that the additional steps NatWest introduced were unreasonably 
inconvenient or unfair. I didnt find NatWest had treated Mr B unfairly and didnt tell it 
to do anything else. 
In summary, Mr B asked to appeal and said:
- He wasnt complaining about security measures NatWest had brought in.
- The provisional decision had incorrectly focused on the Effective Warnings but the 
complaint related to questions when making payments to existing payees which was 
a separate matter.
- The introduction of additional questions caused concern about scams and fraud. 
- The account terms and conditions required NatWest to provide prior notification when 
making changes of this nature.
- NatWest failed to correctly respond to the complaint.
- He wasnt persuaded that NatWest had introduced questions when approving an 
online payment for security purposes.
- Mr B has more recently told us NatWest has removed the questions it previously 
introduced which shows it acted in error. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to thank Mr B for the level of detail hes included in his submissions and patience 
whilst the complaint has been with us. I understand Mr B feels his complaint hasnt been 
correctly understood. Mr B has told us it doesnt relate to the Effective Warnings NatWest 
introduced but questions asked when making online payments to existing payees. 
I want to assure Mr B that I did consider the questions NatWest introduced when reaching 
my provisional decision, as well as its introduction of the Effective Warnings process. 
NatWest has confirmed changes in the processes it follows when approving online payments 
(for both new and existing payees) were made to improve security for its customers and in 
line with industry codes. In my view, the changes reflect NatWests aim to provide better 
security for customers. And Mr Bs complaint relates to the measures that were introduced 
by NatWest.
Mr B has explained he feels NatWest has cited security as an excuse for introducing 
questions, but I dont think thats the case. Whilst I note Mr B feels the questions form part of 
a marketing or data gathering exercise I havent seen evidence to support that. 
Mr B has told us he feels, under the account terms and conditions, NatWest shouldve 
provided prior notice of its intention to change the online payment approval process and 
introduce questions. But I dont think it would be practical for a business to provide prior 
warning whenever it changes a process or introduces new checks. Whilst I note what Mr B 
has told us, the terms and conditions dont say NatWest has to provide prior notice for 
changes of this nature. As a result, I havent been persuaded it acted unfairly by failing to 
notify Mr B in advance.  
I think its reasonable to say, the process of making payments online and via other methods 
is likely to change over time to reflect a business commercial discretion, systems changes 
and the rules it operates under. Mr B has told us the questions hes raised are no longer 
asked. But Im not persuaded that means they were introduced unfairly or in error. I think the 
different approaches reflect ongoing updates and changes to the way NatWest operates and 
processes payments. Whilst the questions may have been withdrawn, Im not persuaded 
that means NatWest acted unfairly when it introduced them. 
Mr B has told us the additional questions caused concerns about scams and fraud. I can see how strongly Mr B feels in this matter and I dont seek to dimmish any distress caused. But I 
have to take into account the changes to making online payments were genuine and brought 
in by NatWest. I dont doubt how concerned Mr B has been at changes NatWest made, but I 
havent found it acted unfairly. 
There were mistakes from NatWest when it considered Mr Bs queries and complaint. As I 
said in a previous decision, complaint handling in itself isnt something this service can 
consider. And whilst I agree there were mistakes and incorrect information provided by 
NatWest, we cant fine or punish a business for making an error. In order to make an award, 
Id need to be persuaded Mr B had experienced an unreasonable level of distress and 
inconvenience due to the actions of NatWest. Im sorry to disappoint Mr B but, even 
accepting the error, I havent found grounds to make an award for the distress and 
inconvenience caused. 
In much the same way, in order to direct NatWest to take further action, Id have to be 
satisfied it had made a mistake or caused a financial loss. Im sorry to disappoint Mr B but I 
havent found that to be the case. Having considered everything provided to us by both 
parties I havent been persuaded to uphold this complaint.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 March 2022.
