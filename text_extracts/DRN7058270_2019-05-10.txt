Mr Hs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think that 
247 Moneybox had been wrong to give the loans to Mr H. So he didnt  recommend  that the 
complaint be upheld. Mr H didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint  hasnt  
been resolved  informally,  it has been  passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide. This is the 
last stage of our process.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
247 Moneybox needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr H could repay the loan in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that 247 Moneybox should  fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN70582702the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
At the outset I should note that there  was a gap of just over five months between  Mr H 
repaying loan 2 and asking to borrow again.  Given that the first two loans  he had taken had 
been repaid within a few days of them being  taken  out, and were for very small  amounts,  
I think it would be reasonable for 247 Moneybox to consider that gap in lending as an 
indication that Mr H wasnt  reliant on its loans.
The repayments that Mr H agreed  to make  on each loan were  small compared to the income 
he declared to 247 Moneybox. And they appeared to be easily  affordable based on what  he 
said about his disposable income.  From what 247 Moneybox has shown us, its checks didnt 
identify anything adverse on Mr Hs credit file such as defaults or large  amounts of other  
borrowing. So given the amounts Mr H needed  to repay, what was apparent  about  his 
circumstances at the time, and his borrowing history with the lender, I dont think it wouldve 
been proportionate for 247 Moneybox  to ask him for the amount of information that might 
have shown the lending was unsustainable.   
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr H provided or the information  247 Moneybox 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying.  
I appreciate that Mr H says his credit file would have  shown a far worse position than was 
identified by 247 Moneyboxs checks.  But the information a consumer  might  see, when  they 
request a copy of their credit file, might  be very different  to that seen  by a lender. A lender 
might only see a small portion of the credit  file, or some data might be missing or 
anonymised, or the data might  not be up to date.  So, this may explain any differences  
between the information provided  by 247 Moneyboxs credit check to it and the information 
seen by Mr H in his credit report.
I think that the checks 247 Moneybox  did were sufficient here, and they suggested  that Mr H 
could afford  the repayments on the loans.  So I dont  think 247 Moneybox did anything  wrong  
in agreeing to give these  loans to Mr H. It follows that I dont uphold the complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I dont uphold the complaint or make  any award against 
Active Securities Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 June  2019.
