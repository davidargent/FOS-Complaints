The complaint

* Including overlapping loans
Mr S says if Sunny had carried out proper checks it would not have approved the lending. 
He says he fell behind with his rent and other priority bills and the stress of not being able to 
support his family severely affected his mental health.
Sunny says it asked Mr S about his income and expenditure and checked his credit file. It 
says it found all the loans to be affordable and considered it had carried out proportionate 
checks. It adds that, although Mr S was charged interest for over 24 months, his average 
loan was less than £150, he paid less than 50% in interest and he never fell into arrears.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld. He found that proportionate 
checks would have shown Mr S was struggling to manage his money by loan 5, and that, by loan 15, his pattern of borrowing suggested hed become reliant on the lending. Our 
adjudicator recommended that interest and charges (plus 8% statutory interest) should be 
refunded on loans 5 to 74. He added that adverse information about loans 5 to 14 should be 
removed from Mr Ss credit file and that loans 15 to 74 should be removed entirely.
Sunny responded to say, in summary, that the checks it carried out showed the repayments 
were affordable and it took account of existing monthly repayments.  However, Sunny added 
that Mr Ss borrowing indicated he may not have been using the product for short-term 
needs, so offered to uphold his complaint from loan 25.
Mr S did not accept the offer.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to 
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
Loans 1 to 4
Im satisfied that Sunny carried out proportionate checks for these loans and there was 
nothing in the available information to indicate the repayments were unaffordable to Mr S.
Loan 5
This was Mr S's fifth loan application in six weeks. As he already had two Sunny loans and 
his scheduled repayment was the highest so far, I consider Sunny should have done better 
checks before approving this loan. Had it done so, its likely to have found Mr S already had 
two other short-term loans with another lender and was in a debt management plan.
So, I consider Mr S was showing clear signs that he was struggling financially and Sunny 
should not have approved further lending from loan 5 onwards.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
15. I say this because:
Mr S had been borrowing from Sunny for seven months and this was his largest loan 
application so far;
As Mr S had two other Sunny loans outstanding, his scheduled repayment was 
increasing again;
The gaps between one loan being repaid and a further loan being taken out were 
decreasing  loan 15 was taken out just two days after loan 14 had been repaid;
From loan 15 onwards Mr S was provided with a new loan within days/weeks of 
settling a previous one. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not 
Mr S was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was 
leaving in his finances and that Mr Ss indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
In 2017, Mr Ss credit file shows hed defaulted on three accounts between February 
and August of that year;
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  74 was 
taken out over three-and-a-half years after Mr Ss first. And it was for the same 
amount. Mr S had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny 
over an extended period.
 
I think Mr S lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 15 onwards:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time;
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ss 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for high-cost loans.
 
So Im upholding the complaint about loans 15 to 74, as well as loans 5 to 14, and Sunny 
should put things right.
My final decisionMy decision is that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr S paid on loans 5 to 74;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative information about loans 5 to 14 from Mr Ss credit file;
The number of loans taken from loan 15 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 15 to 74 should be removed from 
Mr S's credit file.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2020.
