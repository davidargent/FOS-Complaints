Our adjudicator thought the loans from loan 10 onwards shouldnt have been given because 
the overall pattern of Mr Es borrowing indicated he was reliant on these loans and the 
borrowing was becoming unsustainable. 
Sunny disagreed and said Mr Es behaviour didnt indicate he was struggling financially, and 
his disposable income was enough to repay the loans. It also said Mr E paid very little in 
interest. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr E could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr E could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Es complaint. Having done so, I am partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Es complaint about loans 1 to 9. Mr E hasnt provided any 
further evidence or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because they no longer appear to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr E, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Es case, like the adjudicator, I think that this point was 
reached by loan 10. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr E was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr E had taken out ten loans in less than two months. So, it should have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr E was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Es 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ive noted what Sunny has said about the amount of interest Mr E paid. But this was 
due to Mr E repaying his loans early. The fact he repaid his loans much earlier than 
planned should have caused some concern to Sunny. As that might be the sort of 
behaviour that would indicate someone was facing problems managing their money 
and needing to refinance loans on a regular basis.
Mr Es first loan was for £100 and his tenth one was for £250. By now Sunny ought to 
have realised that it was unlikely that Mr E was borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 10 onwards Mr E was provided with new loans within weeks  sometimes 
days  of taking out a previous one. 
 
I think that Mr E lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan  10 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Es indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Mr E borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Es ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding Mr Es complaint about loan 10 onwards. 
Putting things right  what Elevate Credit International Limited needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr E paid on loans 10 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;the number of loans taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 10 to 14 should be removed from
Mr Es credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit International Limited to take off tax from 
this interest. Elevate Credit International Limited must give Mr E a certificate showing how 
much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Es complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 July 2020.
