The complaint
Mr M complains that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
What happened
Mr M was given a loan by 118 118 Money in November 2015. He borrowed £1100 and 
agreed to repay this over 24 months.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in May 2022. Both parties have received a 
copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from the decision 
below. I said;
118 118 Money gathered some information from Mr M before it agreed to lend. It asked Mr 
M about his income and expenditure. It says it verified his income using an online tool. It 
carried out a credit check. Those checks suggested Mr M had enough disposable income 
each month to afford the loan repayments. 
Mr M was entering into a fairly significant commitment with 118 118 Money. He was 
agreeing to make monthly repayments for a period of 2 years. So, I think it is right that 118 
118 Money wanted to gather, and independently check, some detailed information about Mr 
Ms financial circumstances before it agreed to lend to him. I think that the checks it did were 
sufficient to achieve that aim. I think 118 118 Moneys checks were proportionate. 
But simply performing proportionate checks isnt always enough. A lender also needs to
react appropriately to the information those checks show. Those results might sometimes 
lead a lender to undertake further enquiries into a consumers financial situation. Or, in some 
cases, the results might lead a lender to decline a loan application outright. So, Ive looked at 
what 118 118 Money gathered to see whether it needed to ask for more or whether it made 
a fair lending decision. 
I have looked at the credit search that 118 118 Money conducted. The search showed that 
Mr M had only 3 active accounts listed. He held a credit card with a small limit, along with a 
telecoms account and also a defaulted account. I currently think 118 118 Money are right 
when they say the defaulted account is historical and also the same debt that also then 
incurred Mr M a county court judgement. Mr M had owed this amount for a while and still had 
an amount to repay. But on its own I dont think it is enough to give 118 118 Money concerns 
that he was having problems managing his finances.  So, I dont think 118 118 Money would 
necessarily have been prompted to do more or react to what its search showed it.
Mr M told 118 118 Money he was renting and told 118 118 Money that his expenditure was 
£1155. This doesnt seem like an unrealistic amount for Mr M to declare. I think when I 
consider how much Mr Ms verified monthly income was, and what he declared to 118 118 
Money he had in essential spend, I think the credit he had taken out was affordable for him.
I appreciate that Mr Ms financial situation could have been worse than my assessment 
above might suggest. But I think that the checks 118 118 Money performed were 
proportionate and didnt suggest that Mr M was facing any current problems in managing his 
finances. I think 118 118 Money was entitled to rely on what Mr M said about his finances, 
and his circumstances at the time. And that information suggested that he would be able to 
sustainably afford the repayments on the loan. So, I dont currently think 118 118 Money was 
wrong to give the loan to Mr M.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response to my 
provisional decision. 118 118 Money said it accepted the findings. Mr M did not respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
118 118 Money has not made any new points for me to respond to and Mr M has not 
responded. So, as neither party has anything further to add that I feel I need to comment 
on or that will change the outcome of this complaint, I dont see any reason to depart from 
my findings within my provisional decision. With that being the case, I do not uphold Mr Ms 
complaint.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2022.
