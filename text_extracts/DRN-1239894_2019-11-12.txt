 The complaint
 Mrs F complains that PrePay Technologies Limited blocked and closed her account. 
 What happened
 Mrs F had a business account with PrePay.
 On 16 July 2019, Mrs F received two payments into her account, one for £5,000 and 
another for £10,000. Both payments were transferred from an account Mrs F held with 
another bank which I will refer to as bank B. Mrs F says she intended to use the money to 
help run her business. 
Following receipt of the payments, Prepay decided to review Mrs Fs account. Whilst it 
completed its review it blocked Mrs Fs account. This meant Mrs F couldnt access any 
money in the account. 
On 17 July 2019, PrepPay sent Mrs F an email to let her know it had decided to close her 
account immediately. It asked Mrs F to provide it with an account number so that it could 
transfer her remaining balance. And said that this process could take up to 30 days to 
complete. But Prepay didnt release the money in her account until October 2019.
Mrs F says PrePay took too long to release the money in her account. As a result, she says 
she couldnt pay bills including the cost of renting a storage unit. And she suffered a great 
deal of stress and anxiety. She wants PrePay to pay her compensation.
An investigator looked into Mrs Fs complaint. She said PrePay acted in line with its legal 
and regulatory obligations when it blocked Mrs Fs account. And it hadnt done anything 
wrong when it closed Mrs Fs account. So, she didnt uphold the complaint. Mrs F disagreed. 
She said PrePay blocked her account longer than was necessary. And PrePay told her it 
would release her money sooner than it did. As no agreement could be reached the matter 
has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate that Mrs F was caused distress and inconvenience by what happened. But 
the issue here is whether PrePay acted fairly in placing a block on Mrs Fs account and 
whether the length of time it took to undertake its internal review was reasonable.
Ill start by setting out some context for the review of Mrs Fs account. Anti-money laundering 
regulations and UK legislation place extensive obligations on regulated financial businesses 
to have suitable systems in place for customer identification. Financial institutions must 
establish the purpose and intended nature of a business as well as the origin of funds, and 
there may be penalties if they dont. This applies to both new and existing relationships.In order to meet these requirements, PrePay is entitled to review an account and ask a 
customer for more information about how they use their account. And its not for this service 
to interfere with the banks processes. Our role is to see if the bank has made any mistakes 
and then put the customer back in the position theyd have been in if the mistake hadnt 
happened.
The terms and conditions that apply to Mrs Fs account outline the circumstances in which 
PrePay can block an account. Having considered those terms carefully Im satisfied PrePay 
acted in line with them when it blocked Mrs Fs account on 17 July 2019. 
Having looked at the evidence, I can understand Prepays concerns about the payments 
which had been made into Mrs Fs account. I say this because from looking at Mrs Fs 
account statements, the payments were of a higher amount than the usual account activity. 
Having said that any account review should be completed in a timely manner. So, Ive 
looked at how long things took and what enquires PrePay were making. 
As part of its review PrePay made enquires with bank B about the payments. From looking 
at the information provided by PrePay I can see that bank B had trouble getting all the 
information it needed to give to PrePay, which meant things took longer than normal. But it 
wouldnt be fair to hold Prepay responsible for bank Bs timeliness.
I can see that PrePay did respond to Mrs F requests for updates. And it chased bank B for 
the information it had requested. So, I think it did its best to complete its enquiries with bank 
B as quickly as possible. And move things forward. PrePay completed its review on 16 
October 2019. And released Mrs Fs balance to her the next day. So overall, Im satisfied 
that the review was completed in a timely manner.
I understand that Mrs F wants PrePay to explain the reason it applied the blocks to her 
account. But PrePay doesnt disclose to its customers what triggers a review of their 
accounts. And its under no obligation to tell Mrs F the reasons behind the account review 
and block, as much as shed like to know. So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not 
giving Mrs F this information. 
Overall, having looked at all the evidence and circumstances of this complaint, Im satisfied 
that PrePay acted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the accounts. And was 
acting in line with its legal and regulatory obligations when it blocked and reviewed Mrs Fs 
account. So, I cant say PrePay has done anything wrong. And Im not going to ask PrePay 
to compensate Mrs F for any distress, inconvenience or financial loss this may have caused 
her.
account closure
A bank is entitled to close an account with a customer just as a customer may close an 
account with a bank. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which 
complies with the terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account  which both PrePay and Mrs F had to comply with 
 say that it could close the account by giving her 60 days notice. And sooner in certain 
circumstances. PrePay has done this. So, its entitled to close the account as it seems its 
already done.
In summary, I recognise how strongly Mrs F feels about whats happened, and I dont doubt 
it was a frustrating time. But overall, based on the evidence I have, I cant fairly say PrePay 
have acted unreasonably. So, I wont be asking them to do anything.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 December 2019.
