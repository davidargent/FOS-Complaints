Mr B said that Sunny shouldve realised that he couldnt afford the loans and having to 
borrow in order to repay loans trapped him in a spiral of debt. 
When Mr B first complained to Sunny, it partly upheld his complaint and made an offer to 
write off the outstanding balance and amend his credit file accordingly. Mr B didnt feel this went far enough and when our adjudicator investigated he agreed. 
Our adjudicator came to the overall view that whilst loans 1-9 hadnt been unfair, the pattern 
of lending itself showed that from loan 10 onwards the borrowing was unsustainable  so 
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr B loan 10 or any of the loans that followed. Our adjudicator 
set out the steps he felt Sunny should take to put things right for Mr B.
Sunny didnt agree with everything in our adjudicators view letter  but it offered to uphold 
the complaint from loan 25 onwards. Sunny sent details showing how it would work out the 
refund it was willing to pay to settle Mr Bs complaint. 
We passed this information on to Mr B  but hes told us he doesnt want to settle the 
complaint on this basis and hed like a final decision.  
What I've decided - and why 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr B could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet 
repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
As far as I can see, Mr B hasnt objected to what our adjudicator said with respect to not 
upholding his complaint about loans 1 -9. So I dont think I need to say more about loans 1 -
9 except to say that I agree with our adjudicator about these loans.  
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr B, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think by loan 10 Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was likely to be unsustainable and it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. I say this because at this point Sunny ought to have 
realised:
Mr B was not managing to repay his loans sustainably. Since July 2016 he had taken 
out 10 loans in around 9 months or so 
 
whilst he repaid loans earlier than the agreed term, successfully repaying his loans 
doesnt mean Mr B managed to do so in a sustainable way. And borrowing and 
repaying this number of loans early suggests to me that Mr Bs finances were not in a 
stable position
 
the loan amounts varied but despite most loans being for just £50, loan 10 was a big 
jump up in terms of the amounts hed recently been borrowing  and almost as much 
as the first loan Mr B had taken with Sunny 
 
so it wasnt reasonable of Sunny to think his situation had improved and he was now 
asking to borrow because of a new need for a short term loan rather than an ongoing 
problem
 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr B was borrowing further 
to cover the hole repaying previous loans was leaving in his finances and that Mr Bs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
 
I think that Mr B lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.  
the number of loans which Mr B borrowed was likely to have negative implications on 
Mr Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans. By that point Mr B had already borrowed ten loans in a row. And any 
further borrowing was likely to be detrimental to his credit rating.
 
In coming to my decision Ive taken into account that there was a gap in lending of around 
5 months after Mr B paid loan 10 in June 2017 before he took out loan 11 in 
November 2017. But I dont think this gap in lending was long enough to make any overall 
difference to the outcome of this complaint. For the reasons Ive explained, I think Sunny 
shouldve seen that Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably by the time he took 
out loan 10  and it shouldve realised then that it was unfair to continue lending to him. 
So Im upholding the complaint about loans 10 through to 44 and Sunny should put things 
right. 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
If Sunny has sold any outstanding debts it should buy these back before doing what I have 
set out below. If Sunny isnt able to buy back any debts it sold then Sunny should liaise with 
the new debt owner to achieve the following:
 
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr B towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything it 
has already refunded.
 
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr B which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr B originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
 
C. Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding 
loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr B as though they had been repayments 
of the principal. If this results in Mr B having made overpayments then these should 
be refunded with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Sunny 
should then refund the amounts calculated in "A" and "B" and move to step "E".
 
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in "A" and "B" 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Mr B. However if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan 
with Mr B.
 
E. The number of loans taken from the point of loan 10 means any information recorded 
about these is adverse. So all entries about loans 10 - 44 should be removed from 
Mr Bs credit file.
 *HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Bs complaint about loans 10 - 44. Elevate 
Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) should pay Mr B as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2020.
