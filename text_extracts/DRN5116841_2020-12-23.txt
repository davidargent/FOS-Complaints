Miss S has complained  that Madison CF UK Limited  trading as 118 118 Money lent to her 
irresponsibly.
background
Miss S was given a loan of £2,000 by 118 118 Money in July 2015. The loan was due to be 
repaid in 12 monthly instalments of around  £232.  If the loan ran to term, the total amount 
repayable including interest  was just over £2,788. I understand  the loan has been repaid.
When Miss S initially complained to 118 118 Money,  the lender also considered  2 other 
loans that it had provided to Miss S in July 2016 and February 2018 respectively. 118 118 
Money decided  to uphold Miss Ss complaint about these loans. It calculated a refund of the 
interest shed paid for both loans which it then offset  to reduce the outstanding balance that 
remained on Miss Ss third loan. 118 118 Money  also said it would remove  these loans  from 
Miss Ss credit file. 
But 118 118 Money didnt agree with Miss Ss complaint  about  the loan it had provided in 
July 2015,  so Miss S brought her complaint to this Service. 
One of our adjudicators has looked into the complaint. As 118 118 Money had already 
upheld Miss Ss complaint about the loans she took in July 2016  and February  2018,  the 
adjudicator didnt consider these loans any further.  
But he thought  118 118 Money shouldnt have provided Miss S with the loan she took in July 
2015. Miss S didnt  disagree with the adjudicators assessment, but Ive not seen a reply  
from 118 118 Money to the assessment or to any subsequent correspondence about this 
complaint. So the matter  has been  passed to me to resolve.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to considering unaffordable and irresponsible  lending complaints  
on our website - including the key relevant rules, guidance, good  industry  practice and law. 
And Ive considered this approach when deciding Miss Ss complaint.
As 118 118 Money has already upheld  Miss Ss complaint about the loans she took in 2016  
and 2018 and offered to put things right in line with this Services approach,  I do not need  to 
consider these loans  any further. So I have only considered the loan that 118 118 Money 
provided to Miss S in July 2015.
118 118 Money needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend to Miss S 
irresponsibly. 118 118 Money was required to carry out a borrower focussed assessment or 
affordability check. The checks had to be borrower focussed  so 118 118 Money  had to 
think about whether  repaying the loan sustainably would cause difficulties or adverse 
consequences for Miss S. 
Ref: DRN51168412118 118 Money had to carry  out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy  itself that 
Miss S would be able repay her loan sustainably. There was no set list of checks  that 118 
118 Money had to do, but it could  take into account  a number of different things such  as the 
loan amount, the length of the loan term, the repayment amounts, and the borrowers  overall 
financial circumstances.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have  
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); and
the longer  the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit  is 
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make  payments for an extended  
period); 
118 118 Money was required to establish  whether Miss S could sustainably repay her loan  
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable  on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation. The loan payments being affordable  on this basis might  be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't  automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all the evidence, arguments  and information Ive seen about this 
matter and what it means for Miss S.
118 118 Money says Miss S applied for her loan via its website and that she was asked for 
information about her income and expenditure. 118 118 Money also acquired  a credit report 
and held a telephone welcome call with Miss S, after which the loan was confirmed.
But I think the information that 118 118 Money  had gathered in its checks  should have been 
of some concern  for the lender. The credit  report showed that Miss S had a total debt 
balance of over £26,000  which included over £14,000 in loans or instalment credit  and over 
£8,000 on credit cards. The Report  also showed that Miss S had opened  18 accounts in the 
previous six months;  she held 18 active accounts,  with at least 12 open loans, plus credit 
cards and bank accounts. I think 118 118 Money  also ought to have realised from the 
information it had gathered that Miss S was already paying a considerable proportion of her 
monthly income towards her existing credit  commitments and that she had been taking loan 
after loan in the previous  few months.  
I appreciate that 118 118 Money asked  Miss S if she felt that the loan was affordable. But I 
think 118 118 Money ought  to have been concerned from its checks  about the extent of Miss 
Ss existing  credit commitments  and the impact  this might be having on her monthly 
outgoings which doesnt seem to be clear  from Miss Ss application data. I would have 
expected the lender to want  to obtain a thorough understanding of Miss Ss true financial 
position - to satisfy  itself that she could sustainably  meet her loan repayments  over the 
whole loan term. I think that 118 118 Money  ought reasonably to have realised  that in order 
Ref: DRN51168413for its checks to be reasonable and proportionate,  in these particular circumstances, it 
needed to look further into Miss Ss financial position  for example by asking to see her 
bank statements.
Miss S has provided us with copies of her bank statements for the months leading up to her 
loan application  so I can determine what better checks might have shown 118 118 Money at 
that time.  And I have considered this information  in light of what Ive set out above. 
Of course,  different checks  might show different things. But I think  if 118 118 Money had 
carried out what I consider to be proportionate checks, I think  its likely it would have 
discovered more about Miss Ss financial position. In particular  I think  it more likely than not 
that 118 118 Money would have realised that Miss S was spending a considerable amount in 
regular betting  transactions  and was struggling to manage her finances. As Ive already 
explained, 118 118 Money  was required to establish  whether Miss S could sustainably  make 
her loan repayments. Overall, I think if 118 118 Money had carried  out what I consider  to be 
proportionate checks it ought reasonably to have realised that Miss S was having significant 
problems managing her finances; that she was potentially borrowing to fund her betting 
transactions and that she would most likely  need to borrow elsewhere to repay  her loan from 
118 118 Money. I would  have  expected  118 118 Money to realise  that it was unlikely  that 
Miss S would be able to sustainably repay  her loan. So it ought reasonably  to have 
concluded that it was not appropriate  to lend to her.
Ive not seen anything which makes me think that 118 118 Money treated Miss S unfairly in 
some other way. But I dont think it should  have agreed to provide the loan to her in July 
2015.  So 118 118 Money needs  to put things right.
Putting things  right 
I think its fair and reasonable for Miss S to have repaid the principal amount that she 
borrowed, because  she had the benefit of that lending.  But she has paid interest and 
charges on a loan that shouldnt have been provided  to her. So 118 118 Money  should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges  from the loan and treat all the payments 
Miss S made as payments towards the capital. 
If reworking Miss Ss loan account results in her having effectively made 
payments above the original capital borrowed, then 118 118 Money  should  
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated  on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date 
the complaint  is settled*. 
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Ss credit  file in relation  to the 
loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money  to deduct tax from this interest.  118 118 
Money should give Miss S a certificate  showing how much tax its deducted, if she asks for 
one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Ss complaint and direct  Madison CF UK Limited 
trading as 118 118 Money to put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN51168414Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 23 January 2021.
