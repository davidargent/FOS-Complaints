The complaint
Mrs J complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly closed her accounts. She says 
this caused her financial loss, trouble and upset. So, she wants NatWest to pay her 
compensation.
What happened
Mrs J had a current account and two savings accounts with NatWest. Mrs J was a customer 
of NatWest for around forty years and used her current account to pay her bills and receive 
her pension payments.
In February 2022, NatWest wrote to Miss J asking her to get in touch with them by 4 March 
2022 and give them some information about a transaction on her account. NatWest sent 
Mrs J another letter on 25 February chasing the information it had requested and said that if 
Mrs J didnt provide them with the information it needed, it would close her accounts. 
Unfortunately, at the time Mrs J was away on holiday so didnt read the letters. Mrs J retuned 
from holiday on 24 March 2022, Sadly, when she came home, she became unwell, with 
some back and eye problems. So, she wasnt able to go through her post. And remained 
unaware of NatWests letters.
On 28 April 2022, NatWest decided to close Mrs Js accounts. It wrote to her giving her 60 
days notice that she needed to make alternative banking arrangements. Because of Mrs Js 
health conditions, although the letter was delivered to her address, she wasnt aware of its 
contents due to the problems she was having with her eyesight. Mrs J says she found out 
that her accounts had been closed when she tried to access her accounts via her online 
banking on her mobile phone.
Mrs J went into a branch and asked NatWest for an explanation, but the bank wouldnt give 
her much information. Mrs J says given the seriousness of NatWests actions the bank 
should have made more of an effort to get in touch with her, for example by sending her an 
email. So, she asked NatWest to review their decision to close her accounts. NatWest 
agreed, but whilst it did so it blocked Mrs Js accounts. This meant Mrs J had to travel to 
branch to access cash, some of her direct debits went unpaid, and she incurred late 
payment charges on her credit card.  
NatWest completed its review on 31 August 2022, but said it wasnt willing to reopen Mrs Js 
accounts. It sent Mrs J a cheque for her closing balances. Mrs J complained to NatWest. 
She said she had to go to the trouble of rearranging more than a dozen direct debits and 
standing orders. She also wasnt able to access her pension easily, as normally she did all 
her banking via her mobile phone. But due to the block she had to travel to a branch to 
complete any banking she wanted to do, which was inconvenient. She also said that she had 
been charged late payment fees and unpaid direct debit charges due to the block on her 
accounts. She also pointed out that NatWest hadnt paid the interest that she earned on her 
accounts when it closed her accounts. 
In response to Mrs Js complaint, NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong and had 
closed Mrs Js accounts in line with the terms and conditions of the accounts. 
Unhappy with this response, Mrs J brought her complaint to our service where an 
investigator considered it. The investigator asked NatWest to provide more information about 
why it had closed and then blocked Mrs Js accounts. NatWest gave us some information 
but said it couldnt provide anything more than it had already provided to us about why it had 
closed and then blocked Mrs Js accounts. 
The investigator also asked Mrs J for more information about her circumstances at the time  
and the impact the banks actions had on her. Mrs J provided her credit card and bank 
statements which showed shed incurred late payment charges on her credit card account 
due to the block and unpaid direct debits charges. Mrs J also explained that she believes 
NatWest discriminated against her on the basis of her race when it blocked and closed her 
accounts.
The investigator said that based on the limited information the bank had provided, she 
couldnt say the bank had treated Mrs J fairly when it had closed and blocked her accounts. 
So, she said that NatWest should pay Mrs J £300 compensation for the trouble and upset 
this had caused her. She also said that NatWest should refund the charges Mrs J had to 
pay. NatWest agreed and refunded Mrs J the charges and late payment fees. Mrs J said she 
was happy that shed been refunded but didnt think the amount of compensation offered  
adequately reflected the trouble and upset shed suffered. She wants £3,000.
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Account closure 
Banks are entitled to end their business relationship with a customer, as long as this is done 
fairly, doesnt breach law or regulations and is in keeping with the terms and conditions. In 
this instance the terms of Mrs Js accounts say that in certain instances NatWest can close 
the accounts with immediate notice and by providing 60 days notice. And it doesnt have to 
provide a reason for doing so. NatWest wrote to Mrs J in April 2022, giving her two months 
notice that it was closing her accounts and that shed need to make alternative banking 
arrangements. The timing of this letter was unfortunate, as at the time Mrs J wasnt very well 
so didnt read the letter. So understandably she was shocked to discover that following the 
end of the notice period in June 2022,  she couldnt access her accounts. 
When Miss J discovered she wasnt able to access her accounts she went into a branch to 
find out what was happening. Staff told her that her accounts were closed.  Mrs J appealed 
the banks decision. NatWest agreed to review its decision and deferred closing Miss Js 
accounts. Whilst it did so, however, it blocked Mrs Js accounts. This meant Mrs Js direct 
debits went unpaid and she incurred late payment charges on her credit card account. She 
also didnt have access to the funds in her accounts, so she had to travel to branch to 
access her pension which was stressful and inconvenient. NatWest completed its review and 
didnt change its mind about closing Mrs Js accounts. It closed Mrs Js accounts on 31 
August 2022.
NatWest can only close accounts in certain circumstances and if its in the terms and conditions of the account. NatWest have relied on the terms and conditions when closing 
Mrs Js accounts. The terms explain that the bank can close the account with notice. 
However, NatWest still needs to provide information to this service so we can fairly decide a 
complaint. Despite being asked by the investigator, NatWest has failed to provide 
information about why it no longer wanted Mrs J as a customer and blocked her account 
between June and August 2022. 
Ive considered what NatWest has said about why it wont provide further information to our 
service about the reasons it closed and blocked Mrs Js accounts. This service has the 
power to request evidence of this nature under the dispute resolution rules (DISP) and Im 
not persuaded the reasons given by NatWest exclude it from complying with these rules. So, 
in this particular case, because of the lack of information I cant be satisfied that NatWest 
has treated Mrs J fairly when it closed and blocked her accounts. Taking this into account, I 
agree NatWest should pay Mrs J compensation for the trouble and upset caused by blocking 
and closing her accounts.
Prior to issuing this decision NatWest refunded Mrs J the late payment fees, charges, and 
interest on her accounts, which Mrs J was happy to accept to resolve that aspect of her 
complaint. So, I dont need to need to address this any further.
The investigator also said that NatWest should pay Mrs J compensation £300 compensation 
for the trouble and upset caused by NatWest blocking and closing her accounts. NatWest 
agreed but Mrs J wants £3,000. I should explain that there isnt a set formula that we use to 
calculate awards for particular mistakes or poor service. Its my role to consider what impact 
NatWests actions have had on Mrs J and decide, within guidelines set by our service, 
whether compensation would be appropriate in the circumstances. 
Ive considered what Mrs J has said about how NatWests actions impacted her. Ive no 
doubt this was a worrying and stressful time for Mrs J. She had to go to the trouble of 
rearranging all of her direct debits and pension payments  fortunately at the time she had 
another bank account that she could fall back on. So, she managed to redirect her pension 
payments. But she still had to take the time to rearrange her finances. Mrs J also had to 
travel to a branch to make withdrawals which would  have been inconvenient. So, I am 
satisfied that Mrs J was caused trouble and upset. However, Im satisfied that £300 
compensation recommended by the investigator recognises the impact NatWests actions 
had in the overall circumstances of this complaint. So, I wont be directing NatWest to pay 
any more to resolve this aspect of Mrs Js complaint.    
Finally, Mrs J wants NatWest to provide her with an explanation why it closed her accounts. 
She says she believes that NatWest actions are based on racial discrimination. While I can 
appreciate this is her perspective, it is not the role of the Financial Ombudsman Service to 
decide whether the business has acted unlawfully or not  thats a matter for the courts. Im 
required to consider a number of factors in order to decide Mrs Js complaint in accordance 
with what I think is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint. Part of this 
has meant considering the provisions of the Equality Act 2010 . And after looking at all the 
evidence, Ive not seen anything to suggest that NatWest decided to block and close Mrs Js 
accounts for an improper reason. 
I understand Mrs J wants NatWest to explain the reason it closed her accounts. But NatWest 
doesnt disclose to its customers what triggers a review of their accounts. Its under no 
obligation to tell Mrs J the reasons behind the account review and closure, as much as shed 
like to know. So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not giving Mrs J this information. 
And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it to do so.In summary, Im not satisfied that NatWest treated Mrs J fairly when it closed and blocked 
her accounts. So, I uphold this complaint and direct NatWest to put things right by paying 
Mrs J £300 compensation for the trouble and upset this matter caused her. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Bank 
Plc to put things right by doing the following: 
Pay Mrs J £300 compensation for the trouble and upset caused by the bank unfairly 
blocking and closing her accounts
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 November 2023.
