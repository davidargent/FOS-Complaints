The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has not found dividend 
payments paid to him.
What happened
Mr A says he hasnt received a number of dividend payments paid to his NatWest account 
between 2019 and 2021. He says the business responsible for paying them which I will call 
E says it paid them to NatWest and has provided the account number. Mr A says he would 
like his money returned and compensation for the significant distress and inconvenience he 
has been caused.
NatWest says Mr As accounts were closed some years ago. It says the account number has 
now been reused and the dividends were correctly paid into the account it was given details 
of. It also says it has offered £200 as a goodwill gesture which remains open to Mr A to 
accept. NatWest doesnt accept making a mistake.
Mr A had brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator thought it likely the account number had been re-used and the dividends paid 
into the account for which the account details were provided by E.
Mr A doesnt accept that view and in summary questions where his money is.
I asked both sides for further information and asked NatWest to confirm why money could be 
paid into a recycled account number with a different name and what it intended to do about 
retrieving it.
I also asked Mr A if he has asked E to request a return of the money as it and not Mr A 
would need to make that request as it made the payments.
NatWest says no account name was provided by E and says it will need to ask it to request 
a return of the money.
Mr A says he has no intention of asking E to make that request and says NatWest is 
responsible for the impact on him.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NatWest is not responsible for what 
took place. I appreciate that Mr A will be disappointed by my decision and I appreciate that 
someone else has his money.
I make clear to Mr A that I can only look at the actions of NatWest in this complaint and not 
those of E or the person that received the dividend payments.
Im satisfied that Mr As NatWest accounts were closed some years ago and that NatWest 
has recycled the account number. I make clear to Mr A that we are not NatWests regulator 
and so its not my role to comment on the merits of recycling account numbers especially 
from the same branch where the sort code is the same. I also cant fairly direct that if 
NatWest re-uses account numbers that it at least doesnt do so from the same branch to 
avoid problems such as this. I accept that Mr A will no doubt be frustrated by NatWests 
process on this issue.
I accept there will be a number of unanswered questions here, but I think E has used Mr As 
old NatWest account information. And that NatWest has paid the money into the account it 
was given details of by E. In those circumstances I cant fairly hold NatWest responsible for 
what took place and can see that no account name was provided by E which could have 
altered NatWest to the mistake.
Im also satisfied that it will be for E to ask NatWest to try and retrieve the money paid into 
someone elses account. I say that as E made the payment to NatWest and not Mr A. I 
appreciate Mr A says he will not ask E to do so and that of course is his choice but without 
that request I think it will be difficult for NatWest to try and retrieve his money.
Overall, Im satisfied NatWest has followed Es instructions using the details it gave it. If Mr A 
feels that there has been a fraud committed by the recipient of the money, then he would 
need to ask the Police to investigate. If Mr A would like NatWest to try and retrieve the 
money, then he needs to ask E to start that process on his behalf. NatWest has made a 
goodwill offer of £200 which of course Mr A is free to accept directly with NatWest if he 
wishes.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 August 2022.
