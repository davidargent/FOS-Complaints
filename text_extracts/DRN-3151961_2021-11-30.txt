DRN-3151961
The complaint
Mr B complains U K Insurance Limited (trading as Direct Line) have charged him a fee for 
cancelling his Car Insurance Policy
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr B says he didnt request for the policy to be cancelled  but no longer had need of 
it as his vehicle had been scrapped. So the policy had simply reached its end
I acknowledge Mr Bs thoughts. But the cover was stopped during the term of the 
agreement, by Mr B. So I Im satisfied this is still a cancellation 
The terms and conditions of the policy document says an administration fee would be 
charged if the policy is cancelled by the customer
I can also see Direct Line sent Mr B a renewal notice in October 2021. In the notice it 
says there is an administration fee for cancelling the policy  and the specific amount 
is clearly set out. So, I dont think Direct Line have been unreasonable in applying 
this fee
Mr B said he is aware of circumstances where insurers havent applied similar 
charges previously. That may be so, however Direct Line have chosen to do so in 
this instance. And I dont think it has acted unfairly in doing so. So I dont intend to 
interfere in its decision
So for these reasons, I do not uphold Mr Bs complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 December 2021.
