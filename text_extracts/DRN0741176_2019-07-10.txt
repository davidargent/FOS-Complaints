K820x#14complaint
Mrs G complains that Nationwide  Building Society  sends statement  emails to her at 
inappropriate times of the day.
background
Mrs G receives  her Nationwide statements by email. Nationwide  generally  sends  these 
during the early hours  of the morning. Mrs G needs  to keep her phone  nearby, and says 
shes disturbed by the alerts when Nationwides emails arrive. She considers the society 
should send the emails  to her during usual business hours.
Our investigator didnt  consider the complaint should  be upheld, because  Nationwides policy 
for communication  isnt something that this service  can interfere with.
Mrs G didnt agree with the investigators conclusions, so the complaint  has been passed  to 
me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come  to the same  conclusions as the investigator, and for the same  
reasons. It is beyond the remit of this service to interfere  with the method by which 
Nationwide chooses  to communicate  with its customers.
If Mrs G is unhappy with the time at which Nationwides emails arrive,  she might  want  to 
consider receiving paper copies or moving to a bank or building society  that can better 
accommodate her needs.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 August 2019.
