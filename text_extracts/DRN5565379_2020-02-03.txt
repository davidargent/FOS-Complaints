K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains about difficulty accessing  TSB Bank plcs telephone banking system.
background
Mr B says he has difficulty accessing TSBs phone banking system. He says the system 
doesnt recognise some of the information he has to give, so it takes longer than it should to 
get through to the system.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend the complaint should be upheld.  She was satisfied that 
when TSB became aware  of the difficulties Mr B was experiencing, it did what  it could to try 
to help him access the system. The adjudicator wasnt persuaded that TSB was at fault.
Mr B didnt agree with the adjudicators conclusions, so the complaint has been passed to 
me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr B says TSBs phone banking system  doesnt  recognise some of the information  he has to 
provide at the first attempt. So it takes too long for him to access the system.
From what  Ive seen and been  told, I dont think I can safely  say that there is an ongoing 
problem with TSBs phone banking system. So it wouldnt be fair or reasonable to ask the 
bank to pay compensation  to Mr B for the difficulties  he says hes experienced.
TSB has told Mr B that if he continues to have difficulty he should press  0* and he will be put 
through to an adviser. Like the adjudicator, I think thats a reasonable attempt by TSB to help 
Mr B resolve the issue. 
But Im not persuaded that the bank needs  to do anything else. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 March 2020.
