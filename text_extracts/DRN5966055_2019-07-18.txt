K821x#15complaint
Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, irresponsibly  lent to him. He says 
he became dependent  on short  term lending. 
background
This complaint is about 15 payday  loans  QuickQuid provided to Mr H between  April 2012 
and September  2017. There is table at the end of this decision which  is a summary of Mr Hs 
lending. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint. He thought that QuickQuid was wrong to approve 
loans 5 and 6 and loans  12 to 14. QuickQuid made an offer to pay compensation in respect  
of loans 5 and 6 but it didnt agree with the adjudicator about  loans  12 to 14. 
Mr H didnt accept QuickQuids offer, he thought that he should also be paid compensation 
in respect of loans 12 to 14 as the adjudicator recommended. 
So as no agreement was reached the complaint  was passed to me  an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Hs case. Ive decided to uphold Mr Hs 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Hs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  indicate  that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done  more 
to establish that any lending  was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number or higher  frequency  of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer and business have a lending  relationship  
is long
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN59660552Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Hs complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr H would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Hs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Hs complaint.
did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable way?  If not, would 
those checks  have shown  that Mr H would  have been able to do so?
Mr H didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1-4, loans 7-11 and loan 15. 
Because of this I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. And 
QuickQuid has offered to compensate Mr H in respect of loans 5 and 6. So I also dont think 
these loans are now in dispute.  So I wont be making a decision about whether QuickQuid 
was correct to approve these loans. Im only looking at loans 12 to 14 in this decision.
But loans 1 to 11 and loan 15 were part of the borrowing relationship Mr H had with 
QuickQuid. So they are something  I will take into account when considering the other loans 
he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 12 to 14 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided,  did the overall 
pattern of lending increase  Mr Hs indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful for loans 12 to 14?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending surrounding these loans. Ive looked  to see if 
there was a point  at which QuickQuid should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think 
that this point was reached by loan 12. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr H had been  borrowing before loan 12 had generally increased or had 
been relatively high. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more likely  than not 
Mr H was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was 
leaving in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr H wasnt  really reducing  the amount he owed QuickQuid over these loans. He 
was, in effect, paying large amounts of interest  to service this debt over an extended 
period
I think that Mr H lost out because QuickQuid continued to approve  loans 12 to 14 (until the 
break in lending before loan 15) because:
Ref: DRN59660553these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans Mr H had taken was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans
So Im upholding  Mr Hs complaint about  loans  12 to 14 because the overall  pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and hes lost out as a result.
did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr H in some 
other way.  
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
QuickQuid needs  to pay compensation in respect of the loans 12 to 14 and also pay the offer 
it has made in respect of loans 5 and 6. This is: 
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 5 and 6 and loans 12 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans over these periods means any information  recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans 5 and 6 and loans 12 to 14 should  be removed 
from Mr Hs credit  file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Hs complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 August 2019.
