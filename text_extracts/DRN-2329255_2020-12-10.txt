The complaint
Mrs J complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) contacted her to pay an 
outstanding debt that she says shed already paid off.
What happened
Mrs J received a letter from NatWest around February 2020, letting her know that that a debt 
she owes had been passed to a third-party debt collector. Mrs J complained because she 
believed shed paid off the debt several years ago and says that NatWest provided a poor 
level of service when she got in touch about this letter. NatWest told Mrs J that she owes 
around £8,950.
Mrs J says she arranged a repayment plan in 2010 via a third-party company  who Ill refer 
to as D. Mrs J says that her understanding, based on Ds advice, was that NatWest 
accepted the offer of a repayment plan and that she paid all the agreed instalments on time. 
Mrs J believes she paid off her debt around five years ago. 
NatWest confirmed it received a repayment offer from D but says this was rejected at the 
time. It also says that Mrs J didnt keep up with her repayments so, even if the bank did 
accept the offer, this wouldve amounted to a breach of the agreement anyway. NatWest 
agreed that it had provided a poor level of service to Mrs J and confirmed that she still owed 
the debt. 
Mrs J asked this service to step in. She says this experience has caused her a lot of stress. 
As a resolution, she wants NatWest to clear the debt and pay her compensation.
Our investigator didnt think NatWest acted unfairly when it wrote to Mrs J about the debt. 
The investigator was satisfied that NatWest had sent a letter rejecting the offer D had put 
forward and had seen evidence indicating that the instalments werent paid every month  so 
the agreement, had it been in place, wouldve been breached. The investigator also 
concluded that Mrs J received a poor level of service from NatWest and recommended the 
bank pay her £100 compensation to put things right. 
NatWest agreed to pay £100 compensation for the poor level of service it provided. Mrs J 
questioned how Ds offer couldve been rejected without her knowledge and why she wasnt 
contacted about the debt between 2015 and 2020. Mrs J feels the evidence NatWest 
provided isnt sufficient proof that it sent a letter rejecting Ds offer and that it should provide 
a copy of the actual letter. Mrs J added that she paid all her instalments on time. 
As Mrs J didnt agree, the complaint had been passed to me for a final review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I share the investigators opinion and Ill explain why:
NatWest says it rejected the repayment plan offer it received from D and wrote to 
Mrs J to let her know. Unfortunately, it no longer holds an exact copy of the letter for 
me to see  given the length of time, I dont think its unreasonable that the bank no 
longer has a copy. NatWest instead provided a copy of its internal notes on Mrs Js 
account showing a letter was sent in March 2011. The bank also provided several 
letter templates, as an example of what Mrs J wouldve been sent at the time. In 
addition, the banks internal notes show that it called Mrs J twice in April 2011 and 
advised her that the offer hadnt been accepted. On balance, I think NatWest did 
send a rejection letter to Mrs J at the time and I think it did enough to let her know 
that the offer from D had been rejected. 
Mrs J queries why she hadnt been contacted about the debt since 2015  which is 
when she thinks the debt had been paid off. However, Ive seen copies of letters 
NatWest sent Mrs J between 2016 and 2019  each letter sets out the outstanding 
balance that was owed. Mrs J confirms receipt of these letters but says she received 
advice to ignore them. I cant comment on advice Mrs J was given by a third-party. 
My role is to determine whether NatWest has acted unfairly. In this instance, 
NatWest has regularly written to Mrs J to keep her updated on the balance she owed 
 so I think the bank did enough to make sure Mrs J knew that she still owed it a 
debt. 
The investigators opinion and NatWests own conclusions regarding this complaint is 
that Mrs J received a poor level of service from the bank when she got in touch about 
this issue. I wont explore what happened in too much detail as NatWest already 
accepts that the service it provided couldve been better and agrees that £100 
compensation is fair. Having reviewed the content of the calls, I can see the issues 
Mrs J experienced included having to make several calls in a short space of time, 
being passed around call handlers, periods of being placed on hold and being 
advised to call the third-party debt collector only to find that it held no records of her 
debt.
I share the investigators opinion on this point and agree that £100 is a fair way for 
NatWest to compensate Mrs J for the stress and inconvenience it caused her.
Putting things right
In summary, I think NatWest acted fairly when it wrote to Mrs J about her outstanding debt. I 
also think it did enough to let her know that the offer put forward by D wasnt accepted and 
has since kept Mrs J regularly updated regarding the balance she owes. Ill be asking 
NatWest to pay Mrs J £100 compensation because of the poor service she received from the 
bank over the phone. 
My final decision
Im upholding this complaint in part and instruct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mrs J 
£100 compensation. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 January 2021.
