The complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA didnt help obtain a refund after he 
purchased an item that wasnt genuine. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
PayPal said it would help Mr C with his dispute but that he had to send the item back 
to the merchant. Mr C has explained the item was purchased from another country 
and the costs involved in returning it were too high. Hes also told us that the process 
of returning the item would've taken too long. 
I dont agree that PayPals request to return the item was unreasonable. Ive looked 
online and found various options for sending packages abroad that would have met 
PayPals timescale for the return. Whilst the options came at a cost, the figures Ive 
seen are considerably less than the item Mr C was seeking a refund on. Im satisfied 
there were options available and that PayPals request wasnt unreasonably 
inconvenient. 
Mr C says he repeatedly tried to contact PayPal about his dispute but was unable to 
get through in a reasonable amount of time. Whilst I understand there may have 
been lengthy wait times, Mr C had been given instructions setting out how to begin 
the process of obtaining a refund. If he wanted to discuss different ways of resolving 
the situation his only option was to talk to PayPal. 
Mr C asked to appeal after his claim was closed. PayPal considered his request but 
declined it. Im satisfied PayPal acted reasonably when it declined Mr Cs claim as he 
hasnt returned the item he is seeking a refund on. As Im satisfied PayPal has acted 
reasonably and that it has dealt with Mr Cs complaint fairly, Im not telling it to take 
any further action. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2020.
