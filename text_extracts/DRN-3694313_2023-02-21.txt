The complaint
Miss Y complains that Marks & Spencer Financial Services plc, trading as M&S Bank, wont 
refund to her the money that she paid for a holiday club membership. Her complaint is made 
under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Her partner is also involved in her 
complaint.
What happened
Miss Y and her partner entered into a purchase agreement to buy a holiday club 
membership in October 2013. The purchase price was $16,700 and Miss Y entered into a 
loan agreement with the holiday company for a loan of $13,600 that she was to repay by 36 
monthly payments of $405.83 and she provided details of her M&S Bank credit card for 
those payments to be made. She also made payments of $840 (£538.51) and $3,299 
(£2,114.93) to the holiday company using her M&S Bank credit card. 
She contacted M&S Bank in September 2020 about a claim under section 75 because she 
and her partner were pressurised into signing the contract, they should have had the same 
rights at the time as they would had if the membership had been in Europe, including the 
right to cancel the contract within 14 days, and the holiday company had said it would buy-
back the membership if they chose not to continue with it. Miss Y contacted the holiday 
company about her claim in November 2020 and M&S Bank issued its final response to her 
claim in December 2020. 
It said that there was no evidence to show that the contract had a 14 day cooling off period 
or that Miss Y had attempted to cancel the agreement within that period. It also said that the 
holiday company had a first right to refuse a buy-back but there was no guarantee that it 
would buy-back the membership. It said that it was unable to establish a breach of contract 
by the holiday company or to comply with her request for a refund. Miss Y wasnt satisfied 
with its response so she complained to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Miss Ys complaint should be upheld. She didnt 
think that M&S Banks decision to turn down her claim for breach of contract under section 
75 was unfair or unreasonable. Miss Y has asked for her complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. She said that she was seeking further advice in relation to the contract that she 
signed with the holiday company and she still thought that it had breached the contract  but 
shes provided no further information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Miss Ys complaint about M&S Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company and 
that M&S Banks response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  
but Im not determining the outcome of Miss Ys claim under section 75 as only a 
court would be able to do that;
Miss Y has been advised that she should have had the right to withdraw from the 
contract within a cooling-off period and that no such right was included in the 
purchase agreement;
the contract was made outside of the European Union and it says: This Agreement 
shall be construed under the laws of  and the country in which the contract was 
made was specified;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the purchase agreement was required under the 
laws in that jurisdiction to include a cooling-off period;
nor have I seen any evidence to show that Miss Y and her partner contacted the 
holiday company to try to withdraw from the agreement within a time frame that 
would have been included in any cooling-off period  the first reference that Ive seen 
to her not wanting to continue with her membership wasnt until January 2018 in 
response to a request for payment of her outstanding maintenance fees when she 
wrote: I think at the end of this year I will be selling it;
Miss Y says that the holiday company had said that it would buy-back the 
membership if she and her partner chose not to continue with it  but Ive seen no 
evidence in the agreements to show that the holiday company had agreed that it 
would buy-back the membership;
the declaration that Miss Y and her partner signed says: If we/I decide to sell our 
[membership, the holiday company] has first right to refusal and Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company had agreed to buy-
back their membership;
Miss Y says that she and her partner were pressurised into signing the contract but 
they signed the purchase agreement in October 2013 and Ive seen no evidence to 
show that they raised any concerns about the way that the contract was sold to them 
until they contacted M&S Bank in September 2020;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Miss Y and her partner 
were unduly pressured into entering into the agreements in October 2013 or that the 
holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have raised any concerns 
about being pressurised to enter into the agreement much sooner than they did and I 
consider it to be likely that any such claim would now be time-barred;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company in these circumstances and 
I consider that M&S Banks response to Miss Ys section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable; and
I sympathise with Miss Y for the issues that she and her partner have had with the 
membership but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require M&S 
Bank to refund to Miss Y any of the money that she paid for it, to pay her any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Ys complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss Y to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 March 2023.
