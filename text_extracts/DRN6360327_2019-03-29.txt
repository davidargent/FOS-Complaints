Mr S says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr S had two payday loans with QuickQuid. Ive set out some of the details QuickQuid 
provided about the loans  in the table below.
Loan  
no.Amount Start date End dateOriginal repayment 
schedule
1 £200 23/02/2010 29/03/2010£53.10  on 5 Mar 2010
£253.10 on 19 Mar 2010**
2 £600 15/04/2010 outstanding£135 due on 28 Apr 2010
£750 due on 12 May 2010
**the loan repayment was extended to 29 March
An adjudicator considered  Mr S complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. She didnt 
think QuickQuid had done enough  to check whether  either loan was affordable. 
For loan 1, QuickQuid  had asked Mr S about his net monthly income and recorded  it as 
£1,600. But our adjudicator thought QuickQuid ought to have asked Mr S some questions  
about his expenditure too. However, she didnt think there was enough evidence of Mr S 
expenditure in February 2010  and so couldnt say proportionate checks  wouldve shown loan 
1 wasnt affordable.
Loan 2 had a much larger second repayment   about 47% of Mr S net monthly  income  
and hed incurred  late fees for loan 1. So our adjudicator recommended  the complaint about  
loan 2 be upheld.  QuickQuid agreed  to this recommendation and offered to refund the 
interest and charges Mr S paid on loan 2 and add interest at 8% simple  per year to that 
refund. It would then offset that against  the remaining  balance  of the loan. It also said it 
would remove any reference about  the loan from Mr S credit history, once hed cleared the 
remaining principal balance.
Mr S didnt accept the offer, for a number of reasons (all of which Ive read and will 
summarise here).  He said that he thought he should  also receive money  for distress and 
inconvenience. He didnt think he should have to pay the outstanding  balance of loan 2.
Mr S also said QuickQuid  and a third-party  business harassed him in relation to the 
outstanding balance of loan 2.
As there was no agreement, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
In relation to Mr S complaint about loan 1, I consider it wouldve been  proportionate for 
QuickQuid to ask Mr S some questions about  his expenditure (e.g. rent/mortgage, food, 
travel etc.) as well as his income. The largest  repayment was about  16% of Mr S declared  
income, which I think is high enough  that it wasnt reasonable  for QuickQuid to assume the 
Ref: DRN63603272loan was affordable  without  also having  sufficient information about Mr S regular 
expenditure. But I havent seen any evidence of what  Mr S regular expenditure was at the 
time the loan was approved. And the repayment  wasnt so high that I think its reasonable to 
assume, in the absence  of this information, that loan 1 wasnt affordable  to him. So Im 
unable to find that loan 1 was lent irresponsibly.
As QuickQuid has already  made  an offer for loan 2, I dont need to decide  whether the loan 
was approved responsibly or not. I only need to decide whether QuickQuids offer is fair.
QuickQuids offer is in line with this Services usual approach to putting  things right for this 
type of complaint. But Mr S says QuickQuid should write off the balance  of the loan in 
addition to what it has offered to do. And he says it should also pay him something for 
distress and inconvenience.
Ive not seen anything to persuade me it would be fair for QuickQuid to write off the balance 
of Mr Ss loan, or pay him anything extra for distress and inconvenience.  Ill explain why.
My starting point is that Mr S has had the benefit  of the £600  he borrowed, so its fair that he 
should pay it back. After  all, QuickQuid is refunding the interest and other charges Mr S 
wouldnt have paid if the loan hadnt  been approved. So in effect,  Mr S needs to return the 
principal he wouldnt have  received had the loan not been approved. This comes as close  as 
possible to putting  Mr S in the financial position he wouldve  been  in had QuickQuid not lent 
him the money.  And I think thats  a fair way to resolve his complaint.
I also dont think QuickQuid needs to pay Mr S anything for distress  and inconvenience in 
relation to his complaint about irresponsible lending. Ive not seen evidence QuickQuid was 
actually aware Mr S was in financial difficulty before  it approved  the loans, so I dont think  it 
had reason to think providing loans  which Mr S had asked  for  would cause him distress.
Ive noted in Mr S response to the adjudicator he says QuickQuid and a third party both 
harassed him when  attempting to collect the outstanding debt.
I cant address these matters in this decision. Firstly, Ive not seen  that Mr S raised this 
matter with QuickQuid  when he complained about irresponsible lending.  Theres no 
reference to this issue when Mr S first referred  his complaint to this service either. So 
QuickQuid hasnt had the opportunity to consider this issue first  as it must under our rules.  
And secondly, I cant consider the third-party debt purchasers acts or omissions in a 
complaint against  QuickQuid. If Mr S wishes, he can raise any concerns he has about this 
with the relevant business.
In summary,  I dont think theres  enough  evidence to conclude  it was irresponsible  for 
QuickQuid to have  approved  loan 1. And I think QuickQuids offer to resolve the complaint  in 
respect of loan 2 is fair.
Mr S has previously  told this service he is in poor health. I remind QuickQuid of its obligation 
to treat Mr S positively and sympathetically.
putting things right
QuickQuid should  do what it has offered:  
Ref: DRN63603273it should refund the interest and charges Mr S paid on loan 2, adding  8% simple 
interest per year from when they were paid until the date of settlement
it may apply the refund to the remaining principal balance
it should remove any information about the loan once the balance  is repaid
To be clear, if QuickQuid doesnt own the debt, it should take it back. If its unable to do this, 
it will have  to liaise with the debt owner  to achieve the same outcome as set out above  
ensuring that Mr S repays no more than the principal amount borrowed.
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr S a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
QuickQuids offer to resolve the complaint  is fair. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things  right 
by taking the steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 April 2019.
