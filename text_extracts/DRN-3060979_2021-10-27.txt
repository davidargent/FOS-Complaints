The complaint
Mr P is unhappy Bulstrad Life Vienna Insurance Group JSC (Bulstrad) declined a claim he 
made under his travel insurance policy. 
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them in full 
again here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
In summary, Mr Ps flight from Thailand to the UK was delayed. Hes unhappy Bulstrad wont 
cover this and thinks the term outward journey can be interpreted as outward from 
Thailand. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusion reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
Outward journey is specifically defined in the policy and therefore only this 
interpretation can be used. 
The policy is clear that claims for travel delay only apply to the outward journey  in 
this instance, as defined, it means Mr Ps initial journey from the UK.
There is no cover in the policy for delays on the return journey to the UK.
Insurers will decide what risks they wish to cover and will explain these in the policy 
documents. Simply because something isnt mentioned it doesnt automatically mean 
that it is or should be assumed to be, covered. In this case, I believe the policy 
makes it clear only the outward journey is covered.
For the reasons above, I do not uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ps complaint against Bulstrad Life Vienna 
Insurance Group JSC.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 November 2021.
