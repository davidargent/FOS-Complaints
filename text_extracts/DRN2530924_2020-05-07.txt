K821x#15Complaint
Mr S (by the way of a representative)  says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) ought  to have known the loans it provided were unaffordable.
Background
Mr S took a running  credit facility (RCF) with a £750  credit limit followed  by 21 instalment 
loans from Sunny between July 2014 and April 2017. A summary  of Mr Ss borrowing, based 
on the information provided to us by Sunny, can be found in the appendix at the end of this 
decision.
In our adjudicators most recent findings,  he thought Sunny had treated Mr S fairly  when  it 
approved his running credit facility (loan  1). But felt the way Mr S used his facility, should  
have caused Sunny concern. He thought  Sunny should have stopped  allowing Mr S to draw  
down from 3 December  2014 until the facility was closed.
Our adjudicator also upheld Mr Ss complaint about all of his instalment loans. This is 
because Sunny allowed Mr S to take out instalment  loans although he had shown difficulties 
repaying his running  credit facility (loan  1) and this had the same  effect  as unfairly  allowing  
Mr S to continue to borrow in a way that was unsuitable. 
By loan 6, our adjudicator felt that a pattern of lending  had been established which  shouldve  
indicated to Sunny that Mr S wasnt able to sustainably  make his loan repayments.
Sunny agreed  that further checks  were  warranted for loans 16-22 and it made an offer which  
was in-line with our adjudicators opinion for these loans. But Sunny didnt accept the 
adjudicators full findings for several reasons, and it made a number of points, including:
Sunny did not receive any contact from Mr S to inform the lender he was in any form of 
financial difficulty;
Mr S did not miss any repayments in relation to the running account facility;
Mr S did not have  to use more than 16.16% of his monthly  income to repay any one loan;
There was a break  in lending of at around eight months between loans 14 and 15.
Mr Ss representatives told us he did not want  to accept Sunnys offer. As no agreement  
could be reached,  the case has been passed to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to reasonably 
conclude Mr S could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner.
Ref: DRN25309242These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
I have thought, about the break in lending between loans 14 and 15. But considering how 
long Mr S had already  been borrowing from Sunny for, I dont think this gap of around 8 
months was sufficient for Sunny  to have thought it could treat Mr Ss application afresh. So 
Ive considered that Mr S only had one chain  of lending. 
To begin with, Mr S seems to accept  our adjudicators opinion  that Sunny wasnt  wrong to 
approve his running  credit  facility. And Sunny  has already accepted that something may 
have gone wrong  when  loans 16-22 were given to Mr S. 
So as these loans  are no longer in dispute  I have no reason to reach any findings  about 
them in this final decision. However, I have  included these loans in the section where I direct 
Sunny as to what it needs to do to put things right for Mr S. This decision will instead, look at 
the running of Mr Ss RCF as well as instalment loans 2-15.
The relevant  regulations  in place at the time Mr S was given his RCF
When Mr S held his RCF Sunny was regulated by the Financial  Conduct  Authority (FCA). 
The consumer credit sourcebook (section 6.7.2)  says: a firm must monitor  the customers  
repayment record and take action where there are signs  of actual or possible repayment 
difficulties. So Ive thought  about  whether Sunny did enough to monitor  the facility after it 
was approved.
Our adjudicator thought Sunny shouldve seen signs of difficulties by the time Mr S applied 
for his eighth  drawdown on 3 December 2014. By this point, our adjudicator  thought that 
Sunny would have  seen  that Mr Ss borrowing history showed he was experiencing difficulty  
repaying his facility. Having looked at the way Mr S used the RCF I agree with the 
adjudicator and Ive explained why below. 
Ref: DRN25309243Mr S initially  requested his full credit limit of £750  in one drawdown in July 2014. He repaid 
what he owed in full by the end of July before he proceeded to request his full credit limit 
again a few days later.
Mr S went  on to repeat the same behaviour in August  2014,  by requesting his full credit  limit 
of £750 and then repaying it quickly  he did this on two occasions in August.  This suggests 
Mr S may have potentially  been  struggling financially resulting in him needing to access  
further funds available to him within a few days.  I think this is something  which  should have 
put Sunny  on notice  but I dont think this should have warranted further action at this stage. I 
say this because  Mr S had only held his account for two months, so I dont think a strong 
enough pattern  had emerged at this stage showing a reliance on Sunnys facility.
However, Mr Ss borrowing behaviour changed in September 2014. He had borrowed his full 
credit limit of £750 at the end of August 2014  and rather than repay  it in full, he made  his 
contractual repayment for September and October 2014, in-line with Sunnys credit  agreement.  
He paid a total of £319.47 in October  but, within four days, he had requested  the remaining 
principal balance available  to him of £297.25.  Mr Ss need to borrow so soon after he repaid his 
balance in full was not, in my view, the actions of someone comfortable financially.
Mr S went  on to use his account  this way on a further two occasions - making his contractual 
repayment and then drawing down his remaining principal balance  within  a few days. And he 
wasnt making any headway in repaying what he owed within  a reasonable time. By 
3 December 2014, he had used his account  this way on three  occasions.  I agree with our 
adjudicator, that this is the point where Sunny should have halted  any further lending.
Mr S was not using  his account as intended.  Indeed, what appears to have happened  is that 
he was borrowing further from Sunny  in order to fill a hole in his finances that was made by 
making repayments to Sunny. And so this isnt a sustainable form of borrowing.
So Im upholding  Mr Ss complaint about  his running credit facility  (loan  1) from 3 December 2014.
Loans 2-15
Mr S went  on to hold his facility for around nine months, whilst requesting 10 drawdowns 
during this time. Our understanding  is that Sunny withdrew its running credit product at the 
end of December  2014. And instead  it started providing instalment loans.
Whilst Mr S was unable to continue using his RCF, I can see he was provided  with 
instalment loans from December 2014. But due to the way Mr S used his facility, and the fact 
that his circumstances didnt appear to have significantly  changed, I dont think it was 
reasonable for Sunny to have provided  him with any of the following instalments loans.
Whilst Sunny stopped  allowing Mr S to draw down  on the facility  after this, it instead 
provided him with nine instalment loans  shortly afterwards. I think that this had the same 
effect as unfairly  allowing  Mr S to continue to draw  down on the RCF in a way that was 
unsuitable. So, Sunny  should  have seen that it was unlikely Mr S wouldve been  able to 
sustainably repay  any of his subsequent instalment loans.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.
Ref: DRN25309244Our adjudicator thought Sunny shouldve seen this by the time Mr S applied  for his sixth 
loan, that a pattern of lending had developed  which made these loans unsustainable. I have 
considered our adjudicators points, and Im minded to agree. I say this because:
When Mr S took out loan 6, it was his 15th drawdown or loan in 10 months and it seems 
he had needed  to borrow from Sunny for each  of the preceding 10 months.
By loan 6, I think there was a pattern in Mr Ss borrowing. For loans 4, 5 and 6, the 
amounts he borrowed  totalled £750,  which was the same amount he was approved for 
his running credit  facility.  Sunny  ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr S 
was having to borrow further to cover the hole the repayment of his previous loans left in 
his finances and that Mr Ss indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Although the value  for Loan 6 was slightly smaller then some  of Mr Ss previous 
instalment loans, his overall monthly  repayment  hadnt  significantly decreased. So 
Mr S had in effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr S lost out when Sunny provided  loans  6 onwards because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit over an extended  period of time and;
the sheer  number of loans would more likely then not have had negative implications on 
Mr Ss ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these high-
cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Ss complaint about  all of his loans. Sunny should  put things right as 
detailed below.
Putting things  right  what  Sunny needs to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr S paid from 3 December 2014  until the facility closed 
along with loans 2  19
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
for loans 20  22, Sunny should  rework these loans so Mr S only has to repay the 
principal borrowed  and it should  treat any repayments  made by Mr S as if it went  
towards the principal  balance.
If and when Mr S had repaid enough  to repay  the principal, then any overpayment  
should be refunded to Mr S. To this overpayment 8% simple a year interest should be 
added from the date of the overpayment came due to the date of settlement*
If however, after doing  the above, there remains an outstanding principal balance on 
any of these three loans,  Sunny if it wishes, can off set any outstanding principal sum 
from the refund due on Mr Ss running credit facility and loans 2-19.
remove any negative  information from Mr Ss credit file, about his running credit  facility 
from 3 December  2014 until the facility  is closed as well as loans 2- 5;
Ref: DRN25309245Remove loans 6-22 from Mr Ss credit file entirely, this is because  the period  of time Mr S 
owed Sunny  money means that any information  still recorded about these loans is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  pay Mr S compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2020.
