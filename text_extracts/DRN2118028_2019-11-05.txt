Ms M says proper affordability checks would have shown she could not afford to repay the 
loans. She says that she became dependent on short-term loans and was stuck in a cycle of 
borrowing which caused her financial situation  to deteriorate significantly.
Sunny says it carried out affordability and creditworthiness checks  for each loan application. 
It says its checks  were  proportionate and that it acted responsibly when approving the loans.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She considered that, by loan 
5, proportionate checks were likely to have shown  Ms M was having problems managing  her 
money. She also found that, by loan 6, Ms Ms pattern of borrowing suggested  she had 
become dependent on the loans. Our adjudicator recommended interest and charges (plus 
8% statutory interest) should be refunded on loans 5 to 24 and that adverse information  
about loan 5 should be removed from her credit file. In addition, she said that loans 6 
onwards should  be removed  from Ms Ms credit  file in their entirety.
Ref: DRN21180282Sunny responded to say, in summary,  that the loan repayments represented a small 
proportion of Ms Ms income. It added that its checks were robust, and showed Ms M had 
sufficient disposable  income to afford the repayments. Sunny  said Ms Ms repayment history 
was good and that she showed no sign of financial difficulties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms M could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors could 
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ref: DRN21180283Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ms complaint.
Loans 1 and 2
Im satisfied Sunny did enough checks before approving these first two loans. Ms M had 
declared an income of £2,400 and her regular expenditure meant  she had disposable  
income of £850  per month. There was nothing in the available  information to indicate Ms M 
was struggling financially  and I cant conclude Sunny was wrong to have found loans 1 and 2 
were affordable to her.
Loan 3
When Ms M applied for loan 3, both her first two loans were  still outstanding which  meant 
her scheduled  monthly repayment was around  £220. Because of this, Id have expected a 
proportionate check to include asking Ms M whether she had any other  outstanding short-
term loans. I cant see Sunny did this, so Ive had a look to see what such a check  is likely to 
have shown. Based on the available information, I cant  see that Ms M had any other  short-
term loans so I cant say loan 3 was unaffordable  to her.
Loan 4
Ms Ms fourth loan application was for significantly more money and loan 2 was still 
outstanding. This meant her scheduled monthly repayment was about  £350. In addition  to 
this, Ms Ms credit file showed a new court judgement dated 27 July 2016. So I find Sunny  
should have carried  out a full financial review before approving  this loan.
Such a review shows Ms M had understated her regular  expenditure, but also was earning 
significantly more than the £2,400 shed declared. As she had no other short-term loans at 
the time,  Im satisfied Ms M had enough disposable  income to comfortably make the 
repayments due to Sunny. So I dont find Sunny did anything  wrong  by approving  loan 4.
Loan 5
Again I consider a full financial review would  have been proportionate  by the time Ms M 
applied for loan 5. Loan  4 was still outstanding and I can see Ms M had borrowed a further 
£650 from two other short-term providers in the two weeks prior to her fifth loan application  
with Sunny. Im satisfied  this should have  indicated to Sunny  that Ms M may be having 
problems managing her money and it should  not have approved loan 5.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Ms M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ms case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
This was Ms Ms sixth loan in less than five months and loans 4 and 5, as well as 
both the other short-term  loans  with other lenders were  still outstanding;
Ref: DRN21180284From  loan 6 onwards  Ms M was provided  with a new loan every few weeks  and there  
were no gaps in the lending.  So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than 
not Ms M was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole repaying her previous loan 
was leaving in her finances and that Ms Ms indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably;
Ms M wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  24 was 
taken out two years after Ms Ms first. And it was for a larger  amount. Ms M had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Ms M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ms indebtedness by allowing  her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Ms Ms 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 24 and Sunny should  put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading  as 
Sunny) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Ms M paid on loans 5 to 24;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loan 5 from Ms Ms credit file.
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 24 should be removed from 
Ms Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms M a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 December 2019.
