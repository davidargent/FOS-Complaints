The complaint
Mr J and Ms P say Barclays Bank UK PLC didnt tell them there was a product fee for their
new preferential interest rate.
What happened and what Ive decided  and why
I issued my provisional decision in May 2020. The contents of that are attached with this 
final decision and form part of it. In my provisional decision I explained why I was minded to 
partially uphold Mr J and Ms Ps complaint.
Neither side had anything further to add following my provisional decision. Mr J and Ms P 
didnt ask for the overpayments to be refunded to them, and Barclays agreed to rework the 
account on the lower rate as set out in my provisional decision.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I see no reason to depart from my provisional findings.
Putting things right
Barclays must:
Rework the mortgage onto Bank of England base rate plus 0.68% from the product 
start date, with the overpayments left on the account, so they reduce the balance 
(and interest), and
Pay Â£150 compensation to Mr J and Ms P for the trouble and upset caused.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part and order Barclays Bank UK PLC to pay redress as outlined 
above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J and 
Ms P to accept or reject my decision before 17 July 2020.
