The complaint
Mr P has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called PDL 
Finance Limited, trading at the time as Mr Lender. Mr P says he was lent to irresponsibly 
and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep things simple, Ill refer mainly to Mr Lender throughout this decision.
What happened
We now know that Mr P took out 11 instalment loans from Mr Lender between April 2014 
and August 2014. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Ps borrowing with Mr Lender, based on 
the information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought it should be upheld 
in respect of loans 5 -11 inclusive. Mr Lender said it didnt agree, but it did otherwise offer to 
settle the dispute, which Mr P declined. 
Ive been asked to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice, on our website. Ive followed this 
approach when thinking about Mr Ps complaint.
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr 
P could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
Mr Lender should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr P could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loans being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr P could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Mr Lender told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend 
to Mr P including assessing his income, expenditure and creditworthiness. It says all this 
information showed that he would be able to make most of the loan repayments he was 
committing to. Ive thought about this and also looked at the overall pattern of lending history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at 
some point, Mr Lender should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans 
to Mr P. 
Bearing in mind what Ive said above, about the length of the lending relationship, I think the 
somewhat basic financial checks Mr Lender probably carried out prior to lending loan 
numbers 1 - 4 would have been proportionate to this situation thus far. I dont think its clear 
enough that what Mr Lender would have would have seen, from its checks, suggested these 
loans were unaffordable for him. I accept that Mr P may have already been finding managing 
money quite difficult at this point. However, theres no clear record that the type or depth of 
credit checks that were carried out at that time would have exposed these issues. So Im 
afraid I dont agree that Mr Lender knew its lending was unsustainable for loans 1 - 4. I 
therefore dont uphold this part of the complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan number 5, the situation was different. Mr P applied for 
this loan on the same day hed paid off the previous loan and his monthly repayments went 
up, reflecting a slight increase in borrowing. 
Given the length of lending at this point and these other factors, I think its reasonable that 
the financial checks carried out by Mr Lender ought to have been more comprehensive and 
searching. I think any reasonable uplift in the depth of checks would have shown Mr P to be 
in a financially vulnerable situation. We already know his earnings were quite moderate and 
it seems he had borrowed extensively against his overdraft, credit cards and store cards. He 
also had a known history of using short-term lenders.
So overall, I think if proper checks had been carried out, Mr Lender would have seen that 
further lending wasnt a good idea. I think the lending from the point of loan 5 onwards was 
unsustainable and likely to cause hardship, given Mr Ps obvious financial situation.
In addition to the above, from the point of loan 8 onwards, there was also a clear pattern of 
repeated lending evident in my view. Loan 8 was advanced to him after 12 consecutive 
months of lending without any meaningful break. It also represented a big rise in the amount borrowed. From this point therefore, Mr Lender repeatedly lent to Mr P in an unsustainable 
manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr P borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
Putting things right
In order to put things right, Mr Lender should:
refund all interest and charges Mr P paid on loans 5 - 11;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ps credit file in relation to loans 5 - 
7.
the number of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 8 - 11 should be completely 
removed from Mr Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr P a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I partially uphold Mr Ps complaint and direct PDL Finance Limited to put things right as set 
out above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to 
accept or reject my decision before 6 August 2020.
