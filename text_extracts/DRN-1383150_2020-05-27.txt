Complaint
Mr J complains that NewDay Ltd failed to contact him after it reversed a payment to his 
account and then did not collect his direct debits.
Background
Mr J had a credit card account with NewDay. On 1 February 2019 an amount was credited 
to the account in error. As a result the account went into credit. No statements were issued 
whilst the account was in credit and no direct debits were collected.
NewDay was made aware of the error in June 2019 and reversed the credit. The reversal 
appeared on the July 2019 statement together with a credit of £10 as a gesture of goodwill.
Mr J says that NewDay didnt contact him about this at the time. He says that NewDay then 
didnt collect his direct debit in July. He says it only contacted him towards the end of August 
to tell him that the payment hadnt been collected. He says that NewDay added fees and 
charges to his account and issued a default notice in September. He complained to NewDay 
about these matters.
NewDay investigated his complaint. It acknowledged that it shouldve contacted Mr J at the 
time when the credit was reversed to provide him with an explanation. NewDay said it had 
credited his account with £10 at the time as a goodwill gesture. But, after he complained it 
had looked into this again. It said that because it hadnt contacted Mr J at the time it would 
pay him £105 by way of compensation and would also refund all of the charges and interest 
thatd been applied to his account in September and October. 
It didnt refund any charges for August because it said it had tried to collect the direct debit in 
July but itd been returned by Mr Js bank marked refer to drawer. And, it said that it had 
written to Mr J about the missed payment on 25 July 2019 and had also phoned him on 7 
August 2019. Further statements and notices had been sent to Mr J but he hadnt made any 
payments.
Mr J said that NewDay hadnt done enough and so he complained to our service. Our 
investigator looked into the complaint. She said that whilst NewDay couldve contacted Mr J 
to inform him about the payment reversal it had included the details of the reversal on his 
statement. She also said that NewDay had contacted him by letter and by phone to inform 
him about the missed payment in July. She reviewed the number of times NewDay had 
contacted Mr J after the account had been defaulted and she didnt think this had been 
excessive. So, she thought that NewDay had acted fairly and reasonably and she didnt 
expect it to do anything more.
Mr J didnt agree and so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
My findingsIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. For mainly the same reasons as our 
investigator I wont be upholding this complaint.
Ive looked at how NewDay dealt with the payment that had been credited to the account in 
error. I can see that the credit was made in February 2019 and it appears on the statement 
for that month. NewDay discovered the error in June 2019. When NewDay discovered that 
the payment had been credited to his account in error it shouldve contacted Mr J to explain 
what'd happened and what it would mean for him. New Day acknowledges that it shouldve 
done this. 
But, I can see that it sent him a statement in July which showed the payment reversal. It also 
included £10 as a goodwill gesture. Subsequently NewDay agreed to further compensate Mr 
J for not having contacted him. It did this by refunding interest and charges, totalling £64.80 
that had been applied to his account in September and October 2019. It also paid him £105 
by way of compensation.
Mr J says that, because of whats happened, he shouldnt have to pay any interest or fees 
and that the total amount of his debt should be written off. Ive thought about what Mr J has 
said.
When the payment was credited in error in February, Mr J wouldve seen this on his 
statements. He wouldve known that he hadnt made the payment but he didnt raise any 
query about it. He also had the benefit of that payment for the period from February to June. 
So, during that period he wasnt charged any interest or asked to make any payments  
even though he still owed money to NewDay. The amount that he owed NewDay didnt 
increase as a result of what had happened.
Ive also thought about the interest and charges that were applied to Mr Js account in the 
period since June 2019. Ive looked at the July statement. It stated that a payment was due 
and that it would be collected by direct debit on the specified date. NewDay says that it tried 
to collect the direct debit but it was returned marked refer to drawer. Mr J says that 
NewDay didnt try to collect the direct debit. But, I can see that NewDay sent him a letter on 
25 July 2019 to tell him that the payment hadnt been collected and the August statement 
shows that the direct debit was returned unpaid. So, Im satisfied that Mr J knew that the 
payment hadnt been made. 
The terms and conditions for the account provide that when a payment is missed interest 
and charges will apply. So, when Mr J didnt make payments in July, August, or September 
NewDay was permitted under the terms and conditions to apply the interest and charges. 
Mr Js mentioned calls hes received about the outstanding balance on his account. I 
understand Mr J is upset by the number of calls hes received but NewDay isnt obliged to 
put things on hold whilst the matter is with us. I agree with our investigator that the number 
of calls hasnt been excessive.
So, having considered everything here, Im satisfied that Mr J still owed the amount 
outstanding on the credit card and that interest and fees were correctly applied when 
payments were missed. NewDay has compensated Mr J for not contacting him when the 
credit was reversed. Its refunded £64.80 for interest and charges and has paid him an initial 
sum of £10 and a further sum of £105 by way of compensation. I think that this is fair and 
reasonable for what happened here and I dont expect it to do anything more.
My final decisionFor the reasons given above I do not uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 June 2020.
