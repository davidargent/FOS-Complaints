The complaint
P, a limited company complains that it lost out on the sale of a piece of land as a result of 
National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) placing a block on its business account.
To put things right, P wants NatWest to pay it more compensation.
What happened
NatWest told P that to avoid its account being restricted, it needed it to update its business 
profile and provide certain documentation. 
P gave NatWest some information on 3 March 2021 and was told it would continue to have 
access to the bank account. However, the member of staff was mistaken, and NatWest 
applied a block to Ps account shortly after.
P says that as a result of the block being placed on its account, it lost out on the sale of a 
piece of land. 
Before this service became involved, NatWest paid £6,000 towards Ps legal costs of the 
sale that fell through. NatWest also paid £150 and offered a further £850 in recognition of the 
difficulties caused by giving P the wrong information about the block.
P doesnt consider that NatWests compensation is adequate. P says that as the sale fell 
through, it has incurred additional costs that it wouldnt otherwise have had to pay.
The investigator didnt recommend that Ps complaint be upheld. He thought that planning 
permission wouldnt expire until March 2022, so there wasnt a loss from it expiring. The 
investigator also thought that P hadnt tried to mitigate its losses by considering an 
alternative option to allow the sale to go through in March 2020. The investigator thought 
that NatWest had already done and offered enough to put things right for P.
After P sent this service additional information, the investigator sent out an endorsement 
letter. In it he said that he didnt think NatWest was wrong to freeze Ps account. The 
investigator couldnt see that once P knew about the block it had made NatWest aware of 
the impact on the sale of the land. So, the investigator didnt think that NatWest was given 
an opportunity to fix the situation. 
P is unhappy with the investigators recommendation. It says the outline planning permission 
expired in March 2021, so it now needs to apply for the reserved matters to keep the 
planning permission alive. 
P says it couldnt do anything to mitigate its losses. P says that the buyer had a deadline by 
which to draw down its funding. Once this deadline was missed, the buyer withdrew. As Ps 
bank account was frozen, it didnt have any other options to complete the sale as its solicitor 
couldnt request the purchase monies without knowing when P would be able to receive the 
monies. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise that Ive summarised Ps complaint in my own words. Ive not responded to every 
single point made by all the parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by this, Instead, Ive 
concentrated on what I think are the key issues here. Our rules allow me to do this.
This means I dont comment on all the evidence that P has given us about the costs that it 
has incurred. But I want to reassure P that I have considered everything it has provided.
Im satisfied that NatWest sent several letters to P dating back to December 2019, asking it 
to update its business profile. In these letters NatWest told P that if the information wasnt 
provided, it would have to restrict access to the business account.
Although NatWest told P that the block wouldnt be applied to its account, I cant find that it 
was wrong to apply the block in the first place. NatWest needed to review the information 
that P provided and couldnt do so by the deadline of 4 March 2020. So, I need to consider 
whether NatWest should be required to do more in relation to the incorrect advice that it 
gave P about not applying the block.
P told this service that the buyers had a deadline by which to call on the purchase money. 
And that when P couldnt exchange or complete due to NatWest freezing the account, the 
funding had expired, and the sale was lost.
The fact that P says it couldnt complete due to NatWest freezing its account suggests that P 
was aware that there was a problem. A direct debit was returned as unpaid on 11 March 
2020, so it seems likely P was aware of a potential issue either at the time or shortly after. 
P says that the sale was due to complete on 13 March 2020, but I dont have any evidence 
to suggest that P contacted NatWest at this time to try and resolve the problem. The first 
record that NatWest has of contact by P is on 17 March 2020. At this point, P told NatWest 
the sale had been due to go through the week before but couldnt because of the block. 
Given the urgency of the situation, I wouldve reasonably expected P to speak to NatWest 
sooner than it did. 
As I dont consider that NatWest was given the opportunity to resolve the problem in time for 
the sale to go ahead as anticipated, I dont consider it reasonable to require it to bear the 
additional costs that P might incur.
P has given different explanations of what it tried to do once it realised that its bank account 
had been frozen. P told this service that it had no option to process the land sale transaction 
through another business account other than a personal account with another bank. And that 
all contracts had been drafted in the business name and therefore to change this last minute 
wouldve cost immense time and money. But P told NatWest that the buyers werent 
comfortable with the last-minute change of payment details.
Whichever explanation is the right one, I cant see that P gave NatWest the opportunity to lift 
the block in time for the sale to proceed. Again, this means I dont consider it reasonable to 
require NatWest to reimburse Ps costs arising out of the lost sale more than it already has. 
And I dont find that just because NatWest has paid something that it should be required to 
pay more.Even if I didnt consider it wasnt fair to require NatWest to pay more compensation for the 
reasons set out above, I still wouldnt uphold the complaint because P doesnt appear to 
have tried to mitigate its losses. For example: 
P says its solicitor couldnt hold the purchase monies without knowing when the block 
would be lifted. But I dont have any evidence to suggest that P or its solicitor 
contacted NatWest to either speed up removal of the block or find out when it would 
be lifted. Im also not persuaded that Ps solicitor couldnt have held on to the money 
for a short period of time to allow the sale to proceed as planned.
I cant see that P tried to negotiate with the buyer once the block on its account was 
lifted on 17 March 2020. 
P couldve tried to redraft contracts to allow the sale to proceed but didnt do so. 
P couldve done more to try and find another purchaser between March 2020 and the 
expiry of planning permission in March 2021. I appreciate that P says the pandemic 
disrupted its ability to try and sell the land over the last year. But I wouldve 
reasonably expected to see some evidence of efforts to find an alternative buyer.
I appreciate that it might not have been possible for P to take all or some of the above steps. 
But without evidence that P tried to do anything to mitigate its losses, I cant reasonably 
require NatWest to pay the kind of compensation that it seeks. I also cant be sure that P 
wont be able to recover the additional costs it has paid for the reserved matters once the 
sale of the land completes.
Im satisfied that NatWests payment of £6,000, £150 and the offer to pay a further £850 is 
adequate compensation for the misinformation about the block. I dont require NatWest to do 
more than this.
My final decision
National Westminster Bank Plc has already made an offer to pay £850 in addition to the 
£6,150 it has paid to P. I think this is fair in the circumstances.
So, my decision is that if it hasnt done so already, National Westminster Bank Plc should 
pay P £850.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask P to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 September 2021.
