K821x#15complaint
Ms W complains that MYJAR Limited lent to her irresponsibly.
background
MYJAR approved 48 loans for Ms W between  December 2011 and March  2017. I have used 
the Loan Table MYJAR has provided  to us and substituted the loan ID numbers for individual 
loan numbers which I have used to identify them in this decision. The Loan  Table  appears  at 
the end.
When MYJAR sent its final response letter to Ms Ws representative  in December 2017 it 
conceded on several loans  about  eight in total.  It offered to reimburse for those eight which  
on the Loan Table are Loans 13, 17, 20, 22, 24, 35, 39 and 40. Ms W appears to have 
rejected that offer as the complaint was brought to us. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at this complaint and thought that MYJAR  should put things  
right for Ms W in relation to Loans 5 to 48. MYJAR  disagreed but did concede in relation to 
Loans 5 to 25 and Loans 31 to 34. MYJAR  explained that where there  where gaps between 
the loans which it felt were large  enough  to make a difference it didnt think it should  pay 
compensation. And it said others  were  affordable  as they were repayable in instalments.
Some of the loans MYJAR  says it is defending now are ones it conceded in December 2017. 
Three in particular are Loans  35, 39 and 40. 
The offer was put to Ms W who rejected it.
So the complaint remains unresolved in relation to Loans 26 to 30 and 35 to 48 save that 
I note Loans 35, 39 and 40 were  conceded earlier in the complaint process  by MYJAR and 
I will take that into account. 
So the complaint has been passed  to me for a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Ms Ws case. 
Ive decided to uphold Ms Ws complaint in part and have explained why below.
First of all  the gaps  in lending to which MYJAR refers need  to be addressed. None of them 
are particularly long and when viewed within the context of the number of months to which 
MYJAR had been  extending credit to Ms W then I do not consider that the gaps make a 
difference to the loan chain.
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms W 
could repay  her loans  in a sustainable  manner. 
Ref: DRN59582182These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Ms Ws income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Ms Ws complaint.  These questions are:
1.Did MYJAR, each  time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Ms W would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Ms W would  have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Ms Ws indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did MYJAR  act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Ms Ws complaint.
MYJAR has conceded on loans which cover the period of time usually addressed in relation 
to the first question. So I am moving on to the second question to be addressed. 
I have not recreated individual,  proportionate  affordability checks for these loans because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Ms Ws indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise 
harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which MYJAR should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any 
further lending.  Given the particular circumstances  of Ms Ws case, I think  that this point was 
reached by Loan  8. I say this because:
Ref: DRN59582183the amounts  Ms W was borrowing were generally increasing up to Loan  8, and 
MYJAR ought to have  realised  it was likely their indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably
Ms W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount they owed lender. And was in 
effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended  period.
I think that Ms W lost out because MYJAR  continued to provide  borrowing from Loan 8 
onwards because:
even where Ms W has repaid the loans early,  more often than not Ms W reapplied  a 
very short time after having  repaid  for the next loan;
some  repayment figures  were  over a quarter  of her net monthly  salary;
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ws indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Ms Ws 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans;
the fact that some  were instalment loans does not alter my view in relation to the 
repetitive nature  of the multiple loan approvals. And the instalment loans often were  
for even higher principal amounts than she had taken before;
Ms W had default history with two other  short term lenders in 2012  culminating in one 
for about £1,600 in December 2012.  Ms W had a County  Court  Judgment against her 
in November 2012 which was satisfied in April 2013. These are from Ms Ws 
personal credit file. 
So Im upholding  Ms Ws complaint about Loans  8 to 48 because the overall  pattern  of 
lending increased  her indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and she lost out as a result. Many  of these have been  conceded  by MYJAR already. 
Did MYJAR act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude MYJAR acted  unfairly  or unreasonably towards  Ms W in some  
other way.  
Ref: DRN59582184putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms W paid on Loans 5 to 48;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative payment information about Loans 5 to 7 from Ms Ws credit file;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 8 means any information recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  Loans 8 to 48 should  be removed from Ms Ws credit  
file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Ms W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Ms Ws 
complaint. MYJAR  Limited should  pay redress as Ive set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I need to ask Ms W to accept or reject  
my final determination  on or before 22 August 2019.
