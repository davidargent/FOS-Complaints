The complaint
Mr S has complained that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have incorrectly provided a 
refund to someone he sold a mobile phone to on an internet sales platform.
What happened
Mr S sold a mobile phone on an internet sales platform. He agreed to refund the cost of the 
postage to the buyer, but issued a full refund by mistake via PayPal. He contacted PayPal 
and they told him to contact his bank and get them to stop the refund. Mr S did this and 
withdrew the funds from his PayPal account less the transaction fee. A refund was then 
provided to the buyer by PayPal and this put Mr Ss PayPal account in arrears. PayPal 
stopped Mr S accessing his account and appointed a debt collector to collect the arrears.
Mr S tried to contact PayPal and discuss the matter, but was unable to do so, partly because 
his account was blocked. So, he complained to us. Our investigator eventually concluded it 
was most likely PayPal had made an error in allowing the refund to the buyer to go through. 
He said PayPal should clear the arrears on Mr Ss account and pay him £100 in 
compensation for distress and inconvenience.
Mr S agrees with our investigators most recent assessment. PayPal dont agree with it and 
has asked for an ombudsmans decision. Theyve said Mr S processed a refund to the buyer 
and this went through. They were later told by Mr Ss bank this payment had been reversed, 
but it was too late, as the refund had gone through and this put Mr Ss PayPal account in 
arrears. So, they dont think they did anything wrong. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive checked the transactions on Mr Ss PayPal account and it looks like the refund hed 
made by mistake to the buyer was reversed the day after he made it, i.e. on 27 October 
2020. It looks like a further refund was made by PayPal on 4 November 2020 to the buyer. 
PayPal have said the only refund that went through was the one that Mr S authorised by 
mistake. But, Im not satisfied with their explanation based on the transactions I can see on 
Mr Ss PayPal account. It looks like his bank managed to reverse the refund Mr S had made 
after he took PayPals advice and contacted them. But, for some reason, PayPal processed 
a refund anyway. PayPal have said Mr Ss bank didnt tell them the refund payment had 
been reversed until 27 November 2020, but it seems to me it would have shown on Mr Ss 
account as reversed on 27 October 2020. And this suggests PayPal didnt pick this up and 
made a refund to the buyer on 4 November 2020. Its not clear to me whether this was a new 
refund or PayPal just allowing the original refund to complete when they shouldnt have 
done. But  either way  it looks like it only happened because PayPal made an error. 
I appreciate PayPal are adamant this isnt what happened, but I have to base my decision on 
what I think is most likely in the circumstances. This error by PayPal led to Mr Ss account 
going into arrears, which resulted in a debt collection agency being appointed and distress 
and inconvenience for him. 
Putting things right
I think the fair and reasonable outcome to Mr Ss complaint is for PayPal to clear the arrears 
on his account, as I think it is most likely the arrears is due to an error on their part. I also 
think PayPal need to remove any reference to this on Mr Ss credit report, if needed. And I 
think PayPal should also pay Mr S £100 in compensation for distress and inconvenience. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, my final decision is to uphold Mr Ss complaint. PayPal 
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must clear the arrears on Mr Ss account and pay him £100 in 
compensation for distress and inconvenience. They must also remove any record of the 
arrears from Mr Rs credit report, if needed. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2022.
