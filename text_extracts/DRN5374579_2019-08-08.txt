K820x#14complaint
Mr R says CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid irresponsibly  lent to him. Mr R says 
the loans were unaffordable.  He thinks QuickQuid shouldve  seen  this and not lent to him. 
background
This complaint is about three payday  loans QuickQuid provided  to Mr R between  April and 
August 2014.  Mr Rs lending history  is as follows:
loan 
numberdate 
startedamount 
borroweddate ended
1 14/04/2014 £400 14/04/2014
2 08/05/2014 £600 08/05/2014
3 08/08/2014 £750 08/08/2014
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Rs complaint.  He said that Mr R had repaid the loans 
straight away and he hadnt paid any interest or charges on the lending.   So Mr R hadnt 
suffered a financial loss.  
Mr R disagreed and the complaint was passed  to me, an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
If I were  to uphold this complaint I would award compensation that would, as far as possible, 
put Mr R back in the position  he would  be in had QuickQuid not lent irresponsibly. So Mr R 
should be compensated for any interest and charges he paid, as he shouldnt  have paid 
them. And the loan amounts should be repaid  to the lender. This is because  it shouldnt have 
lent to Mr R, so he wouldnt  have received this money.   
But Mr R didnt pay any interest or charges as a result of these loans. He repaid all of the 
loans on the day he borrowed and any interest  or charges he was due to pay were  refunded  
to his account. So it follows that I dont  think its reasonable to say hes suffered a loss. 
Because of this, Im not upholding  Mr Rs complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold M Rs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 September 2019
