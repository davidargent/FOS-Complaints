Mr L says Elevate Credit  International  Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly lent 
to him.

This complaint is about eight instalment loans Sunny  provided  to Mr L between August  2018 
and December 2018. Mr Ls borrowing history based  on what Sunny provided is as follows :

2 04/09/2018 23/09/2018 6 £500 £189
3 24/09/2018 24/10/2018 6 £450 £183

8 06/12/2018 15/12/2018 6 £350 £188
*The highest repayment amounts are based on the maximum repayments due for the
overlapping loans. The amounts have been  rounded  up/down.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ls complaint  in part and thought loans 5 to 8 should not have 
been given. Sunny didnt  agree in full so the complaint has been passed tome to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr L could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN40018222the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
Mr L hasnt disagreed with our adjudicators  opinion  on loans 1 to 4 so I wont be looking at 
these any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Mr Ls other lending. 
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 5 would most likely  have shown  
that Mr L was having  some trouble  in managing  his money. By the time loan 5 was taken,   
Mr L was paying  for three other loans with Sunny at the same time. Loan 5 was taken in very 
quick succession after the first four loans and less than two months after loan 1 was taken. 
While the amounts had fluctuated, Sunny should have been concerned with Mr Ls 
borrowing pattern  by the time loan 5 was taken and should have realised that he was having  
problems managing money. So I dont think it should  have given loan 5  and subsequently 
loans 6 to 8 should also not have been  given. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 8 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr L paid on loans 5 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative  information about  loans 5 to 8 from Mr Ls credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN40018223my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 April 2020.
