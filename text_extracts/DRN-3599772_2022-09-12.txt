The complaint
Mr R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) gave him incorrect advice 
about a scheduled account payment.
What happened
Mr R says he spoke to NatWest on 31 October 2021 about a scheduled payment due out of 
his account on 1 November 2021 for his rent. He says he was told by NatWest that it 
couldnt see the payment and so he set up a further payment. Mr R says both payments 
were made which meant his account was overdrawn. He says he was caused distress and 
inconvenience by NatWests mistake and would like £500 compensation. Mr R says he had 
to sort out the overpayment himself.
NatWest accepts it made a mistake and has apologised. It says its advisor should have 
known that a scheduled payment is not visible on an account after a certain period of time on 
the day before its due. NatWest says it has provided feedback to its staff and paid £25 
compensation.
Mr R brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld it. The investigator accepted Mr 
R had been given incorrect information and would have been caused distress and 
inconvenience. The investigator thought NatWest should pay a further £200 compensation.
NatWest agrees with that view, but Mr R doesnt. He questions why NatWest provided us 
with a different final response letter to the one he was sent 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I uphold this complaint but agree with 
the investigators view that NatWest should increase its compensation offer by £200. I 
appreciate Mr R will be disappointed by my decision and also appreciate his concern and 
frustration about the different final response letters. It is difficult to see why two different 
letters were generated by NatWest, but Im satisfied that the important point is that Mr R was 
able to sort out the overpayment and doesnt appear to have suffered a financial loss.
There is no question here that NatWest made a mistake by giving Mr R incorrect information 
about his rent payment. I have no doubt Mr R was caused distress and inconvenience as a 
result of the mistake and would have been concerned that his account was overdrawn. Im 
satisfied that NatWest has fairly apologised for the mistake and has provided feedback to its 
staff member. Im also satisfied that, as I have explained, Mr R didnt suffer any real financial 
loss and no interest or charges were made.
The only real issue for me to decide is the compensation level. And Im satisfied that a total 
payment of £225 compensation is fair and reasonable and is in line with the type of awards 
we would make for this type of issue. I also consider that the issue was resolved within a 
short time period and that NatWest has apologised for its mistake. I dont think what took 
place justifies an award of £500 or that the mistake impact was significant enough to make 
such an award.
Putting things right
NatWest should pay a further £200 compensation making a total of £225.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and order National Westminster Bank Plc to 
pay Mr R £200 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 October 2022.
