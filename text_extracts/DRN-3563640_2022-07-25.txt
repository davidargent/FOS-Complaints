The complaint
Mr P complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their decision to debit his 
account stating he had been double compensated, which he feels is incorrect.
What happened
On 1 June 2021, Mr P made two separate payments to an online retailer, who Ill refer to as 
T, for some parts. But these parts were fault, so Mr P raised a section 75 claim through his 
credit card provider, who Ill refer to as N.
While this claim was ongoing, Mr P received a partial refund from T into his PayPal account. 
So, N factored this refund into the payment they made for Mr Ps successful section 75 
claim, refunding him the amount left outstanding.
But after this payment, PayPal re-debited Mr Ps account, saying he had been double 
compensated. This placed Mr Ps account into a negative balance and so, he made a 
payment to PayPal to bring his account back to £0. But Mr P was unhappy with this as he 
felt hed been left out of pocket. So, he wanted PayPal to refund him the £2,013.38 he felt he 
was out of pocket, plus any interest hed been charged due to PayPals decision to re-debit 
his account.
PayPal responded and didnt agree. They thought theyd acted fairly, and in line with their 
terms and conditions when re-debiting Mr Ps account. And they thought Mr P should take 
up his issue with N, who they thought were responsible for arranging a refund through the 
section 75 claim he raised. So, they didnt think they needed to do anything more. Mr P 
remained unhappy with this response, so he referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and upheld it. They were satisfied that Ns 
payment made following Mr Ps section 75 claim factored in the refund T sent directly to Mr 
P through his PayPal account. So, they thought PayPals decision to re-debit Mr Ps account 
was unfair as they didnt agree Mr P had been double compensated. So, they thought 
PayPal should pay Mr P the amount left outstanding relating to the faulty parts provided by T 
plus 8% simple interest, refund any interest that may have been charged while Mr Ps 
account was in a negative balance and pay Mr P £100 to recognise the upset and 
inconvenience hed been caused. 
Mr P accepted this recommendation. But PayPal didnt, maintaining their belief theyd 
classified Mr Ps situation correctly, in line with their terms, and that Mr P would need to seek 
the remaining part of the refund from N, not themselves. As PayPal didnt agree, the 
complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
 Ive first calculated Mr Ps current financial position. To do this, Ive considered the initial 
£4,527.38 Mr P paid T and then subtracted the refunds Mr P received from T and N as well 
as the £144.68 refund PayPal paid before re-adding the payment Mr P paid to PayPal after 
they re-debited his account. And having done so, I can see Mr P is currently left £2,013.38 
out of pocket.
So, Ive then thought about whether I think PayPals actions have directly impacted Mr Ps 
financial position. Had PayPal not re-debited Mr Ps account saying he had been double 
compensated, then Mr P wouldve received a total refund of the payment he made to T, less 
1p. And as Mr Ps section 75 refund had been successful, I think this is the position he 
shouldve been in. So, I think PayPals actions have directly led to the financial loss Mr P has 
incurred.
Ive then thought about whether I think the actions taken by PayPal were fair. They think they 
were, as it was Ns responsibility to ensure Mr P received the full refund via his section 75 
refund made through N directly. But I disagree. Ive seen an email from N which confirms 
they took into consideration the partial refund Mr P received from T through his PayPal 
account when calculated the section 75 refund amount hed receive. So, the section 75 
refund wasnt for the full amount, as T had already given Mr P some of his funds back.
Crucially, it was after Mr P received the partial section 75 refund from N that PayPal chose to 
re-debit Mr Ps account. So, N were unable to factor this re-debit into their calculations. This 
has meant Mr P has needed to bring his PayPal account back to a zero balance to avoid 
charges, impacting his financial situation. PayPal say they did this as Mr P had received 
double compensation. But he didnt. The refund N provided was intended to be on top of the 
refund T had already given Mr P. So, I dont think PayPal shouldve re-debited Mr Ps 
account and so, I think they acted unfairly when doing so.
Putting things right
Any award or direction I make is intended to place Mr P back in the position he wouldve 
been, had PayPal acted fairly in the first instance.
In this situation, had PayPal have acted fairly, they wouldnt have re-debited Mr Ps account. 
And if they hadnt, Mr P wouldnt have needed to make a payment into his PayPal account to 
bring it to a zero balance and incurred any interest or charges this may have led to. So, I 
think PayPal should pay Mr P the £2,013.38 he needs to recover all of the funds he paid to 
T, plus 8% simple interest from the date Mr P repaid PayPal until its refunded. 
I also think PayPal should refund any interest or charges Mr P was charge while his account 
was in a negative balance, if there are any, as I dont think it shouldve been. And finally, I 
think PayPal should pay Mr P £100 to recognise the inconvenience hes been caused due to 
their actions, including the financial loss and time spent needing to engage with PayPal 
unnecessarily.   
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I uphold Mr Ps complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA and I direct them to take the following action:Pay Mr P £2,013.38 plus 8% simple interest from the date Mr P made payment to 
PayPal until the date it is refunded,
Refund any interest (if any) Mr P was charged while his account was in a negative 
balance; and
Pay Mr P £100 for the upset and inconvenience hes been caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 August 2022.
