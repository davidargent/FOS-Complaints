The complaint
Mr C complains that Admiral insurance Company Limited mishandled his claim on his motor 
insurance policy.
What happened
The subject matter of this complaint is a 4-door saloon car, made by a prestige car maker in 
about 2009. For the year from April 2020, Mr C had the car insured on a comprehensive 
policy with Admiral.
In March 2021, the car suffered accident damage. Admiral said it was a write-off. In late 
April,  Admiral gave a pre-accident valuation of £13,290.00 and paid Mr C that amount less 
the policy excess of £1,250.00.
Mr C complained to Admiral that its valuation wasnt high enough. By a final response dated 
26 April, Admiral increased its valuation to £14,185.00 and paid Mr C the extra £895.00 plus 
a small amount of interest and a further £50.00 for inconvenience. In total Admiral paid Mr C 
£12,986.73.
Unhappy with that, Mr C brought his complaint to us in late May. He says the car was worth 
about £17,000.00. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Admiral had acted fairly. He said that the trade guide valuations were as follows:
Glasss: £14,185.00
CAP: £14,700.00
Cazana: £16,459.00
Mr C disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says, in summary, that:
He needs the Cazana guide price of £16,459.00.
That £2,500.00 shortfall has caused him difficulty, inconvenience, stress and drained 
his quality of life in general. He still hasnt been able to replace the vehicle as hes 
not been paid enough. 
He was paid the lowest of the valuations which is unfair.
Even another £515.00 between cap and glasses would be beneficial to him. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Under the policy terms, Admiral didnt have to pay any more than the pre-accident market 
value of the car, less the policy excess. Mr C wasnt entitled to a courtesy car unless Admiral 
was repairing his car.
I will consider whether Admiral treated Mr C fairly. 
We expect insurers to treat a vehicle as a total loss if the estimated cost of repairing it 
exceeds a percentage (e.g. 70%) of its pre-accident value.
We consider all relevant valuation evidence. So Ive looked at the advertised prices Mr C has 
provided. But I place more weight on the retail prices stated in the trade guides, as these are 
based on research of likely prices after negotiation, taking into account all aspects of supply 
and demand.
Ive noted the make, model, specification, age, below-average mileage and good condition of 
Mr Cs car.
For a car like his before the accident, Ive seen trade guide figures as follows:
Glasss: £12,160.00
CAP: £14,700.00
Cazana: £16,459.00
Admirals final response letter said that Glasss had provided Admiral with the figure of 
£14,185.00.
But  whichever of the Glasss figures I look at  £14,185.00 is within the range of the trade 
guide figures. So I dont consider that Admirals final response valuation was unreasonable 
or treated Mr C unfairly. And I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Admiral to increase its 
valuation.
Mr C has fallen short of showing that Admiral treated him unfairly by treating the car as a 
total loss. Im satisfied that Admiral dealt with his claim and his complaint promptly and fairly. 
Overall I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Admiral to pay Mr C any more. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Admiral insurance Company Limited to do any more in response to this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 October 2021.
