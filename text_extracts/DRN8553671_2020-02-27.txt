K821x#15complaint
Mr Q has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
Novaloans Ltd, trading  at the time as Cash4unow. Mr Q says he was lent to irresponsibly 
and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Cash4unow.
background
We now know that Mr Q took out 10 loans from Cash4unow between March  2014 and 
November 2015.  Ive included a summary  of the lending in an appendix at the end of this 
decision. 
One of our adjudicators recently  looked into the complaint  and said they thought it should be 
upheld from the point of loan 3 onwards. Cash4unow  didnt  think it had done anything  wrong 
so the complaint has come to me for an ombudsmans final decision. 
.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Qs 
complaint.
Cash4unow needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr Q could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought  to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Cash4unow should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Cash4unow was required to establish  
Ref: DRN85536712whether Mr Q could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr Q could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Cash4unow told us it carried out certain  affordability and credit checks before agreeing  to 
lend to Mr Q. Ive thought  about this and Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of lending 
history with a view to seeing if there was a point  at which Cash4unow should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  Ive considered 
whether, at some point,  Cash4unow should  have realised that it shouldnt  have  provided  any 
further loans.  
Bearing in mind what Ive said above  about the length of the lending relationship, I think the 
checks which Cash4unow most likely carried out appear to have been proportionate for 
loans 1 and 2. I think this because the level of checks, together  with the income  and 
expenditure details provided by Mr Q, would have made these  loans appear  affordable  for 
him. So I dont uphold this part of Mr Qs complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan 3 onwards in this case  a more  thorough  and 
responsible approach was called for. This is because,  even though this was all still quite 
early in the lending relationship, I think Cash4unow ought to have seen that Mr Q was 
experiencing problems in managing money.
I can see that Cash4unow doesnt agree with this. But I note from the financial checks it 
carried out ahead of granting  loan 3, Cash4unow  would have been able to see Mr Q was 
frequently using   and applying for  these types of short-term loans with different providers. 
I also note that Cash4unow would have  seen at least  2 other loans  were  overdue and other 
applications had been declined. There was also evidence some  payday loans were in the 
course of being  settled.  An important  point here is that this picture conflicts  with information 
Cash4unow says it was given by Mr Q, who had indicated on his loan 3 application that he 
had no such debts outstanding.
So Ive thought about what  the situation  at the point of loan 3 would have looked like. Mr Q 
had declared a relatively good monthly income of around £3,000 per month. But his 
outgoings were  also quite high and the loan (3) he was about to be given was another  
payday loan which was due in one payment  of £650. In this type of situation, my expectation 
is that Cash4unow should have  carried out more diligent checking  in relation to Mr Qs 
finances and the (apparent) other  loan(s). It should  have also tried to resolve  the conflict  that 
seemed to exist about whether other  loans  were outstanding or had defaulted. I think if it had 
done this, Cash4unow would have  easily  uncovered  Mr Qs obvious problems in managing  
money
Ive considered what Cash4unow  has said about  all this, particularly about some  of its 
checks not revealing much to be concerned  about.  But of those involved in this case, it is 
Cash4unow which is the regulated party and as Ive said above,  it had a duty to ensure it 
Ref: DRN85536713wasnt lending irresponsibly. Comprehensive and diligent  checks  would have revealed other 
lending and been a genuine  cause for verifying  the information  Mr Q had provided. In my 
view, given the information  available  about Mr Q, the situation  had arrived  at the point of 
loan 3, for these more  in-depth checks to be carried out. He should not have been lent loan 
number 3 and by definition loans 4 and 5 should  have  been subjected to similar  scrutiny. I 
therefore uphold  the complaint about loans  3, 4 and 5.  
From the point of loan 6 onwards, there  was an additional  and clear  pattern of repeated 
lending evident,  in my view. This was Mr Qs sixth loan in 8 months and the trajectory  
throughout the lending  chain was showing an upward dependency on high-interest, short-
term lending. Im therefore also upholding Mr Qs complaint in respect of loans 6 - 10 as well. 
Cash4unow repeatedly lent to Mr Q in an unsustainable manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr Q borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right  what Cash4unow  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr Q paid on loans 3 - 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges on these from 
the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 - 5 from Mr Qs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 10 should be completely 
removed from Mr Qs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash4unow  to take off tax from this interest. Cash4unow must give Mr Q a 
certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Qs complaint. Novaloans  Ltd, trading as 
Cash4unow, should put things right for Mr Q as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr Q to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 March  2020.
