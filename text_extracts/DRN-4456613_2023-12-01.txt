The complaint
Mrs M complains about the way National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) handled a 
dispute she brought to it about a purchase on her debit card. 
What happened
The parties are familiar with the background to this complaint so I will only summarise it 
briefly here.
In January 2021 Mrs M entered into a contract for timeshare relinquishment services paid by 
instalments using her NatWest debit card. The last instalment was taken in June 2021 and 
the service was due to be completed by the supplier in 12 months from the date the contract 
was entered into. However, Mrs M says the supplier is no longer trading and cannot provide 
the service. 
Mrs M says she approached NatWest in March 2022 to raise a dispute by email to try and 
get her money back. However, she says she didnt hear anything back. 
Mrs M complained to NatWest but says she didnt hear back. This service got involved and 
NatWest responded to say it has no record of the complaint or the dispute being raised. It 
now points out that the time limits for raising a chargeback have expired, so a chargeback 
would not succeed. 
Mrs M insists NatWest received her claim via email so she referred her complaint to this 
service. 
NatWest maintains it didnt get the claim and that the email address Mrs Ms representative 
used to send it is invalid.
Our investigator did not uphold the complaint and concluded that Mrs Ms representative had 
likely sent the claim to an invalid email address.
The matter has now been referred to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have considered the evidence submitted by the parties but I wont be referring to it all  
only what I consider to be key. This is not intended as a discourtesy but reflects my role 
resolving disputes informally.
I am sorry to hear that Mrs M paid money to the supplier and didnt get the service she was 
promised. However, it is important to note here that NatWest is not the supplier of these 
services. So in deciding what is fair and reasonable I consider its role as a provider of 
financial services. As Mrs M paid using her debit card I consider the card protection of 
chargeback relevant here - so I have thought about what NatWest was fairly able to do for 
her in respect of progressing a chargeback dispute.
Chargeback is not a legal right but is based on rules set down by the card schemes. I am not 
clear if this case involved a VISA or Mastercard  however, I dont consider that makes a 
difference here as the provisions around timescales in this instance are broadly similar and 
dont change the outcome in any event. 
I consider the most relevant reason code here relates to a service not provided. However, it 
is also worth noting that I dont consider other chargeback rules that might arguably apply in 
this instance to change my findings regarding time limits in any event. 
In order for NatWest to have raised a chargeback for Mrs M for a service not provided it 
would have had to do so within the strict timescales laid down by the card schemes. This is 
120 days from the last day of expected service and/or no longer than 540 days from the date 
of the transaction in dispute. 
NatWest says that it hadnt heard from Mrs M about the dispute prior to January 2023 when 
she complained through this service. By this point she was clearly out of time to raise a 
chargeback dispute. However, Mrs Ms representative said it sent a letter to NatWest by 
email raising the claim in March 2022  which would have been in time.
So it seems the key thing here is whether NatWest got the letter of claim in March 2022. The 
parties disagree on this  but in this scenario my decision is based on what I think is most 
likely the case.
I have seen the letter which Mrs Ms representative says it emailed to NatWest in March 
2022. However, NatWest has confirmed that the email address the representative used 
(ADDRESS A) is incorrect and does not exist. In support of it not receiving a dispute at this 
time it has also provided a system note to show there is no record of the dispute for Mrs Ms 
account. 
What NatWest has said is credible, and on the face of it I have no reason to disbelieve it. 
There is no evidence that NatWest directly responded to the claim letter to confirm receipt or 
otherwise. 
I also note that NatWest did not respond to the complaint raised via ADDRESS A either and 
only responded once this service got in touch with NatWest via alternative means. I note the 
email address Mrs Ms representative then used to communicate with NatWests chargeback 
team (as given in NatWests final response letter) is different from ADDRESS A.
I note Mrs Ms representative has said that it has evidence that NatWest has responded to 
other correspondence it has sent to ADDRESS A in respect of other clients. However, while 
the evidence shows that Mrs Ms representative has sent messages to ADDRESS A and 
that NatWest has written to Mrs Ms representative by post and email it doesnt clearly 
show that NatWests responses were directly as a result of these emails to ADDRESS A. In 
fact at least one piece of evidence sent to ADDRESS A shows Mrs Ms representative 
stating it hasnt heard back from NatWest  which is consistent with this being an invalid 
mailbox. It also appears that NatWests emails to the representative come from an address 
other than ADDRESS A  there is no persuasive evidence it directly replied from this 
ADDRESS A.Furthermore, I note NatWest has shown a screenshot of it searching its global mailbox 
address list and there being no matches for ADDRESS A. This supports the argument that 
this mailbox does not exist.
In summary, I consider it more likely than not the claim letter from Mrs Ms representative 
from March 2022 was sent to an invalid mailbox. Therefore, NatWest has not made a 
mistake by not responding to the claim at the outset.
I am sorry that the claim is now out of time. However, because of what I have concluded 
here I dont consider this is the fault of NatWest.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2023.
