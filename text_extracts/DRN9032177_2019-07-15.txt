K821x#15complaint
Mr A complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  
19 June 2019,  an extract of which is attached and forms part of this final decision. So, I wont  
repeat that information here.  
In my provisional decision,  I set out why I thought  that Mr As complaint should  be upheld  in 
relation to loans  10 and 14-23. I also set out how I proposed to ask QuickQuid to put matters  
right.
Mr A accepted my provisional decision and said he didnt have anything  to add. QuickQuid 
said:
It carried out proportionate checks.
Mr A had a sound repayment history.
In relation to loans  8-23, it carried out proportionate checks which included validation  
of Mr As income  and credit commitments.
For multi-period  loans,  Mr A would have been  able to save disposable income from 
previous months.  
Mr A confirmed  that he could afford the repayments. 
The amounts  Mr A borrowed fluctuated during the relevant period which shows that 
he wasnt dependent on the loans.  
There were  significant  breaks in lending. 
   
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
For the reasons  I set out in my provisional  decision,  I dont  agree  that QuickQuid carried out 
proportionate checks for all of the loans it gave to Mr A. 
The fact that Mr A repaid the loans  doesnt  mean that he did so in a sustainable way. As I 
said, I dont think its reasonable to expect Mr A to save from previous months in order  to 
make the repayments.  It was for QuickQuid  to satisfy itself that Mr A could afford to repay 
these loans sustainably.  I dont think that a declaration at the time he took out the loans 
which said that he could  make the repayments  is persuasive. 
I appreciate that the amounts Mr A borrowed fluctuated and that there were gaps in his 
borrowing. I took those  matters into account in my provisional decision. 
Ref: DRN90321772Ive looked at everything again but, for the reasons I set out in my provisional  decision, I 
remain of the view that QuickQuid shouldnt have  given  Mr A loan 10 or loans 14-23. 
QuickQuid should  put things right as Ive indicated.  
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr As complaint in part. I now require CashEuroNet  LLC, 
trading as QuickQuid  to;
refund  all interest and charges Mr A paid on loans 10 and 14-23;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
write off any unpaid  interest and charges on the outstanding loan;
use the refund to reduce the capital  owing on the outstanding  loan and pay any 
balance to Mr A.
remove any negative information  about loan 10 from Mr As credit  file;
the number  of loans  taken from 14 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  14 to 23 should  be removed from Mr As 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. 
QuickQuid must give Mr A a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 August 2019.

complaint
Mr A complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr A took out 23 loans between July 2011 and May 2017. On several occasions, Mr A topped-up his 
borrowing. He also refinanced two of the loans by extending  the term.  Mr As final loan remains 
outstanding. A summary of Mr As borrowing  from QuickQuid is shown as an appendix to this 
decision.
QuickQuid said that Mr As complaint about the first four loans was made too late. Mr A has 
confirmed that he no longer  wishes to complain  about loans one to four. So I wont make any findings  
in relation to those four loans but Ill include them by way of background.
Mr As complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He said that QuickQuid shouldnt  
have given Mr A some  of the loans and he set out what it should do to put matters right.
QuickQuid didnt agree  with the adjudicators assessment. As the complaint hasnt been 
resolved informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general  approach to complaints about  short-
term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  - on our 
website.
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr A could  repay the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
    the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
    the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
    the greater the number and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans  (reflecting  the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN90321774There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Mr A could sustainably  repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow  this is the case. This is 
because the Office  of Fair Trading Irresponsible Lending guidance and later the Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC)  defines sustainable as being without undue  difficulties  and in particular, the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; 
as well as without having  to borrow to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender should  
realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing  
further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr As complaint.
As Ive said above, Mr A doesnt wish to pursue his complaint in relation to loans one to four. So Im 
looking at loans five onwards. There  are three periods of lending which Ill look at separately: loans 
five to seven, loan eight  and loans nine to 23.
loans five to seven
Before loans  five to seven,  QuickQuid asked Mr A about his income, which it recorded  as
£1,460. It also carried  out credit checks. By loan five, a pattern  of borrowing  had emerged  which 
suggested that Mr A may be reliant  on short-term borrowing. In those circumstances, proportionate 
checks are likely to have established a much fuller picture of Mr As financial position. I think 
proportionate checks before  loans five to seven wouldve  meant that QuickQuid took steps to verify  
the information Mr A provided about his financial situation.  So, I dont think QuickQuid carried out 
proportionate checks before  loans five to seven.
Thats not the end of the matter, as I need  to establish whether proportionate checks  would  have 
made any difference here. Mr A hasnt provided us with his bank statements  going as far back as 
2012. So, I dont know what QuickQuid would have seen if it had carried  out proportionate checks 
before loans  five to seven. I havent  seen anything which suggests that QuickQuid wouldve  known 
that Mr A wouldnt  have  been able to repay these loans sustainably.
Ive also looked at the number of loans at this stage,  the amounts they were  for and the period of 
time Mr A was borrowing. I dont think that for loans  five to seven,  Mr As lending  history, in itself, 
should have shown QuickQuid that he was experiencing underlying financial difficulty.  Based on 
what Ive seen, I cant say that QuickQuid shouldnt have given Mr A loans five to seven.
loan eight
After a gap in lending of almost seven  months, Mr A borrowed again but repaid the loan within two 
days. There  wasnt anything in the information  Mr A provided or the information  QuickQuid  should 
have been aware of which meant that it should have done more at this stage. I dont think  
QuickQuid was wrong to give Mr A loan eight.
Ref: DRN90321775loans nine to 23
Loan nine, taken in June 2015, was the start of a new period of lending.  At this point, QuickQuid 
asked Mr A about his income  and expenditure.  Given the loan amounts and what Mr A said about  
his income and expenditure, I dont  think it would  have been  proportionate for QuickQuid to ask Mr A 
for the amount of information needed to show that the lending was unsustainable. There wasnt 
anything in the information  Mr A provided or the information QuickQuid should  have been aware of 
which meant it would have been proportionate to start verifying what Mr A said.
I think the position changed  slightly by loan ten. QuickQuid knew that Mr As income was
£1,700 and his expenditure was £1,025. That left him with disposable income of £675. QuickQuid 
assessed his estimated  disposal income  as lower  than that at £444. The higher repayment for loan 
ten was £624. QuickQuid  says that Mr A should have saved disposable income  from the previous 
month in order to make the final repayment. I dont think that was reasonable here.
Before loan ten, proportionate checks are likely to have included asking Mr A not only about  his 
income and expenditure  but also about any other short-term financial commitments.  But I dont think 
that QuickQuid needed to verify what Mr A said about his finances at this stage. I think  that also 
applies to loans 11, 12 and 13.
I think that proportionate checks before loan ten would  most likely  have shown  that Mr A was having 
problems managing  his money. I think QuickQuid would have become aware  that Mr A already had 
an outstanding short-term financial  commitment  which  meant that he couldnt afford  to repay further 
borrowing. So QuickQuid  shouldnt have given Mr A loan ten.
But, based on what Ive seen, proportionate checks before loan 11 and 12 would  have shown 
that Mr A could afford to repay those loans. Thats because  Mr A didnt appear to have  other 
outstanding short-term  loans at the relevant times. So I dont think  that QuickQuid  was wrong to 
give Mr A loans 11 and 12.
Mr A had other  short-term  borrowing before loan 13 but not at such a level that QuickQuid wouldve 
known from proportionate  checks  that he couldnt afford to repay loan 13, particularly as loan 13 was 
for a modest amount.  So, I dont think that QuickQuid was wrong to give Mr A loans 11, 12 and 13.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Mr As lending history  with QuickQuid,  with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which  QuickQuid should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further  loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr As case, I think that this point was reached by loan
14. I say this because  Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed  QuickQuid.  Hed 
borrowed £250 in June 2015 and he was now asking  to borrow £300 some  six months later.
Mr A went on to borrow a further nine loans. Loan 23 was taken  out almost two years after Mr As 
first loan in this lending period. Whilst the amounts Mr A borrowed fluctuated, he had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service  an intermittent debt to QuickQuid over an extended period.
I think that Mr A lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide  borrowing from loan 14 onwards 
because these  loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.  And the sheer number 
of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr As ability to access  mainstream  credit 
and it potentially kept him in the market for these
high-cost loans.
So, in addition  to upholding Mr As complaint about loan ten, Im also upholding  the 
complaint about loans 14 to 23 and I propose to direct QuickQuid  to put things right.
Ref: DRN90321776putting things right  what I intend  to direct QuickQuid to do
refund all interest and charges Mr A paid on loans 10 and 14-23;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
write off any unpaid interest  and charges on the outstanding  loan;
use the refund  to reduce the capital owing  on the outstanding loan and pay any 
balance to Mr A.
remove any negative information about loan ten from Mr As credit  file;
the number of loans  taken from 14 onwards means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about loans 14 to 23 should be removed from Mr As credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must 
give Mr A a certificate  showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  given  above, my provisional  decision  is that I intend to uphold Mr As complaint  in
