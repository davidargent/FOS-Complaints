Mr L has said Uncle Buck did not lend to him responsibly. Uncle Buck  has said it conducted 
the relevant and appropriate checks before providing the lending. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ls complaint  in part and thought loans 7 to 11 should not have 
been given. Uncle Buck didnt agree in full  it made an offer for loans 8 and 10 only.  Mr L 
didnt accept this offer. The complaint  has now been  passed to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN56266642the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
Mr L hasnt disagreed with our adjudicators  opinion  on loans 1 to 6 so I wont be looking at 
these any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Mr Ls other lending. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Uncle Bucks  lending history with Mr L, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Uncle Buck should reasonably  have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Uncle  Buck should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point Uncle Buck ought to have realised Mr L was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr L had taken out seven  loans within  20 months.  So Uncle  Buck 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr L was having  to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that     
Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
I can see from the credit file provided  that Mr L was also borrowing from other 
lenders at the time.  As well as this, his total monthly repayments  on active fixed term 
Ref: DRN56266643accounts were significantly high. So its unlikely Mr L would have been able to make  
the repayments without undue financial difficulty. 
Mr Ls first loan was for £300  and loan 7 was for £800.  At  this point Uncle  Buck 
ought to have known that Mr L was not likely  borrowing  to meet  a temporary  shortfall 
in their income but to meet an ongoing  need.  
Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Uncle  Buck. Loan 11 
was taken out 37 months after Mr Ls first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr L had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Uncle Buck  over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr L lost out because Uncle  Buck continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr L borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ls ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
I note that there was some small gaps in the lending but these gaps werent significant 
enough to break the chain. 
Loan 3 was rolled over two times after Mr L discussed with Uncle  Buck that he would be 
unable to make the repayment due. Good industry  practice at the time pointed to three 
rollovers being the maximum a borrower  should be allowed.  So with two rollovers,  I accept 
this might not be a sign of on-going  financial difficulty. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 7 to 11 and Uncle Buck  should  put things right.
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 7 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 11 should be removed from Mr 
Ls credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr L a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Uncle  Buck Finance 
LLP should put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN56266644Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 April 2020.
