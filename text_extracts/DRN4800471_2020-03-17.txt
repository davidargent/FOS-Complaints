K821x#15complaint
Mr M has complained PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA refunded his buyer despite goods 
never being returned to him.
background
Mr M sold goods in 2017 and was paid £725  by his buyer. Later  on the buyer  lodged  a 
complaint with PayPal.  He didnt believe the goods  were as described.  The buyer said hed 
accept a partial refund of £350.  PayPal told Mr M theyd provide his buyer a full refund once 
the items  had been returned  to Mr M. Mr M only received back some of the parts hed sold. 
He estimated this to value £40.
Mr M disputed the outcome of the dispute with PayPal. He initially didnt get back to them  by 
26 January 2018  so they closed the dispute. Mr M then appealed. He also provided 
evidence hed contacted Action Fraud about  what happened. In February 2018 PayPal 
offered Mr M a partial refund of £543.75. He didnt get back to them  so they considered the 
matter closed. PayPal  asked a debt recovery agency to get Mr M to repay the debt. The 
amount he owed had climbed to £748.
Mr M brought his complaint to the ombudsman service. We got PayPals full file of evidence 
confirming their contact with Mr M. We informally told PayPal wed expect them to honour 
the offer theyd  made to Mr M unless they could  demonstrate why this would  be unfair. Our 
investigator then confirmed this outcome to PayPal  in August 2019. She also pointed out to 
PayPal they seemed to have placed an unfair  timescale on Mr M to respond.   
PayPal disagreed with this outcome.  They pointed out their User  Agreement  specified that 
customers had to respond to PayPals  information  requests in a timely  manner.  Mr M also 
disagreed with the outcome.
This complaint has been referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as our investigator. Ill explain why.
Firstly its been quite  difficult  to ascertain how much PayPal refunded the buyer.  The buyer 
stated theyd accept  half as a partial  refund. This would be £350.  Further evidence provided  
by PayPal of their contact  with Mr M shows they made a partial refund of £450. There is also 
further correspondence when Mr M appealed the decision to show  theyd actually given a full 
refund of £725.
It seems  clear  from other  evidence  that PayPal would only offer a full refund of £725 when 
Mr M had received his goods back. But Mr M has clearly told us  and PayPal  that he 
never received all the goods back.  Hes also sent us photographs  showing what he did 
receive back.
If in fact PayPal repaid  the buyer in full, then Id have expected them  to verify Mr Ms claim 
that hed not received his goods back.  
Ref: DRN48004712But actually I dont  believe the buyer  did receive a full refund. I say this because PayPal 
made an offer to Mr M which exceeded half the value of the goods.
PayPal hasnt been able to explain to us why they felt it was fair and reasonable to withdraw 
their offer to Mr M apart  from relating this to the timescale they gave him to respond.  This 
was a short timescale of three days. I have  already  told PayPal that it may be fair to expect 
customers to respond promptly but I see no reason why they would  limit that timescale to 
three days.
And in any case Ive seen  nothing to show why if the offer PayPal made in February 2018 
was fair then, it wouldnt be considered as fair now.
I can see Mr M now believes this isnt enough.  However as I think  its possible his buyer  
wasnt refunded in full, I cant  see that it would be fair he was. I also note PayPal s debt 
recovery agent has been asking Mr M to pay a varying amount in letters sent to him from 
March 2018 onwards.
Overall Ill be asking  PayPal to refund Mr M in line with the offer they made in February 
2018. Theyll also need  to instruct  their debt recovery company to stop pursuing Mr M and 
rework what may have  been owed before any fees and charges were  added on.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is to instruct  PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
Refund Mr M £543.75 in line with their original offer;  and
Rework what  Mr M now owes them to ensure  no fees and charges  are included.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 April 2020.
