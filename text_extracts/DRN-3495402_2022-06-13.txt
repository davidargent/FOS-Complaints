The complaint
Ms H complains that NewDay Ltd, trading as Debenhams, lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
In November 2020 Ms H opened a credit card account with NewDay. She had an account 
limit of £500 which didnt change during the life of the account. 
Ms H says that NewDay shouldnt have lent to her because she couldnt afford it. She says if 
NewDay had done checks on her which it should have done it would have realised she had 
a lot of debt.
NewDay says that it did all the necessary and proportionate checks and these showed that 
Ms H could afford the credit that was extended to her.
Our adjudicator thought that NewDay shouldnt have lent to Ms H. They thought Ms H was 
so indebted elsewhere that NewDay should have realised she would struggle with any more 
debt. Our adjudicator said that NewDay should refund any interest and charges paid by Ms 
H.
NewDay disagreed. It pointed out that Ms H managed her account both with it and other 
lenders well and that she had not ever been in arrears. The account is now closed.
As NewDay disagreed, the case has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible 
lending - including the key relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our 
website and Ive taken that into account when considered Ms Hs complaint.
NewDay needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms H could 
afford to repay what she was being lent in a sustainable manner. These checks could take 
into account a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment 
amounts, Ms Hs borrowing history and her income and expenditure. 
NewDay says its credit check results didnt show anything negative to suggest it would have 
been unreasonable to have provided Ms H with the credit. It says it asked her about her 
income and it also had information about other credit she had elsewhere and that none of 
this cause concern. It points also to the fact Ms H managed her account well and did not 
incur any fees or charges at any point. 
However, I think that the results of NewDays checks should have been a cause for concern. 
Ms H told NewDay that she earned only around £750 net a month, with accommodation 
costs of £400 a month. She declared that she had no monthly living costs, which clearly 
could not be true. Credit checks showed that Ms H had £6,300 in other unsecured debt.
While NewDay noted that Ms H had nine active credit accounts it noted no defaults or 
arrears, no payday loans and no CCJs it did not know how Ms Hs unsecured debt was 
structured and, had the entire sum been owed via revolving credit accounts, sustainable 
monthly repayments at 5% would have left Ms H with almost nothing each month. 
Information supplied by Ms H in the form of a credit report indicate these credit accounts 
comprised three loans, two credit cards, an overdraft facility, a catalogue account and two 
utility accounts. Ms Hs loans were costing a combined total of £217 a month.
So while NewDays check may have been proportionate I think it should have sought a 
better understanding of her financial situation before lending to her. It should have queried 
her lack of living expenses and how she was meeting her existing credit costs from her 
limited income. I think it should have been evident to NewDay that Ms H wouldnt have had 
the capacity to sustainably repay the new account. It follows that I agree with our adjudicator 
that NewDay was wrong to lend to Ms H.
Putting things right
As I dont think NewDay ought to have opened the account, I dont think its fair for it to be 
able to charge any interest or charges under the credit agreement. But I think Ms H should 
pay back the amounts she has borrowed. Therefore, NewDay should:
Rework the account removing all interest and charges that have been applied.
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Ms H along with 
8% simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. NewDay should also remove all adverse information regarding 
this account from Ms Hs credit file.
Or, if after the rework there is still an outstanding balance, NewDay should arrange 
an affordable repayment plan with Ms H for the remaining amount. Once Ms H has
cleared the balance, any adverse information in relation to the account should be
removed from her credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. It must give Ms H a 
certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if she asks for one. If it intends to apply the refund to reduce 
an outstanding balance, it must do so after deducting the tax.
This compensation is standard redress in a case of this type where it is considered that an 
account should not have been opened in the first place. It reflects the redress requested by 
Ms H through her representatives from the outset. My understanding of Ms Hs account 
activity is that she paid no more than £1.09 in interest, fees or charges over the course of the 
lending relationship; this means she is unlikely to receive more than £1.50 in compensation. 
Parties may wish to reflect on the effort put into pursing this complaint to this final resolution 
considering the level of compensation known to be at stake. 
My final decision
I uphold Ms Hs complaint and direct NewDay Ltd, trading as Debenhams, to pay 
compensation as described above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 July 2022.
