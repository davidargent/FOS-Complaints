K821x#15Complaint
Mr R has complained about the loans he took out through MYJAR Limited (MYJAR). He 
says he was in a debt spiral  to the extent  that loans werent affordable.  Mr R also says 
MYJAR didnt properly undertake affordability checks or adequately  assess signs of his over-
indebtedness.
Background
Mr R took 16 loans  from MYJAR between May 2016 and February  2018.  A summary of 
Mr Rs borrowing is shown at the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator felt that MYJAR didnt do enough  when checking whether  it should  lend 
loans 4-6. If it had done further  checks, he thought those checks  wouldve shown loan 4 
appeared affordable but loans 5 and 6 would  have appeared unaffordable. 
The adjudicator also concluded that due to the overall pattern of borrowing, MYJAR  
shouldve stopped lending to Mr R from loan 7 onwards, as he felt the lending had become 
unsustainable at this point.
I issued my provisional decision on 21 June 2019 explaining why I was thinking of reaching  
the same  conclusion as the adjudicator but for slightly different reasons for loan 5 and 6.
Mr R and his representative  have nothing further  to add. MYJAR provided new evidence for 
me to consider. It said this showed Mr Rs other debt levels decreased during its lending  
relationship with him. MYJAR also said Mr R had ample affordability and was under no or 
very little financial stress at the time he took the loans with them.
My findings
Ive considered MYJARs response to my provisional decision, along with all the available  
evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. Having done so, my decision remains the same.  For completeness, I have set my 
provisional decision out below and addressed MYJARs arguments within  it to form my final 
decision.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when  MYJAR  lent to Mr R. The 
FCAs Consumer Credit  sourcebook (CONC) is the specialist sourcebook for credit-related 
regulated activities. It sets out the rules and guidance specific to consumer credit providers, 
such as MYJAR. 
Ref: DRN70596252I am not quoting all the specific  regulations  here, because I would expect MYJAR to be 
familiar with these through previous ombudsman decisions, particularly recent  decisions,  
which set these rules out in more detail.
It is important  to note that the FCA didnt, and doesnt, specify exactly  how an assessment of 
affordability is to be carried out but the extent  and scope and the types  and sources of 
information to use needed to be enough  to be able to reasonably  assess  the sustainability  
of the arrangement for the consumer.
In other  words the assessment  needs  to be consumer-focussed.  It is not an assessment of 
the risk to the lender  of not recovering the credit but of the risk to the consumer of incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant  adverse  consequence  as a result of the 
decision to lend.
As set out in CONC,  the risk to the consumer  directly  relates  to the particulars of the lending  
and the circumstances of the consumer. Therefore, a lenders assessment of 
creditworthiness would  likely need to be flexible. That is to say, what is sufficient for one 
consumer might not be for another, or indeed  what might  be sufficient for a consumer in one 
circumstance might not be so for the same  consumer in other circumstances.
Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment  of creditworthiness  to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect  a lender to require more  assurance, the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way. 
Certain factors might point to the fact that MYJAR should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include, 
but not limited  to:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So MYJAR was required  to establish whether Mr R could sustainably  repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  Mr R could 
sustainably make his repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook  (CONC) defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  and without having  to borrow to meet  
the repayments. 
Ref: DRN70596253So, it follows  that a lender  should  realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably - if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.  
MYJAR has told this service it carried out detailed checks before agreeing to lend to Mr R. It 
says it asked Mr R about  his employment status,  income and expenses. It also said it carried 
out credit  searches. Based  on its checks,  it thought it lent the loans responsibly.
I think the checks MYJAR carried out were proportionate for the first three loans. 
Mr R was in the early stages of his relationship with MYJAR and the amounts that Mr R 
needed to repay were  relatively modest  compared to his declared income. 
By the fourth  loan I think MYJAR ought  to have  asked  Mr R about any other outstanding 
short term lending he had, in addition to asking about his income and expenses.  However, 
as Mr R didnt have  any outstanding commitments of this nature,  I think MYJAR would still 
have found the loan to be affordable.
Our adjudicator explained more detailed checks would have been proportionate from loan 5 
onwards. He found that those checks for loans 5 and 6 would  most  likely have shown that 
Mr R would have had insufficient disposable  income to afford the loan repayments of around  
£379 for loan 5 and £367 for loan 6.
Ive thought about this and, whilst I agree at this point MYJAR  ought to have fully reviewed 
Mr Rs finances and verified the information  he provided, I actually think  when MYJAR 
agreed loan 5, it ought to have realised - without the need  to delve into Mr Rs finances - that 
Mr R was having difficulty repaying his short term loans and couldnt really afford to repay 
them. 
A pattern was emerging  where Mr R was frequently taking a new loan very shortly after the 
last one was repaid  and the amounts Mr R was borrowing  were  increasing. 
Loan 3 was taken out two days after loan 2 was repaid. Loan 4 was taken out on the same 
day as loan 3. On each occasion,  Mr R was borrowing further  to meet  the gap repaying the 
previous loan had left in his finances   and the amounts were  increasing. Mr R was showing 
signs of being  unable to meet his repayments without having to borrow further. 
Loan 5 represented Mr Rs fifth loan in four months and this loan was for three  times  the 
amount he originally borrowed.  Whilst Mr R repaid loan 4 three  days  early, he returned later 
- the very same day - to borrow  loan 5 and it was for a greater amount. So I dont think 
repaying loan 4 early  was a sign that all was well with Mr Rs finances. On the contrary, in 
these circumstances,  I think  there was a significant risk Mr R wouldve been  unable to 
sustainably meet his repayments for this loan.
Ref: DRN70596254MYJAR doesnt agree and says that there was ample affordability  and no or little financial  
stress. But Mr R approached MYJAR  as a high cost short term lender to borrow money. By 
loan 5, Mr R had taken  5 loans in 4 months  with little in the way of breaks. The initial lending 
of £100 had risen  to £300. I dont agree this is reflective  of someone with ample affordability 
and little financial stress.
I also dont agree with MYJAR that the total unsecured debt data it has provided shows 
Mr Rs debt levels reduced  throughout  the lending period.  On the contrary the overall trend  is 
actually increasing.  The data MYJAR has provided  suggests that Mr Rs debt was - £238 at 
the time of loan 1 - to £289 at the time of loan 5 - increasing further by loan 12 to £688. 
Mr Rs debt levels didnt significantly tail off until the last two loans. But by this point 
(December 2017) Mr R had been  continuously  taking short term loans with MYJAR for over 
18 months and had been indebted to MYJAR  for all but 25 days  during those 18 months. 
At the same time Mr Rs indebtedness  to MYJAR was increasing  and there was a general 
trend (albeit  with some fluctuations) of a reducing  income.
So, MYJAR as a responsible lender should  have realised by loan 5 that Mr R was struggling 
to meet  the loan repayments without  borrowing  further.  And therefore, I dont think  MYJAR 
couldve reasonably  believed that  Mr R was able to sustainably  repay this loan.
 
I think this was also the case for loan 6. This loan was taken two days after loan 5 was 
repaid and for the same amount. I think MYJAR ought to have  realised that Mr R was having 
difficulty repaying his loans and therefore he was unlikely to be able to afford to repay loan 6 
without having  to borrow further.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MYJARs  lending history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 1-6 of Mr R taking new loans  shortly  
after repaying previous ones. I think that by loan 7, MYJAR  ought fairly and 
reasonably to have  regarded  that pattern as established.
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr R was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. So MYJAR ought to have  realised it was more  likely than not Mr R was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances and that Mr Rs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed MYJAR.  Loan 16 was 
taken out 21 months after Mr Rs first loan.  And it was for a larger amount. 
Over  the 16 month period from loan 7 to loan 16  there  were  only 17 days  when 
Mr R was not indebted to MYJAR. Mr R had paid large amounts of interest  to, in 
effect, service a debt to MYJAR over an extended period.
This isnt the purpose of these loans  and MYJAR  as a responsible lender shouldnt  have  
continued lending  in the circumstances.
Ref: DRN70596255I think that Mr R lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Rs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 7-16 as well as loans 5 and 6 and MYJAR 
should put things right as set out in the following section.
Putting things right
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr R towards  interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld  loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything  
MYJAR has already  refunded.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr R which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr R originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr R as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr R having 
made overpayments  then MYJAR should  refund these overpayments  with 8% simple 
interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would 
have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. MYJAR  should  then refund the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should  be paid to Mr R. However if there  is still an 
outstanding balance then MYJAR  should try to agree an affordable  repayment  plan 
with Mr R.
E) MYJAR  should remove any adverse information it has recorded  on Mr Rs credit 
file in relation  to loans 5 and 6. The overall pattern of Mr Rs borrowing for loans 7-16 
means any information recorded about them is adverse, so MYJAR should remove  
these loans entirely from Mr Rs credit file. MYJAR does not have to remove  any 
outstanding loans from Mr Rs credit file until these have been repaid, but MYJAR 
should still remove any adverse information  recorded about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to deduct tax from this interest. MYJAR should  
give Mr R a certificate showing  how much  tax MYJAR has deducted, if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN70596256My final decision
I have decided to partially uphold  Mr Rs complaint and direct  MYJAR Limited to put things 
right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 August 2019.
