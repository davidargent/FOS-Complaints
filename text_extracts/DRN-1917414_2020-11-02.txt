The complaint
Mr P complains that Go Car Credit Limited wont reimburse him for the repair costs that hes 
incurred on a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Go Car Credit, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr P - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr P nearly eight years old, had been driven for more 
than 89,000 miles and had a price of £6,500;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mr P electronically signed the hire purchase agreement in February 2019 but there 
were significant issues with the car  Go Car Credit paid for those issues to be 
repaired in April 2019, including replacing the cars engine with a refurbished engine 
 and it says that the cars mileage when it was returned to Mr P was 93,040;
the cars timing chain tensioner failed in December 2019 and Mr P paid £1,444.59 for 
the timing chain kit to be replaced  he then claimed that amount from Go Car Credit;
it said that hed been able to drive about 14,000 miles in the car since the engine was 
replaced and that Mr P hadnt provided a diagnostic report confirming the faults for it 
to review or allowed it to inspect the car or consider the quote before he had the car 
repaired;
Mr P complained to this service and our investigator recommended that his complaint 
should be upheld  she recommended that Go Car Credit should reimburse Mr P for 
the £1, 444.59 cost of the repair and pay him £350 to compensate him for the loss of 
use, distress and inconvenience that hed experienced;
this is a finely balanced complaint because Go Car Credit paid for the engine to 
replaced in April 2019, Mr P was then able to use the car for about eight months and 
drove it for about 14,000 miles and then paid for the timing chain kit to be replaced 
before Go Car Credit had been given an opportunity to properly consider any issues 
that were present with the car at that time;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when 
it was supplied to Mr P and Go Car Credit paid for the cars engine to be replaced in 
April 2019  the replacement engine used was a refurbished engine but I consider 
that it would be reasonable for Mr P to expect the replacement engine to last for 
more than eight months and 14,000 miles;
nor does there seem to be any dispute that the replacement engines timing chain kit 
failed so needed to be replaced in December 2019 and Mr P has provided a detailed 
invoice which shows that he paid £1,444.59 for the timing chain kit to be replaced;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mr P to have given Go Car Credit 
more time to properly consider any issues with the car in December 2019 before it 
was repaired, but I dont consider that his failure to do so is enough to make it unfair 
or unreasonable for me to require it to reimburse Mr P for those repair costs;
I consider that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr P and 
that it was fair and reasonable for Mr P to expect the replacement engine to last 
longer than it did  so I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these 
circumstances for Go Car Credit to pay £1,444.59 to Mr P to reimburse him for the 
repair costs that hes incurred; and
Mr P has been caused distress and inconvenience by these issues and his use of the 
car has been affected  I find that it would also be fair and reasonable for Go Car 
Credit to pay him £350 to compensate him for that distress and inconvenience and 
loss of use.
Putting things right
I find that Go Car Credit should pay £1,444.59 to Mr P to reimburse him for the repair costs 
that hes incurred and that it should also pay him £350 compensation.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ps complaint and I order Go Car Credit Limited to:
1. Pay £1,444.59 to Mr P to reimburse him for the repair costs that hes incurred.
2. Pay £350 to Mr P to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes 
been caused and his loss of use of the car.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2020.
