K822xcomplaint
Mr L says Gain Credit  LLC,  trading  as Lending Stream (Lending  Stream), irresponsibly lent 
to him.
background
This complaint is about six short-term loans Lending  Stream provided to Mr L between April 
and September  2015. Mr Ls borrowing history is as follows (I have rounded  the figures):
LoanDate 
TakenDate 
RepaidInstalments AmountHighest 
Monthly 
Repayment
1 30/04/2015 30/10/2015 6 £200.00   £91.00
2 18/06/2015 31/12/2015 6   £50.00   £98.00
3 07/07/2015 31/12/2015 6   £50.00 £109.00
4 13/08/2015 29/01/2016 6   £70.00 £135.00
5 21/08/2015 29/02/2016 6   £50.00 £151.00
6 07/09/2015 29/02/2016 6   £50.00 £143.00
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ls complaint and thought loans  5 and 6 shouldnt have 
been given. Lending Stream agreed  and made  an offer in line with the adjudicators 
recommendation. 
Mr Ls representative said he didnt  agree  due to the fact that he had taken out three further  
loans before the first one was paid off.  Mr L requested his complaint be escalated to an 
ombudsman for decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure 
Mr L could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.  These checks  could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN89546322the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.  Ive decided  to uphold Mr Ls complaint 
in part and have explained why below. 
There isnt any remaining disagreement  about  loans 5 and 6. These were upheld by the 
adjudicator and Lending Stream has agreed, it has offered  redress  and the removal of loan 6 
from Mr Ls credit file. Having looked at the circumstances surrounding the sale of loans 5 
and 6 I agree that Lending Stream shouldnt have  approved these loans and that it should 
pay compensation. I also agree with the offer it has made.  So  it only remains  for me to 
consider loans 1 to 4. 
In his response to the offer Mr L said he took out three further loans  before  the first one was 
paid off. And I have  looked at this because  this may have been an indicator  that Mr L was 
struggling to manage  his finances. The first loan was the largest amount borrowed - £200.  
The remaining  loans were  for small amounts  two at £50 and one at £70. There  is nothing 
to show that Mr L was borrowing further to finance  the loan he already held. He repaid his 
loans early and without any obvious difficulty.  And because  Mr L repaid the loans early  he 
wouldnt have paid the same amount of interest he had agreed  to at the start of the loan 
terms.
So I dont  think this would have flagged to Lending  Stream that it should make  further  checks  
on Mr Ls financial position. And, overall, I dont think its lending decision for the first four 
loans was unreasonable and Im not upholding Mr Ls complaint about  them. 
Ref: DRN89546323So I think what Lending Stream has offered to resolved Mr Ls complaint is fair. Im 
upholding the complaint  about loans 5 and loan 6 and endorse  the offer Lending Stream  has 
already made. To clarify:
putting things right  what Lending Stream needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 5 and 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Mr Ls credit  file;
for loan 6 any information recorded  about Mr L is adverse. So all entries  about loan 6 
should be removed  from Mr Ls credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest.  
Lending Stream must give Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Gain Credit LLC 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 February  2020.
