The complaint
Miss B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA irresponsibly gave her a credit card 
she couldnt afford. 
What happened
In April 2017, Miss B applied for a credit card with PayPal. She was given an initial credit 
limit of £1,050. The limit was increased five times until in October 2021, her credit limit was 
£5,300. 
Miss B complained to PayPal July 2022 to say that she should never have been given the 
credit card and subsequent limit increases. She said that she had since gone into an IVA 
due to the amount of unsustainable debt she had been in. She said that if PayPal had 
completed appropriate checks before lending it would have seen she couldnt afford the 
credit. 
PayPal didnt agree it had acted unfairly. It said it had completed adequate affordability 
checks each time it extended credit to her and that those checks didnt reveal any 
affordability concerns. 
Our investigator recommended the complaint be upheld in part. She didnt think PayPals 
affordability checks had gone far enough for each of the credit limit increases, however, it 
wasnt until the final limit increase that she considered proportionate affordability checks 
would reasonably have revealed that Miss B would struggle to repay. 
PayPal didnt accept that outcome, so the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Prior to granting Miss B with credit, PayPal needed to ensure she could afford to sustainably 
repay what she borrowed. There isnt a set list of checks PayPal needed to complete. 
Instead, any checks it did had to be proportionate in the given circumstances. This means 
that what is considered proportionate can vary from one lending decision to the next, and in 
the case of an open-ended revolving credit facility such as the one PayPal granted, its likely 
more thorough checks would be required the longer the lending relationship went on (and 
the more credit that is granted). 
In deciding what was proportionate, PayPal needed to take into account things such as (but 
not limited to): The amount of credit, the size of any reasonable regular repayment (for credit 
cards this is likely to be much more than the contractual minimum repayment (see rules and 
guidance in CONC)), the cost of the credit and the consumers circumstances. 
As part of the application, Miss B declared that her income was between £1,501 and £2,000 
per month and that her total committed expenditure didnt exceed £1,000 per month. PayPal 
says it also completed a credit check, although it hasnt provided us with those checks, it has 
told us Miss B had no adverse information being reported. Miss B has supplied us with a 
copy of her credit file and based on this, Ive not seen any reason to question what PayPal 
says it saw. 
Overall, taking into consideration the circumstances of the lending being applied for, what 
PayPal was told by Miss B and what it could see from its own checks, I think it gathered a 
reasonable and proportionate amount of information and evidence before deciding to lend. 
Having reviewed what information and evidence was available, Ive not seen anything to 
make me think PayPal made an unfair lending decision in opening the credit card account 
with an initial limit of £1,050. 
For each of the credit limit increases, PayPal says it completed credit checks and reviewed 
Miss Bs account activity on her PayPal credit card. However, I dont think PayPal completed 
reasonable and proportionate affordability checks on each of these increases. I consider 
each time it should have done more before deciding to lend. Ill set out in turn my reasoning 
for each increase and what that means for PayPals decision to lend to Miss B. However, in 
summary, I think that prior to each increase I consider PayPal should have sought to verify 
Miss Bs income and expenditure in some way. 
The first limit increase was in November 2017. This was by a modest amount of £250, 
bringing the total limit to £1,300. However, since the account opening Miss B had taken out a 
further credit card and a personal loan. It appears she also took out two other credit cards 
only a few days before being accepted for the PayPal credit card. Its unlikely PayPal would 
have seen this during the application. So, by the first limit increase it would see that she had 
at least four additional credit commitments that werent visible earlier. I think this sharp 
increase in unsecured borrowing ought to have prompted more thorough affordability checks 
from PayPal. 
In the absence of any income and expenditure verification done by PayPal at the time, Ive 
relied on copies of Miss Bs bank statements from the time. I think these give a good 
indication of what information PayPal would likely have discovered about her income and 
expenditure if it had completed adequate checks. Having reviewed her statements from 
around the time of the first limit increase, Ive not seen anything to make me think that more 
thorough checks by PayPal would likely have led to a different lending decision. It appears 
from what Ive seen that Miss B could afford the new credit limit. PayPal therefore didnt 
make an unfair lending decision. 
The second limit increase was in August 2018. This time the limit increased by a much more 
significant £1,000 to a total of £2,300. At this point, PayPals credit checks indicated Miss Bs 
unsecured debt had more than doubled and she now owed nearly £40,000 to other creditors. 
And her monthly repayments towards debts had increase more than threefold. This ought to 
have prompted more thorough affordability checks. 
However, Miss Bs bank statements indicate that this new credit limit appeared to still be 
affordable to her. While her credit commitments had increased, so had her income and she 
was sharing most essential and committed expenditures with her partner. I therefore dont 
think PayPal made an unfair lending decision in relation to the second increase. 
The third increase was in April 2019. Once again it was increased by £1,000 to a total of 
£3,300. I can see that PayPals credit checks showed that Miss Bs credit commitments 
hadnt changed since the last limit increase. However, given the time that had passed and 
that it was proposing to give her a further £1,000 of credit, I think more thorough checks 
ought to have been completed by PayPal. Miss Bs bank statements around this time once again indicate that the limit increase 
appeared to be affordable to her. I therefore dont think PayPal made an unfair lending 
decision when it increased her limit a third time. 
The fourth limit increase was in October 2019. This was again another £1,000 increase to a 
total limit of £4,300. PayPals credit checks showed that Miss Bs unsecured debt had 
decreased slightly since the last limit increase but was still close to £40,000 overall. 
However, I note that the checks also indicated that her percentage of debt compared to her 
income had significantly increased. This suggested Miss Bs income may have lowered and 
ought to have prompted more thorough checks. 
Miss B hasnt been able to provide all of her bank statements for this particular period of 
time. However, from what she has been able to provide, Ive not seen anything to suggest 
her financial circumstances had deteriorated from the previous limit increase or that she had 
insufficient disposable income to comfortably meet all of her commitments. Ive therefore not 
seen anything to make me think PayPal made an unfair lending decision in relation to the 
fourth increase.
The final increase was two years later, in October 2021. This also increased the limit by 
£1,000 to a total of £5,300. PayPals checks show Miss B now held debts totalling over 
£150,000. However, much of this was a mortgage. Her monthly debt repayments had also 
increased. Clearly, Miss Bs personal circumstances had significantly changed since the 
previous lending decisions and this ought to have prompted more thorough checks by 
PayPal. 
At this time I think proportionate affordability checks would likely have revealed that Miss B 
couldnt sustainably afford a further limit increase. Her repayments towards loans, not 
including her mortgage, were taking up around half of her income. On top of this she also 
held a number of credit cards with different lenders. Any reasonable further checks at this 
time I think would have shown that Miss B was overindebted and arguably already struggling 
with her existing commitments. Im therefore satisfied that if PayPal had completed adequate 
checks, it would have seen this too. I therefore dont think it made a fair lending decision 
when increasing the limit a final time. 
As I think PayPal made an unfair lending decision, I think it should put things right. Miss B 
has used the credit that was given to her, so I think it is fair that she pays back what she 
borrowed. However, as I dont think PayPal should have placed her in that position, I think 
its fair it refunds any interest, fees, charges and insurances that it applied in relation to 
balances that exceeded the previous limit of £4,300. It should also ensure Miss Bs credit file 
is updated to remove any adverse information that might have been recorded following the 
final limit increase. I understand Miss B is currently subject to an IVA. It will be up to Miss B 
to ensure she complies with the terms of her IVA if any refund is payable to her by PayPal.   
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA to:
Rework the credit card refunding any interest, fees, charges and insurances (not 
already refunded) applied against balances that exceeded £4,300 from 
October 2021. 
If the rework results in Miss B having made any overpayments, then those 
overpayments should be refunded to her along with 8% simple interest per year from 
the date of each overpayment to the date of settlement. PayPal should also remove any adverse information it might have recorded on her credit file after October 2021 
(if applicable). Or;
If the rework results in there still being a capital balance outstanding, PayPal should 
put in place an affordable and sustainable repayment plan for the remaining amount. 
Once Miss B has paid back the amounts she borrowed then PayPal should remove 
any adverse information it might have recorded on her credit file after October 2021 
(if applicable). 
If the outstanding balance of the account has been sold to a third party, PayPal should either 
arrange to buy back the debt so that it can carry out these directions, or ensure the third 
party does so on its behalf. 
If PayPal considers tax should be deducted from the interest element of my award it should 
provide Miss B with a certificate showing how much it has taken off, so she can reclaim that 
amount if she is eligible to do so.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 September 2023.
