The complaint
Miss K complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC failed to help her obtain a refund after a 
business she had paid for services went into administration. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
- Barclays options for obtaining a refund for Miss K were limited. Miss K paid for the 
services via her Visa debit card. Barclays looked at whether it could obtain a refund 
via a Visa chargeback claim. 
- Chargebacks are subject to the schemes rules and time limits. Visa runs the scheme 
and sets the time limits. Consumers can raise a chargeback claim within 120 days of 
the transaction date or within 120 days of the date they expected to receive the 
service they paid for. As there were no active bookings in place when Miss K raised 
her chargeback claim I think Barclays acted reasonably by using the date of the 
transactions as the starting point for the 120 day time limit.   
- The last transaction took place on 8 October 2018 and Miss K didnt contact Barclays 
to request a refund until 5 August 2019, which is more than 120 days. Im satisfied 
Barclays decision to decline Miss Ks chargeback claim was reasonable. There were 
no other options for Barclays to help Miss K obtain a refund.
- I havent found anything to show Barclays made a mistake or treated Miss K unfairly. 
As a result, Im not telling it to take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 August 2020.
