Miss B says CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  my provisional  decision on 8 May 2019. A copy  of it is attached  and forms 
part of this final decision. I asked Miss B and QuickQuid to let me know  if they had anything 
to add.
QuickQuid confirmed it didnt have anything to add. Miss B provided some  further comments 
and information  for me to consider. Ive taken  this  and all of the information previously 
provided  into account  and have  set out my findings below.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
In response to my provisional decision Miss B provided some  new information about  her 
individual voluntary arrangement (IVA). She also said: [the IVA] surely supports the fact that 
I was in financial difficulty up to this date and in default otherwise I would not have been able 
to be considered for one.  Miss B added that in order to be considered for an IVA that 
defaults over a prolonged period would have been registered on her credit  file.
Miss Bs IVA commenced  in August 2008,  shortly  after loan 3 was approved.  Given  the time 
that elapsed, its not possible for me to know what information was recorded  on her credit  file 
in 2008. I accept its possible some adverse information would have been visible to 
QuickQuid. But without  knowing  how much  adverse  information appeared, or how adverse it 
actually was, I cant make a judgement on whether Miss Bs credit history shouldve  affected 
QuickQuids decision to lend to her.
As I said in my provisional decision,  Miss B was in contact with QuickQuid during the period 
of lending and doesnt appear to have mentioned that she was in financial difficulty. She 
provided plausible reasons for the late repayments  on loans 1 and 2 which did not directly  
relate to financial difficulty. 
I also note that the information Miss B gave when applying for the loans was that her net 
monthly income was £2,900, so it wasnt necessary for QuickQuid  to take further  deductions 
(like income tax and national insurance) into account  as Miss B has suggested.
Miss B has said she was in a desperate  situation   and I am sorry to hear this. But based on 
the evidence Ive seen, I dont think QuickQuid  acted  irresponsibly when it lent to her.
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint against  CashEuroNet UK LLC.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 June 2019.

complaint
Miss B says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss B had three loans  with QuickQuid. Ive set out some of the details  QuickQuid provided about the 
loans in the table below.

An adjudicator considered Miss Bs complaint and recommend it be upheld  in part. She didnt think 
QuickQuid shouldve  approved Miss Bs third loan.
QuickQuid didnt agree  with the adjudicator. But it said that to amicably resolve the complaint it would  
refund to Miss B half of the interest she paid on loan 3 and add 8% simple interest a year to that 
amount. As there was no agreement, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
I note that in responding  to the adjudicator QuickQuid seems to suggest Miss B may have raised  her 
complaint too late for this service to consider. I remind QuickQuid that it consented to this service 
considering Miss Bs complaint in its email of 1 March 2019 and that it may not now withdraw that 
consent (as per DISP 2.8.2AR).
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive taken into account the law, good industry  practice and any 
relevant regulations at the time.
Miss Bs loans with QuickQuid  were approved in 2008  at this point in time there was less guidance 
on responsible lending than in later years but QuickQuid was required to take reasonable care before 
offering loans  and needed  to take into full account the interests  of its customers  before deciding 
whether to lend.
Ive seen that before  lending to Miss B, QuickQuid  recorded that her net monthly income was £2,900.  
It also recorded  that she was employed and living in rented accommodation. QuickQuid says it carried 
out credit checks too, but hasnt provided  details  of these.
Having considered  all of the evidence, Im not currently persuaded  QuickQuid lent to Miss B 
irresponsibly. Ill explain why.
I dont think the repayments for any of the loans are so high that QuickQuid  ought  to have realised  
Miss B would likely  struggle to repay them.  The largest repayments are about 
17%-26% of Miss Bs net monthly income   and each loan had a term of two months (so two 
paydays) and I think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to take that into account.
Ref: DRN35484104As can be seen in the table above, each loan was repaid later than the original due date. This could 
sometimes be a sign of financial difficulty  and might therefore indicate  it wouldnt be responsible to 
lend again  particularly  not very soon  after a loan which has been repaid late.
So Ive looked closely at how Miss B managed her repayments. The first repayment on loan 1 was 
due on 31 January 2008  and this payment was made on time. The second payment was due on 
29 February 2008 but Miss B missed this payment.
However, Ive seen that Miss B emailed QuickQuid on this date and informed it the direct debit had 
bounced as she had new bank details. Given what Miss B told QuickQuid,  I dont think it had reason 
to think  she was in financial difficulty at this time.
Miss Bs second loan also had two repayments. Again,  it seems  the first was made  on time but the 
second was late. But Miss B provided a reason  for the late payment  that her eyeglasses were 
broken and she needed  to purchase new ones  and she proposed a new repayment schedule. There 
was no mention of a change to her broader circumstances and so I dont  think  QuickQuid had reason  
to question Miss B further about her financial situation. Miss B went  on to repay  the loan at the end of 
the month, as she had proposed.
All this means that when Miss B applied for her third loan, I dont think  QuickQuid shouldve assumed  
she was actually in financial  difficulty on the basis of the late repayments. Although both the previous 
loans were repaid late, Miss B had provided plausible  reasons for this, neither of which relate  directly  
to financial difficulty but instead to unexpected events.
I do however note that the third loan was taken  very shortly after the second  making  it the second 
time Miss B had borrowed  in quick succession. And so its arguable QuickQuid ought  to have realised  
from this that Miss B may have been struggling to repay her loans. But I dont  think  this means  
QuickQuid shouldnt  have  lent at all  rather that it shouldve done more to check  whether  Miss B 
could really afford another loan. On balance, I dont  think additional  checks of the type QuickQuid  
ought reasonably to have carried out would have suggested the third loan was unaffordable at the 
outset. Ive not seen any detailed  evidence of Miss Bs financial situation at the time, but I wouldnt 
have expected  QuickQuid  to go as far as asking Miss B to provide detailed  information  about  her 
financial circumstances.
QuickQuid has now made an offer, as a gesture of goodwill. I dont intend to uphold Miss Bs 
complaint about the lending. I therefore intend to leave it to Miss B to decide  whether or not to accept  
QuickQuids offer.
