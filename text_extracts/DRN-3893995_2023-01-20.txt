The complaint
Ms F has complained that NewDay Limited irresponsibly lent to her
What happened
Ms F opened a shopping account with NewDay in May 2007. At that point her credit limit 
was set at £200. It was increased once in August 2007 to £900.
 
Ms F says that she couldnt afford the credit and that NewDay shouldnt have allowed her to 
have the card. She says she couldnt pay it back in a sustainable way.
 
NewDay says it did all the necessary checks before it lent to Ms F and before it increased 
Ms Fs credit limit and that it acted appropriately and fairly.
Our adjudicator thought that Ms Fs complaint shouldnt be upheld. She thought that 
NewDay likely did reasonable checks to begin with but when Ms Fs credit was increased 
NewDay ought to have asked Ms F for more information about her circumstances. Our 
adjudicator asked Ms F for copies of her bank statements and credit file from the time of the 
lending, but Ms F wasnt able to supply these. So, our adjudicator concluded that she could 
not safely say if NewDay had done more checks it would have seen information which would 
have indicated it shouldnt increase Ms Fs credit limit
.
Ms F did not agree, so the complaint has been passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible 
lending - including the key relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our 
website and Ive taken that into account when considered Ms Fs complaint.
NewDay needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms F
could afford to repay what he was being lent in a sustainable manner. These checks could 
have taken into account a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the
repayment amounts, how quickly the debt was being paid off and Ms Fs income and 
expenditure. There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending 
itself clearly demonstrates that that the lending was unsustainable.
NewDay has not been able to provide copies of the checks it did when the account was 
opened and when the limit was increased. This isnt surprising given over 15 years have 
passed since then. But it says it would have completed credit checks. Understanding 
NewDays processes, I consider this is likely to have happened. In the absence of any 
information about the outcome of these checks, or any evidence of Ms Fs financial 
circumstances at the time, I cant safely say that NewDay did anything wrong in providing the 
original lending. 
Similarly, when NewDay increased Ms Fs limit a few months later, NewDay says it would 
have done further credit checks. And it would have had information about how Ms F had 
managed the account up to that point. As the credit limit increase was significant (over four 
times the original limit), I think it would have been reasonable for NewDay to have found out 
more about Ms Fs circumstances. For example, I think it should have asked about Ms Fs 
income and living costs. 
But this information is no longer available from either party  Ms F wasnt able to supply her 
bank statements from the time and the credit file she provided, while it showed that she had 
financial problems later on, didnt show information from 2007. So I dont know what 
NewDay might have seen if it had made these further checks. 
For this reason, I dont have enough information to satisfy me that had NewDay did not 
complete proportionate checks before it lent to Ms F, or that NewDay didnt act appropriately 
on the outcome of those proportionate checks. This means I cant fairly say that Ms F lost 
out as a result of anything NewDay might have done wrong. 
My final decision
I do not uphold Ms Fs complaint, so it follows that NewDay Limited doesnt have to do 
anything further. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms F to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 February 2023.
