In response to Mrs Ws complaint STF issued its final response letter. In the letter it 
explained why it hadnt made an error when the loans were approved because these loans 
looked affordable. 
But it did acknowledge that Mrs W had some problems repaying loans 28 and 29  but no 
additional interest fees or charges were added to the balance as a result of these problems. 
Mrs W had occasionally missed payments, but the loans (expect for 28 and 29) had been 
settled within the agreed time frame.
Unhappy with this response, Mrs W brought her complaint to this Service. 
The adjudicator, reviewed Mrs Ws complaint and she didnt uphold her complaint about 
loans 1  5. But she did say from loan 4 STF ought to have been carrying out further, more 
in-depth checks into Mrs Ws financial situation. But she didnt have enough information from 
Mrs W to be able to conclude STF did something wrong when loans 4 and 5 were lent. 
However, the adjudicator did uphold Mrs Ws complaint about loans 6  29 because, in her 
view, the overall pattern of lending was now harmful for Mrs W and so these loans ought to 
not have been provided. 
Mrs Ws representative appeared to have agreed with the adjudicators findings. No further 
comments were provided. 
STF didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment. In response, it made a number of points 
including;
it doesnt believe it did anything wrong in the way that it dealt with Mrs W;
STF stuck to all relevant guidelines and regulations that fell within good industry 
practice at the time and
Since November 2018 STF has the ability to attach evidence of customers outgoings 
such as bank statements or utility bills. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
There doesnt appear to be any ongoing disagreement about the outcome the adjudicator 
reached about loans 1  5. So, I no longer think they are in dispute and so I wont be making 
a full finding on them. But what I would add, is that I dont disagree with what the adjudicator 
said, and I agree that STF checks needed to go further from loan 4. But I dont have enough 
evidence to uphold loans 4 and 5. 
Instead, this decision will focus on what happened when loans 6  29 were lent. But Ive kept 
in mind loans 1- 5 as they do form part of Mrs Ws lending history with STF. 
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs W could
repay her loans in a sustainable manner.These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might suggest STF should have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Mrs W. These factors include: 
Mrs W having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income); 
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mrs W having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period 
of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing 
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mrs W coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mrs W. The loan payments being 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.
At the time loans 6  29 were given, STF was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, 
which has set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) that payments are 
sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in particular, made on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to make them. If a 
lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make 
their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those 
repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mrs Ws complaint.
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 6 - 29 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. STF has been able to provide this Service with a copy of Mrs Ws 
application forms from loan 2. These application forms include details about the income and 
expenditure that Mrs W declared and what expenditure STF gathered from its credit checks 
(for the later loans).  
I would say, that based on the details in the application form and the later income and 
expenditure assessments, that STF couldve have reasonably concluded that Mrs W would 
be in a position to afford the repayments she was committed to making. 
But Id be inclined to agree with the adjudicator here, and I think that from loan 4, STFs 
checks really needed to go further. At this point in the lending relationship, I think STF ought 
to have been verifying Mrs Ws income and overall expenditure in order to have an accurate 
understanding of her actual financial position. Itss not clear from the applications forms that 
it did this. 
But whether the checks went far enough and showed STF these loans were affordable is 
only one part of what it needed to do. In addition to assessing the circumstances behind 
each individual loan provided to Mrs W, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during the course of its lending relationship with Mrs W. Having 
looked at the overall pattern of STFs lending history with Mrs W, I agree with our adjudicator 
that STF should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful, at the time it provided loan 6. I say this because;
At this point STF ought to have realised Mrs W was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Mrs W was returning for her sixth loan in 13 months. So STF ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mrs W was having to borrow further to cover 
an ongoing need and that Mrs Ws indebtedness was increasingly unsustainably. 
Mrs Ws capital borrowing hadnt shown any signs that it was significantly 
decreasing. In fact, the overall pattern was one of taking larger loans. This suggests 
to me that Mrs Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably, and she was likely 
needing further borrowing to cover ongoing living costs, rather than as a means to 
cover one-off purchases, for example. 
Mrs W had developed a pattern of taking new loans around the same time previous 
ones were repaid, for example, loans 4 and 6. And at times Mrs W had more than 
one loan running at the same time. This pattern continued throughout the lending 
relationship. So, STF ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs W, was 
having to borrow further to effectively cover a longer-term financial need. To me, this 
is also indicative of her indebtedness not being sustainable.
Mrs W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STF. Loan 29 was 
taken out over four years after Mrs Ws first loan. Loan 28 was also taken out on the 
same day, so at this time, Mrs W had £1,100 of principal to pay which is over five 
times as large as Mrs Ws first loan. Mrs W had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to STF over an extended period.
I think that Mrs W lost out when STF provided loans 6 - 29 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ws indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans and the time in debt was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mrs Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 - 29 and Ill go on to set out
what STF should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Mrs W from loan 6 as I think it ought to.
 
Clearly there are several possibilities, and all hypothetical answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs W may have simply left matters there 
and not tried to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and STF which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, 
she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even 
possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same isimpossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mrs W in a compliant 
way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Mrs W would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
STF shouldnt have given Mrs W loans 6 - 29.
A. STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs W towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party 
where applicable, but not including anything STF have already refunded.
B. STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs W 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs W originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. STF should pay Mrs W the total of A plus B.
D. The overall pattern of Mrs Ws borrowing for loans 6 - 29 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so STF should remove these loans entirely from 
Mrs Ws credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Mrs W 
a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mrs Ws complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 December 2021.
