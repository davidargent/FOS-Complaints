The complaint
Mrs W complains that Progressive Money Limited (PM) lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
PM approved a loan application for Mrs W in July 2018. The loan was for £10,000 over 60 
months wit monthly repayments of £347.80.
Mrs W says PM was wrong to lend to her because the loan wasnt affordable. PM didnt 
uphold the complaint, so Mrs W complained to this service.
I issued a provisional decision in which I explained why I wasnt upholding the complaint. I 
said that based on what Id seen, I was satisfied that PM had carried out reasonable and 
proportionate checks and that the lending decision was fair.
I invited both parties to let me have any further comments or arguments they wanted to 
raise.
Mrs W replied and made a number of points about her income. She also said she didnt think 
the checks PM had carried out were reasonable and that it should have been clear that the 
repayments werent affordable. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive carefully considered the further points Mrs W has made but this hasnt changed my 
decision. Based on what Ive seen, I still think the checks carried out by PM were reasonable 
and proportionate and that the lending decision was fair.
I dont think PM lent irresponsibly.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 February 2023.
