Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Gs complaint in part and thought loans 2-5 shouldnt have been 
given. Cash4unow  didnt agree. So the complaint was passed  to me, an ombudsman, to 
make a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Cash4unow needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Cash4unow should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN70856382I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Cash4unow was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator that there was nothing to indicate  Cash4unow  needed to do 
more when it approved  loan 1. This was the start of the lending relationship between the two 
parties. The repayments for the loan would  have seemed affordable based on what Mr G 
had told Cash4unow.  So I dont think at this stage,  Cash4unow  was wrong to give this first 
loan to Mr G.
However as our adjudicator explained, by the second loan it would have been clear that Mr 
G was showing signs that he was already struggling to repay his borrowing.
The first loan was to be repaid over 3 instalments. Mr G repaid the first instalment on time. 
But when Cash4unow tried to collect the second  instalment on 27th September  2017,  Mr Gs 
card payment declined.  Cash4unow then tried again to collect the payment a day later,  but 
the card payment was declined again. So at this point Mr G was an instalment in arrears.
Mr G then contacted Cash4unow a week before the third instalment was due to be taken. 
Cash4unow recorded what he told them, in its final response letter. It says You  informed us 
on 20.10.17 that you would be unable to make repayment as you had withdrawn funds to 
gamble and were  behind  with utility and other bills having  repaid  your rent. The third 
instalment was also not paid on time.  So at this point, Cash4unow would have been aware 
that Mr G had withdrawn funds to gamble, was struggling to repay his utility  and other  bills 
and was two instalments  in arrears with his first loan.
Mr G then repaid the full amount outstanding for loan 1 on 27th November 2017, a month 
after he had agreed to do so. He then came back only 5 days after repaying  the loan and 
asked for another that was for more  than the first loan and was to be repaid over a longer 
term.
So when Mr G took out and repaid his first loan, he had already missed his repayment dates 
on two occasions,  had taken an extra month to repay the loan and during this had informed 
Cash4unow that he was gambling  whilst  struggling to repay his bills. He then asked for a 
second loan only 5 days later for more, over a longer period.
When I consider all of these points together, it shows that there  was a significant risk that Mr 
G would be unable to meet  his repayments  for loan 2 because he was showing clear signs 
Ref: DRN70856383that he was struggling  to repay in a sustainable  way. So I think Cash4unow was wrong to 
approve loan 2 and all loans after this point.  
It follows that I dont think Cash4unow  should  have given loans 2-5. So Cash4unow should  
now put things  right. 
putting things right  what Cash4unow  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 2-5;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 2-5 from Mr Gs credit file
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Cash4unow to take off tax from this interest.  Cash4unow must 
give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. Novaloans  Ltd 
(trading as Cash4unow) should pay Mr G compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2020.
