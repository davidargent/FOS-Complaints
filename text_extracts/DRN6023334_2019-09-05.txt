K820x#14complaint
Mr L complains  that National Westminster Bank Plc delayed a faster  payment he made.  
background
Mr L set up a new faster payment on 9 May 2019.  Mr L wanted to make  a payment of £1,500 
but it was held by NatWests fraud  prevention system. On 10 May 2019  Mr L called  NatWest  
and confirmed the payment was genuine. NatWest  processed the payment and it was made 
the same  day. 
Mr L complained and explained  that he wanted to use the £1,500 to make  a credit card 
payment from another current account  he holds  elsewhere. Mr L said that the payment was 
due to be collected on 12 May 2019.  
NatWest responded  on 15 May 2019 but didnt agree it had made a mistake. NatWest said 
its fraud systems  picked  up the payment and held it because of genuine  concerns. In 
addition, NatWest said it tries to contact  account holders within 72 hours of its decision to 
hold a payment  but Mr L had got in touch before that time had passed. NatWest paid Mr L 
£50 and apologised but confirmed no error was made. 
Mr L referred his complaint to our service  and it was passed to an investigator. The 
investigator didnt  find that NatWest  had made  a mistake or treated Mr L unfairly so didnt 
ask it to take any further action to resolve  his complaint. Mr L asked to appeal  so his 
complaints been  passed to me to make  a decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Mr L feels NatWest hid his money  after he tried to make an important payment. 
In his response to the investigator, Mr L said hed made the same  payment before without a 
problem and that the timescale for NatWest to make  contact was too long. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Mr L but I dont agree NatWest tried to hide his money. NatWest has 
sent in systems evidence  to show the Faster  Payment  instruction was a new one that Mr L 
set up on 9 May 2019. NatWests fraud  systems picked up the new payment and held it for 
verification because it had concerns it might not have been  genuine.  Ive looked at what the 
account terms say about  making Faster Payments. 
The terms say it will normally process Faster Payments immediately but In limited 
circumstances (for example, if we suspect  fraud), the payment may take longer to reach the 
payees account.
So whilst I understand why it was important for the payment to be processed, I have  to 
balance that against NatWests obligation  to try and protect its customers against fraud. I 
also have to take into account  that NatWests terms say Faster Payments can take longer if 
there are concerns over fraud. In this case,  Im satisfied NatWest  has acted in line with the 
terms. I havent found it sought  to hide Mr Ls money. 
Ref: DRN60233342Mr L says hes made  these payments before without a problem but the evidence  Ive seen 
shows he set this Faster  Payment instruction up on 9 May 2019. Whilst Mr L may have 
made Faster  Payments before, on 9 May 2019  he asked NatWest to process a new payment 
instruction.  
NatWest says it normally contacts account  holders within 72 hours  of a payment being held 
to discuss whether its genuine. In this case, because  Mr L called NatWest before that 
timescale passed it was able to release his payment sooner. I understand Mr L feels  the 72 
hour timescale isnt acceptable. But I cant tell NatWest how long it has to deal with 
transactions that are held for additional  checks, thats not our role. And I note because Mr L 
called NatWest on 10 May 2019  he didnt have to wait that long for his payment to be 
released. 
Mr L has told us he needed  to ensure the funds  were in his other bank  account  before 
12 May 2019 to ensure an important direct  debit could be paid. The payment was released  
to Mr Ls account on 10 May 2019 so the funds should have been  available on 12 May 2019. 
Whilst NatWest  didnt  agree it had made  a mistake  it did pay Mr L £50 and apologised.  I 
havent found anything to show NatWest  made  an error by holding Mr Ls Faster  Payment. 
As a result, Im not telling  it to do anything else to resolve this complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 October  2019.
