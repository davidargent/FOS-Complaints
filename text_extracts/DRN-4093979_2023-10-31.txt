The complaint
Ms B complains that Allium Money Limited wont refund to her the money that she paid for a 
trial membership of a holiday club. Her partner is also involved in her complaint and shes 
being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Ms B and her partner entered into a trial membership agreement to buy a trial membership 
of a holiday club in September 2019. The purchase price of the trial membership was £4,395 
and Ms B also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a finance provider for a loan of 
that amount. She agreed to make 35 monthly repayments of £144.51 and a final payment of 
£144.19 to the finance provider.
Ms B contacted the finance provider in March 2020 to cancel her loan because she and her 
partner wouldnt be able to use the trial membership as a result of the restrictions imposed in 
response to the global pandemic. It said that Ms B was outside of the period in which the 
agreement could be cancelled and it confirmed that the holiday company would be extending 
the term of the trial membership period for six months because of those restrictions.
Ms Bs representative then made claims, on behalf of Ms B, to the finance provider under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in July 2020. It said that: the product 
was mis-sold and misrepresented to Ms B and her partner; the contract was breached; 
commission was paid between the finance provider and the holiday company which wasnt 
disclosed to Ms B which created a breach of fiduciary duty and caused an unfair relationship; 
and the loan was unaffordable.
The finance provider didnt uphold those claims. It said that Ms B had already made a 
complaint to it and, when she was told that she would be liable to continue with payments 
until the account was settled in full, she said that she was returning overseas and wouldnt 
be making the payments. It said that all customers attend a compliance interview with a 
compliance manager where every aspect of the purchase is explained to them prior to 
signing all of the documentation, the holiday companys resorts in the UK were open and 
available to reserve as were most of its resorts abroad, and the holiday company would 
continue to ensure that none of its members lost any of their trial membership entitlements 
because of the restrictions. It also said that there was no commission arrangement between 
it and the holiday company and it set out the holiday companys response to Ms Bs claims.
Ms B wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. Ms Bs 
complaint form says that the holiday company and the finance provider failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan; the finance provider paid a commission to 
the holiday company which wasnt declared to her and the holiday company unduly 
pressured her and her partner into entering into the trial membership agreement and her into 
entering into the loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement unfair pursuant to section 
140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Ms Bs complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that the finance providers decision to turn down her claims was unfair or unreasonable. 
She wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt 
think that the holiday company had breached the contract. She said that she hadnt seen 
enough to suggest that the relationship between Ms B and the finance provider was unfair 
and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was 
unfair. She also said that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending 
was unaffordable for Ms B.
Ms Bs representative, on behalf of Ms B, says that it doesnt agree with our investigators 
recommendation and would like the complaint to be referred to an ombudsman. It has raised 
concerns about the way that the finance was sold to Ms B and says that the holiday 
company didnt broker proper credit and failed to meet the standard of a regulated firm. It 
has referred to a decision issued by this service on a complaint about a different type of 
holiday ownership product in which it says the voluminous documentation for the product 
was reviewed and the debtor-creditor relationship was considered to be unfair. It says that 
the same voluminous documents and the same unfair charges exist in the product that was 
sold to Ms B and her partner so Ms Bs relationship with the finance provider is unfair. 
Ms Bs loan has now been transferred to Allium Money.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Ms Bs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Ms B and her partner entered into a trial membership agreement in September 2019 
to buy a trial membership of a holiday club which gave them the right to reserve up to 
five holiday weeks within the following three years;
the agreement included the conditions and Ms B and her partner signed other 
documents including a members declaration, a standard information form, a 
separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given, an exchange 
contract and loan applications, and Ms B received pre-contract credit information and 
a loan explanation document and signed the loan agreement;
the finance provider says that Ms B sent it an e-mail in March 2020 because she 
wanted to cancel her loan and that it had a phone conversation with her  it wrote to 
her in March 2020 and said that she was outside of the period in which the loan 
agreement could be cancelled and it confirmed that the holiday company would be 
extending the term of the trial membership period for six months because of the 
restrictions imposed in response to the global pandemic;
the loan agreement made clear that Ms B had the right to withdraw from it without 
giving any reason within 14 days but Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms B tried to 
withdraw from the loan agreement within the withdrawal period;
Ms B and her partner had signed the separate standard form of the withdrawal notice 
that could be given which made it clear that they could withdraw from the trial 
membership agreement within 14 days without giving any reason  but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that they tried to withdraw from that agreement within the 
withdrawal period;
the finance provider confirmed that the holiday company would be extending the term 
of the trial membership agreement for six months because of the restrictions imposed 
in response to the global pandemic and, in response to Ms Bs representatives July 
2020 letter, it said that the holiday companys resorts in the UK were open and available to reserve as were most of its resorts abroad, and the holiday company 
would continue to ensure that none of its members lost any of their trial membership 
entitlements because of the restrictions;
I dont consider that Ms B had the right to cancel the loan agreement when she 
contacted the finance provider in March 2020 and I consider that the six month 
extension of the trial membership period and the holiday companys assurance that 
its members wouldnt lose any of their entitlements was a fair and reasonable 
response to the restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic;
Ms Bs representative made claims to the finance provider in July 2020 and Ms B 
then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter refers to claims under 
sections 75 and 140A, including that the trial membership was misrepresented to 
Ms B and her partner, but her complaint form only refers to claims under section 
140A and doesnt refer to a misrepresentation made by the holiday company;
the July 2020 letter also says that Ms B and her partner had provided a 
comprehensive witness statement which it said was enclosed with that letter  but 
Ms Bs representative didnt include a witness statement with the copy of its letter 
that was sent to this service and Ive not seen a witness statement by Ms B and her 
partner;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Ms Bs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not the finance 
providers response to her claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Ms Bs representatives July 2020 letter says that the credits were misrepresented to 
Ms B and her partner because they were advised that: the package would enable 
them to use exclusive accommodation and to have cheaper holidays (and over the 
length of the contract they would save an amount in excess of the sum paid); and the 
product was of some substance and that the purchase would be an investment (as 
the product would increase in value and, after a period of a few years, they would be 
able to sell it at a considerable profit)  but it says that the product is worthless and 
has no merit;
the trial membership gave Ms B and her partner the right to reserve up to five holiday 
weeks within the following three years at the holiday club so I dont consider that the 
trial membership is worthless and I dont consider that it could properly be considered 
to be an investment;
neither Ms B nor her representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which Ms B and her partner were told that the trial membership 
would enable them to use exclusive accommodation and to have cheaper holidays, 
the conversations that took place at that time or the information that was provided to 
Ms B and her partner;
there was no reference in the letter that the finance provider sent to Ms B in March 
2020 to a complaint from Ms B about the trial membership having been 
misrepresented to Ms B and her partner and the finance provider says that all 
customers attend a compliance interview with a compliance manager where every 
aspect of the purchase is explained to them prior to signing all of the documentation;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented the trial membership to Ms B and her partner or that they were 
induced into entering into the trial membership agreement by any such 
misrepresentations;
the July 2020 letter also says that the holiday company has ceased to trade and has 
committed a repudiatory breach of contract but I understand that a new management 
company had been appointed and was able to provide the services under the trial 
membership agreement to Ms B and her partner;
I consider that the liquidation of the holiday company could be a breach of contract 
for which Allium Money might now be liable under section 75 - but I also consider the 
appointment of the new management company to have been a suitable remedy for 
any breach of contract, and Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms B and her 
partners use of their trial membership has been adversely impacted by the 
liquidation of the holiday company;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any other 
breach of contract by the holiday company for which Allium Money would now be 
liable under section 75;
the July 2020 letter says that commission was paid between the finance provider and 
the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Ms B which created a breach of 
fiduciary duty and caused an unfair relationship and Ms Bs complaint form says that 
the finance provider paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt 
declared to her;
the finance provider says that there was no commission arrangement between it and 
the holiday company and Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that any 
commission was paid by the finance provider to the holiday company;
the July 2020 letter also says that the loan was unaffordable for Ms B and her 
complaint form says that the holiday company and the finance provider failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan;
Ms B and her partner had completed loan applications in September 2019 and Ms B 
had stated that she had a gross annual income of £22,000 and a gross household 
income of £58,000;
the finance provider says that Ms Bs application was underwritten subject to its 
lending criteria at the time which would have included validation of information on the 
application form and a check against a number of databases, including credit 
reference agencies, before the decision was made to approve the lending;
Ms B had confirmed on the loan application that she was satisfied that the monthly 
repayment fitted her budget and was affordable over the life of the loan and the loan 
explanation document says: It is important that you only enter into this agreement if 
you can comfortably afford the payments, and are not aware of any potential 
changes in your circumstances that could affect your ability to make the payments in 
the future;
Ms B phoned the finance provider in March 2020 and it has provided a recording of 
that call  she said that she wanted to cancel the loan but there was no reference to 
the loan not being affordable for her and I dont consider that shes provided enough 
evidence about her financial situation in September 2019 to show that a three year 
loan with monthly repayments of £144.51 wasnt affordable for her at that time;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the finance provider 
should have done more to assess the affordability of the loan for her, that the loan 
was mis-sold to her or that the finance provider has acted incorrectly in connection with the loan;
I understand that Ms B stopped making the monthly loan repayments to the finance 
provider and she said that she was returning overseas - so her loan account is in 
arrears and it has now been transferred to Allium Money;
Ms Bs complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured her and her 
partner into entering into the trial membership agreement and her into entering into 
the loan agreement but if they had been unduly pressured into entering into the trial 
membership agreement and didnt want to buy the trial membership, I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted either the holiday company or 
the finance provider within the applicable withdrawal period to withdraw from the 
agreement;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms B said that she was unduly pressured into 
entering into the agreements when she contacted the finance provider in March 2020 
and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Ms B and her 
partner were unduly pressurised into entering into the trial membership agreement or 
that Ms B was unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the 
holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Ms Bs representative has referred to a decision issued by this service on a complaint 
relating to a different type of holiday ownership product in which it says the 
voluminous documentation for the product was reviewed and the debtor-creditor 
relationship was considered to be unfair  it says that the same voluminous 
documents and the same unfair charges exist in the product that was sold to Ms B 
and her partner so Ms Bs relationship with the finance provider is unfair;
that decision related to a holiday ownership product which was sold as an investment 
and related to a specified property  Ms B and her husband bought a trial 
membership of a holiday club which didnt relate to a specified property and which I 
dont consider was sold to them as an investment;
both products were often sold in similar ways and may have had similar contractual 
documentation but the operation and effect of the contractual documentation would 
be significantly different;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Ms Bs relationship with 
the finance provider was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Ms B and the finance provider 
in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Ms B for the issues that she and her partner have had with their 
trial membership but I consider that the finance providers responses to the claims 
that had been made to it were fair and reasonable in the circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Allium Money to refund to 
Ms B any of the money that shes paid under the loan agreement, to cancel the loan 
agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 November 2023.
