K821x#15complaint
Mrs H says S.D. Taylor Limited  trading  as Loans at Home (LAH) lent to her irresponsibly. 
She says that the loans were unaffordable  and she had real problems making  the 
repayments. She says LAH shouldve seen this and not continued to lend to her.

LAH has agreed that it shouldnt have approved loans  13 to 24. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mrs Hs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 6 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. LAH disagreed and so the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible  lending  including  all 
of the relevant rules, guidance  and good  industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that LAH needed  to take reasonable  steps  to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice,  this means it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make 
sure Mrs H could  repay her loans in a sustainable  manner. Additionally, there may come a 
point where the lending  history and pattern of lending itself clearly  demonstrates  that the 
lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances  of this particular  complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same  reasons.
Ive considered the pattern of lending up to loan 6 and I think  the lending history,  and in 
particular the amount  of time that Mrs H had been borrowing, clearly demonstrates that 
Ref: DRN72851952further lending  would  likely be unsustainable. So I think LAH was irresponsible to continue 
lending after this point.
LAH didnt raise any new issues in response  to the adjudicators  view.  And I dont have 
anything to add to what the adjudicator said. So I think  Mrs Hs complaint should be upheld 
from loan 6 onwards.  
putting things right  what LAH needs  to do
LAH shouldnt have  given Mrs H loans 6 to 24.
If LAH has sold the outstanding debts LAH should  buy these back if LAH is able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If LAH is not able to buy the debts back then LAH should  liaise  
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) LAH should add together the total of the repayments made  by Mrs H towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
LAH has already refunded.
B) LAH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs H 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs H originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) LAH should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance  on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mrs H as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mrs H having made 
overpayments then LAH should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. LAH should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B 
and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any principal LAH has 
already written-off.  If this results in a surplus then the surplus  should  be paid to Mrs H. 
However, if there is still an outstanding balance then LAH should try to agree an affordable  
repayment plan with Mrs H. LAH shouldnt pursue outstanding balances  made  up of principal 
LAH has already written-off.
E) The overall pattern  of Mrs Hs borrowing for loans 6 to 24 means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so LAH should remove these loans  entirely from Mrs Hs 
credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to deduct tax from this interest. LAH should give Mrs 
H a certificate showing how much tax LAH has deducted, if they ask for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Hs complaint. 
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things  right as set out above.
Ref: DRN72851953Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 October  2020.
