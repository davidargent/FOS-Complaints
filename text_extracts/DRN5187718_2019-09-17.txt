Mr C says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, irresponsibly lent to him. 
Mr Cs complaint has been brought to this service by a firm of solicitors. But for ease I shall 
refer below to all actions  being taken by Mr C.
background 
This complaint is about 15 short term loans Sunny provided to Mr C between 
January 2016  and September  2016. All the loans have been repaid except 
Loans 12, 13 and 15. The loans were repayable by six monthly instalments. Mr Cs lending  
history is as follows:

our adjudicators view
Our adjudicator recommended  that Mr Cs complaint should be upheld in part. She said that 
Loans 6 onwards shouldnt have been  given  to Mr C. 
Sunny agreed  with the adjudicators assessment. It offered to offset the redress  due (£60.30 
after the deduction of tax) against Mr Cs outstanding balance and then waive  the remaining 
balance. 
Mr C rejected Sunnys  offer.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr C 
and to Sunny on 7 August  2019.  I summarise my findings:
I explained that as Sunny had agreed the adjudicators  assessment with regard to Loans 6 
onwards, I wouldnt make  any findings about  those loans. But I would order Sunny to provide 
redress for those loans in my decision. 
Ref: DRN51877182I noted that when  Sunny  lent to Mr C the regulator  was the Financial  Conduct  Authority 
(FCA) and relevant regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit  Sourcebook  
(CONC). The CONC contained guidance for lenders about responsible lending. 
I said that Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this meant that it should have carried out proportionate  checks to make  sure Mr C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I thought  less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors included:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer had been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated  
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There might  even come a point where the lending  history  and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrated that the lending was unsustainable.
I thought it was important  to say that Sunny was required to establish whether  Mr C could 
sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation. 
I explained that the loan payments  being  affordable on this basis  might  be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it didnt automatically follow  this 
was the case.  This was because the CONC defined sustainable as being without undue  
difficulties and in particular the consumer  should be able to make repayments, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it followed that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wouldnt be able to make their repayments  sustainably  if they were unlikely to be 
able to make  their repayments without borrowing further. 
Id carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all meant for Mr Cs complaint.
Sunny had made a number of checks before it lent to Mr C. It had asked him for details of 
his income and expenditure. Mr Cs declared income was £1,035 for Loans 1 to 3 and 
£1,399 for Loans 4 and 5. Mr C declared  his expenditure as between  £525 and £625 for 
Loans 1 to 5. 
Sunny had also checked Mr Cs credit  file before agreeing to the loans. It had provided us 
with a summary of the results of its credit checks. It said that Mr C had no other short  term 
Ref: DRN51877183loans with other lenders. He wasnt bankrupt or in an individual  voluntary arrangement and it 
had been at least 28 months since  hed had a delinquent credit account.  Id not seen 
anything in the results  of Sunnys credit  checks that I thought  should  have caused Sunny 
additional concerns at the time of Loans 1 to 5.
Id seen Mr Cs credit report  and Id not seen anything in that at the time of Loans 1 to 5 
which I thought  should have caused  Sunny additional concerns  about Mr Cs financial 
situation or any apparent reliance on short term credit. 
Mr Cs highest monthly  loan repayment amount for Loan 1 was £76.70 and for Loan 2 it was 
£117.70. Loan 2 was still outstanding when Mr C took out Loan 3. Id noted that the highest 
total monthly repayment due for Loans 2 and 3 was £156.35. I thought  the repayments for 
Loans 1 to 3 were relatively modest compared  to Mr Cs declared  income.  
Given Mr Cs repayment amounts, what was apparent about his circumstances  at the time, 
and his history with the lender, I didnt  think it wouldve been proportionate  for Sunny to ask 
him for the amount of information that would have been needed  to show  Loans  1 to 3 were 
unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr C provided before Loans 1 to 3 or the 
information Sunny shouldve  been aware of, which meant it wouldve been  proportionate to 
start verifying what he was saying.  So I didnt think Sunny was wrong  to give Loans 1 to 3 to 
Mr C. 
Mr C took out Loan 4 whilst he was still repaying Loans 2 and 3. This meant that hed be 
repaying a highest  total monthly  loan repayment  of around £168. I thought Sunny might have 
been concerned  that Mr C was borrowing a third loan from it whilst two loans remained to be 
paid. But Id also noted that Loan  4 was for the amount of £50 and his total monthly  
repayments would have increased  by just less than £12. So I still didnt think  at that stage of 
its relationship with Mr C that Sunny had any reason to doubt  the information  hed provided,  
and I didnt think it was unreasonable for Sunny to rely on Mr Cs declared disposable 
income of around  £875. But as the total monthly  loan repayment for Loans 2, 3 and 4 was a 
relatively high proportion of Mr Cs disposable income, I thought  Sunny should have 
supplemented the information it held by asking Mr C some very specific  questions about  any 
other short term loans  he was already committed to repay.
Mr C had provided some information  about  his financial circumstances which  included  his 
credit report  and bank statements. Having looked at these, I couldnt see that Mr C had 
committed to repay any other  short term loans  at the same  time as Loan 4. So I couldnt  
safely say that if Sunny  had carried out proportionate checks before  Loan 4, it wouldve seen 
that Mr C couldnt  sustainably make the repayments  to Loan 4. So I didnt uphold his 
complaint about  this loan. 
Mr C took out Loan 5 just four days after hed repaid Loan 4 and whilst he was still repaying 
Loans 2 and 3. This meant  that hed be repaying total monthly loan repayments  of around 
£156 to £164 for four months.  I thought Sunny might again  have  been  concerned  that Mr C 
was borrowing a third loan from it whilst two loans remained to be paid. And as Loan  5 was 
Mr Cs fifth loan in less than three months, I thought Sunny should have been concerned that 
Mr C might have  been reliant on its lending.  And I didnt think  it was reasonable for Sunny to 
base its assessment before Loan  5 on the information provided by Mr C without taking steps 
to independently check what hed declared. So I thought it might  have been proportionate at 
that time for Sunny to have independently reviewed the true state of Mr Cs finances. This 
Ref: DRN51877184was to make  sure Mr C was in a position  to make  the repayments sustainably.  As far as I 
could see Sunny didnt do this. So I needed  to think about what  Sunny wouldve seen if it 
had carried out proportionate checks. 
And if Sunny had carried out proportionate checks before Loan 5, it would have seen, as I 
had seen from Mr Cs bank statements for the month before Loan 5, that Mr C had received 
only benefit income of around £442  a month.  So his loan repayments were  a significant 
proportion of his very low income and he was committing to making such  repayments on the 
three loans  for four months. I thought it would have been clear to Sunny that it was unlikely  
that Mr C would be able to repay any new borrowing in a sustainable  manner. So I didnt 
think Sunny  should  have  given Loan 5 to Mr C.
I note that Mr C in fact repaid Loan  5 later on the day that hed taken it out. And Sunny 
wouldnt have known  that at the time it gave  the loan to Mr C. But as Mr C repaid Loan 5 so 
early, there werent any interest or charges to be refunded or any adverse information  about 
the loan on Mr Cs credit file to be removed.  So whilst I intended to uphold Mr Cs complaint 
about Loan 5, I didnt  propose to award any compensation for it. 
Otherwise, I thought that Sunny needed to pay Mr C some  compensation which  it had 
already offered in relation to Loans 6 onwards. 
Subject to any further representations by Mr C or Sunny my provisional decision was that 
Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on Loans 6 to 11 and Loan  14 and pay 
interest of 8% simple  a year on the refunds  from the date they were paid to the date 
of settlement*;
with regard to Loans 12, 13 and 15, refund all the interest  and charges that Mr C had 
paid on these loans,  and pay 8% simple interest* a year on the refunds from the date 
of payment to the date of settlement;
write off any unpaid interest and charges from Loans 12, 13 and 15;
apply the refunds  referred to above to reduce any capital outstanding on Loans 12, 
13 and 15;  
remove all entries about  Loans 6 to 11 and 14 from Mr Cs credit file; and
remove all entries about  Loans 12, 13, 15 from Mr Cs credit file once theyd been 
repaid or written off. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must 
give Mr C a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. If Sunny 
intends to apply the refunds to reduce  any outstanding  capital balances,  it must do so 
after deducting the tax.
Sunny responded to my provisional decision by providing information about  the refund 
calculations which Id already seen prior to my provisional decision.
Mr C hasnt provided a response  to my provisional decision.
Ref: DRN51877185my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Given that Mr C and Sunny have  given me nothing  new to consider, I see no reason to 
depart from the conclusions I reached  in my provisional decision. It follows that I uphold  part 
of the complaint and require Sunny to pay Mr C some compensation as set out below.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part in relation to Loans 5 to 15. In full and final 
settlement of this complaint, I order Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading  as Sunny, 
to:
1.Refund all interest  and charges Mr C paid on Loans 6 to 11 and Loan 14 and pay 
interest of 8% simple  a year on the refunds  from the date they were paid to the 
date of settlement*;
2.With regard to Loans 12, 13 and 15, refund all the interest and charges that Mr C 
had paid on these  loans, and pay 8% simple  interest* a year on the refunds from 
the date of payment to the date of settlement;
3.Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  from Loans 12, 13 and 15;
4.Apply the refunds referred to above to reduce  any capital outstanding on 
Loans 12, 13 and 15;  
5.Remove all entries about Loans 6 to 11 and 14 from Mr Cs credit  file; and
6.Remove all entries about Loans 12, 13, 15 from Mr Cs credit file once theyve 
been repaid or written  off. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must 
give Mr C a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. If Sunny 
intends to apply the refunds to reduce  any outstanding  capital balances,  it must do so 
after deducting the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 October  2019.
