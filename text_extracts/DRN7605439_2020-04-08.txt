K821x#15complaint
Mr R complained about a number  of loans he took out through  a company called Elevate 
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr R says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
background
We now know that Mr R took out some  13 instalment loans from Sunny between April 2016  
and July 2017. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Rs borrowing with Sunny, based  on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
I issued a provisional decision (summary attached) in March  2020, comprehensively setting 
out why I thought the complaint should be partly  upheld, but from the point  of loan number 8 
rather than loan number  6.  And I asked both parties  to provide any further  submissions or 
information to me within one month. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  It seems neither party wants to send in 
any new information or arguments. So theres no reason for me to change  the findings  I set 
out in my provisional  decision. 
I therefore uphold  this complaint in respect of loans 8 -13, fully in line with my provisional 
decision.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr R paid on loans 8 - 13;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
the number of loans  taken from loan 8 onwards means any information recorded about  
them is adverse.  So all entries  about loans  8 - 13 should  be completely removed from 
Mr Rs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr R a certificate  
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I partly uphold this complaint  and I direct  Elevate Credit 
International Limited to pay Mr R the above compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I am required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 May 2020.

complaint
Mr R has complained about  a number  of loans he took out through a company called Elevate Credit 
International Limited, trading  at the time as Sunny. Mr R says he was lent to irresponsibly and the 
loans caused him financial  problems.
To keep things simple  Ill refer mainly  to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know  that Mr R took out some 13 instalment  loans from Sunny  between  April 2016 and July 
2017. Ive enclosed a summary  of Mr Rs borrowing with Sunny, based on the information  it provided 
to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  into the complaint and said they thought it should  be upheld from the 
point of loan number 6 onwards. Sunny  initially  said it didnt agree with this and that it hadnt done 
anything wrong. But later it made  an offer to settle the complaint which wasnt accepted by Mr R so 
the complaint has come  to me for an ombudsmans final decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  Ive 
followed this approach when  thinking about Mr Rs complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr R 
could repay  all the loans he was given  in a sustainable manner. These checks  ought to have taken 
into account  a range of different factors,  such as the amounts being lent, the total repayment amounts  
and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate. However,  certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should have 
fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting  that it could be more difficult to meet  a higher 
repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time during which a 
customer has been  given  loans  (reflecting  the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.  So, Sunny was required to establish whether Mr R 
could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether  the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.
Ref: DRN76054394Of course, the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr R could sustainably 
make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically  follow  that this is the case. This is because the 
relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular, the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments 
as well as without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. So, it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought to have fairly and reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if they are unlikely  to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks  before agreeing  to lend to Mr R. Ive 
thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending history with a view to seeing  if 
there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. Ive considered  whether, at some point,  Sunny should  have 
realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans. 
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ought  not to be 
upheld. Ive looked carefully at these and taken note of the loan amounts, which were relatively small, 
and Mr Rs declared income at the time. Ive also looked at what he said about  his monthly 
expenditure. With this information, and bearing in mind what  Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks, together with the income and expenditure  details provided by 
Mr R, would have made those particular  loans appear affordable. 
However, our adjudicator thought there was an emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of 
loan 6 onwards in this case which meant it was wrong to lend further to Mr R. I can certainly  see why 
our adjudicator used what is a common approach  we take when large  numbers of loans have ben 
granted over quite a short time period. But I think this particular case is unusual. I say this because, 
as Ive said, Mr R wasnt borrowing that much on most occasions and his income was relatively 
consistent and able to support the types of lending he was undertaking up to a point.
By loan 6, for example, its true to say Mr R had been taking out Sunny loans repeatedly for 5 months.  
But nearly  all were  for only £50 and the total amounts  he was being required to pay back  wasnt that 
high, even though the interest was. Mr R appeared also to be mainly paying the loans off quickly. In 
short, specifically looking  at the circumstances of this case, I dont think  Mr Rs borrowing was, as yet, 
in an unsustainable dimension at the point of loan 6. Although repeated and unsustainable  lending 
was indeed a feature of this case, I dont think it became so until loan number 8. Ill explain why.
Loans 5, 6 and 7 were  only for £50 and it wasnt until loan 8 that we can see the overlapping of loans 
re-emerging as a real issue. Loan 8 was taken out whilst loan 7 was outstanding  and by this point,  Mr 
R had been lent money on 8 occasions over just 7 months. For me, this is the point where  the lending  
looked different and therefore required a more  thorough  and responsible approach. 
At loan 8, the overall pattern  of Sunnys lending to Mr R should have caused it to see, in my view, that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans from this point onwards. Sunny ought  to have realised  
that Mr R wasnt merely  borrowing to deal with short-term cash-flow problems; he was borrowing very 
regularly, to meet an ongoing need. Mr R was having to consistently take out high interest,  short-term 
lending over a sustained period and the indebtedness  caused  by this type of borrowing was harmful,  
in my view.  Sunny should have seen this and ought  to have  realised Mr R was at risk of not managing  
to repay the loans sustainably  or getting  into financial  difficulties.  
So Im considering upholding this complaint in respect of loans 8 - 13. Sunny repeatedly  lent to Mr R 
in an unsustainable manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing him to take expensive 
credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended  time period;  and
the length of time over which  Mr R borrowed  was likely to have had negative implications on his 
ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these  high-cost loans
Ref: DRN76054395my provisional  decision
For the reasons  given,  Im intending to partly uphold Mr Rs complaint and direct 
Elevate Credit International Limited to put things right for Mr R as set out above.  
I now invite  either party  to send in anything else they want me to consider before 
6 April 2020, after which Ill issue a final decision.
