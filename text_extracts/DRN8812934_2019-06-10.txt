Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  my provisional  decision on 22 May 2019. A copy is attached  and forms 
part of this final decision. I explained why I was planning to uphold this complaint in part and 
asked both parties for their comments.  Both Mr H and QuickQuid responded with further 
points.
Mr H questioned why I hadnt found  loans 1-3 were  lent irresponsibly, as QuickQuid had 
previously made an offer in respect  of these loans. Mr H said that QuickQuid had accepted 
lending irresponsibly, so it should honour  its offer for these loans.
QuickQuid did not accept my provisional findings.  It said the checks  carried  out were  
adequate and proportionate to the type and amount of credit  provided. It also argued  that 
the pattern  of lending and Mr Hs repayment  history  wasnt indicative of him being in financial  
difficulty.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill start by addressing  the points Mr H raised about  QuickQuids offer. I had carefully  
considered QuickQuids response  to the adjudicator (including its offer) before reaching my 
provisional findings. QuickQuids offer had included refunding interest and charges  on loans 
1-3 and the interest and charges on the FlexCredit account from 28 September  2014 
onwards.
Ive reviewed QuickQuids  offer again and it does  not contain  an acceptance it did anything 
wrong. It did say it accepted the adjudicators figures  for Mr Hs income and expenditure 
suggested loans  1-3 were  unaffordable.  But theres no admission it shouldve  sought this 
information at the time it lent  its acceptance the loans may have been unaffordable  
appears to have been made in hindsight.
In respect of the FlexCredit,  QuickQuid outright rejected it had done anything wrong. It said: 
We cannot  agree that QuickQuid  failed  to adequately monitor  [Mr Hs] lending  history during 
the course of time in which each loan agreement was effective.
Ref: DRN88129342It ended its response by saying: in an effort to amicably resolve [Mr Hs]  we are willing 
to agree with your recommendations to refund interest and charges paid on the QuickQuid 
loans 1, 2, 3 and the Flex Credit loan (paid  from 28 September 2014 onward).
Taking into account everything  QuickQuid said, I think the offer was made as a gesture of 
goodwill. As that offer was rejected by Mr H, QuickQuid isnt bound  by it. So I looked at 
everything afresh in my provisional  decision  as I am allowed to when the parties have still 
not agreed a resolution.
In my provisional decision,  I didnt find that QuickQuid had actually  acted responsibly  when it 
approved loans 1-3 and the FlexCredit account. But at the same time, I thought 
proportionate checks at this stage wouldnt have  suggested these loans were unaffordable. 
The key paragraph  in relation to these loans said:
I dont think its likely  asking  Mr H further  questions about his expenditure wouldve 
suggested loans  1 to 4 were unaffordable at the time he applied  for them.  I dont think it 
wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask Mr H for proof of his income  and 
expenditure at this stage and I dont think its likely Mr H wouldve simply told QuickQuid that 
his living  expenses were  quite substantial. In saying this, I note that in July 2014 he told 
QuickQuid his housing  expenses were just £150 a month, that he had no other  credit  
commitments and that his total living expenses were only £325 a month. So I think  asking 
questions about  Mr Hs expenditure  would  still have led QuickQuid  to approve his loans  
and Im not therefore  planning to uphold the complaint about loans 1 to 3, or the initial 
decision to approve  loan 4 (the FlexCredit account).
I havent been given any reasons to change these  findings and so my decision not to uphold  
the complaint  about loans 1-3 or the initial  decision to approve the FlexCredit account 
remains unchanged.
I now turn to QuickQuids reasons for not agreeing with my provisional findings.
In respect of the FlexCredit  account, I am well aware that it is a different product from 
payday loans.  It is still a high-cost credit product however, and so isnt suitable for use as a 
long-term borrowing  solution. As I said in my provisional decision, Id still therefore expect to 
see Mr Hs borrowing reducing over time. I have already explained that this didnt happen  
and when and why QuickQuid ought to have taken action.
QuickQuids main response to this is that Mr H made his repayments on time,  so it had no 
reason to believe he was in any difficulty. But  as QuickQuid will be aware  this service 
doesnt accept  repaying a loan (or, on this case,  drawdowns) on time to means it was 
automatically repaid  sustainably. I explained  in my provisional decision that the way in which 
Mr H was using the account suggested  he was struggling to make his payments sustainably, 
without undue difficulty.
I appreciate QuickQuid doesnt  agree  with what Ive said but it hasnt really  said anything 
new in response  to my findings. So Im still partially  upholding  the complaint about  the 
FlexCredit account for the same reasons as given in my provisional decision.
In respect of the remaining  loans, QuickQuid said: the principal amounts borrowed 
fluctuated during Mr [Hs] time with QuickQuid which exhibited  a lack of financial 
dependency on our product
Ref: DRN88129343I dont think the pattern  of lending from loan 5 onwards demonstrates any significant  breaks,  
or that the amounts borrowed fluctuated so much  that QuickQuid couldnt reasonably have  
realised that Mr H was struggling to repay  the loans sustainably, or that he wasnt  
demonstrating a dependence on them. Mr H mostly continued to borrow  very large  sums 
relative to his income. So that the amounts occasionally fluctuated  doesnt  demonstrate  he 
had repaid the preceding  loans sustainably. He still continued to reborrow in a way that 
suggested a long-term  dependence on expensive short-term credit.  I explained in my 
provisional decision why I thought that caused  Mr H to lose out and QuickQuid hasnt said 
anything new on these  points.
The points QuickQuid  raised therefore  havent  changed my decision and Im upholding the 
complaint in part for the same reasons as given in my provisional decision.
putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  all interest and charges paid as a result of the drawdowns on the FlexCredit 
account on and after 28 September  2014
refund  all interest and charges paid on loans  5 to 14** (including top-ups)
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about the FlexCredit account from Mr Hs credit file;
delete all entries about  loans 5-14 from Mr Hs credit file.
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr H a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
**I understand  the balance of loan 14 was written  off, with Mr H having  repaid less than he borrowed.  
So it may be that QuickQuid  doesnt have  to refund anything for loan 14.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 July 2019.

complaint
Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC,  trading  as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
This complaint is about  13 payday  loans  and one FlexCredit agreement QuickQuid provided  to Mr H 
between May 2013 and December 2017. Information about these loans is attached as an appendix to 
this decision.
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Hs complaint  in respect of all of his loans, with the exception of the initial 
decision to approve the FlexCredit account. Although the adjudicator didnt  think QuickQuid was 
wrong to approve  the FlexCredit account, she thought  QuickQuid allowed 
Mr H to make too many  drawdowns and that it shouldve  intervened at some point. 
QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr H could repay the loans  
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being  without undue  
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting  
other reasonable  commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. (The 
Office of Fair Tradings guidance on irresponsible lending (ILG) provided  similar guidance for lenders 
and is relevant to some of the earlier  loans.) It follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought fairly  
and reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without borrowing  further. 
Ref: DRN88129345Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Ive first considered what  proportionate  checks for loans  1 to 4 would most  likely have shown. 
QuickQuid only asked  Mr H for information about his income and carried out credit checks. I dont 
think checks like these were  proportionate  in the circumstances of these loans. Mr H declared net 
income of £1,200 a month and the repayments for most of these  loans were  significant  in comparison 
to his income. In addition,  loan 4, the FlexCredit  account,  was a longer-term agreement  and so it was 
important to understand how Mr H would be able to manage it over the long term.  With this in mind, 
I think  QuickQuid ought to have asked  Mr H some questions  about  his expenditure  too  including  
checking the details of his other short-term  commitments  where appropriate.
Having said this, I dont think its likely asking  Mr H further questions  about his expenditure wouldve 
suggested loans 1to 4 were  unaffordable at the time he applied for them. I dont  think it wouldve been 
proportionate for QuickQuid  to ask Mr H for proof of his income and expenditure  at this stage and 
I dont think its likely  Mr H wouldve simply told QuickQuid that his living expenses were quite 
substantial. In saying this, I note that in July 2014 he told QuickQuid his housing  expenses  were  just 
£150 a month,  that he had no other credit commitments  and that his total living expenses  were only 
£325 a month.  So I think asking questions about Mr Hs expenditure  would still have led QuickQuid to 
approve his loans  and Im not therefore  planning  to uphold the complaint about loans 1 to 3, or the 
initial decision  to approve loan 4 (the FlexCredit  account).
As well as looking  at the decision to approve the FlexCredit account, Ive also looked at how Mr H 
used the account.
The account  ran from March 2014 to November 2015  about 20 months  with Mr H making around 
16 drawdowns totalling a little over £2,000. The first drawdown was on 31 March 2014 and the last 
drawdown was on 29 December 2014.  Its important  to note QuickQuid withdrew the FlexCredit 
account from all customers in December 2014, so Mr H wasnt able to make more drawdowns after 
this point.
The FlexCredit  account was a high-cost short-term credit product and so wasnt suitable for use over 
the long term. Mr H was able to repay the drawdowns  in up to ten monthly payments, so Id expect to 
see him reducing the balance of the account  over time and not consistently carry  a high balance.  But 
Mr Hs balance didnt reduce over time. By 25 April 2014 hed reached the credit limit and he stayed  
at the credit limit until September  2014. He then slightly reduced the balance, before making further 
withdrawals up until the point QuickQuid withdrew  the account from all its customers. The fact Mr H 
stopped making drawdowns only when QuickQuid withdrew the product suggests  it wasnt a choice 
made by Mr H.
Ive thought about whether QuickQuid shouldve  realised  Mr H wasnt likely to repay the borrowing  
within a reasonable period  of time if he kept using the account in the way he was. And I think 
QuickQuid shouldve  realised this when  Mr H requested the drawdown on 28 September  2014.  I say 
this because this was the third request in a row (in only a little over a month) which took Mr H up to 
his credit limit. So it was reasonably clear  Mr H wasnt likely to be only borrowing over the short-term 
 and that hed have to pay expensive rates of interest  to service the same debt over a long period of 
time. Its not likely  Mr H wouldve been doing this if he was manging  his repayments sustainably  and 
without undue  difficulty.
Im therefore  planning to say QuickQuid  shouldnt  have allowed the drawdown  on 28 September 
2014, or the subsequent drawdowns made by Mr H.
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of QuickQuids lending history with Mr H, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which it should reasonably  have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful.  And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further 
loans. 
Ref: DRN88129346Given the particular circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 5. I say 
this because:
by the time Mr H asked for loan 5, hed been borrowing from QuickQuid for more  than two 
and a half years, with no substantial break in the lending  (other  than that enforced by 
QuickQuid following  the withdrawal of the FlexCredit  account)  so Mr H wasnt using  high-
cost short-term credit  for its intended  purpose
the FlexCredit account alone ran for about 20 months  then Mr H asked for loan 5 just 14 
days after repaying the balance of the FlexCredit. So QuickQuid ought to have realised it was 
more likely  than not Mr H was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying  his previous  
loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
Mr H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid.  Loan 14 was taken 
out 55 months after Mr Hs first. And it was for a much larger  amount. Mr H had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to QuickQuid over an extended period
I think  that Mr H lost out because QuickQuid  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 4 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number of loans  was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Hs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im also planning to uphold  the complaint  about loans 5 and the subsequent loans.
putting things  right  what QuickQuid  needs  to do
I plan to tell QuickQuid  to:
refund all interest and charges paid as a result  of the drawdowns on the FlexCredit account  
on and after 28 September 2014
refund all interest and charges paid on loans 5 to 14 (including top-ups)
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about the FlexCredit  account from Mr Hs credit  file;
delete  all entries about loans 5-14 from Mr Hs credit file.
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr H a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
Im planning to uphold the complaint in part and to tell CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right by 
taking the steps set out above.
Ref: DRN88129347Appendix  loan table  and notes
Please note the end date information  for loan 14 has been amended since my provisional  decision. 
At the time the information was originally provided  there was an outstanding  balance on loan 14  but 
I understand that was later waived.
Mr Hs loans  were all payday loans  except for loan 4, which was an open-ended credit (oec)  facility  
called FlexCredit. The FlexCredit account allowed Mr H to make drawdowns up to a fixed  limit and 
repay those  drawdowns  in up to ten monthly  instalments.
Mr H topped-up  some  of his payday loans  meaning  he borrowed extra  funds during the course  of 
the loan agreement. The top-ups are denoted in the table with a letter  in the loan no. column.  Some  
figures in the table have been rounded to the nearest  pound.
