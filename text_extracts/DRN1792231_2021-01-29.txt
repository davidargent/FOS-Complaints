K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that Caledonian Consumer Finance  Limited wont refund to him the money 
that hes paid under a fixed sum loan agreement for an electricians training course. He also 
complains that the loan was unaffordable for him.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator  for these reasons:
Mr S signed a fixed sum loan agreement with Caledonian Consumer Finance in June 
2017 to pay for an electricians training  course   the cost of the course was £7,145 
and he made an advance payment of £50 so the loan was for £7,095, it was interest 
free and he agreed to make 43 monthly payments of £165;
he also signed a registration form for the course,  a credit application and an 
affordability assessment   but he says that he had no correspondence from the 
course provider and wasnt able to contact  it so hasnt been  able to complete the 
course, he was pressurised into signing up for the course  and that the course  was 
unaffordable for him;
he complained  to Caledonian Consumer Finance  and then to this service but our 
investigator didnt  consider that there had been a breach of contract  or 
misrepresentation by the course provider  as she had evidence  to show  that Mr S was 
provided with log-in details to access the course  materials and contact details for the 
course provider if he wasnt able to do so  and she didnt  consider  that the loan was 
unaffordable for Mr S;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit  Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against  the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been  a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ss complaint about  the course, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract  or misrepresentation  by the course  provider and 
that Caledonian Consumer Finances response to his claim under section 75 wasnt  
fair or reasonable   but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ss claim under 
section 75 as only a court  would be able to do that;
Mr S was sent an e-mail which provided  him with the log-in  details to access the 
course materials  he says that he didnt receive  the e-mail but it was sent to the     
e-mail address that hed provided and the course provider  says that Mr S contacted it 
in July 2017 - but Ive seen no evidence to show that he took any other action to 
access the course materials or to take or complete the course  until he contacted 
Caledonian Consumer  Finance about it in January 2019;
Ref: DRN17922312immediately above Mr Ss signature on the loan agreement it says: This is a Credit  
Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974.  Sign it only if you want  to be 
legally bound by its terms - he was paying  £165  each  month  under that agreement  
for the course and I consider that it would  be reasonable  to expect him to have done  
more to contact the course provider about the course;
Mr S also signed an affordability  assessment which showed that he had monthly 
income of £2,000  and expenditure of £600 so he had £1,400 available to pay for the 
course  he also signed  an affordability declaration on the credit application in which 
he confirmed that hed provided  a salary slip to the course advisor to verify his 
income and that he had £1,400 each month  available to pay for the course;
I consider that it was reasonable for Caledonian Consumer Finance to rely on that 
information and that it showed that the loan was affordable  for Mr S at the time that it 
was made to him - so Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show  that 
the loan was unaffordable  for Mr S at that time;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that he was unfairly  
pressurised into signing the documents, that the course or the loan agreement was 
mis-sold to him or that theres  been  a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
course provider;
Mr S has described the financial difficulties  that hes experiencing  and he has my 
sympathy for those  difficulties  but Im not persuaded  that theres enough  evidence  
to show that Caledonian Consumer Finance has responded to his complaint unfairly 
or unreasonably;  and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Caledonian Consumer  Finance to end the loan agreement,  to waive  any of the loan 
repayments due from Mr S, to refund to him any of the loan repayments  that hes 
made, to pay him any compensation  or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
I suggest that Mr S contacts Caledonian Consumer Finance about his financial difficulties 
and tries to agree an affordable repayment arrangement  with it. Its required to respond to 
any such financial difficulties positively and sympathetically.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint .
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2021.
