The complaint
Mr R complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay), trading as Marbles, irresponsibly granted him 
credit that he couldnt afford to repay. 
What happened
NewDay approved a credit card application for Mr R in April 2016. They initially provided a 
credit limit of £900 but the limit was increased in August 2016 to £1,800, January 2017 to 
£2,400, May 2017 to £3,650, and finally in October 2017 to £4,650.
Mr R says NewDay were wrong to provide credit as it wasnt affordable for him.
NewDay disagree. They say that when they approved the credit card application they 
reviewed Mr Rs credit file and found he had no arrears or defaults. They said there was only 
£2,900 of unsecured debt and two public records that didnt give them cause to consider the 
initial lending was unaffordable. And when NewDay increased the credit limit on the account 
they said that on each occasion they had reviewed Mr Rs account performance and his 
credit file and had also found the credit affordable.
Our investigator thought that NewDay shouldnt have provided the credit card in the first 
place and suggested NewDay should take some action to remedy the situation. But as 
NewDay didnt respond to her assessment the complaint has been referred to me, an 
ombudsman, for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to considering complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set 
out on our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Account opening
I think NewDay completed proportionate checks before approving the credit card. They 
reviewed Mr Rs credit file and gathered some information from him about his income and 
circumstances.
Those checks revealed that Mr R had two County Court Judgments against him 53 months 
earlier and still owed £9,200 towards those judgements. I think that information alone was 
sufficient to suggest that Mr R was unlikely to be able to sustainably afford the credit 
NewDay were offering and on that basis NewDay should have rejected the application.
The credit file also showed that Mr R was borrowing from pay day lenders at the time of his 
application and that would have been further corroboration that he was struggling financially, 
and the lending wasnt affordable.
The subsequent limit increases
As I dont think NewDay should have provided the card in the first place I think its unlikely 
the subsequent credit limit increases would have been affordable either. That credit simply 
added to Mr Rs indebtedness and Ive not seen evidence to suggest NewDay had 
information that Mr Rs financial circumstances had significantly and sustainably improved. 
So, I think those limit increases were also irresponsibly made and the additional credit was 
unaffordable for Mr R.
Putting things right
As I dont think NewDay ought to have opened the account, I dont think its fair for it to be 
able to charge any interest or charges under the credit agreement. But I think Mr R should 
pay back the amount he has borrowed. The system notes provided by NewDay suggest the 
account was closed in 2018. so, NewDay should:
Refund all interest, fees, charges, and insurances and add 8% simple interest per 
year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the date of settlement.
Remove any adverse information they may have reported to Mr Rs credit file in 
relation to this account.
*If HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. It 
must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if he asks for one. If it 
intends to apply the refund to reduce an outstanding balance, it must do so after deducting 
the tax.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to put things right in the manner set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 September 2022.
