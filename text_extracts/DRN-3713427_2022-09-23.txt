There is limited information about the first four loans Mrs C says she received. This is not 
unusual due to the time that has passed since the loans were granted, and Morses Club 
acquiring the loans that were issued by Shopacheck (loans 1-3). Loan 4 did appear to have 
been issued by Morses but upon asking for information our adjudicator was told there was 
none to send. Mrs C has not been able to send us anything about loans 1 to 4 and so our 
adjudicator could not formulate a view on those. 
After Mrs Cs representative had referred her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service then one of our adjudicators looked at the loans about which she had information  
loans 5 to 9  and did not think that Morses had done anything wrong.
Mrs C has responded to that outcome to say that she thinks that a non-uphold outcome is 
not justified for all the loans  in other words, she thinks some should be upheld. But Mrs C 
has not explained which or given details of why she thinks this. No additional information or 
details about her financial position had been sent to us by Mrs C before our adjudicator 
came to her view or since. So, Mrs C has sent to us nothing as supporting evidence. 
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Morses had to assess the lending to check if Mrs C could afford to pay back the amounts 
shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Morses checks couldve considered a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and 
Mrs Cs income and expenditure. 
I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been 
proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done more to establish 
that any lending was sustainable for Mrs C. These factors include:
Mrs C having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mrs C having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mrs C coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mrs C. Our adjudicator thought that this 
was the case for Mrs Cs complaint at loan 4.
Morses was required to establish whether Mrs C could sustainably repay the loans  not just 
whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mrs C was able to repay her 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without 
having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, 
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it 
follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mrs Cs complaint.
As I have no information at all about loans 1 to 4, over and above the loan table set out at 
the beginning of this decision, then I am not able to make any findings about those loans. 
Using the information Morses has sent to us, I have seen that Mrs C declared her income 
and her expenditure for each of the five loans about which I can review  loans 5 to 9. For 
each Mrs Cs weekly income appears to have been between £300 and £500 a week. And 
Mrs C had told Morses that her expenditure (including rent and other items) was between 
£155 and £263.
Morses carried out a credit search and it has explained that it always does that for the first 
loan  here loan 5  and after that it relies on past repayment performance and other 
information it gathers from the customer. So, I have reviewed the credit search results dated 
31 August 2017. 
Mrs C had only three SHARE records which would have been considered a low number. She did have a record of a County Court Judgment against her name but that had been on 
1 July 2013 so over 4 years before loan 5 was applied for. And the record indicates it was for 
£606 and so that was not an overly large sum.
The total value on all her active credit accounts was £1,475. And it had been 24 months 
since she had opened her most recent account. 
Overall, I do not consider that Morses likely would have viewed this as a set of results to 
cause it concern. I consider that Morses carried out checks which were proportionate. I have 
no additional or supporting information from Mrs C. So, on the information I have I do not 
uphold her complaint about loans 5 to 9. As I said earlier, I make no findings in relation to 
loans 1 to 4. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mrs Cs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 October 2022.
