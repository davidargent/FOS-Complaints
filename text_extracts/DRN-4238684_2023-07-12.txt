The complaint
Mrs R complains about Metro Bank PLC.
She says that Metro didnt do enough to protect her when she became the victim of a scam
and would like Metro to refund her the money she has lost.
What happened
Mrs R was introduced to C by a friend who had recently started investing with C and was
happy with the service it was providing.
Having been through a significant life event, Mrs R was keen to maximise her savings. C
then contacted Mrs R and persuaded her to invest with it. Initially Mrs R was impressed with
the seemingly professional nature of C and could see through her online portal that the
money she was paying was being invested in gold and purchased by cryptocurrency.
However, this was not the case  the funds had been used to purchase crypto only and the
online portal was fake.
Mrs R was then pressured to pay in further funds when her supposed profits started
decreasing, which C blamed on the Covid-19 Pandemic. C kept pressuring her to pay more
money.
Mrs R then realised that C was a scammer  and the friend that introduced her to C
confirmed that they had also fallen victim to the scam.
Mrs R was in denial for a while and suffered depression after losing so much money, but
then reported the scam to Metro through a third party and raised a complaint.
Metro didnt uphold her complaint, so she brough it to this Service.
Our Investigator considered the complaint, and thought that it should be upheld in part, but
that Mrs R should also be liable for some of the loss.
I have previously issued a provisional decision on Mrs Rs complaint, where I explained that 
while I was minded to also uphold Mrs Rs complaint, I also did not feel that the deduction in 
award was appropriate. 
Mrs R accepted my provisional decision, but Metro did not. It said that it would be willing to 
now accept our Investigators view to brig the complaint to a close. It also provided further 
comments for me to consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part, and make no changes to my 
provisional decision, although I will comment on what Metro has said.
Was Mrs R the victim of a scam?
It isnt in dispute here that Mrs R was the victim of a scam. Mrs R was mis-led by the 
scammer into what she was investing in and was pressured to pay more money to reach 
certain levels before she could access her supposed profits. C has now had a warning 
placed on it on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) register.
Mrs R made the following payments as part of the scam.

Did Mrs R authorise the payments?
In line with the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (PSRs), Mrs R isnt liable for payments 
she didnt authorise, unless she failed with gross negligence or intent to comply with the 
terms of the account or keep her personalised security details safe.
Im satisfied that Mrs R did authorise the payments in question  they were made using her 
own bank card and she responded to a text sent to her by Metro that it was her making the 
payments.
I understand Mrs R had been tricked into instructing Metro to make the payments  but while 
Mrs R never intended the payments to go to the scammers, this doesnt change the fact she 
authorised them and is therefore presumed liable for the loss in the first instance.
I understand that Metro have stated that under reg 74 of the PSRs and set out in its current 
account Terms and Conditions, it is unable to investigate transactions that took place more 
than 13 months ago. But the PSRs only apply to unauthorised transactions  and these 
payments were authorised, so this doesnt apply.
Recovery of Mrs Rs payments
After Mrs R made the payments, I wouldnt expect Metro to do anything further until it was 
notified of the scam.
The only recourse for potential recovery of the funds for the payments made by debit card 
would be via the chargeback scheme. Chargeback is a process by which disputes are 
resolved between card issuers (here, Metro) and the merchant (here, X).
However, a chargeback in these circumstances would unlikely have been successful as 
Mrs R didnt report the scam until after the timescales usually allowed for a chargeback claim 
had already passed.
Should Metro have reasonably prevented the payments in the first place?
I can only uphold this complaint if I think that Metro reasonably ought to have prevented 
some or all the payments Mrs R made in the first place  therefore preventing the loss 
before it happened.Mrs R authorised the scam payments in question here  so as Ive explained above, she is 
presumed liable for the loss in the first instance.
That said, as a matter of good industry practice, Metro should have taken proactive steps to 
identify and help prevent transactions  particularly unusual or uncharacteristic transactions 
 that could involve fraud or be the result of a scam. However, there is a balance to be 
struck: banks had (and have) obligations to be alert to fraud and scams and to act in their 
customers best interests, but they cant reasonably be involved in every transaction.
Taking into account the law, regulatory rules and guidance, relevant codes of practice and 
what I consider having been good industry practice at the time, I consider Metro should fairly 
and reasonably:
Been monitoring accounts  including payments made and received  to counter 
various risks including anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism 
and preventing fraud and scams;
Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that 
might indicate its customers were at risk of fraud (amongst other things). This is 
particularly so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, 
which banks are generally more familiar with than the average customer; and
In some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken 
additional steps, or made additional checks, before processing a payment, or in 
some cases declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect customers from 
the possibility of financial harm from fraud.
This leads me to consider the payments that Mrs R made  and if Metro should have 
intervened.
The first two payments
Im not persuaded that Metro should have intervened on the first two payments that Mrs R 
made  while they were higher than her usual day to day spending, but Mrs R did 
periodically make higher value payments, so they were not so uncharacteristic or unusual to 
have triggered a response from Metro at this time.
Payment three
By the time payment three was made, Mrs Rs total spend for the day was now £10,225.46  
all going to a crypto exchange. This was unusual behaviour for Mrs R  and should have 
alerted Metro to check if everything was as it should be.
I understand that Metro says that as Mrs R is a private banking customer that the timeframe 
and transactions made were not unusual  but I disagree. Just because someone is a 
private banking customer does not necessarily mean that they will make high value 
transactions in a short space of time  and having looked at Mrs Rs statements, it appears 
that they are unusual for her normal spending behaviour. 
I consider that Metro should have contacted Mrs R, and I would have expected it to have 
questioned her about the payment  including what the payment was for, and the 
surrounding context  and to proceed accordingly. The intention being to disrupt or uncover 
a potential fraud or scam.
Ive seen nothing to suggest that Mrs R had been coached, or told to lie about the payments she was making  so I think that had Metro acted as I wouldve expected, it would quickly 
have uncovered what was going on.
I understand that Metro sent Mrs R a text message on 29 January 2020 (the day the 
payments were made, although not when they debited the account). And that she spoke with 
it on the phone to confirm the transactions were genuine  but Metro hasnt provided me with 
a copy of the call that it says took place, or any notes from the time. So, I cant say that it did 
give Mrs R a meaningful warning or acted as I would have expected. A text message to 
confirm a payment is genuine does not go far enough.
Metro has provided me with a later call where Mrs R questions if the payments had now 
gone through and mentioned that they were going to a crypto seller, and that she wanted to 
make more payments  this was again an ideal opportunity for Metro to intervene  although 
later than I would normally expect. But Metro didnt pick up on this either and told Mrs R that 
she could pay up to £20,000 in one day by card.
Had Metro warned Mrs R appropriately, I dont think that Mrs R wouldve continued with 
payment three and the loss couldve been prevented from this point, and I think Metro 
missed an opportunity to intervene.
Should Mrs R bear some responsibility for the loss?
While I do think that Metro should have prevented the third payment I do also need to 
consider if Mrs R should bear some responsibility for the loss by way of contributory 
negligence.
I understand that our Investigator thought that Mrs R should bear some responsibility as she 
said she checked the FCA register, and found no warning about C. But I disagree.
Mrs R wasnt an experienced person here  whereas Metro was the expert and had more 
knowledge on the intricacies of these types of scams. She had been given convincing 
literature from C in an attempt to prove its supposed legitimacy, signed a contract and 
provided identification documents similar to what you would expect from a legitimate 
company. The promise of rate of return was also not so outlandish at between 5-10% per 
annum to have been unbelievable for an investment product.
Cs website was also professional looking and provided fake details of its supposed 
credentials including regulation. And while Mrs R said that she checked the FCA website to 
determine if there were any warnings about the company, she hasnt said she checked to 
see if it was registered  this is an important distinction as I wouldnt necessarily expect Mrs  
as a lay person to understand what she was supposed to be looking for. There were also no 
other warnings about C that I could find online from the time that Mrs R was scammed into 
making the payments, so even if she had done further research, I dont think that she would 
have found anything to have caused her alarm.
Metro said in response to my provisional decision that Mrs R would have seen that C was 
not regulated, so she should have known that there was a risk, and that the document Mrs R 
signed with C stated that she could not make a withdrawal until her account balance reached 
$400,000 this should have been a further read flag. But as Ive explained above, Mrs R 
checked the FCA website for warnings, and was not an experienced investor. Again, Metro 
was the expert, not Mrs R. So the points Metro has raised dont change my decision. 
Putting things right
Metro Bank PLC should refund Mrs R from payment three onwards.I calculate this to be £164,566.57.
On top of this, Metro Bank PLC should also pay Mrs R the rate of interest on her savings
account where the funds originally came from on this amount, from the date the payments
were made until date of payment to Mrs R (less any lawfully deductible tax).
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part. Metro Bank PLC should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 August 2023.
