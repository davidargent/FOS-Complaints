The complaint
Mr M is unhappy with the service hes received from PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA
surrounding his request to reset the password on his PayPal account.
What happened
Mr M contacted PayPal via their online chat feature to request a password reset on one of
his PayPal accounts. Mr M waited several hours for a response from PayPal, who eventually
did send him a link by email to allow the account password to be reset. However, the link
PayPal sent was for Mr Ms other PayPal account, and not for the account that Mr M had
advised PayPal he wanted to reset. Further email links were sent by PayPal to Mr M, but
there were also for his other PayPal account.
Mr M wasnt happy that he continued to be unable to access his PayPal account, and he
wasnt happy that hed had to spend many hours over a period of several days trying to
resolve this issue, including being promised phone calls by PayPal that he never received.
So, he raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr Ms complaint. They responded to Mr M explaining why his account had
been restricted. However, this didnt address Mr Ms complaint about the issues surrounding
PayPal not being able to help him reset his password, and the account had only been
restricted because Mr M was unable to login to it when hed tried to.
Mr M wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that Mr M had been
inconvenienced and frustrated by the poor standard of customer service that hes received,
and so they upheld Mr Ms complaint on that basis and recommended that PayPal make a
payment of £100 to Mr M, in addition to any compensation that had already been paid, to
compensate Mr M for what had taken place.
PayPal didnt agree with the recommendation put forwards by our investigator, so the matter
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 19 May 2022 as follows:
Its clear to me that the standard of service that Mr M received from PayPal
when he contacted them to ask for the password on his PayPal account to be reset 
fell short of the standard that Mr M should be entitled to expect. And Im satisfied that 
Mr M did incur consideration frustration and inconvenience because of this.
One reason I say this is because Mr M had to wait over seven hours for his first chat
message to PayPal to be responded to, and when it was responded to, and Mr M 
was sent a link to reset his password, this link took him to another account that he 
held which wasnt the account that he was looking to reset. Additionally, PayPal then 
sent Mr M further links to the wrong account on several other occasions, and also 
closed Mr Ms chats with them before the issue was resolved, meaning that Mr M had 
to restart the process from the beginning in order to try to make progress.
Furthermore, its evident from the copies of the chats that Mr M has provided to this 
service that he was promised phone calls from PayPal to help him resolve the issue, 
but that these calls were never received. And its very clear from these chats that Mr 
M grew increasingly and understandably more and more frustrated.
All of which means that my provisional decision here is that I will be upholding this 
complaint on the basis of the poor service that Mr M received as partially described 
above.
I note that our investigator recommended that PayPal should make a payment of 
£100 to Mr M, above and beyond any compensation that PayPal may have already 
paid to him, to compensate Mr M for what has happened here. However, given the 
considerable upset and frustration Im satisfied that Mr M has incurred here, I dont 
feel that £100 provides sufficient compensation in this instance, and as such my 
provisional instructions to PayPal are that they must make a payment of £200 to Mr 
M which I feel provides a fairer level of compensation for what has taken place. This 
£200 payment must be in addition to any previous payments of compensation that 
PayPal may have already made to Mr M.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr M and PayPal the opportunity to provide any 
comments or new information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a final 
decision. 
In response, Mr M explained that he felt a higher amount of compensation than the £200 I 
had provisionally instructed is warranted in this instance and referenced a day rate that he 
earns in his employment. I can appreciate Mr Ms position here, but this service doesnt take 
a complainants employment day rate into account, and this because its the position of this 
service that no one persons time is any more or less valuable than any other persons time. 
Instead, this service arrives at what we feel are fair compensation amounts by considering 
the full circumstances of the complaint and within the framework of how we decide on 
compensation amounts for any inconvenience and upset a person may have incurred. 
Further details regarding this framework can found on the Financial Ombudsman Service 
website and working within that framework I can confirm that I continue to feel that £200 is a 
fair compensation amount in this instance.
Mr M has also requested that PayPal allow him access to the money he holds in his PayPal 
account. This point was addressed by our investigator in their view of this complaint, and Id 
like to apologise to both Mr M and PayPal for not addressing it in my provisional decision. 
However, my position on this point is essentially the same as outlined by our investigator.
PayPal have explained that a temporary limitation was placed on Mr Ms account and that 
there are steps that Mr M needs to complete before that limitation will be lifted. This doesnt 
seem unreasonable to me, and Im satisfied that PayPal have acted within the terms of the 
account when applying that limitation. As such, I can only refer Mr M to PayPal to discuss 
the steps he needs to take before the limitation on his account can be lifted.Finally, PayPal also responded to my provisional decision and maintained that they feel that 
this complaint shouldnt be upheld in Mr Ms favour. PayPal explained that they didnt feel 
that they should be considered as being at fault for Mr M not being able to remember his 
account password.
PayPals position here seems misplaced to me, as this complaint isnt about the fact that Mr 
M forgot his password, but rather is about the service that Mr M received from PayPal when 
requesting that his password be reset. And I continue to be satisfied both that the service 
that Mr M did receive from PayPal in that regard fell below the standard which he should 
reasonably be entitled to expect, and that PayPal should compensate Mr M for this. 
All of which means that I continue to feel that a fair and reasonable resolution to this 
complaint is that PayPal should make a payment of £200 compensation to Mr M, and I can 
confirm that my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in Mr Ms favour on that basis 
accordingly.
Putting things right
PayPal must make a payment of £200 to Mr M which I feel provides a fair level of 
compensation for what has taken place here. This £200 payment must be in addition to any
previous payments of compensation that PayPal may have already made to Mr M.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie
SCA on the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2022.
