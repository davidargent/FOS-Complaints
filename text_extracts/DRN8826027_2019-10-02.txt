K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that DJS (UK) Limited  (trading as PiggyBank) failed to carry out effective 
affordability checks before lending  to him, causing him to become stuck in a cycle of 
borrowing. He says that the lending  was irresponsible.

In the final response  letter  PiggyBank explained  that as well as these approved loans it 
refused three applications by him. But I do not know when those were.  And it made an offer 
for Loans 4, 7, 8, 19 and 20.
 
Mr M says Piggybank should  have realised that he had become dependent  on short-term 
loans by considering his borrowing history  and doing better  affordability  checks.  He says 
Piggybanks lending actually made his situation  worse and it should  have advised him to 
seek debt management  advice.
Piggybank says it asked  Mr M for information  about his income and expenditure and 
factored in additional details about  his credit  commitments that it found in his credit file. It 
said Mr Ms disposable income was calculated to be between  £1,700  and £2,700 for the 
duration of the lending  period.
Ref: DRN88260272One of our adjudicators looked  at this complaint and thought that PiggyBank  should put 
things right for Mr M in relation to Loans 9 to 18 in addition to the loans on which PiggyBank 
had made  offers. 
No additional  points have been received  from Mr M and so I think  that he has no issue with 
the loans which our adjudicator did not think had to be put right (Loans 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6) so 
I do not plan to review  them. 
PiggyBank has made no comments  and has not sent any additional points to us. So I plan to 
consider this complaint relatively  briefly.
The complaint remains unresolved and has been  passed to me for a decision. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner 
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key element was that any checks needed  to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being  
borrowed was due to be repaid. 
By Loan 9 PiggyBank  ought to have  been carrying out a full financial review of Mr Ms 
situation before approving any loans. I say this because it had been  lending to him 
continuously for over a year and the amounts he was asking  for were increasing, on the 
whole, and Mr M was not showing  any signs of getting on top of his finances. 
Having considered the information PiggyBank had in relation to each of the loans from 
Loan 9, and having considered the bank statements and credit file (dated 12 October 2017) 
received from Mr M then I agree with the findings of our adjudicator.  
Proportionate checks would have revealed  high unsecured loan balances, relatively regular 
use of payday  lenders  since 2014 and possibly earlier, ever increasing requests from 
PiggyBank, and for Loans 17 and 18 Mr M chose  to roll the loans over. All point to a 
dependency on credit.
As our adjudicator explained, the bank statement scrutiny revealed that Mr M was a regular 
gambler and so these facts would have  given an overall picture with which a responsible 
lender was unlikely to consider lending to Mr M. 
Including the loans on which PiggyBank has made offers, I uphold  Mr Ms complaint in 
relation to Loans 4 and 7 to 20. 
Ref: DRN88260273putting things right
Because PiggyBank  should not have given  Mr M the loans he took, its not right that Mr M 
should have to pay interest  or charges on these, or have them affect his credit file in a 
negative way. Then I think it should do as follows:
refund  any interest and charges  already  paid by Mr M in respect of Loans  4 
and Loans 7 to 20; and     
apply 8% simple interest  per year to any interest  and charges refunded from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse payment information  about  the loans and credit  account from 
Mr Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Piggybank to take off tax from this interest.  Piggybank 
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and direct that DJS (UK) Limited 
(trading as Piggybank)  put things right in the way I have said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 November 2019.
