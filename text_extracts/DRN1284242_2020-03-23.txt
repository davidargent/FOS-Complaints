K821x#15complaint
Mr S has complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called  Elevate  
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr S says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mr S took out some 16 loans from Sunny between December 2016 and 
August 2018.  Ive enclosed a summary  of Mr Ss borrowing with Sunny, based  on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  6 onwards. Sunny  initially said it hadnt  done anything wrong. 
However, it then made an offer to settle  the complaint which Mr S didnt  accept, so the 
complaint has come  to me for an ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Ss 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr S could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable  manner.  These checks  ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
Ref: DRN12842422whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr S could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr S. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of lending history with 
a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Ive looked carefully  at loans 1  3. Bearing in mind  what Ive said above about  the length  of 
the lending relationship, I think  the checks which Sunny most likely carried out appear to 
have been proportionate  for these and I think  the levels of checks, together  with the income  
and expenditure  details  provided by Mr S, would have made those particular  loans appear  
affordable. Looking at the lending after that, I think that by loans 4 and 5, the checks Sunny 
should have carried  out ought  to have been more comprehensive. But I dont actually think 
this would have  changed whether or not he was given either  of these 2 loans because even 
with better  financial checking,  these would  both have still looked affordable from Sunnys 
point of view.
However, I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of loan 6 onwards 
would have looked different and therefore  required a much more thorough and responsible  
approach. By this point, the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending to Mr S should have caused it 
to see, in my view,  that it shouldnt have  provided any further loans. This is because  this was 
Mr Ss sixth short-term loan application with Sunny in just under  6 months. And in common  
with some of his borrowing pattern thus far, he was asking to borrow from Sunny whilst other 
borrowing still remained outstanding.  
So Sunny ought to have  realised that Mr S wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term 
cash-flow problems; he was borrowing very regularly,  to address shortfalls in his income  and 
to meet  an ongoing  need. Mr S was having to consistently take out high interest, short-term 
lending, as of loan 6 onwards, over a sustained period and the indebtedness  caused by this 
type of borrowing was harmful, in my view. Sunny should have seen this and ought to have  
realised Mr S was at risk of not managing to repay the loans sustainably or getting into 
financial difficulties. 
So Im upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 6 - 16. Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr S in 
an unsustainable manner  because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
Ref: DRN12842423the length of time over which Mr S borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 6 - 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 16 should be completely 
removed from Mr Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr S a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Ss complaint. Elevate Credit  International Limited  
should put things right for Mr S as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 April 2020.
