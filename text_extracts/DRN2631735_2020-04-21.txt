K821x#15complaint
Mr R says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading as Sunny - irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 29 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr R between  April 2018 and 
March 2019. Mr Rs borrowing history  is outlined at the end of this decision. 
In its submissions to us, Sunny offered to uphold Mr Rs complaint  about loans 11 to 29. But 
in our most recent assessment, the adjudicator didnt think Sunnys offer had gone far 
enough. They thought the loans from loan 7 onwards shouldnt have been  given because  
the overall pattern of Mr Rs borrowing indicated he was reliant on these loans and the 
borrowing was becoming unsustainable. Sunny disagreed and said Mr Rs behaviour  didnt 
indicate he was struggling financially, and his disposable  income  was enough  to repay  the 
loans. It also said Mr R repaid loan 7 early  which  Sunny said didnt fit with Mr R being in 
financial difficulty. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much  was being lent, the 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN26317352I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint. Having done  so, I am partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Rs complaint  about loans 1 to 6. Mr R hasnt provided any 
further evidence  or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because  they no longer appear  to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr R, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Rs case, like the adjudicator,  I think  that this point was 
reached by loan 7. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr R was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr R had taken out seven loans in four months. So, it should  have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr R was having to borrow further  to cover the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Rs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
The fact Mr R repaid his loans much  earlier  than planned should  have caused some 
concern to Sunny. As that might  be the sort of behaviour that would indicate 
someone was facing problems managing their money and needing to refinance loans 
on a regular basis
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr R was provided  with new loans in rapid  succession.  For 
example, loan 8 was taken out four days after loan 7, loan 9 three weeks  after that. 
And loan 10 was taken  less than two weeks after loan 9 had been taken. In the 
space of a month Mr R had borrowed £450. 
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  29 was 
taken out 11 months after Mr Rs first. Mr R had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
Ref: DRN26317353These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr R borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Rs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Rs complaint about  loan 7 onwards. 
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts Sunny should buy these back  if Sunny is able to do 
so and then take the following steps.  If Sunny cant buy the debts back, then Sunny should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
A) Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made by Mr R towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by 
Mr R which  were considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mr R originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should  remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr R as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr R having made 
overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Mr R. However,  if there  is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr R. Sunny shouldnt 
pursue outstanding balances made  up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
E) The overall pattern  of Mr Rs borrowing for loans 7 to 29 means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse, so Sunny  should  remove these loans entirely from Mr Rs credit  file if 
it hasnt done  so already. Sunny does not have  to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Rs 
credit file until these have been  repaid, but Sunny should still remove any adverse  
information recorded about these  loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Elevate Credit International Limited  to take off tax from this 
interest. Elevate Credit  International  Limited must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off if he asks for one. 
Ref: DRN26317354my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 May 2020.
