The complaint
Ms H complains about lending made to her by NewDay Ltd trading as Fluid Mastercard.
What happened
Ms H said that NewDay had lent her money she couldnt afford to pay back. She said that
she was struggling to make payments on time, and she had missed payments due to her
income simply not being enough to pay other loans and make ends meet. In January 2021,
she received a default notice for this debt.
Ms H wanted us to tell NewDay remove the interest she was being charged, and make a
suitable arrangement to settle what was due.
NewDay said that Ms H opened this card account in late August 2019. She said then that
she was employed part-time, with an annual income of £22,000 and NewDays checks
showed she had an unsecured debt balance of £21,700.
NewDay said that when Ms H opened her card account, she had no accounts in arrears, no
county court judgments against her, she wasnt in a debt management programme and she
had no payday loans. NewDay said that there was one default on her credit file, but this was
recorded 18 months prior to the application. NewDay opened her card account with a credit
limit of £1,500. NewDay was confident that it had lent responsibly to Ms H. It said it never
increased her credit limit.
NewDay also said it had provided appropriate support to Ms H when she got in touch to say
she was having financial difficulties. It put a payment holiday in place from 1 April 2020, then
contacted Ms H after that, but she said she could maintain the payments going forward. But
arrears began to accrue again in September 2020, Ms H hadnt made her full minimum
payment in August. Insufficient payments were received after that to clear the arrears on the
account. Ms Hs account was terminated on 17 February 2021.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. She said that the lending NewDay
made to Ms H had taken her unsecured borrowing over 100% of her income. And she set
out the details of Ms Hs financial situation at the time, which Ms H had shared with us
through her bank statements and payslips, as well as discussing her family situation and
dependents. Our investigator said that taking account of this, she didnt think the lending
NewDay had made was affordable for Ms H, and she said Ms H quickly got into difficulties.
Our investigator said that NewDay should reimburse all interest and charges applied from
the time of the account opening, to date. If there was any money left once that refund had
been applied to Ms Hs debt then NewDay should pay that to Ms H, plus interest. If Ms H still
owed NewDay money, then it should arrange a repayment plan with her. And NewDay
should remove from Ms Hs credit file, any adverse credit data reported from account
opening to date, as the account should never have been given to Ms H.
NewDay didnt agree. It wanted to stress that it is a second-chance lender. It said that the
information it received showed Ms H had a medium to high level of debt to income, but it
wasnt unusual for someone to be accepted for one of its cards with this level of debt.
NewDay said it couldnt have known about things like deductions her employer makes from
Ms Hs wages. It said it isnt required to carry out the sort of income and expenditure checks
that our investigator said it shouldve done. It said they arent an industry-wide requirement.
And it didnt think it couldve known how Ms H would use her card, before she took it out.
Our investigator didnt change her mind. She said that more detailed checks than the ones
NewDay told us it had carried out can be required in some circumstances, and she thought
they were required here. She still thought NewDay shouldnt have lent to Ms H.
NewDay said that it wanted this case to be referred to an ombudsman, so it was passed to
me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
I agree with our investigator that Ms Hs initial use of the card was an indication that 
she was in financial difficulties when she got the card. But what I have to assess, is 
whether NewDay shouldve known this, when it made its lending decision.
When Ms H applied for her card account, her unsecured debt was almost as much as 
her annual income. With the additional lending that NewDay offered her, she owed 
over 100% of her yearly income, before allowing for tax or any living expenses.
NewDay has accepted that this meant Ms H was at what it terms medium to high 
level of indebtedness. I think it was clear, from the information that NewDay did 
have, that Ms Hs circumstances were not such that it was obvious that her income 
and expenditure were going to have no impact on her affordability risk. The 
creditworthiness assessment that NewDay does ought to be proportionate to the 
individual circumstances of each case. And this case, I think it was appropriate for 
NewDay to carry out a more detailed assessment of Ms Hs financial position, if it 
wanted to lend to her.
I also think that if NewDay had looked in more detail at Ms Hs personal 
circumstances, it would not have decided to lend her £1,500. We know now that this 
wasnt affordable for her. But I think its likely that additional checks into Ms Hs 
income and expenditure wouldve revealed this before NewDays lending decision 
was made, if theyd been done at that time.
For those reasons, I think that NewDay should refund onto Ms Hs debt, all the 
interest and fees she has been charged on this lending. I dont anticipate that this will 
be enough to clear Ms Hs debt.
I can see that shes now agreed a payment plan with NewDay, so I make no 
determination on that.
I also think any negative markers on Ms Hs credit file, for this lending, should be 
removed, as I agree with our investigator that this lending shouldnt have been made 
to Ms H.
And finally, Ms H has told us she was already finding it difficult to manage her 
finances when NewDay opened her credit card account. And it does look to me as if the money NewDay has lent her has made things worse. So I will also ask NewDay 
to pay Ms H £100 in compensation, to make up for the part this lending has played in 
whats gone wrong.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties acknowledged receipt of my provisional decision, but neither party offered 
anything further.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I originally proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Limited must 
refund onto Ms Hs debt, all the interest and fees charged on this lending, 
remove any negative markers on Ms Hs credit file, for this lending, and
pay Ms H £100 in compensation.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 October 2021.
