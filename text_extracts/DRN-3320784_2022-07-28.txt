The complaint
Miss C complains that Santander Consumer (UK) plc, trading as Santander Consumer 
Finance, has recorded a default on her credit file.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in January 2022 in which I described what 
had happened as follows:
Miss C entered into a conditional sale agreement with Santander Consumer Finance 
that she signed in January 2017 for a used car to be supplied to her. She made an 
advance payment of £954 and agreed to make 42 monthly payments of £161.62 and 
a final payment of £,3,037.63. She voluntarily terminated the agreement in April 2018 
but there was a voluntary termination liability of £2,168.15 which she had to pay. She 
couldnt afford to pay that amount so repaid it by instalments until it was settled in 
January 2019.
Miss C contacted Santander Consumer Finance because there was a marker on her 
credit file about a payment from May 2018 that shed discovered when she was trying 
to port her mortgage. She says that she wasnt able to port her mortgage because of 
the default recorded by Santander Consumer Finance but she sold her house so had 
to pay an early repayment charge of around £3,300 to be released from the 
mortgage.
She complained to Santander Consumer Finance about the default in January 2021. 
It said that the voluntary termination liability wasnt paid in full so the default was 
correctly recorded and it was unable to amend the information on her credit file. It 
accepted that it didnt meet its usual standard of service because of the delay in 
dealing with her request and if offered her £50 compensation. Miss C wasnt satisfied 
with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator recommended that her complaint should be upheld. She wasnt 
satisfied that enough was done to warn Miss C of the default and agreed that it 
wasnt fair that a default had been applied so Santander Consumer Finance agreed 
to remove the default from Miss Cs credit file. She didnt think that it would be 
appropriate or reasonable for her to ask Santander Consumer Finance to refund the 
early repayment charge or pay for the storage costs that Miss C had incurred for 
storing her possessions. She thought that the default had denied Miss C the 
opportunity to make a full mortgage application which had caused her stress and 
inconvenience  and recommended that she should be awarded £500 compensation.
Miss C has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says, 
in summary, that:
the amount of compensation is an insult and she feels that the financial 
hardships that shes suffered due to this mistake havent been understood;
her decision in principle was declined due to the default on her credit score so 
she couldnt make a mortgage application;
theres nothing on her credit file other than the default which would cause the 
decline;
she was never in arrears with her payments to Santander Consumer Finance 
and paid the full amount within the time scale given;
Santander Consumer Finance removed the default as it was falsely placed 
there, not because it forgot to warn her about it first;
there were no factors other than the default that caused the decision in 
principle to be declined, and now that the default has been removed shes 
been accepted for a decision in principle for a mortgage on a property worth 
£205,000 - nothing else has changed on her credit file which clearly shows 
that it was the reason that it was declined; and
shes struggled financially and with her mental health because of the mistake 
made by Santander Consumer Finance and the stress and uncertainty has 
been horrendous.
I set out my provisional findings in my provisional decision and said that I agreed with the 
outcome reached by our investigator but for different reasons which are set out below:
Miss C voluntarily terminated the conditional sale agreement early in April 2018 
and there was a voluntary termination liability of £2,168.15;
Santander Consumer Finances contact notes say that she could make monthly 
repayments for the voluntary termination liability but she was advised that it 
would appear on her credit file so she said that she would look into paying it in 
full;
she wasnt able to pay that amount in full and repaid it by monthly payments that 
ended in January 2019;
Miss C has provided extracts from her credit files which show that her account 
was defaulted with £716 owing (and the date of the default is December 2017 
with one credit reference agency and June 2018 with another);
although Miss C was advised that not paying the liability in full would lead to 
information appearing on her credit file, I dont consider that Santander 
Consumer Finance did as much as it would reasonably be excepted to do to 
properly explain to Miss C the consequences of information appearing on her 
credit file and I consider that it didnt follow the correct process for recording a 
default on her credit file;
Santander Consumer Finance has now removed that default but Miss C has 
clearly been caused issues as a result of the default being on her credit file;
shes described in detail the affect that it had on her request to port her mortgage 
to another property and that a decision in principle was made in December 2020 
to decline her request because of her credit score and unsatisfactory credit 
information;
although there are many factors that could cause a mortgage request to be 
declined, consider it to be more likely than not that Miss Cs request was 
declined, at least in part, because of the default that Santander Consumer 
Finance had recorded on her credit file;she says that she accepted an offer for her house in December 2020 but she 
delayed exchanging contracts in the hope that the situation with her mortgage 
would have been resolved and that she exchanged contracts in July 2021 
otherwise she would have lost the sale;
she had to pay an early repayment charge of around £3,300 (the March 2021 
redemption statement refers to an amount of £3,297) to be released from the 
mortgage  which she says that she wouldnt have incurred if shed been able to 
port her mortgage;
shes also incurred costs for storing her possessions since she sold her house;
Miss C contacted Santander Consumer Finance in early November 2020 about 
the adverse information that was on her credit file  so she knew before then that 
there was an issue with her mortgage but she continued with the sale of her 
property and she paid the charge to be released from her mortgage;
it was her choice to do those things and she could have chosen not to sell the 
property and not to end her mortgage which would have avoided the need to pay 
the charge and to pay to store her possessions;
I understand that these wouldnt have been straightforward decisions and that 
there were likely to me many complicated factors leading to those decisions but 
she was aware of the early repayment charge and sold the property knowing that 
she would have to pay that charge;
I consider that the decision that Miss C took led to the early repayment charge 
and storage costs being incurred and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Santander Consumer 
Finance to reimburse her for those costs;
Miss C has described the affect that the default has caused her financially and 
with her mental health and she says that the stress and uncertainty has been 
horrendous  our investigator recommended that Santander Consumer Finance 
should pay her £500 to compensate her for the stress and inconvenience;
Miss C says that £500 compensation is an insult but I consider £500 to be fair 
and reasonable compensation in these circumstances for the distress and 
inconvenience that Miss C has been caused and Im not persuaded that a higher 
award of compensation is justified;
Santander Consumer Finance has removed the default from Miss Cs credit file 
and I find that it would be fair and reasonable for it to pay her £500 to 
compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused; and
I sympathise with Miss C for the issues that shes experienced but I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Santander Consumer Finance to 
reimburse Miss C for the early repayment charge or the storage costs that shes 
incurred, to pay her any compensation other than the £500 referred to above, or 
to take any other action in response to her complaint.
Subject to any further representations by Miss C or Santander Consumer Finance, my 
provisional decision was that I was minded to uphold this complaint in part. Miss C has 
responded to my provisional decision and says that:
she knew about the default on her account in November 2020 but went ahead with 
the sale of the property in December 2020 (but the sale wasnt completed until July 
2021) but she had to sell it as she had no option due to a breakdown in her 
relationship as the mortgage was with her then partner and he no longer lived there 
so she needed to either buy him out or sell the house (she couldnt get the mortgage in her own name due to her poor credit score as a result of the default wrongly 
placed on her account);
Santander Consumer Finance should have rectified the issue much sooner and 
removed the default before she had to contact this service but it denied responsibility 
and said that she owed it money and had missed payments;
if it had been rectified in a reasonable length of time, she wouldnt have suffered 
hardship, distress and depression; and
£500 is an insult and she asks that I reconsider the final outcome.
She made a data subject access request and said that she didnt want me to issue a 
decision until shed received the information that shed requested. There was a delay in that 
information being provided to her but shes now received it. Shes provided a further detailed 
response in which she says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
she sent three payments totalling £716 between July and September 2018 to pay to 
Santander Consumer Finance the amount that she owed it;
Santander Consumer Finance then sold the car which covered the outstanding 
amount so she had no more payments to make;
she wasnt given any dates on when the liability needed to be paid-off and no 
confirmation of the repayment plan that was agreed;
she queried the default that it had recorded on her credit file and if it had been just a 
late payment marker she wouldnt have been forced into a serious financial struggle;
she never received any arrears letters and her debt was repaid within three months;
theres still no evidence to justify why Santander Consumer Finance placed the 
default on her account; and
it wasnt her choice to sell the house and she was forced into this situation due to a 
breakdown in a relationship and she couldnt afford to keep the house so it had to be 
sold.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, including carefully considering Miss Cs response to my provisional decision 
and her further comments following receipt of the information provided to her in response to 
her data subject access request, Im not persuaded that I should change my provisional 
decision. 
A car had been supplied to Miss C under a conditional sale agreement with Santander 
Consumer Finance that she signed in January 2017. She voluntarily terminated that 
agreement in April 2018 and the voluntary termination notice that was sent to her shows that 
there was a voluntary termination liability of £2,168.15. Miss C wasnt able to pay that 
amount so Santander Consumer Finance was required to record that on her credit file as its 
required to record true and accurate information about her payment history to the credit 
reference agencies.
It agreed that she could pay the outstanding amount by instalments  and she paid a total of 
£716 to it and the car was then sold which settled the outstanding amount that she owed to 
Santander Consumer Finance  but that didnt change the adverse information that Santander Consumer Finance would be required to report on Miss Cs credit file about her 
being unable to pay the voluntary termination liability in April 2018. It wasnt missed or late 
payments that Santander Consumer Finance was recording on her credit file, but it should 
have been recording that she hadnt paid the voluntary termination liability when it became 
due. 
Although Miss C was advised that not paying the liability in full would lead to information 
appearing on her credit file, I dont consider that Santander Consumer Finance did as much 
as it would reasonably be excepted to do to properly explain to Miss C the consequences of 
information appearing on her credit file and I consider that it didnt follow the correct process 
for recording a default on her credit file.
I also consider that the explanations that Santander Consumer Finance has provided to 
Miss C for recording adverse information on her credit file havent been as clear or as helpful 
as it would have been reasonable for her to expect it to be. I consider that that will have 
caused her distress and inconvenience.
Santander Consumer Finance has now removed the default from Miss Cs credit file but I 
consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it to have recorded adverse 
information on her credit file in May 2018. I consider it to be likely that that adverse 
information would have affected her mortgage application. 
I sympathise with Miss C for the personal difficulties that shes experienced and understand 
her reasons for selling the house, but when she did so she knew that shed have to pay the 
early repayment charge. For these reasons, and the reasons set out in my provisional 
decision, I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Santander Consumer Finance to reimburse Miss C for the early repayment charge or the 
storage costs that shes incurred. I find that it would be fair and reasonable for it to pay her 
£500 to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused. Im not 
persuaded that a higher award of compensation is justified in these circumstances.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Santander Consumer 
Finance to pay £500 to Miss C to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that 
shes been caused.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss Cs complaint in part and I order Santander Consumer (UK) 
plc, trading as Santander Consumer Finance, to pay her £500 to compensate her for the 
distress and inconvenience that shes been caused. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 August 2022.
