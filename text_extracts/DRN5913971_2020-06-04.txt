K821x#15Complaint
Mr P complains that Harvey  & Thompson Limited (H&T) was irresponsible  when it provided 
him with a number of loans between 2004 and 2011.
Background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  28 April 2020. 
An extract  from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will not repeat that 
information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to partly uphold the complaint. I invited 
both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. Mr P has told us he accepts 
the findings in the provisional  decision and he doesnt have anything further to add. H&T 
said they were disappointed the gaps in lending werent recognised, and it considers this to 
be inconsistent with other decisions.  
My findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the individual circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered what H&T said about  gaps  in lending. Id start by saying that the decision in 
this case is based  on the individual circumstances  of Mr P. But I did outline in the provisional  
decision some  factors that I considered when deciding  whether to think it was reasonable for 
H&T to renew its relationship with Mr P. Some of these  factors include;
the length of any lending  relationship before any gap;
the value of the loans  before the gap and 
the value of the loans  when a consumer returned for further lending. 
So in this case, I accept, there are some  breaks in lending such  as between February and 
September 2007. But I dont, in the individual circumstances of this case, that this gap was 
sufficient for H&T to renew the relationship. This is because Mr P had spent the majority  of 
the past three years up to that time in debt with H&T, and there  hadnt  been any significant 
and sustained decrease in the amounts Mr P was borrowing. 
So having  thought about the additional comments  raised  by H&T I still think Mr Ps complaint 
should be partly upheld. H&T shouldnt have provided Mr P with loans 32  70 and Ive 
explained below what H&T needs  to do to put things right. 
what H&T should  do to put things right
Based on what Ive seen  so far, I dont think H&T should have  provided  loans 32 to 70 to 
Mr P  in other words it shouldnt have provided him with any of the loans taken from (and 
including) January  2008 and it should put things right as set out below:
Ref: DRN591397121)Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr P towards interest,  fees and 
charges on these loans,  
2)Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr P which were 
considered as part of 1), calculated from the date he originally  made the payments, 
to the date the complaint is settled.
3)Pay Mr P the total of 1 plus 2
4)The overall pattern  of Mr Ps borrowing for these loans means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so if they still appear  on Mr Ps credit file H&T 
should remove them entirely. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Harvey  & Thompson to deduct tax from this interest. It 
should give Mr P a certificate  showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I partly uphold Mr Ps 
complaint. 
Harvey & Thompson Limited should put things right for Mr P as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 July 2020.

Ref: DRN59139713EXTRACT FROM PROVISIONAL DECISION 
Complaint
Mr P complains that Harvey & Thompson Limited  (H&T) was irresponsible when it provided  him with a 
number of loans between 2004 and 2011.
Background
H&T says Mr P borrowed  from it over seven periods  taking 70 loans. I've attached  a table at the end 
of this decision,  in the appendix, which includes some of the information  H&T has provided  about Mr 
Ps loans.
I would point  out, that the number of loans  under consideration has increased since the adjudicator  
looked at the complaint. This is because H&T provided  this service  with a more  detailed breakdown of 
Mr Ps loan history.  So when  looking at this case, Ive used  the loan numbering from the appendix.  
All of the loans taken by Mr T were cheque loan products. This means that when Mr P borrowed a 
sum of money  from H&T, he provided it with a cheque, backed by a cheque guarantee card,  for a sum 
of money which included the capital sum borrowed and an amount of interest. H&T would  then cash  
the cheque on an agreed date. So in this case, it seems that for each £100 cheque  Mr T received  £87 
cash. So in effect, Mr P was charged  £13 for every £100 borrowed, for what  appears to be around a 
month.   
In response to Mr Ps complaint H&T said it hadnt done anything wrong  and didnt make an offer to 
settle the complaint.  
Initially, one of an adjudicators looked at the case because H&T didnt  think we could  look at any 
loans taken out before  2010. After  review,  an adjudicator thought we could consider loans  taken  out 
before 2010  but only those  taken out 6 April 2007. Following that, H&T removed its objection to us 
looking at pre 2010  loans.  And Mr P appears to also have accepted this. 
One of our adjudicator's then considered the merits of Mr Ps case. And they recommended that it 
should be upheld  in respect of all the loans taken from and including Loan 20 (loan 31 in the 
appendix)  this was the first loan that the adjudicator  said we could  consider because  this service  
wasnt in a position to consider loans  before April 2007 because  H&T didnt fall under our jurisdiction 
until this time.  
Mr P appears  to have  accepted the findings that were  reached by our adjudicator.  However,  H&T 
didnt agree,  it said it considered any gap of three months or more to be sufficient for it to renew the 
relationship with Mr P. So unlike the adjudicator,  it didnt consider Mr Ps loan history to be one 
continuous lending  relationship. 
No agreement could be reached so the case  has been passed  to me for a decision.  
My provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about these  types 
of loans  - including  all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry  practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN59139714This Service doesnt have jurisdiction to look at complaints about loans  taken before 6 April 2007 
(Loans 1 to 30). This is because H&T didnt come under  our jurisdiction until this date. So in this 
decision the only loans  that Im actually  able to consider  loans 31  70. But I have kept in my mind  
that Mr Ps lending relationship started in 2004.  
At the time H&T provided the loans  to Mr P it was licensed by the Office  of Fair Trading  (OFT). H&T 
had to act responsibly but I acknowledge  that in 2004 there wasnt too much by way of guidance to 
those businesses as to what that meant in practice. Broader  good practice dictated that responsible 
lenders should ensure  that all loan applications went through sound and proper  credit assessments 
and that the interests of the borrowers should be taken into full account. 
But before January 2008  when the OFT issued  Consumer Credit Licensing  General  Guidance for 
Licensees and Applicants on Fitness  and Requirements, direction from the regulator as to its 
expectations as regards responsible lending hadnt been comprehensive.
I acknowledge that before  January 2008 H&T granted 31 loans over around 36 months to Mr P. And I 
also have to acknowledge that there was an almost six month gap between  loans 30 and 31. I dont 
think that on its own is sufficient  to say that Mr P wasnt having  some wider  money  management  
problems, but I acknowledge the rules and regulations that were applicable at the time that loan 31 
was given   and I dont  have any information from Mr P about his actual position  at the time. So 
taking everything into account,  I dont think I can safely  say that H&T acted unfairly in the 
circumstances given the regulations that were in force at the time. 
But, the OFT did issue guidance in January 2008 and I think that from that point the pattern of 
borrowing by Mr P shouldve been enough for H&T to consider that further credit shouldnt be 
advanced. 
The available  guidance explained that the aim of the OFT was to ensure that an appropriate  standard  
of consumer protection was in place and that it would  focus  on a several things when assessing 
fitness of applicants  for licenses.  One of those considerations was integrity, adding  that,
The way you operate  any aspect  of a business may well be relevant  to your fitness to hold a 
consumer credit  licence. 
It went on to provide examples of the kind of evidence that may involve integrity  issues. The final 
example stated,
evidence of business practices  that appear to the OFT to be deceitful or oppressive or 
otherwise unfair or improper whether unlawful or not and whether arising in relation to the 
licenses business  or otherwise with particular regard  to any breaches of OFT guidance. This 
could include evidence of irresponsible  lending .
The guidance added that, 
Lenders  may take different approaches to responsible lending in line with variations between 
the needs  of different  sectors of the market.  However, lenders should always take reasonable 
care in making loans or advancing lines of credit and should  take full account  of the interests 
of consumers in doing so. They should undertake  proper  and appropriate checks  on the 
potential borrower's creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan and to meet  the terms of the 
agreement. The checks should be proportionate, taking account of the type of agreement, the 
amounts involved, the nature of the lenders relationship with the consumer, and the degree 
of risk to the consumer. 
Ref: DRN59139715So, to me, the avoidance  of unfair practices that may result  in detriment to consumers was central to 
the OFTs guidance. The annex in the guidance listed a number of practices  that the OFT deemed 
unlawful and/or considered  unfair. The final one of these was as follows:    
Irresponsible lending
Lending irresponsibly contrary to the provisions of section 25(2B) of the Consumer  Credit  Act 
1974, by failing to take reasonable care in making loans or advancing  lines of credit, including 
making only limited  or no enquiries  about consumers' income before offering  loans, and 
failing to take full account  of the interests of consumers  in doing  so.
In summary, when granting licences, the OFT had thought about  whether a credit provider  was being 
run with integrity with particular concerns around whether  licence holders were  carrying out unfair 
practices of which irresponsible lending is an example. 
So before granting credit  to Mr P, H&T had to do proportionate checks. These had to take account of 
the type of credit, the amounts involved, the nature of H&T's relationship with
 Mr P, and the degree of risk to Mr P.
H&T hasnt  provided  details of the assessments it may have undertaken when these  loans  were 
approved to Mr P. It says that,
the lending  decision when  [Mr P] originally applied  were fully compliant with the regulatory  
requirements and industry expectations at the time and included criteria such  as confirmation  
of employment, receipt of regular income above  a minimum net monthly  amount  and a 
requirement to hold a cheque  guarantee card. 
To me, based on what H&T has told me, It seems  that H&T put a lot of weight on whether its 
borrowers had cheque  guarantee cards  because  if they did - H&T says - it was a strong determinant 
of creditworthiness.  To me this suggests that H&T relied  on any assessment  Mr  Ps bank may have 
carried out without knowing whether such  an assessment took place, or if it was good  enough to 
satisfy H&Ts responsibilities  under the regulations. 
By giving Mr P a cheque guarantee card, his bank  had committed to honour any endorsed cheque  up 
to the value  of the guarantee. For example, if Mr Ps cheque guarantee limit was £100, his bank 
would be obliged to pay up to £100 of the cheques value,  regardless of whether Mr P had sufficient  
funds in his account. But to equate another businesss cheque  guarantee pledge with an affordability 
assessment is clearly flawed. 
H&T utilised the cheque guarantee mechanism  as part of its lending relationship  with Mr P.  For 
example, for loan 32, Mr P provided nine cheques of £50 each rather than one cheque  of £450.  This 
is significant.
After all why else would it insist on a number of separate cheques each for an amount  backed by Mr 
Ps bank instead of a single cheque  for a higher  amount that wouldnt be backed? To me, it follows 
that I dont  think H&T could rely on the fact that Mr P had a cheque guarantee card would mean he 
could automatically repay his lending.  Only that H&T could be guaranteed  repayment because Mr Ps 
bank had guaranteed these sums.    
So while Mr P may have  been approved for a cheque guarantee card, that doesnt mean H&T could 
rely on that fact to decide that Mr P would  be able to afford his loans.  And as I dont know what other 
information it obtained about Mr P, I'm not able to say whether it did do proportionate checks.  But Im 
also unable, at this stage, to say what those checks may have shown. However,  with the over-arching  
obligation to act responsibly in mind, I can say that Im not currently persuaded that H&T acted 
responsibly towards Mr P, from the point he took loan 32 and thereafter. 
Ref: DRN59139716I say this because, not only had the OFT issued guidance  and clarified  the obligations on licensed 
credit providers, but also because of the overall  pattern of Mr Ps borrowing by Loan  32. Mr P had a 
lending relationship with H&T that had stretched for around 38 months and hed spent  at least 24 of 
those months  indebted to H&T.  
It may be helpful if at this point I consider what H&T has told us about  the gaps in lending being 
enough to renew the relationship. In effect,  it is saying that this three month gap was enough  for Mr 
Ps financial position  to improve and therefore, it could, in effect treat each application  afresh, rather 
than as part of a pattern.  
I dont disagree that three months, in some situations, may be reasonable for the lending relationship 
to start again,  especially if a consumer has only taken a few loans of fairly low value. But, in my view, 
there are some factors that may lead me to conclude  that a larger gap may be needed, such as the 
amount being borrowed between those gaps and how long the lending  relationship had been running 
before the gap occurred. And it is these things that Ive kept in mind when thinking  about whether 
there are as many different lending chains  as H&T says.
By January  2008, Mr P had been borrowing from H&T for over three years.  There  were  some small 
gaps in this lending such as between June and September 2005 and then some slightly  larger breaks 
between February and August 2007.  But the amounts Mr P had taken had been broadly static at 
around £200  - £400 each  time money was lent. In my view this pattern was highly  suggestive of 
someone who was reliant on these loans in order  to make ends meet. 
I think  that at this point H&T shouldve  realised,  that Mr P was in a cycle  of borrowing  which meant 
that hed have  to borrow again to bridge the gap left in his finances by repaying the earlier loans. I 
think this pattern of borrowing was harmful for Mr P. And I'm not persuaded that H&T was taking full 
account of his interests when  it continued  to lend to him in this way.
And I think that Mr P lost out because H&T continued  to provide him with credit from loan 32 onwards. 
These loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to take expensive 
credit intended for short-term use. The sheer number  of loans was likely to have  had negative  
implications on Mr Ps ability to access mainstream  (and cheaper) credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost  loans.
And, apart from the break between Loans 31 and 32 for example, the only other gaps were for a few 
weeks. This means that between November  2004 and December 2011  a period of 84 months - 
there were only around 24 months  when  Mr P wasnt indebted to H&T. And there was an almost  
unbroken chain of lending between July 2008 and November 2011.  In addition to this, Mr Ps 
borrowing didnt significantly decrease over time. Indeed, his largest loan (68) was taken out nearly 
seven years after his first loan with H&T. This strongly suggests  that Mr P had long term and ongoing 
money management problems.   
In these circumstances it seems to me that the loans  werent being  used as intended to meet a short 
term need  as suggested by H&T. The whole pattern suggested a long-term  unsustainable  reliance on 
these loans.
With all of this in mind,  Im intending to uphold Mr Ps complaint about loans 32 to 70 and H&T should 
put things right as set out below.
