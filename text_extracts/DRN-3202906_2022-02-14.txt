The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his account and 
gave him a short period of notice of their decision. Mr S is also unhappy about being told he 
had to repay his overdraft immediately.  
What happened
Mr S received a text message from NatWest to say his account had been suspended. Mr S 
had an overdraft facility of £2,000 of which he had used £1,999. Mr S then received a letter 
from NatWest giving him seven days notice of the account closure and to clear the overdraft 
otherwise they would refer the matter to their recoveries team. Mr S complained to NatWest 
about the unreasonable notice and timeframe to repay the balance. 
NatWest responded and maintained the decision to close Mr Ss account and said theyre 
unable to provide him with any specific details surrounding their decision. NatWest quoted 
the terms and conditions relating to circumstances where theyre able to close an account 
immediately. NatWest explained they wont give the exact reason for why Mr Ss account 
was closed other than to refer to the terms and conditions. NatWest explained this also 
meant any overdraft facilities on the account would be withdrawn. And, therefore, Mr S 
would need to repay the overdraft on his account immediately. They said, following the 
seven-day closure letter, Mr S should receive a 28 day intention to default letter, and if the 
debt is still outstanding then Mr Ss account would be referred to their collections and 
recoveries department.   
Our investigator looked into things for Mr S. She thought NatWest had acted in line with their 
terms and conditions in closing Mr Ss account. Mr S disagreed so the matter has come to 
me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. I understand Mr S will be 
disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have made this decision.  
My starting point is the terms and conditions of Mr Ss account. Section 12 covers closure of 
an account and under the heading Closing your account, it says NatWest can close any 
other account immediately if: 
Theres then a list of scenarios which allow NatWest to close an account immediately. The 
terms and conditions also discuss circumstances where NatWest can demand repayment of 
the overdraft without giving their usual 30 days notice. 
I can see NatWest sent a letter to Mr S saying they had carried out a review of his banking 
arrangements with them and had made a decision they could no longer offer him banking 
services. They explained they could close his account immediately but were giving him 
seven days notice and they explained what would happen next  this includes Mr Ss 
overdraft being taken away. The letter also says, unless Mr S repays the debt in full within 
seven days, they may share information about the debt with Credit Reference Agencies. 
NatWest have also provided account opening documentation provided to Mr S when he first 
opened his account. This says that the overdraft isnt for a fixed period and is repayable on 
demand. It goes further to say This means that we may, at any time, require you to 
immediately repay the whole overdraft. 
Banks have ongoing legal and regulatory obligations when providing services to customers. I 
can see NatWest do explain to Mr S they regularly review accounts and theyve closed his 
account in line with the terms and conditions. I can see Mr S points out the inconvenience 
this has caused him and also the worry of having to repay the overdraft immediately. I do 
acknowledge this but the terms and conditions do allow NatWest to close an account with 
immediate effect so I cant say theyve acted unfairly  particularly so in this case as they 
have given seven days notice rather than closing the account immediately. And, the terms 
and conditions as well as the account opening documentation allows NatWest to ask for 
immediate repayment of the overdraft. I note Mr S feels seven days notice to repay £1,999 
is unreasonable but I cant say NatWest have acted unfairly here.  
I note Mr S has raised additional complaints. Hes concerned about a text message he 
received saying his balance was over his agreed overdraft limit when this wasnt the case. 
He says his account has now been defaulted despite him attempting to contact NatWest to 
arrange a repayment plan and about being on hold for a significant period during a call to 
NatWest before being disconnected. My decision has only looked at Mr Ss account closure, 
the notice he was given and having to repay the overdraft immediately  as these have been 
addressed by NatWest in their complaint response. Mr S will need to raise the additional 
complaints with NatWest before our service can consider them. 
I acknowledge it will be frustrating for Mr S to not know the reason for the closure of his 
account but theres no provision within the terms and conditions which requires NatWest to 
give a reason. In summary, while I understand the impact this had on Mr S, I cant say 
NatWest have acted unreasonably here. Theyve taken steps in line with the terms and 
conditions and also informed Mr S about the next steps he needs to take if he requires 
banking services from an alternative provider. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given, it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 March 2022.
