The complaint
Mr L complains that TransferWise Ltd failed to credit funds into his account, provided no 
record of the transaction and provided poor customer service.
What happened
Mr L says that he sent $7,700 to his Wise account to cover a transfer hed set up on 16 June 
2022 for the same amount. For some reason, he says, the transfer was only for $7,000 so 
Mr L says TransferWise asked him for his bank details to enable a refund. He says that even 
though he requested the money was added to his account, this did not happen, and he 
wasted time and received confusing responses from TransferWise who didnt even add a 
date to its final response letter. Mr L adds that he wants a record of the activities involving 
the additional $700, including the charges incurred.
TransferWise said it sent Mr L a link for the refund of the excess money - $695.86 as $4.14 
was the charge for the transfer. In the meantime, it says Mr L contacted the online chat and 
requested the refund to be added to the Wise account. It says he was advised to set up a 
further transfer request, but that its operations team could not then link the transfer to his 
Wise account so again requested his account details for the refund.
TransferWise said Mr L accessed the refund link on 17 June 2022 but was unsure whether 
to select SWIFT or SWIFT REFUND and sent an email with that question at 1.32pm. By the 
time TransferWise responded, at 2.45pm, Mr L had already incorrectly selected the SWIFT 
option. TransferWise said it responded again by 3.17pm that day and said it would contact 
the Operations team to look at it. It said they didnt respond until 20 June 2022 but confirmed 
it could offer the relinking of the refund to Mr Ls Wise account if he wanted to set up a new 
transfer request. TransferWise said Mr L declined this so on 21 June 2022, the excess 
refund was sent back to Mr L, and he was told it could take five business days to arrive.
On 27 June 2022 TransferWise gave Mr L a £500 free transfer voucher when he enquired 
about compensation, although it accepts it didnt explain how it worked. It acknowledged that 
its communication could have been better, so TransferWise offered Mr L £75 and said it 
would refund him any fees that were applied to the $695.86 refund if he provides evidence. 
Mr L says he does not accept this offer as a resolution as he has still not seen a complete 
record of all the transactions and the associated charges. He says it is unfair to ask him to 
provide evidence of the charges when TransferWise has this information, and he does not.
Our investigator considered that TransferWises offer was fair and that it accommodated 
Mr Ls request to have access to all the relevant information. He found that it had provided 
Mr L with all the transaction information, some of which was also included within Mr Ls Wise 
account and some of which was screenshots from its internal systems.
Mr L responded to say, in summary, that he wanted all the transactions to show on his Wise 
account on his mobile phone app.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Based on the evidence Ive seen I cant conclude the discrepancy in the money received and 
the transfer amount was due to TransferWise. However, I do find that its communication and 
execution could have been better when it came to how it dealt with the excess $695.86.
I accept that Mr L received confusing, and sometimes contradictory, advice, but I find 
TransferWises offer of £75 for this to be fair and reasonable.
I also acknowledge that Mr L says he does not have all the information he requires in his 
Wise account on his mobile phone app. Whilst I dont dispute that to be the case, this service 
does not have the power to enforce a company to change its systems and Im satisfied that 
TransferWise has now provided the requested information to Mr L.
TransferWise has also said that if Mr L can show he received less than $695.86 into his 
bank account, then it would refund any shortfall. I find this to be reasonable.
My final decision
My decision is that I find the offer from TransferWise to be fair and reasonable. TransferWise 
Ltd should pay Mr L £75, plus any fees he can show he incurred on the $695.86 refund, as it 
has offered to do.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 March 2023.
