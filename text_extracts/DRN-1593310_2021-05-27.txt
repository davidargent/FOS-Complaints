The complaint
Ms W is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, continue to hold her liable for an 
amount corresponding to a scam in which she was the victim.  
What happened
Miss W received £1,250 from an unknown third party into her PayPal account. Another 
unknown third party contacted Miss W and explained that the money had been sent to Miss 
Ws account by mistake and that it was intended to have been sent to themselves. The 
unknown party then asked Miss W to forward the money on to them and suggested that Miss 
W do this outside of PayPal, via friends and family as this would avoid Miss W incurring any 
fees.
Miss W transferred the money out of her PayPal account and sent it to the recipient third 
party, as requested. However, at that point, the sender of the money raised a dispute with 
PayPal against Miss W, stating that they had sent her £1,250 but hadnt received any goods 
in return. PayPal subsequently found in the senders favour, and PayPal deducted £1,250 
from Miss Ws bank account that was linked to her PayPal account. This meant that Miss W 
was £1,250 out of pocket.
At this point Miss W realised that she had been scammed. PayPal were unwilling to 
reimburse the £1,250, so Miss W approached her bank and asked them to raise a 
chargeback claim, which they did. PayPal didnt defend the chargeback claim or respond to 
it, and the claim was successful, meaning that the £1,250 was reimbursed back to Miss Ws 
bank account as a result of that claim.
However, PayPal then began pursuing Miss W for the £1,250 her bank had recovered. Miss 
W didnt feel that this was fair, so she raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Miss Ws complaint, but they felt that Miss W was liable for the £1,250, and 
that because the chargeback claim had been successful, and the £1,250 had been 
recovered from PayPal by her bank, that it was correct that Miss Ws PayPal account had a 
negative balance of £1,250 and that it was therefore appropriate that PayPal pursue Miss W 
for that amount. So, they didnt uphold Miss Ws complaint.
Miss W wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this 
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that it was clear that Miss 
W had been the victim of a scam and that she shouldnt be held liable for the outstanding 
balance. They also felt that if PayPal wanted to pursue Miss W for the balance that they 
should have challenged the chargeback request from her bank, rather than allow the 
chargeback to succeed and pursue Miss W afterwards. So, they recommended that the 
complaint be upheld in Miss Ws favour and that PayPal should write off the £1,250.
PayPal didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so it seems clear to me that Miss W was the victim of a scam here, and Im 
aware that this type of scam  known as a middle man scam  is one which PayPal are 
aware of. And indeed, it appears that PayPal acknowledged to Miss W that she may have 
been the victim of such a scam in this instance.
Its difficult then to understand why PayPal didnt do more to assist Miss W in these 
circumstances, and I havent seen anything in the information presented to me that gives a 
reasonable explanation as to why PayPal dont consider that Miss W was scammed, such 
that she should be held liable for the £1,250.
It is clear though that this is the conclusion that PayPal reached, and I say this because they 
continue to maintain that Miss W is liable for the £1,250. 
But its equally difficult to understand why, when Miss W approached her bank and asked 
them to raise a chargeback claim to recover the £1,250 from PayPal, that PayPal didnt 
defend that claim, if they felt that Miss W was legitimately liable for that money.
And it doesnt seem fair for PayPal to allow the chargeback claim to succeed, only to then 
pursue Miss W for the money recovered by Miss Ws bank via the chargeback claim. And 
one reason that I say this is that because the chargeback claim has now succeeded, Miss W 
no longer has the right to challenge PayPals pursuit of this money via her bank  given that 
shes already done so, and that challenge was successful.
PayPal have referred to the terms of their user agreement which states that PayPal takes no 
action in chargeback cases. But thats PayPals choice, and PayPal can defend a 
chargeback case if they want to. And in this instance, its clear that PayPals seeking to rely 
on the terms of their user agreement would result in an unfair outcome here, given that Im 
satisfied that Miss W was the victim of a scam, and so shouldnt be held liable for the £1,250 
that PayPal seeks to recover from her.
It follows then that Ill be upholding this complaint and instructing PayPal to write off the 
perceived debt of £1,250 from Miss Ws account. I hope that PayPal can understand, given 
what Ive explained above, why I have made the final decision that I have.
Putting things right
PayPal must write off the £1,250 that they perceive Miss W as being liable for from Miss Ws 
account.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, on 
the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 June 2021.
