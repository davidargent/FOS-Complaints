The complaint
Ms F complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wouldnt allow her to 
withdraw funds from her account.
What happened
Ms F had an existing account with PayPal. In mid-February 2021, Ms F sold a mobile phone 
and used her PayPal account to receive the funds from the buyer of around £320. Shortly 
after the payment had been received, Ms F tried to withdraw the funds from her account but 
was unable to do so. She received a message from PayPal saying her account was 
restricted. 
Ms F contacted PayPal several times, but she was given conflicting information. She was 
told that the payment needed to be held for 180 days to protect PayPal in case there was a 
claim against them, and she was told that she didnt have the correct identification on file, 
and she would need to provide this before the payment could be released.  
Ms F was unhappy as shed held the account with PayPal since around 2010 so she was 
unhappy they were asking for this now. Ms F told PayPal she didnt have the forms of 
identification they needed and by delaying access to the money they were causing her 
financial difficulty and affecting her mental health. So she complained to PayPal.
PayPal didnt uphold the complaint. They said their call handler had given Ms F the 
identification information she needed to access the money and once theyd received this, 
theyd reinstate her account so she could withdraw the money. Ms F didnt think this was fair, 
so she asked this service to look into her complaint.
Our investigator thought the complaint should be upheld. She thought PayPal had treated 
Ms F unfairly by providing conflicting information about what alternative identification could 
be used. She acknowledged that with our help getting alternative identification, Ms F now 
had her money. However, she felt there had been unnecessary delays which had caused 
Ms F distress and inconvenience, so she recommended a compensation payment of £150. 
PayPal didnt agree. They said theyd given Ms F the correct information about the 
identification documents she needed to provide to access the money. So they werent 
responsible for the delay in Ms F providing these and the distress caused by this. So they 
asked for an ombudsman to look into the complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold it. Ill explain why.
Ms F has told us shes unhappy that PayPal restricted her account and wouldnt allow her to 
withdraw the money from it she needed which caused her financial difficulty and also 
impacted her health. However, PayPal feel they acted in line with their terms and conditions 
and provided Ms F with enough information for her to be able to remove the limitation in a 
timely manner. 
Looking at the PayPal User Agreement Ive seen under the Personal accounts section it 
says, Holders of certain existing personal accounts may be required to upgrade their 
accounts (which may include providing further information to PayPal) in order to be able to 
use all of the current functionality available in a personal account. 
It also says under Account limitations that Limitations are implemented to help protect 
PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk or 
activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious. Limitations also help us collect 
information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open and We may also limit your 
PayPal account in order to comply with applicable law. 
I recognise Ms F told us shed had her account since 2010 and she was confused why 
PayPal chose this point to limit her account. However, Ms F has also told us she didnt 
regularly use the account, so its possible it was only because of this particular transaction 
taking place that her account was highlighted as not containing the right levels of 
identification. 
Although Ms F has held her account for a significant period of time, regulations do change 
over time and its not unreasonable for PayPal to request information from their customers to 
evidence they are compliant with these regulations. So whilst I acknowledge this was difficult 
timing for Ms F, I cant reasonably say PayPal did anything wrong by limiting the account 
until they received the identification documents they needed. 
However, I dont think PayPal did enough to help Ms F provide the documents they needed. 
Ive listened to the calls and read the system notes theyve provided in conjunction with the 
calls, and although I recognise PayPal said they told Ms F at the outset what identification 
documents she could provide to reactivate her account, I dont agree. 
Throughout the various calls, Ms F asked PayPal why her account had been limited as she 
didnt understand why as shed had her account since 2010. She also explained on virtually 
every call that she couldnt provide the identification documents PayPal had requested as 
she didnt have those particular documents - and I heard her become increasingly distressed 
as she felt no-one was listening to her. 
During the calls, Ms F was given conflicting information such as waiting for 180 days for the 
payment to clear, and that the payment was being held because it didnt meet the criteria for 
the sale and she should contact the business whod bought the item to ask them to confirm 
everything was fine with them so the payment could be released immediately. At no point on 
these calls was there any mention of identification needed.
PayPal told us that as per their case note of 22 February, Ms F was told on the first call once 
she was aware her account had been limited, what identification documentation she needed 
to provide. However, Ive listened to the call, and although the call handler was being helpful 
and suggesting documents such as the divorce decree, she appeared confused about the 
information contained on this document. 
The call handler suggested the document, without recognising that the decree wouldnt show 
Ms Fs maiden name or that when a person gets divorced, they dont automatically revert to 
their maiden name. She also suggested that the married name should be changed. This 
conversation therefore increased Ms Fs frustration and distress - and I dont agree that she 
was given the correct information by PayPal at this time.Ive listened to the call between PayPals agents and heard them confirm that in this case, a 
birth certificate, marriage certificate and utility bill would be sufficient for them to remove the 
limitation on Ms Fs account - which is what she was actually able to provide. And I think if 
Ms F had been told this by PayPal on the initial call - where she said she didnt have the 
standard photographic identification - even if it had taken a couple of weeks for her to obtain 
the documents, she would have had a clear idea of what she could get to satisfy PayPals 
requirements. This wouldve meant she didnt have to keep calling them to ask what was 
happening with her account and when she would get her money. 
So based on the evidence Ive seen I think PayPal provided conflicting and inaccurate 
information which meant Ms F wasnt able to access her money for three months and until 
this service became involved in the complaint. PayPal also didnt make any adjustments for 
Ms F despite her telling them she didnt have the documents they needed, and this was 
causing her financial distress and impacting her health. So I dont think PayPal treated Ms F 
fairly. 
Putting things right
Ms F has told us the delay in accessing her money caused her financial difficulty as she was 
relying on the money. She also said this has impacted her mental health because she was 
repeatedly trying to provide the identification she could, but this wasnt being accepted by 
PayPal. 
Ive seen that this was a frustrating time for Ms F as she was unable to get the information 
she needed from PayPal and was repeatedly having to call them to try and access her 
money. And based on what Ive seen, I think PayPal caused unnecessary delays and call 
costs to Ms F. So, given the circumstances of the complaint I think PayPal should pay Ms F 
a total of £150 for the trouble and upset caused.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I instruct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to 
do the following:
Pay Ms F £150 for the trouble and upset caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms F to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 August 2021.
