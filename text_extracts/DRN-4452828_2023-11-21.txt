Complaint
Mrs G has complained about personal loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) provided to her. 
She says that the loans were unaffordable and so shouldnt have been provided to her.
Background
118 118 Money initially provided Mrs G with a first loan for £3,500.00 in July 2019. The loan 
had an APR of 79.9% and the total amount to be repaid of £6,015.36, which included 
interest, fees and charges of £2,515.36, was due to be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of 
just over £250. This loan was settled early with some of the proceeds from loan 2.
 
118 118 Money then provided Mrs G with a second loan for £4,620.40 in January 2020. 
£3,020.40 of the proceeds from this loan went towards settling the outstanding balance on 
loan 1. This loan also had an APR of 79.9% and the total amount to be repaid of £7,823.28, 
which included interest, fees and charges of £3,202.88, was due to be repaid in 24 monthly 
instalments of just over £325.
118 118 Money then provided Mrs G with a third loan for £3,132.61 in February 2021. It is 
my understanding that this loan was provided in order for Mrs G to consolidate the 
outstanding balance on loan 2 have and have a three-month payment freeze. This loan also 
had an APR of 79.9% and the total amount to be repaid of £4,991.55, which included 
interest, fees and charges of £1,858.94, was due to be repaid in 15 monthly instalments of 
£332.77.
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mrs Gs complaint and she didnt think that she had 
enough to be able to say that proportionate checks would have prevented 118 118 Money 
from providing Mrs G with these loans. So she didnt think that Mrs Gs complaint should be 
upheld. 
Mrs G disagreed with our adjudicators assessment. So the case was passed to an 
ombudsman as per the next step of our dispute resolution process. 
My provisional decision of 2 November 2023
I issued a provisional decision  on 2 November 2023 - setting out why I intended to partially 
uphold Mrs Gs complaint. I wont copy that decision in full, but I will instead provide a 
summary of my findings. 
I started by explaining that 118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice, what this means is 118 118 Money needed to carry out reasonable checks to be 
able to understand whether Mrs G could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
I kept this in mind while provisionally deciding Mrs Gs complaint.
Why I was not intending to uphold Mrs Gs complaint about loan 1
The information 118 118 Money provided suggested that it carried out credit checks before 
Mrs Gs loans were provided. The checks carried out before Mrs G was provided with loan 1 
showed that she did have some existing unsecured debt at the time of the application. But 
this was low in comparison to her declared income. Crucially, according to the credit 
searches, Mrs Gs commitments at the time were being relatively well maintained. 
I did accept that Mrs Gs actual circumstances may not have been fully reflected either in the 
information she provided, or the information 118 118 Money obtained. Equally I also 
accepted that if 118 118 Money had gone into the depth of checks Mrs G appeared to be 
saying it should have  such as obtaining bank statements in the same way a mortgage 
provider would  it may have reached a different answer. 
But the key here was that 118 118 Money wasnt providing Mrs G with a mortgage. It was 
providing a loan for a first loan in circumstances where, according to the information 
obtained at least, Mrs Gs finances did not appear to be overly distressed. I thought that it 
was only fair and reasonable for me to uphold a complaint in circumstances where a lender 
did something wrong. Given the circumstances in this case, and the lack of obvious 
inconsistencies, I didnt think that reasonable and proportionate checks would have 
extended further. 
As this was the case, I did not think that 118 118 Money had done anything wrong when 
deciding to provide loan 1 to Mrs G - it carried out proportionate checks and reasonably 
relied on what it found out which suggested the repayments to this loan were affordable. And 
this left me intending not to uphold the complaint about this loan. 
Why I was minded to conclude that 118 118 Money shouldnt have provided loans 2 and 3 to 
Mrs G
The information 118 118 Money provided suggested that it also carried out credit checks 
before loans 2 and 3 were provided. The checks carried out before Mrs G was provided with 
loan 2 showed that Mrs G had had a number of missed payments in the period since loan 1 
was provided. 
She was also getting close to the credit limit on her revolving credit accounts and had only 
been making minimum payments for some time. Furthermore, Mrs G was returning for a 
second loan within months of her first and having barely reduced the outstanding balance on 
that loan. The position wasnt much better at the time of loan 3 either. 
Given all of this, I thought that 118 118 Money ought to have obtained further information 
from Mrs G in order to have been able to make an informed decision on whether to provide 
loans 2 and 3 to her. Furthermore, it was clear to me from the additional information I had seen that Mrs Gs 
existing expenditure meant that she was always going to struggle to make the necessary 
payments to loans 2 and 3  particularly in light of the proportion of the funds she was 
actually receiving, that would be taken up by these payments.
Overall and having considered everything, I was persuaded by what Mrs G has said about 
already being in a difficult financial position at the time she took out loans 2 and 3. While I 
accepted the possibility that Mrs Gs difficulties reflected her choices rather than financial 
difficulty, I added that my experience of these types of cases suggest that this was unlikely. 
And in the absence of any reasonable or plausible arguments from 118 118 Money, I made it 
clear that I was persuaded to accept Mrs Gs version of events in relation to these loans. 
As this was the case, I thought that Mrs Gs existing financial position meant that she was 
unlikely to be able to afford the payments to loans 2 and 3, without suffering adverse 
consequences or borrowing further. 
I was also satisfied that reasonable enquiries into Mrs Gs circumstances would more likely 
than not have shown 118 118 Money that it shouldnt have provided loans 2 and 3 to her. As 
118 118 Money provided Mrs G with loans 2 and 3, notwithstanding this, I was minded to 
conclude that it failed to act fairly and reasonably towards her. 
Mrs G had ended up paying and was still being expected to pay interest, fees and charges 
on loans she shouldnt have been provided with. So it was my intention to issue a final 
decision which concluded that Mrs G lost out because of what 118 118 Money did wrong 
and which directed it to put things right.
I concluded by setting out a method of compensation which I thought addressed 118 118 
Moneys shortcomings and Mrs Gs resulting loss.
Responses to my provisional decision
Mrs G confirmed that she accepted my provisional decision and didnt provide anything 
further to me to consider.
118 118 Money confirmed that it did not intend to challenge my provisional decision and also 
said that it didnt have any further points for me to consider. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I set out in some detail why I intended to partially uphold Mrs Gs complaint in my provisional 
decision of 2 November 2023. As neither party has challenged these conclusions and 
havent provided anything further for me to consider, I see no reason to alter my conclusions. 
So overall and having considered everything, Im still partially upholding Mrs Gs complaint 
and I still require 118 118 Money to put things right. 
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Mrs G
Having thought about everything, Im satisfied that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of this case for 118 118 Money to put things right for Mrs G by:refunding all interest, fees and charges Mrs G paid on loan 2;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Mrs G to the date of settlement;
removing all interest, fees and charges applied to loan 3 from the outset. The 
payments Mrs G made, whether to 118 118 Money or any third-party debt purchaser, 
should be deducted from the new starting balance  the £3,132.61 originally lent. If 
Mrs G has already paid more than £3,132.61 on this loan then 118 118 Money 
should treat any extra as overpayments. And any overpayments should be refunded 
to Mrs G. If an outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, 
118 118 Money can use any compensation due from loan 2 to reduce and/or clear 
the balance on loan 3.
removing all adverse information it recorded on Mrs Gs credit file as a result of loan 
2. Any adverse information recorded as a result of loan 3 only needs to be removed 
should no outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mrs G a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for 
one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in my provisional decision of 2 November 2023, 
Im partially upholding Mrs Gs complaint. Madison CF UK Limited should put things right in 
the way Ive set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 December 2023.
