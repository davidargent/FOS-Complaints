The complaint
Mr S complains about how NewDay Ltd (Marbles) dealt with his concerns about a payment
he made, or tried to make, to his Marbles credit card from his current account with a
business that I will call B.
What happened
On 17 January 2020 Mr S paid, or attempted to pay, £1,000 to his Marbles credit card 
from his current account with B using his debit card. This payment was never credited to 
Mr S Marbles credit card. It was debited from his current account with B on 
20 January 2020 but recredited the same day. Between 17 and 20 January 2020 the 
payment of £1,000 appears to have been marked on Mr S current account with B as a 
pending transaction.
On 17 January 2020 Mr S paid £739.46 to his Marbles credit card from his current 
account with B using his debit card. This payment was credited to Mr S Marbles credit 
card on 17 January 2020 and debited to his current account with B on 20 January 2020. 
Between 17 and 20 January 2020 the payment of £739.46 appears to have been marked 
on Mr S current account with B as a pending transaction.
Mr S was concerned that his payment of £1,000 wasnt credited to his Marbles credit card 
on the 17 January 2020  the day he paid it or attempted to pay it  so he contacted 
Marbles to raise his concerns.
Marbles says it explained to Mr S that the reason the payment had not been credited to 
his credit card was because it had been declined by B.
Unhappy with Marbles explanation he then contacted it to raise a complaint.
Marbles investigated Mr S complaint and ultimately said:
The payment in question had been declined by B.
Because the payment had been declined by B it had never been paid. And 
because it had never been paid there was no missing payment dispute to be 
logged and investigated by it.
It had advised Mr S at the outset that if his attempted payment of £1,000 was 
showing as having debited his current account with B then, in line with 
standard banking practice, it would likely show as a recredit on his current 
account with B in three to five working days.
Ultimately Mr S current account with B was debited and then recredited with 
£1,000 on 20 January 2020.
It could have dealt with Mr S complaint better and for that it had credited 
his Marbles credit card with £25.
Mr S wasnt happy with Marbles investigation into his complaint, or its response to it, so 
he referred it to our service for investigation.
Mr S complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
having credited his credit card with £25  for poor complaint handling  Marbles need 
do nothing further.
Mr S didnt agree with the investigators view so his complaint was passed to me for 
review and decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in September 2020. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Mr S has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed 
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their 
entirety. However, I trust that Mr S will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I 
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, 
as a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The 
purpose of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
Based on what has been said and provided, its my understanding that:
On 17 January 2020 Mr S paid, or attempted to pay, £1,000 to his Marbles 
credit card from his current account with B (by debit card).
On 17 January the sum of £1,000 was marked as pending on Mr S current 
account with B.
The sum of £1,000 was never credited to Mr S Marbles credit card, 
Marbles submitting that B had declined the payment.
On 20 January 2020 the payment of £1,000 was debited to Mr S current 
account with B.
On 20 January 2020 B credited Mr S current account with it £1,000 
pending a chargeback.
On 20 January 2020 Mr S current account with B was credited £1,000 in 
respect of his 17 January 2020 payment/attempted payment to Marbles.
On 11 February 2020 Mr S current account with B was debited £1,000 by 
B to reverse the 20 January 2020 £1,000 credit made by it pending a 
chargeback.
Now its unclear precisely what happened between 17 and 20 January 2020 with both B 
and Marbles providing different accounts as to why payment was never successful. 
However, I dont think I need to decide what happened between these two dates to fairly 
decide this complaint.
In my view Mr S hasnt suffered a financial loss, on either his current account with B or 
his Marbles credit card, as a result of what happened between 17 and 20 January 2020. 
I say this because I can see that Mr S was able to make two payments of £500 and £501 
on 20 January 2020 (debited to his current account with B on 21 January 2020) so as to 
avoid any interest accruing on his Marbles credit card. And that all charges he incurred 
on his current account with B between 1 January 2020 and 14 April 2020 totalling £83.37 
were refunded by B on 10 July 2020.
I appreciate that Mr S would have been concerned that on 17 January 2020 his Marbles 
credit card wasnt showing a credit of £1,000 when his current account with B was showing 
a £1,000 debit to Marbles as pending.But Im not persuaded it would be appropriate for me to make any award in this respect. I 
say this because based on what both parties have said and submitted Im satisfied that 
Marbles did its best to reassure Mr S about the £1,000 and that three days later, or one 
bank working day later, his current account with B was debited and recredited with 
£1,000 and the same sum removed from pending transactions.
I will now turn to what I understand is Mr S dissatisfaction with how his complaint was 
handled and for which Marbles paid him £25 (by way of a credit to his credit card on 
25 March 2020).
Our rules set out the matters that we can look at and these are; regulated activities, 
payment services, lending money, paying money by plastic card, and ancillary banking 
services. In addition, we can consider complaints about ancillary activities carried on in 
connection with the above. The handling of complaints isnt itself a regulated activity. Its 
something that the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority - requires financial 
businesses to do. But that isnt enough to make it a regulated activity within the meaning of 
the rule; that is, one from the list of activities set out in the legislation from which we derive 
our powers.
Were able to consider concerns about complaint handling in some limited circumstances, 
for example, if the complaint handling was ancillary to something we have the power to 
consider. So we can, in theory, consider how Marbles handled Mr S complaint. But there is 
another thing that we need to consider and that is that we can only make an award for any 
poor customer service in handling a complaint if were upholding the underlying issue being 
complained about.
Now in this case Im not upholding, for the reasons given above, Mr S underlying complaint. 
So I cant make, and I make, no award for what I understand is Mr S dissatisfaction about 
how his underlying complaint was handled. 
Marbles responded to that it accepted my provisional decision.
Mr S responded to say that he didnt accept my provisional decision. In summary he said:
He felt it was important to establish how and why his payment of £1,000 went 
missing.
He had to make a number of calls, lasting too long, before Marbles agreed that he 
could and should send it evidence that £1,000 had left his current account with B.
He shouldnt have had to make payments of £500 and £501 in addition to the £1,000 
payment he had made.
He made the payments of £500 and £501 whilst on holiday, which wasnt 
pleasurable.
Marbles might have done its best to reassure him, but that was because of the 
number of calls he made to it and because of his persistence.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand why Mr S would like to know how and why his payment of £1,000 went 
missing. But I remain of the view this doesnt need to be established to fairly decide this 
complaint.I accept that Mr S might have made a number of calls to Marbles and that he feels he 
shouldnt have had to make the payments of £500 and £501 that he did, especially whilst he 
was on holiday. I also accept that Mr S might not have received the reassurance that he did 
had he not made the number of calls he said he did and had he not been as persistent as he 
says he was. But I remain of the view, for the reasons given, that taking everything into 
account it wouldnt be appropriate for me to make any award in respect of this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2020.
