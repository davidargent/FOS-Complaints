Provident has informed the Financial Ombudsman Service that as of 21 December 2021 it 
wrote off the outstanding balances due on loans 6  9 and updated Ms Hs credit file to show 
these loans have been partly settled. 
Ms H says that she agreed reduced repayments with Provident in April 2020 as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Provident has recorded missed payment markers on her 
credit file. 
Following a complaint to Provident, it issued its final response letter, in August 2021. It 
explained that repayments had been made to it on time up until March 2020. It then said 
Ms H either didnt make payments or made partial repayments from 20 March 2020 to 
14 July 2020. 
After this date, it could see Ms H returned to her contractual repayment amounts. Provident 
concluded the missed payment markers it had recorded were correct, because these were 
an accurate reflection of how Ms H managed her loan accounts. 
Unhappy with this response, Ms H referred her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service. 
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and she said it shouldnt be upheld. She explained 
Provident didnt have any local notes anymore so she couldnt be sure what was agreed 
between Ms H and Provident in April 2020 and so cant conclude whether it was aware that 
her difficulties were as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The adjudicator explained the missed payment markers on loans 5  7 started during the 
period that Ms H was making partial / reduced payments. However, there were no adverse 
information reported on loans 8 and 9 as these were taken out after Ms H had returned to 
contractual repayments in July 2020.
The adjudicator could see contact from Ms H with Provident from June 2021, when 
Provident applied waivers to the active loan accounts  so loans 6 - 9. Overall, she thought 
Provident had acted fairly and so didnt need to make any adjustments to the credit file.  
Ms H didnt agree with the adjudicators outcome, but no further comments were provided as 
to why. 
Later, Ms H confirmed that she didnt have copies of any messages between herself and the 
Provident agent which confirmed Provident was aware of her being on furlough and 
therefore agreeing to the reduced repayment plans. 
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive split the decision into two different periods. Ive done this because loans 8 and 9 were 
taken out after Ms H had returned to her contractual repayments in July 2020. 
Loans 5  7 
All three of these loans were taken out before the period of time when Ms H says she was 
on furlough. Ive been provided with the statement of account for these three loans and Ive 
reviewed these to see what happened. 
For loan 5, I can see Ms H made her regular £22 weekly repayment from inception of the 
loan until 16 March 2020. From, 30 March 2020 until 14 July 2020 Ms Hs repayments 
reduce by 50% - to £11.01 per week.  From there, Ms H pays at least £22 each week until 
the loan is closed in October 2020. 
For loans 6 and 7 a similar pattern is also visible in the statement of account, from around 
the end of March 2020 until the middle of July 2020 Ms H repaid Provident around 50% of 
her contractual repayments. However, unlike loan 5, these loans were only repaid when 
Provident took the decision in December 2021 to write off the balances. 
Ive also considered the information Provident has provided (as well as Ms Hs credit file) to 
see what has been reported to the credit reference agencies as a result of these reduced 
repayments. 
For loan 5, a 1 is reported from June until September 2020 when the loan is closed. 
For loans 6 and 7, a 1 is reported from June 2020 until April 2021. After April 2021, 
further payments are missed, so the arrears build on the account. 
A 1 being recorded with the credit reference agencies indicates that the account in 
questions is at least one month in arrears. 
Ms Hs main concern is that a 1 had been reported for a period of around 12 months. The 
reason the 1 has been reported on her credit file for such a long period of time, is that even when Ms H returned to contractual repayments in July 2020 she didnt repay a sufficient 
amount extra, each week in order to repay the arrears that had built up on the account. As a 
result, Provident was entitled to continue to record a 1 each month. 
Ms H says that in effect, these reduced payments were made because she was on furlough 
and therefore wasnt in a position to be able to afford her full contractual repayments. 
Provident has told us, that it doesnt have any notes (from the local office) from around this 
time. Provident says this is the case because the business is currently going through some 
significant changes. 
Equally, there are no contact notes or anything else at Central office which point to or 
indicate Ms H contacted it to tell it about her reduced repayments or anything to suggest that 
it was aware of the reduced payments Ms H was going to making. The notes, that Provident 
have been able to provide start in January 2021 which is after the event Ms H is unhappy 
with.
The first note that Provident has a record for, January 2021, does appear to show Ms H was 
aware of the arrears and why they were in place, as the call note supplied says:
Reason for arrears? Previously discussed
and
Aware of arrears consq? Yes
So, it does seem, that at least in January 2021, based on the call note that Ms H was aware 
of the arrears and the consequences of those arrears. 
Equally, Ms H hasnt been able to provide any information to show that there was a formal 
agreement in place between her and the agent and / or Provident. So, I cant rule out entirely 
that Ms Hs local agent was aware of her being on furlough. But equally, I also cant 
conclude that Provident was aware of Ms H being on furlough. 
So, given the limited information available. it is difficult, for me to be able to conclude that not 
only was Provident aware Ms H was furloughed but that it wouldve treated her any 
differently. 
Also, Ms H appears to have told Provident, she was on furlough for around six weeks. 
However, assuming she was on furlough for the entire time she wasnt making full 
repayments she was actually on furlough for around four months. 
Overall, based on all the evidence provided, Ms H didnt make her contractual repayments 
and Ive not seen quite enough to be able to conclude that Provident was aware of her 
intentions or the reasons behind the missed / reduced payments. 
Equally, when Ms H returned to normal contractual repayments, she didnt pay a sufficient 
amount in order to meet the payments she needed to make and clear the arrears that had 
been built up. Therefore, Provident was entitled to continue to record the account as being in 
arrears. 
As what Provident recorded is an accurate reflection of Ms Hs payment record, I dont think 
that it would be fair and reasonable to tell Provident that it needs to make adjustments to Ms 
Hs  credit file. 
Loans 8 and 9Both of these loans were approved once Ms H had returned to her normal contractual 
repayments so there was no missed payment or arrears markers recorded against these 
loans up to April 2021. 
However, it seems, from the information Provident says it is reporting on Ms Hs credit file 
that these accounts also entered arrears. This may be due to making reduced payments 
following the phone call between Ms H and Provident in June 2021. 
The arrears counted to build each month up until the point Provident took the decision to 
write off the loan. 
After April 2021, based on the statement of account provided, it does seem that further 
payments were missed both for loans 6  7 as well as loans 8 and 9. For example in 
June 2021 Ms H only makes one of her contractual repayments that were due to be made 
towards loan 6. 
Overall, taking into account everything Ive seen, Im not going to be asking Provident to 
make any adjustments to Ms Hs credit file because based on the information Ive been 
provided, Provident has recorded an accurate reflection of the way that Ms H managed her 
loan accounts. 
I appreciate Ms H will be disappointed by my decision, but I do hope my explanation has 
been helpful for her to understand why I have reached the outcome that I have.
 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im not upholding Ms Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2022.
