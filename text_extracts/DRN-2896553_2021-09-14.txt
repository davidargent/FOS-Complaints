The complaint
Mr L complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his accounts without 
explanation; blocked him from switching his account to a new bank; breached GDPR rules 
by sending personal information to joint account holders; and his credit file has been 
adversely impacted despite being told it wouldnt by NatWests debt collection agents.   
To put things right, Mr L wants NatWest to apologise, repair his credit file and pay him 
compensation for the trouble and upset it has caused. 
What happened
In January 2020, following an internal review, NatWest decided to close Mr Ls four accounts 
with it. Two of these were joint accounts; one with his ex-wife and the other with an 
ex-partner. For ease of reference, in some parts of my decision, I will refer to both as Mr Ls 
ex-partners. Both joint account holders live at a different address to Mr L. 
NatWest sent Mr L a notice of closure letter in which it cited all four account numbers. 
Amongst other things it explained the accounts will close in sixty-days, and that he should 
make alternative banking arrangements. 
A copy of the same letter was also sent to Mr Ls ex-wife and ex-partners addresses. 
Given NatWests decision, Mr L attempted to open a new account with a different bank. In 
doing so, he asked this new bank to use the switching facility. Broadly speaking, this is the 
process whereby standing orders, direct debit mandates, and funds in credit, are switched 
between the two banks to make it easier for customers to move their accounts. 
Mr Ls new bank told him NatWest had refused to do this. Mr L spoke to NatWest who 
explained as his accounts were being closed, the switching option isnt available. So he 
should manually move his direct debits and standing orders over to his new bank. 
Unhappy with NatWests actions, Mr L complained. In summary, and through a series of 
responses, NatWest said: 
- It had closed Mr Ls accounts in line with its terms and conditions. And it had 
complied with its obligations under any relevant rules and regulations. NatWest is 
unable to disclose the reason why it did this. 
- Copies of the account closure letter are sent to all parties linked to the account. They 
are sent to any residential and statement address held on file. As this 
correspondence was addressed to Mr L solely, there has not been a data breach.  
- Letters addressed to Mr Ls ex-wife and ex-partner only detail the account they are 
party to respectively. 
- If a notice has been given for account closure(s), the account switching service isnt 
available. 
- NatWest records show text messages were not sent to Mr Ls ex-wife about his 
personal account 
Unhappy with what NatWest said, Mr L referred his complaint to this service. Whilst it was 
waiting to be allocated to one of our investigators, Mr L explained a collections agency, 
acting for NatWest, had asked him for payment of his overdraft debt. Mr L owed this to 
NatWest following his account closure. 
Mr L said he explained to this agency that he had made a complaint to this service. And that 
he was told there would no collection activities, or adverse credit information added to his 
credit records, until the matter was resolved. Mr L says, later, upon checking his credit file, 
he discovered missed payments and default notices had been recorded by NatWest on his 
credit file.   
Mr L says any adverse credit information recorded by NatWest should be removed until this 
matter is resolved.
One of our investigators then looked into the matter. In summary they found:
NatWest has regulatory obligations to meet which can mean it has to review its 
customers accounts. NatWest had given Mr L sixty days notice of closure which 
was in line with the account terms and conditions.  
The account switching service isnt available when an account is closed by 
NatWest. 
Its NatWests process to send important communications to both the account 
address and statement addresses if different. Though NatWest followed its 
process correctly, it wasnt right that it sent letters to Mr Ls ex-partners 
addresses that related to his sole named accounts. So NatWest should pay Mr L 
£100 for any distress and inconvenience this caused.  
Given the clear requirements set out in NatWests closure letter, and the 
accounts continued overdrawn balance at the end of the sixty days, NatWest 
have acted correctly with regards to the information being reported on Mr Ls 
credit file. 
Mr L would need to take up any issue of the collection agent misleading him 
directly with them. 
Mr L was unhappy with what our investigator said. Though I havent listed them all below, Id 
like to assure Mr L that Ive carefully considered all the points hes made. In summary some 
of the key pints he makes are:  
- His complaint is mainly about his own personal information being shared across 
different addresses and information, not related to his joint accounts, being shared
- NatWest sent his ex-partners this information and he had seen it. But Mr L destroyed 
it at the time to avoid any further problems
- £100 is not enough compensation for the trouble and upset this matter has caused 
him - £2,000 would be a more appropriate. 
- He didnt receive any correspondence telling him he had to pay off his overdraft debt 
nor of his debt being passed to agents. Mr L was told there would be no further action until he heard from this service. Mr L says he should have been made fully 
aware of any impact to his credit history by NatWest - it failed to do this.  
- Its possible he didnt read the notice of closure letter carefully when it detailed what 
he had to do to pay off any outstanding debt. Thats because he was upset with 
NatWest sending his personal information to his ex-partners. 
- It was difficult to sort everything out as Mr L was working full time and his account 
switchover hadnt gone through as hed expected 
More recently, Mr L has said NatWest, through its agents, continue to chase him for the debt 
when he had been told it would be on hold until the matter is concluded by this service. And 
his credit file continues to be adversely affected. 
Mr L has also said he didnt pay off his overdraft debt because he was being treated badly 
by NatWest given the information breach. And if he had paid the debt off, NatWest wouldnt 
have helped him at all. So by keeping his debt, NatWest would have had to take this matter 
more seriously.  
This matter has now been passed to me to decide.         
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
And having done that, Ive decided to partially uphold Mr Ls complaint. My decision will 
disappoint Mr L, so Ill explain why. 
Account closure
A bank is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with a bank. 
But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the terms 
and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account, which NatWest and Mr L had to comply with, say 
that it could close the account by giving them at least sixty-days notice. And in certain 
circumstances it can close an account immediately or with less notice. 
Ive seen a copy of the notice of closure letter NatWest sent Mr L. And having looked at the 
information given to me by NatWest, Im satisfied it was entitled to close the account in the 
way that it has done.
Its also worth noting that all banks and building societies in the UK are strictly regulated and 
must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are 
also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of an existing business relationship. That 
sometimes means banks and building societies need to restrict, or in some cases go as far 
as closing customers accounts.
NatWest is under no legal obligation that Im aware of which requires it to give the exact 
basis for its actions. Because of that I wont be revealing its exact justification in my decision. 
Data breach
NatWest say its process is to send important letters, like the notice of closure letter, to all the addresses it holds on file for the account holder. In this case, it held two separate addresses 
in addition to Mr Ls residential one on file  they both related to the joint account holders. 
NatWest has sent me copies of the letters which referenced all four of Mr Ls accounts that 
were being closed. One was to Mr Ls residential address. The other two were sent to 
addresses which I understand relate to Mr Ls ex-partners. These letters are addressed to 
Mr L solely. 
NatWest say it only sent letters addressed to the joint account holders which related to their 
individual accounts held with Mr L. Mr L says that isnt the case. In other words, NatWest 
sent his ex-partners information about his personal accounts on letters addressed to them. 
Mr L says he had seen the letters but destroyed them at the time to avoid any further 
problems. Mr L is upset any letters were sent to his ex-partners homes. 
NatWest is under a duty to inform any joint account holder their account is being closed  
albeit they live at another address to the other account holder. So, if as NatWest say, it sent 
a letter of the individual account to Mr Ls ex-partners, I dont think its done anything wrong 
by doing so.   
That brings me onto the notice of closure letters that were addressed to Mr L but were sent 
to his ex-partners addresses. They reference all four accounts Mr L held. I can understand 
why Mr L wouldnt want this information shared with his ex-partners  or anyone else for that 
matter. But I note they were addressed solely to Mr L, so they shouldnt have been opened 
by anybody else - unless Mr L consented to that. 
I dont know what kind of agreement Mr L had with his ex-partners about any mail they 
received relating to him. Its quite possible there wasnt any such agreement given Mr L had 
opted for all his statements to be sent to him online. NatWest say its process is to send 
important letters to all the addresses it holds for its customer. But all four accounts didnt 
belong to the joint account holders or their addresses.  
So on one hand, letters addressed to Mr L should not have been opened by his ex-partner 
and ex-wife. Similarly, I note NatWest say its process was to send such letters to all 
addresses held for the customer  but Mr Ls partners were not joined to the other sole 
accounts Mr L held. 
NatWest, as Ive already said, had a duty to tell Mr Ls ex-partners their account with Mr L 
was being closed. To my mind, that would in of itself, have caused Mr L embarrassment and 
distress. Thats because his ex-partners would know their joint account was being closed 
and they in turn would have likely spoken to Mr L about this. 
So I think it was unavoidable Mr Ls ex-wife and ex-partner would come to know about his 
bank account closure issue. I accept though they wouldnt have known about all the 
accounts involved. Because of this I think £100 award for the trouble and upset caused by 
NatWest sending Mr Ls letters to his ex-partners addresses is fair compensation. 
Mr L says other letters were addressed to his ex-partners which listed his sole account 
details and information about them. Neither NatWest or Mr L have been able to send me 
copies of any such letter. Mr L says he destroyed them given how NatWests actions made 
him feel. That is unfortunate. But without seeing any evidence, and as NatWest say they 
only addressed letters to the ex-partners for their individual joint accounts, I cant say 
NatWest have done anything wrong in relation to this point. 
Mr L says NatWest sent text messages with private information about him to his ex-partners. 
NatWest say its systems leave a record of this type of activity. And having searched its systems it hasnt found anything to show such text messages were sent. Mr L hasnt been 
able to send us any information to show NatWest did send these text messages. 
I have no reason to doubt either party here, but in the absence of any information to 
conclude either way, I cant make a finding on this matter.  
Overdraft  debt repayment 
The notice of closure letters NatWest sent Mr L in January 2020 said the following: 
You will need to make alternative payment arrangements because at the end of the 60 days: 
- any overdraft facilities will be withdrawn
- any Standing Orders and Direct Debit authorities will be cancelled 
- all cards and cheque books for the account(s) will be stopped 
- online banking and mobile applications will be terminated 
- your account(s) will be closed  
We will not be able to provide references for you.We formally demand repayment of any 
funds owed to the Bank at the end of 60 days from the date of this letter, failing which the Bank will 
follow its normal debt recovery procedures. Please note that unless satisfactory repayment is received 
within 60 days of this letter, performance of your account may be reported to the following Credit 
Reference Agencies.. 
Mr L says he wasnt made aware, in any correspondence, that he had to pay off his overdraft 
debt. Nor that he was made aware of the debt being passed to agents. He adds he should 
have been made fully aware of any impact to his credit history by NatWest. But given what 
this letter says, Im satisfied NatWest did do this.  So I dont think NatWest have done 
anything wrong.  
I note Mr L says its possible he didnt read the notice of closure letter carefully because he 
was upset with NatWest sending his personal information to his ex-partners. But its 
incumbent upon Mr L to read such letters  especially given the seriousness and impact of 
the matter.  
Mr L also says it was difficult to sort everything out as he was working full time and his 
account switchover hadnt gone through as hed expected. 
Im satisfied NatWest hasnt done anything wrong by declining Mr L the opportunity to 
switch his account due to the closures. Thats because Mr L was still able to manually move 
over his direct debits and standing order mandates to his new account. The switching 
process no doubt would have made this easier for Mr L, but I dont think having to do it 
manually was onerous.   
More recently, Mr L says he didnt pay off his debt because he felt NatWest would treat this 
matter more seriously if he owed it money. So, it seems Mr L chose not to pay NatWest off 
as it had told him to do so within 60 days. The repercussions of not doing so were made, in 
my opinion, clear to Mr L. 
Lastly, and for the sake of completeness, Mr L says he had been told that any debt recovery 
and credit reporting actions will be suspended until the matter is resolved by this service. To 
my mind, Mr L has said that agents acting on behalf of NatWest have told him this. Our investigator explained this is a matter for Mr L to take up directly with the agency. 
In any event, given I think NatWest made the results of not paying off the overdraft clear to 
Mr L, and as he had a duty to read that letter, NatWest would likely commence with any 
recovery actions and credit reporting if it had agreed to suspend its actions until my decision. 
In other words, given what Ive said above, even if the debt recovery and credit reporting 
activities were suspended, it would no longer make any difference.  
So, after weighing everything up, I dont think NatWest have done anything wrong in closing 
Mr Ls accounts and not giving him any rationale as to why. I also find it hasnt done anything 
wrong in the way it has attempted to recover the overdraft debt from Mr L  nor with how it 
may have reported adverse information to Credit Reference Agencies because of 
non-payment. 
I do however think NatWest should have been mindful it was sending Mr Ls sensitive post to 
his non-residential address. But as Mr Ls joint account holders would have known their joint 
accounts were being closed, Im persuaded this would have caused Mr L distress and 
embarrassment in any event. So I think £100 is fair compensation in the circumstances of 
this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I uphold this complaint in part and direct 
National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr L £100 for the trouble and upset it has caused.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 October 2021.
