The complaint
Miss T says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly 
lent to her. Miss T says the lending was unaffordable for her and she had to reborrow to 
make the repayments. She has told us the lending had a detrimental impact on her financial 
position and also her mental health.                         
What happened
This complaint is about 25 short-term loans Sunny provided to Miss T between September 
2016 and July 2019. Miss Ts borrowing history for the first ten loans is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Highest 
Monthly 
Repayment
1 05/09/2016 24/02/2017 6 £300.00 £80.59
2 09/11/2016 24/02/2017 6 £100.00 £109.73
3 19/12/2016 24/02/2017 6 £50.00 £123.39

10 26/02/2018 03/05/2018 6 £100.00  
 
Miss T continued to borrow another 15 loans between February 2018 and July 2019. The 
amounts borrowed ranged between £50 to £400. 
When Miss complained to Sunny it offered to uphold the complaint for loan 17 onwards but 
there was no refund due. It offered to write off the outstanding balance on the last three 
loans totalling £403.69.Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ts complaint and thought the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been given as there was the suggestion that Miss T was having 
problems managing her money. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan ten and it confirmed it had 
written off the outstanding balance. Miss T didnt wish to accept the offer.
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss T could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss T could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Miss T didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to three shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Miss T had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ts complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why.
When Miss T returned for more borrowing at loan four, loans one to three were still 
outstanding and so Miss Ts monthly repayment would increase accordingly. Our adjudicator 
thought this additional borrowing may have been an indication that Miss T was having 
problems managing her money.
In response Sunny said that its product allows its customers the flexibility to take up to four 
loans at any one time. But when Miss T made her application for the fourth loan, by now she 
had returned more or less once every month since loan one and I think this may have been 
an indication that she was using this borrowing to supplement her income in order to make 
ends meet. And as Miss T had four loans outstanding her indebtedness to Sunny was 
growing and stood at £550. So, I think Miss T was juggling her finances and having 
problems managing her finances. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ts case, and like the adjudicator, I think that this 
point was reached by loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss T was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss T had taken out six loans within seven months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss T was having to borrow further 
to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that 
Miss Ts indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
From loan six onwards Miss T was provided with a new loan within days or weeks of 
settling a previous one. As an example, loans five to nine were repaid on 29 July 
2017 only for Miss T to return for additional borrowing the next day, and for a larger 
amount. This would suggest the borrowing was unsustainable for Miss T.
 
Miss T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 25 was 
taken out 34 months after Miss Ts first. Miss T had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Miss T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ts indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Miss T borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Miss Ts ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans four to 25 and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
A. Sunny should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss T towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans, not including anything Sunny has already 
refunded.
B. Sunny should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
 Miss T which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss T 
originally made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Sunny may  if it chooses to  use the total of A plus B to repay any principal 
which Sunny has written off.
D. Sunny should pay any remaining refund to Miss T. If there is no refund left and still a 
balance outstanding made up of written off principal, it would not be fair for Sunny to 
pursue this further.
E. Sunny should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Miss Ts credit file 
in relation to loans four and five. The overall pattern of Miss Ts borrowing for loans 
six to 25 means any information recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should 
remove these loans entirely from Miss Ts credit file. 
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Ts complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2020.
