The complaint
Mr P and Mr R are bringing a complaint on behalf of company A. Their complaint is that 
PrePay Technologies Limited (PrePay) didnt fulfil its duties to protect As account from 
financial harm, when a payment of £7,950 was made to scammers. 
What happened
Mr P and Mr R, acting on behalf of A, a newly incorporated company, entered into negations 
to purchase an item using an auction website. A price of £7,950 was agreed for the item and 
this debited As account, via bank transfer, on 22 November 2019. When the item wasnt 
delivered Mr P and Mr R suspected it had been a scam. PrePays records show that it was 
put on notice about the scam on 30 November 2019. PrePay later contacted the receiving 
bank to enquire whether any of As money could be recovered but all the funds had been 
removed from the account. 
Mr P and R complained that PrePay ought to have prevented the payment from debiting As 
account in the first instance. They said PrePay did not fulfil its duties to protect and 
safeguard As account from fraud or financial harm. They believed it was an unusual 
payment because it was a new payee and the first time a large payment had been made 
from the account. They were also unhappy that PrePay didnt inform them that the account 
name for the payee didnt match the details that were submitted for the payment. They said 
the payment was unusual and represented a sudden change to the operation of the account 
and therefore PrePay should have intervened when it was made, prevented it and so should 
refund As losses. 
Pre-Pay rejected the complaint, in summary it said, whilst it monitors accounts and is 
expected to safeguard against fraud it doesnt stop every single large payment on a 
business account as that would be acting against the interests of its customers. PrePay 
didnt have confirmation of payee technology in place at the time of the payment and wasnt 
required to. Pre-pay didnt accept any liability for the losses suffered as part of this scam. It 
attempted to recover the funds from the recipient bank when it was aware of the scam but no 
funds remained in the account.
One of our investigators looked into things and said the payment was authorised by A. She 
considered whether the payment was one that PrePay ought to have been concerned about 
and she didnt think it was. She concluded the account was newly opened so didnt have any 
historic transactions to compare against. A new payee in these circumstances wasnt 
unusual and given it was a business account and the type of business A is, the value of the 
payment also didnt seem unusual or suspicious.
 
She also considered PrePays actions when it was notified of the scam. But no funds 
remained at the recipient account so Pre-Pay couldnt have prevented As losses after the 
scam had occurred. 
Mr P and Mr R disagreed. They provided a detailed response, and in summary said:
-they completed their due diligence when purchasing the item;
-the scam payment was the first payment from the account, it was made within 3 days 
of the account being opened;
-Mr P and Mr R deposited £8,000 on the same day as the scam payment and the 
debit to the scammers left £50 in the account;
-a new payee was created and the activity combined with this was unprecedented and 
indicated a pattern of fraud and PrePay should have been familiar with fraudulent 
patterns;
-PrePay ought to have adhered to several pieces of industry guidance which refer to 
protecting customers from financial harm;
-Prepay wouldnt have known the purpose of the payment so to say it was in line with 
expected business activity isnt based on knowledge of what the payment is for.
As Mr P and Mr R disagreed with the investigators findings and asked for an ombudsman to 
look into As complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered everything I cant fairly hold PrePay liable for As losses. Ill 
explain why. 
In broad terms, the starting position in law is that PrePay is expected to process payments 
and withdrawals that its customers authorise it to make, in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the customers account. And a customer will then be responsible for those 
transactions that have been properly authorised. And I have taken that into account when 
deciding what is fair and reasonable in this case. So, I need to decide whether PrePay acted 
fairly and reasonably in its dealings with A when the made the payment debited the account, 
or whether it shouldve done something more. 
Its not in dispute that the payment from As account was authorised and Ive explained 
above, PrePay had an obligation to follow its instructions. Mr P and Mr R have quoted 
PrePays obligations include the BSI code, various pieces of FSA/FCA guidance and best 
practice. But some of what they refer to relates to expectations for banks and building 
societies and, at the time this transaction occurred, were not necessarily applicable to 
payment institutions like PrePay. I have acknowledged that PrePay had a duty of care to 
protects its customers against the risk of fraud and scams so far as reasonably possible. But 
it also had to balance that with the requirement to execute authorised payment instructions 
without undue delay. And I think its relevant that the relationship between customers and 
payment institutions like PrePay are often different to the relationships between customers 
and their primary bank.
It was possible for PrePay to stop the payment if it had reasonably been put on notice that 
the funds were being misappropriated. But Ive considered whether there was anything 
about the circumstances surrounding the payment that could have put PrePay on notice that 
they were being made as part of a scam.
Was the debit unusual?
The point I need to answer here is, based on all the circumstances of this complaint, whether 
PrePay ought fairly and reasonably to have done more here;whether it ought to have 
suspected the payment may have been at risk or not. Having done so I dont think it should 
have and Ill explain why.The account was newly opened. So, there isnt any transaction history to compare the scam 
payment to. I dont agree with Mr P and Mr R that this means the transaction made to the 
scammers should be fairly considered as unprecedented, or that it represented a sudden 
change in the operation of the account. By that statement any transaction made on the 
account would be unprecedented because it would be the first payment. In deciding if 
PrePays actions were fair I need to consider the wider circumstances.
 
At the time the account was opened A was also a newly incorporated company. This means 
PrePay had very little information on which to assess any initial account activity. PrePay was 
aware that A was a new company and it was aware of As intended business activities. 
Given this I dont think it was unfair of PrePay to expect large deposits to be made into an 
account like this or large purchases to be made.
 
PrePay has said that similar merchants  linked to As intended activities - were paid from 
the account in the following month. Whilst that activity wasnt known at the time it does show 
that As account was set up and used for the purpose intended and transactions to various 
merchants for items, goods and services were likely to (and did) occur on the account. Its 
not uncommon for limited companies to regularly make payments of this size and larger, and 
to new payees, than say - compared to a personal account. So, I can see why, in this 
context, PrePay wouldnt have been suspicious about the payment from As account. 
I appreciate that now, with the benefit of hindsight, Mr P and Mr R feel strongly that PrePay 
ought to have stopped this payment. But based on the knowledge that PrePay had at the 
time about A, I dont think there was anything about this payment that ought to have put 
PrePay on notice that A was at risk of financial harm. I agree the value of the payment is 
large but that doesnt make it unusual  especially for a new business. It also didnt have any 
other features, making it stand out as being unusual, for example it wasnt an international 
payment. I dont think PrePay had reasonable grounds to stop the payments from debiting 
As account. So, I dont think PrePay was unreasonable when deciding not to refund to A. 
Could PrePay have done more after the scam?
Ive also considered PrePays actions after it was notified about the scam. And whilst I think 
it could have acted quicker in general, Im not persuaded this could have prevented As 
losses.
 
The receiving bank has provided evidence that As funds were withdrawn from the account 
before Mr P and Mr R had notified PrePay that the scam occurred. So even if PrePay had 
acted quicker the funds had already been moved on.
My final decision
I appreciate this will come as a huge disappointment to Mr P and Mr R but I dont uphold As 
complaint against PrePay Technologies Limited 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask A to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 February 2022.
