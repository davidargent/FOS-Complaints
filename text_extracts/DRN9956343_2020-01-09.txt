K821x#15complaint
Miss M has complained about a number of loans she took out through a company called 
PDL Finance  Limited,  trading as Mr Lender . To keep things simple,  Ill refer mainly to 
Mr Lender in this decision.  
Miss M says she was lent to irresponsibly and the loans caused  her financial problems.
background
We now know that Miss M took 6 loans from Mr Lender between  August 2014 and August 
2015. Ive enclosed a summary  of Miss Ms borrowing with Mr Lender,  based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  the complaint should  
be upheld from the point of loan 3 onwards.  Mr Lender doesnt agree that it did anything 
wrong and has asked for an ombudsmans final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Miss Ms 
complaint.
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Miss M could repay all the loans she was given in a sustainable manner. These checks 
ought to have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being  
lent, the total repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Mr Lender should  have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
Ref: DRN99563432There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So Mr Lender  was required to establish  
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan repayments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  that 
Miss M could sustainably make her repayments. But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this 
is the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on 
time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to 
meet the repayments. So, it follows that a lender  should realise, or it ought to have  fairly  and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Mr Lender told us it carried  out certain  affordability and credit checks before agreeing  to lend 
to Miss M. Ive thought about these with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which Mr 
Lender should reasonably have seen that further  lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful. Ive considered whether Mr Lender  should  have  realised  that it shouldnt  have  
provided any further loans. 
Our adjudicator said that he thought loans 1 and 2 ought not to be upheld as they appeared 
affordable. Bearing  in mind what Ive said above about the length of the lending relationship, 
I agree.  Neither party has commented on this so I dont need to explain this any further. 
However, I think proportionate checks from the point of loan 3 onwards would most likely 
have shown that at this point Mr Lender ought to have realised Miss M was at risk of not 
managing to repay her loans sustainably. 
For example, Loan 3 was taken out on the same day she repaid loan 2. I also note this was 
for £390 (total repayment £477), due in one single payment.  Because of these things I think  
Mr Lenders financial checks in relation to Miss Ms situation should have been  more 
proportionate to the emerging  borrowing pattern that was taking  place. In particular the 
checks should have  extended to comprehensively  checking her living costs, wider financial  
commitments and any outstanding short-term borrowing. Had Mr Lender  carried  out these 
more robust  checks I think they would  have revealed further loans  were  becoming 
unaffordable for Miss M. She had outstanding  loans with other short-term lenders and this 
therefore meant she didnt  have enough disposable income to meet  the loan 3 repayments.
For Loan 4, Miss Ms overall borrowing figure did reduce and Ive thought  carefully about 
this. Nevertheless, it showed she was continuing  to take out short-term  loans very soon after 
repaying the previous loan and because of this, the checks Ive outlined above, for loan 3, 
were appropriate  for loan 4 for the same reasons.
For loans 5 and 6, I think any reasonable analysis of Miss Ms bank statements and financial 
situation would have additionally revealed evidence of payments to gambling  websites  and 
that she effectively  had no disposable  income to justify further lending.
Ref: DRN99563433Ive looked with care at what Mr Lender has said about loan 3 onwards and whether it and 
subsequent loans would have appeared affordable for Miss M. I also accept what  it says 
about what Miss M said why she wanted the loans.  But Im afraid it was Mr Lenders 
responsibility to carry out the types of checks that would ensure what it was lending  to her 
wasnt unsustainable and the information  being provided to it was plausible. I think there was 
a point as of loan 3 where Mr Lender, by way of carrying  out appropriate financial checks, 
needed to be more comprehensive.
So Im not upholding the complaint about loans 1 or 2 but I am upholding it in respect of 
loans 3, 4, 5 and 6. This is because Mr Lender  failed to carry out proportionate checks  from 
that point to make sure that Miss M could repay all the loans she was given in a sustainable 
manner. 
putting things right
In order to put things  right for Miss M, Mr Lender should:
refund all interest  and charges Miss M paid on loans 3, 4, 5 and 6;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative  information about  loans 3, 4 and 5 from Miss Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender must give Miss M a 
certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Miss Ms complaint.
PDL Finance  Limited should  put things right for Miss M as set out above. Under the rules  of 
the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept or reject my 
decision before  9 February 2020.
