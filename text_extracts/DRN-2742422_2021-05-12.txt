The complaint
Mr T complains that he couldnt get information from PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
(PayPal).
What happened
Mr T had an account with PayPal. He was due to get a partial refund of £6.99 from a seller. 
He obtained the refund on 16 October 2020.
Mr T complained that when he first attempted to accept and obtain the refund, PayPal said 
there was a technical problem and there was therefore a delay. Mr T obtained the refund but 
wanted to understand what the technical issues were. He contacted PayPal who couldnt 
easily help. Mr T said he spent many hours trying to contact PayPal to get the information he 
wanted. He said that PayPal hadnt resolved his complaint about this satisfactorily.
PayPal said that Mr T received the refund on the day he requested it to be paid. They told us 
there was one online interaction with Mr T lasting 4 minutes.
Mr T brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said that he could see why Mr T 
couldve been frustrated by his interactions with PayPal  through its automated service. But 
 Mr T had received the refund of £6.99. He could see evidence of a 4-minute interaction 
between PayPal and Mr T. But he thought that PayPal had acted fairly and didnt need to 
take any more action.
Mr T asked that his complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman,
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see where Mr T is coming from  he wanted to understand what the technical issues 
were which had led to his refund of £6.99 being delayed. And when he tried to contact 
PayPal, he was directed to its automated response service  which gave him no answers. 
He found it difficult to get to a human to interact with. He said that PayPal didnt 
deal with his complaint very well.
Looking at what Mr T has said about PayPals complaint handing. This service is governed 
by strict rules about what complaints we can, and cannot, look at. These are covered in The 
Financial Conduct Authoritys Handbook. This defines a complaint as being about a financial 
product or service. So, complaints specifically about a businesss complaint handling or 
processes arent included. Mr Ts concerns about PayPals response here are specifically 
about how they handled a complaint and replied to it, so  this aspect of Mr Ts complaint 
isnt one we can look at.
But  as I see it, the main issue here is that regardless of PayPals systems problem  Mr T 
got his refund of £6.99 on the day he requested it  Ive seen evidence of this. So  Mr T 
wasnt badly affected by whatever happened. Mr T then wanted to have a conversation with 
PayPal as to what its systems issues had been  and he had to do that using the automated 
bot. Ive seen the exchanges and can appreciate this was frustrating. Mr T says he spent 
many hours trying to get through. But PayPal, equally, have shown us that the only record 
they have is for one interaction with Mr T of 4 minutes  on 16 October 2020. Id also 
observe that I think its unlikely that a PayPal agent would be well equipped to deal with the 
sort of conversation that Mr T wanted to have  and nor would we expect them to. And  nor 
would we expect PayPal to have to discuss their technical issues with their customers  
other than how they may affect their services. So  I can see why PayPal struggled to 
respond to Mr Ts questions.
So  while I can appreciate that what happened caused Mr T frustration, I dont think that 
PayPal acted unreasonably, and I wont be asking them to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 June 2021.
