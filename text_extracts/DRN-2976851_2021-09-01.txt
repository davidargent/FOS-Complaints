The complaint
Ms S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt make an international 
payment.
What happened
On 10 June 2020, Ms S faxed NatWest and asked them to make a payment of £7500 to an 
account in Cyprus. There wasnt enough money in her account. On 15 June 2020, she tried 
to make a payment of £7000, but again, there wasnt enough money in her account. A 
payment of £6023 was made on 17 June 2020.
Ms S complained. She said shed asked to be told if there was a problem with the payment, 
and that the balance of the account should be transferred. But - shed heard nothing from 
NatWest. So  she didnt know the payment hadnt been made. She was left without any 
money in Cyprus to live on and pay bills. She couldnt get through to NatWest to log a 
complaint.
NatWest said the payments werent made because there wasnt enough money in Ms Ss 
account. Theyd emailed her to advise her of this. They apologised that their complaints 
team hadnt called her back as promised, but theyd had problems in calling international 
numbers. For this, they paid compensation of £30 to meet the cost of Ms S calls.
Ms S brought her complaint to this service. Our investigator said NatWest had acted fairly. 
On the first two payment requests on 10 June 2020 and 15 June 2020, there were 
insufficient funds in Ms S account. The third request  for £6023  was made on 17 June 
2020 and was paid. So  she was without the money for a week. Ms S fax said that she 
asked NatWest to email her the balance. She could see that NatWest had sent an email, but 
she hadnt seen what it said. She hadnt seen any evidence of any costs or losses incurred 
by Ms S. Ms S couldnt get through to the complaints department as shed failed the security 
questions. But  NatWest had paid £30 for the cost of Ms S calls which she thought was 
reasonable. She asked Ms S to bring forward evidence of the cost of her calls  so this could 
be put to NatWest.
Ms S asked that her complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
At the outset let me say that this service is an informal one which seeks to resolve individual 
disputes between customers and their bank. And  where information is incomplete, we 
sometimes have to make a judgement based on the probability of what happened and in the 
individual circumstances of the case  and thats needed here, because NatWest havent 
been able to show us a copy of the emails they sent to Ms S on 10 June 2020 and 15 June 
2020  when the payments were rejected for insufficient funds.
Ive seen Ms S statement  and when the payment requests were made, the balance was 
£6346 credit  so there wasnt enough money to make the first two payment requests. So  
NatWests decision not to make the payments was a sound one. But  thats not the crux of 
Ms S complaint  which is that NatWest failed to advise her of the failed payment and didnt 
fulfil her faxed request to send her the balance of the account if there wasnt enough money 
to make the payment of £7500.
Ive seen Ms S fax which requested the payment. It says, Please transfer £7500 to [bank 
details] Any problems (I need the balance emailed to me if possible) [Ms S email address] 
. For me, the fax could be read as either  send me the amount of money in the account 
if theres not enough in it to send £7500 - or it could mean send me an advice of the actual 
balance of the account.  So  it wasnt clear. Ive seen NatWests records. They say that two 
emails were sent - on 10 June 2020 and on 15 June 2020. On both occasions, NatWests 
records say GBP Amount: £7500 (£7000) Payment cancelled due to lack of funds. 
Cancellation letter emailed to the customer. So  the content of those emails look clear to 
me.
NatWest cant provide a copy of the actual emails sent to Ms S. But it looks to me as if it 
simply said the payment(s) couldnt be made because of lack of funds. And therefore  Ms S 
couldve acted to resolve things. They may, or may not, have said what the balance of Ms S 
account was.  But  from what Ive seen, NatWest did send two emails to Ms S email 
address, and they did say the payments hadnt been made. So - Ms S couldve acted based 
on that information  for example, to then make a payment of a lower amount. She told us 
that she was having a lot of problems with her email at that time  so it looks like she may 
not have received the emails  but I cant hold NatWest responsible for that. And, on 
balance, I think that NatWest did enough to advise Ms S that the payments hadnt been 
made, and why.
Ms S also complains that she couldnt get through to NatWest to log her complaint - Ive 
seen NatWests records in this connection. Ms S called them seven times between 18 June 
2020 and 19 June 2020  and could get through; either because she failed security 
clearance, or NatWest couldnt return her calls  either because her number wasnt the 
same as they held on file, or because they werent able to call an international number. 
NatWest have apologised for this and have paid call costs of £30 to Ms S. Ms S has said to 
us that this isnt enough  and as our investigator has said, if Ms S can provide evidence of 
her call costs, we can ask NatWest if they will pay for these.
I know this will be disappointing for Ms S as I can see that she feels strongly about what 
happened. But  as I have explained, on balance, I dont think NatWest made an error here, 
and therefore, I am not going to ask them to do anymore. 
My final decisionI do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 September 2021.
