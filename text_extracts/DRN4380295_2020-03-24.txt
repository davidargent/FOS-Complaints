K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains about a payment he tried to make from his National Westminster  Bank  Plc 
(NatWest) current  account. 
background
On 27 February 2019, Mr S tried to make  a card payment  over the phone  to his mortgage 
account with a different bank, which Ill call Bank  B. Bank B told Mr S the payment hadnt  
been successful  and a second  attempt was made within a few minutes. Bank  B again  said 
the second attempt was unsuccessful. So Mr S contacted NatWest to find out what had gone  
wrong.
When Mr S spoke  to NatWest, it said both payments had been  authorised.  So it didnt know  
why Bank  B had told Mr S they were unsuccessful. NatWest  also said at this time that 
because both payments  had been  approved  the funds had been removed from Mr S 
available balance. This meant that a total of over Â£15,000 was unavailable to Mr S. 
The money was released  back  to Mr S about a week  later.  At this point, Mr S moved the 
money to another of his NatWest accounts and tried to make  the payment to Bank B again, 
using a different  card.  But the same thing happened, NatWest said the transaction  had been 
approved, but Bank B told Mr S it had been  declined. 
Mr S complained to both NatWest and Bank B. Both banks said they werent  responsible for 
what had gone  wrong. Mr S wasnt happy with these  responses and referred both complaints 
to our service. 
An investigator and then an ombudsman considered Mr S complaint about Bank B. They 
said, in summary, they couldnt explain what had gone wrong but they were satisfied Bank B 
hadnt made a mistake.  
A different investigator considered Mr S complaint about NatWest.  She said, in summary, 
that having reviewed  the transaction records for the card payments and she didnt think 
NatWest had done anything wrong.  
Mr S didnt accept our investigators findings  about  NatWest. He said he couldnt  accept that 
neither bank was at fault. Mr S said there had to be a mistake somewhere. So the complaint  
about NatWest was passed  to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
overall conclusion  as the investigator.  Im aware thats not what Mr S was hoping  for but Ill 
explain why. 
Generally, Id expect  a bank to execute a payment in accordance with its customers  
instructions  unless  theres a good  reason  not to; which  would include if there were security  
concerns about  the payment in question or insufficient funds to make the payment being 
instructed. 
Ref: DRN43802952Having looked  at Mr S account  he had sufficient funds to make  the payment he was 
attempting. And I cant  see anything to suggest the transactions were  stopped  for security  
reasons. 
NatWests transaction  records  show that the two card payments Mr S attempted  to make on 
27 February 2019 were  approved by NatWest.  I know Bank  B told him they werent. And Im 
aware that the information in the other  case suggests that Bank  B did receive messages 
indicating the transactions  had in fact been  declined. I also acknowledge itll be frustrating for 
Mr S, but I dont know why that is. But Im satisfied having reviewed  NatWests  records that 
as far as it was concerned, on both occasions,  Mr S card payments had been successful. 
This was also the case for the transaction Mr S attempted on 12 March 2019.  NatWests 
records also show this transaction was approved. 
I appreciate that, as a result of the transactions being approved on NatWests  side,  this 
meant the funds were  then unavailable to Mr S for about a week on both occasions.  Which 
meant he couldnt reattempt the payment to Bank B until they became available  again. But 
this is the usual process, so I dont think NatWest made a mistake in this regard either. 
Beyond that, Im afraid I cant explain what the problem was when Mr S attempted these 
payments. But  based on the evidence Ive seen   I dont  think it was because  of a mistake  
NatWest made. I know thatll be a frustrating answer  for Mr S to receive and Im sorry weve 
not been able to provide  more of an explanation  - but theres nothing more  I can usefully 
add. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr S complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 April 2020.
