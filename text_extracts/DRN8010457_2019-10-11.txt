Mr Lender had already  agreed to refund the interest and charges paid on loans 15 to 19 in 
its final response letter. Our adjudicator thought that Mr Lender ought  to have realised prior 
to loan 15, from the overall pattern of lending, that it wasnt  fair to approve further loans. She 
thought Mr Lender had been wrong  to approve loans 7 to 19. Mr Lender didnt accept this 
and as there was no agreement, the complaint  was passed to me to decide.
Theres been no ongoing dispute  about  the first six loans, so my decision will primarily focus 
on the loans still in dispute  loans 7 to 14.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Miss Ms case. 
Ive decided to uphold Miss Ms complaint  in part and have explained why below
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Miss M could repay her loans in a sustainable manner. 
Ref: DRN80104572These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Miss Ms income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Having considered everything, I think Mr Lender  ought to have realised  from the lending 
history and pattern  of lending  that it was likely Miss M wasnt borrowing in a way which 
was sustainable  by the time she asked for loan 7.
By January 2015 Miss M had been  borrowing from Mr Lender for a little under six months, 
having taken out six loans  during that time.  A number of those loans were taken out on the 
same day, or shortly after, the preceding loan had been  repaid. In my view there were no 
breaks of significance in the chain of borrowing up to this point. During this time the 
information Miss M provided to Mr Lender  suggested she had monthly  disposable income of 
about £600  but given that she was re-borrowing so soon  after repaying a loan,  I think  
Mr Lender ought to have  realised it was unlikely Miss Ms disposable income was really this 
high. And that Miss M was borrowing almost  every month  and sometimes more  than once 
a month   suggested  she wasnt suffering  from a short-term cash  flow problem, but 
something more persistent. Overall, Mr Lender had enough  information by January 2015  to 
see Miss M was in some difficulty.
I think Mr Lender  ought to have also realised  that the pattern of lending  demonstrated  
Miss M wasnt  able to settle her loans over the life of the credit agreement   and was likely 
reborrowing because  of the hole repaying the debts was leaving in her finances, meaning 
the repayments were  not sustainable. This is particularly evident from the lack of gaps in the 
borrowing and the increase over time in the size of the loans.
Ref: DRN80104573Additionally, Miss M was permitted to access high-cost  credit, intended for short-term use, 
for about three  years, without any significant  break between the loans. I think  it was clear by 
the time of loan 7 that Miss M wasnt making any real inroads to ending  her indebtedness to 
Mr Lender and that she was in effect  paying  large  amounts of interest to service a debt to 
Mr Lender for an extended  period.
By allowing Miss M to borrow for so long  from loan 7 onwards  Mr Lender unfairly 
prolonged her indebtedness and likely limited her ability to access mainstream  credit, 
keeping her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
In responding  to the adjudicator, Mr Lenders only point was that the affordability of each 
loan should be assessed individually. But it knows thats not the only factor this service 
considers when dealing with complaints of this nature. And it hasnt made any detailed  
submissions on the pattern of lending in Miss Ms case   for example, it hasnt said whether 
it thinks it is fair to provide  high-cost short-term loans, without any break, for any particular 
period of time. And it hasnt suggested any alternative fair period of time in Miss Ms case.  
So Ive seen  no arguments to persuade me the adjudicator was wrong to say the lending 
from loan 7 onwards  wasnt sustainable.
Ive also considered whether Mr Lender  acted unfairly or unreasonably in some other way. 
Having done so, Ive not seen anything that leads me to conclude  it did.
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Miss Ms complaint about  loans 7 to 19.
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss M paid on loans 7 to 19;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were  paid (if they were) to the date of settlement**;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 means any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 7 to 19 should be removed from Miss Ms credit  
file

**HM Revenue & Customs requires  Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender must give 
Miss M a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ms complaint. PDL Finance  
Limited should put things right by taking  the steps  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 November 2019.
