Mr G says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  a copy of my provisional  decision on 20 April 2020. A copy is attached  
and it forms part of this final decision. I explained  why I didnt intend to uphold Mr Gs 
complaint and asked  both parties  to let me know if they had any further comments.
Neither Mr G nor Sunny sent me anything further to consider.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Mr G nor Sunny sent me anything further  to consider, I see no reason to depart 
from my provisional findings.  So my final decision is the same as my provisional  decision, for 
the same  reasons.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I do not uphold Mr Gs 
complaint against  Elevate Credit International  Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 June  2020.

complaint
Mr G says Elevate Credit  International Limited,  trading  as Sunny, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr G had five loans with Sunny, as summarised below.
Loan no. Amount (£) Start date End date
1 300 28/10/2018 15/05/2019
2 150 02/11/2018 15/03/2019
3 100 05/11/2018 14/06/2019
4 50 24/11/2018 01/05/2019
5 100 22/03/2019 open
An adjudicator  considered the complaint and thought it should be upheld  in respect of loans  4 and 5. Sunny  
didnt agree  but offered, as a gesture of goodwill, to refund  the interest  paid on loan 5 (without adding the 
8% compensatory  interest this service  would  usually  award).
Sunnys gesture of goodwill  offer wasnt accepted. As there was no agreement, the complaint was passed 
to me to decide.
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general  approach to complaints about short-term 
lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance  and good industry  practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice this means 
that it should have carried  out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could repay the loans in a 
sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much  
was being lent, the repayment  amounts and the consumers income and expenditure.  With this in mind,  in 
the early stages of a lending  relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be reasonable  and 
proportionate.  
Ive seen  that for each of the loans Sunny recorded information about  Mr Gs income and expenditure. For 
loans 1 to 4, Mr Gs declared income was £4,000 per month, reducing to £2,700 for loan 5. Ive not seen 
the expenditure figures for loan 1 but for loans 2 to 5 the range was £1,600 to £2,500 per month. The loan 
repayments ranged from £15 to £78 per month, although  as some overlapped the cumulative monthly 
repayments would usually be higher.
I think the checks  Sunny carried out were proportionate  in the circumstance of each loan.  The monthly 
repayments for each loan appeared to be affordable based both on the information provided by Mr G and 
on Sunnys  own assessment  of Mr Gs disposable income. I think  it was reasonable for Sunny to rely on the 
information provided  by Mr G  theres nothing,  in my view,  in the pattern of lending to suggest an 
inappropriate reliance  on the loans, or any other factors  which mean Sunny  ought to have viewed the 
information provided  by Mr G with suspicion. 
As I think Sunnys decision to approve the loans was reasonable, Im not intending  to uphold  Mr Gs 
complaint.
my provisional decision
For the reasons  given above, I do not intend to uphold this complaint against Elevate  Credit International 
Limited.
