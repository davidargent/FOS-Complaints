K820x#14complaint
Mr A, through a Claims Management  Company (CMC), complains  National Westminster  
Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold an Advantage Gold packaged bank account  to him on six 
occasions between  February 2001  and February 2012.  
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr As complaint  and didnt think NatWest mis-sold the packaged 
account on any occasion. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  review.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr As complaint.  
Free accounts  are widely available in the United Kingdom (UK)  and Mr A switching to and 
from one on a number  of occasions  shows Mr A wouldve known NatWest did free accounts 
and he couldve had one of those if he really wanted. Mr A had an overdraft on a free 
account so I dont think he had any reasonable basis for thinking he had a packaged  
account was necessary  for an overdraft.
I dont think NatWest recommended  the Advantage Gold account to Mr A. So he needed to 
decide whether  it was right for him. As far as I can see, Mr A couldve used the benefits  
and he did use some such  as the preferential borrowing rates  and the mobile phone 
insurance. Im open to the possibility Mr A wasnt told everything he needed to know. But Ive 
not seen anything to suggest  he wouldve been  affected by the main limitations or 
exclusions. So I dont  think clearer information wouldve made a difference  and I think  Mr A 
was given enough to understand what he was agreeing  to on each occasion. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr As complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 February  2019.
