The complaint
Mr C complains about problems with a direct debit when he switched his account from  
Santander UK plc (Santander)  to another provider. He would like a refund of a late payment 
fee(£12) and interest incurred as a result (£19.90).And compensation for the inconvenience.

What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again here 
instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
I do appreciate Mr Cs frustration and I dont doubt it caused some inconvenience 
when , having switched his account from Santander to a different provider, his direct 
debit payment for his Santander credit card was successfully taken in September 
2021 but not in October 2021.
Mr C is adamant neither he nor his new provider cancelled the direct debit  so 
Santander must have done so, but I have no evidence of that. I can see from 
Santanders final response letter it had no evidence from the new provider that the 
fault was Santanders. And although  Mr C said he would provide evidence from his 
new provider he hasnt done so. 
I think the switch to the new provider must have been successful as the direct debit 
for September 2021 was taken successfully. As I have no evidence the October 2021 
direct debit payment failed as a result of Santanders actions I cant reasonably ask it 
to refund the costs Mr C incurred or to compensate for the inconvenience as he 
would like.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2022.
