The complaint
Mrs S complains that Mitsubishi HC Capital UK plc wont refund to her the money that she 
paid for some holiday club membership points. Her relative is also involved in her complaint 
and shes being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
I understand that Mrs S and her relative had bought a trial membership of a holiday club in 
October 2013 which had a price of £3,000. They entered into an upgrade agreement to 
upgrade their trial membership and bought 10,000 holiday club membership points in May 
2016. The total amount payable by them was £11,000, they made an advance payment of 
£4,000 and Mrs S entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a lender that has since 
changed its name to Mitsubishi Capital for a loan of £7,000. She agreed to make 120 
monthly repayments of £108.56 to Mitsubishi Capital. I understand that Mrs S and her 
relative entered into an agreement to buy 5,000 more holiday club membership points in July 
2016.
Mrs Ss representative made claims, on behalf of Mrs S, to Mitsubishi Capital in November 
2020 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that: the product 
and the loan were mis-sold; the product was misrepresented to Mrs S and her relative; the 
contract was breached; commission was paid between Mitsubishi Capital and the holiday 
company which wasnt disclosed to Mrs S which created a breach of fiduciary duty and 
caused an unfair relationship; the loan was unaffordable; and the relationship between Mrs S 
and Mitsubishi Capital was unfair. The letter referred to a purchase in July 2016 for a price of 
£7,000 and said that a comprehensive witness statement that Mrs S and her relative had 
provided was enclosed. 
Mitsubishi Capital responded to those claims in detail and set out the reasons that it wasnt 
upholding Mrs Ss complaint. Mrs S wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was 
made to this service. Mrs Ss complaint form says that the holiday company and Mitsubishi 
Capital failed to conduct a proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan; Mitsubishi 
Capital paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to her and the 
holiday company unduly pressured her and her relative into entering into the upgrade 
agreement and her into entering into the loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement 
unfair pursuant to section 140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ss complaint should be upheld as he didnt 
think that Mitsubishi Capitals decision to turn down Mrs Ss claims was unfair or 
unreasonable. He wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale 
and he didnt think that the holiday company had breached the contract. He said that he 
hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mrs S and Mitsubishi Capital 
was unfair and he wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the 
relationship was unfair. He also said that he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that 
the lending was unaffordable for Mrs S and he didnt consider that Mitsubishi Capital had 
acted incorrectly in connection with any commission paid to the holiday company.
Mrs Ss representative, on behalf of Mrs S, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It says that our investigators recommendation is manifestly wrong and 
none of the relevant clauses have been reviewed. It says that the holiday company 
contravened the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 
2010 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, and it has provided a 
list of terms, including those relating to the management charges, which it says may be 
regarded as unfair. It has raised concerns about the way that the finance was sold to Mrs S 
and says that the holiday company didnt broker proper credit and failed to meet the 
standard of a regulated firm. It has also provided a generic submission from a legal counsel 
about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses and a further document in which 
it sets out its analysis of some of the contractual terms. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ss complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mrs S and her relative signed the upgrade agreement in May 2016 to upgrade their 
trial membership of the holiday club and to buy 10,000 holiday club membership 
points  the total amount payable by them was £11,000, they made an advance 
payment of £4,000 and Mrs S entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Mitsubishi Capital for a loan of £7,000;
I understand that Mrs S and her relative then entered into an agreement to buy 5,000 
more holiday club membership points in July 2016 but Ive not been provided with 
copies of the documents relating to that purchase (nor have I been provided with a 
copy of the trial membership agreement that Mitsubishi Capital says that Mrs S and 
her relative entered into in October 2013);
Mrs S and her relative signed other documents in May 2016 including the terms and 
conditions, a key information document, a separate standard form of the withdrawal 
notice that could be given to withdraw from the upgrade agreement and a customer 
compliance statement;
Mrs Ss representative, on Mrs Ss behalf, made claims to Mitsubishi Capital in 
November 2020 and it referred to a purchase in July 2016 for a price of £7,000  
Mrs S then made a complaint to this service and said that she was complaining about 
a transaction that took place in July 2016;
the loan agreement that Mrs S entered into with Mitsubishi Capital was signed in May 
2016 and was for a loan of £7,000  although I understand that Mrs S and her 
relative bought more points from the holiday company in July 2016, Ive seen no 
evidence to show that they used a loan from Mitsubishi Capital to pay for those 
points or that the purchase price of those points was £7,000 so Im satisfied that 
Mrs Ss complaint to Mitsubishi Capital is about the upgrade agreement and the loan 
agreement that were entered into in May 2016;
Mrs Ss representatives November 2020 claim letter refers to claims under sections 
75 and 140A, including that the membership points were misrepresented to Mrs S 
and her relative, but Mrs Ss complaint form only refers to claims under section 140A 
and doesnt refer to a misrepresentation made by the holiday company;
the November 2020 letter also says that Mrs S and her relative had provided a 
comprehensive witness statement which was enclosed  but a witness statement wasnt included with the documents that have been provided by Mrs Ss 
representative;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Ss claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Mitsubishi 
Capitals response to her claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
the November 2020 letter says that the membership points were misrepresented to 
Mrs S and her relative because: they were advised that the package would enable 
them to have exclusive accommodation and cheaper holidays, so over the length of 
the contract they would save an amount in excess of the sum paid; they were 
advised that the product was of some substance but its now clear that the product is 
worthless and has no merit; and it was represented to them that the purchase would 
be an investment as the product would increase in value and, after a few years, they 
would be able to sell it at a considerable profit;
Mrs S and her relative bought 10,000 holiday club membership points in May 2016 
and the upgrade agreement says:  your existing timeshare will be upgraded and 
enhanced and you will receive the Points Rights described above, plus membership 
(if you are not already a member) of [a specified collection of the holiday company];
the key information document says:  you are acquiring a contractual right (on 
redemption of your Points) to use the accommodations detailed in the  Resorts 
Disclosure Booklet; and it, and the customer compliance statement, included further 
information about the membership points;
the customer compliance statement also says: We understand that the purchase of 
our Points is an investment in our future holidays, but that it should not be regarded 
as a property or financial investment and that any subsequent resale will depend on 
market conditions;
neither Mrs S nor her representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to Mrs S and her 
relative before their May 2016 purchase;
the holiday company has provided an extract from the verification notes that were 
made in May 2016 which say that Mrs S and her relative had:  really enjoyed 
[their] stay  [and] want to be full members; and a list of the 33 reservation 
bookings that were made by Mrs S, her relative and others using their membership 
between June 2013 and May 2020;
the membership points can be redeemed to use holiday accommodation so Im not 
persuaded that theyre worthless and have no merit or that theres enough evidence 
to show that Mrs S and her relative were advised that the membership points would 
enable them to have exclusive accommodation and cheaper holidays or that the 
purchase would be an investment;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
were mis-sold or misrepresented to Mrs S and her relative by the holiday company or 
that they were induced into entering into the upgrade agreement by any such 
misrepresentations;the November 2020 letter also says that the seller has ceased to trade and has 
committed a repudiatory breach of contract but Ive seen no evidence to show that 
the holiday company has stopped trading and Im not persuaded that theres been a 
breach of contract by the holiday company for which Mitsubishi Capital would be 
liable under section 75;
the November 2020 letter says that commission was paid between Mitsubishi Capital 
and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mrs S which created a breach of 
fiduciary duty and caused an unfair relationship and Mrs Ss complaint form says that 
Mitsubishi Capital paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared 
to her;
the customer compliance statement that was signed by Mrs S and her relative says: 
We are aware that [the holiday company] is able to recommend credit facilities to its 
customers to fund their purchase, but understand that [it] is not independent. We 
have been advised that [the holiday company] works with a number of selected credit 
providers and  is entitled to receive a commission in respect of credit brokered;
I consider that Mrs S knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that Mitsubishi 
Capital might be paying a commission to the holiday company but Ive not seen any 
evidence to show that she asked either the holiday company or Mitsubishi Capital for 
any details about any commission that was paid;
the holiday company says that it received commission of £420 in respect of the loan 
that Mitsubishi Capital made to Mrs S which was 6% of the loan amount and Im 
satisfied that Mitsubishi Capital didnt breach any duty in making that payment  nor 
was it under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of the commission paid in 
these circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was paid 
was sufficiently high to mean that Mitsubishi Capital should have appreciated that not 
disclosing it to Mrs S risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
the November 2020 letter also says that the loan was unaffordable for Mrs S and her 
complaint form says that the holiday company and Mitsubishi Capital failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan but neither Mrs S nor 
her representative has provided detailed evidence about Mrs Ss financial position in 
May 2016 or to show that the loan wasnt affordable for her at that time;
the loan agreement that Mrs S signed in May 2016 shows that she was employed 
with a gross income of between £25,000 and £29,999 and Mitsubishi Capital says 
that it searched Mrs Ss credit record and used it, with other information provided on 
her application, to calculate a credit score which exceeded its minimum lending 
criteria and that it utilises a third party affordability product and there were no 
indications that Mrs S would struggle to service the loan;
it says that it calculated Mrs Ss net monthly income as £1,852 and that, after the 
loan repayment of £108.56 and the payment for her other credit commitments, she 
would be left with approximately £1,520 each month for other monthly expenses 
which, based on national averages, it says is generally sufficient to meet typical other 
expenses and given that there were no indications of financial stress on her credit 
file, there were no concerns about lending her an additional £7,000;
Mrs S and her relative had signed the customer compliance statement which said: 
Having carefully considered our financial commitments, we confirm that we are able 
to meet the financial obligations being undertaken by us in respect of our Points 
purchase including any financial commitments and repayments under a finance 
agreement;the loan was made to Mrs S in May 2016 but Ive seen no evidence to show that she 
asked Mitsubishi Capital for any information about the affordability assessment that it 
conducted before her representatives November 2020 letter;
I consider that the evidence that Mitsubishi Capital has provided shows that it made 
reasonable and proportionate checks to assess whether the loan was affordable for 
Mrs S before it was made to her and that it was reasonable for it to have concluded 
on the basis of the information that it had gathered that Mrs S could afford a loan with 
a monthly repayment of £108.58;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mrs S, that Mitsubishi Capital should have done more to assess the 
affordability of the loan for her, that the loan was mis-sold to her or that Mitsubishi 
Capital has acted incorrectly in connection with the loan;
Mrs Ss complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured her and her 
relative into entering into the upgrade agreement and her into entering into the loan 
agreement  but Mitsubishi Capital says that Mrs S and her relative bought 5,000 
more membership points from the holiday company in July 2016 - if theyd been 
unduly pressured into entering into the upgrade agreement I dont consider it to be 
likely that they would have agreed to buy more membership points from the holiday 
company two months later;
Mrs S and her relative had signed the separate standard form of the withdrawal 
notice that could be given to withdraw from the upgrade agreement within 14 days 
without giving any reason and the loan agreement said : You will have the right to 
withdraw from the agreement, without giving any reason, for a period of 14 days; but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs S contacted either the holiday company or 
Mitsubishi Capital to withdraw from either the upgrade agreement or the loan 
agreement within the applicable withdrawal periods;
the customer compliance statement also said: We confirm that we have been 
treated courteously during the sales presentation, that we have been given plenty of 
time to consider if the product is right for us and we have not been put under any 
pressure to purchase our Points;
Mrs S and her relative signed those agreements in May 2016 but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that they complained to either the holiday company or Mitsubishi 
Capital about the undue pressure that Mrs S claims was applied to them until her 
representatives November 2020 letter  if theyd been unduly pressured into signing 
the upgrade agreement and didnt want to buy the membership points, I consider that 
it would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted either the holiday company 
or Mitsubishi Capital about that issue sooner that they did;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs S and her relative 
were unduly pressurised into entering into the upgrade agreement or that Mrs S was 
unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mrs Ss representative has says that the holiday company contravened the 
Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 and 
the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, it has provided a list of 
terms, including those relating to the management charges, which it says may be 
regarded as unfair, and it has provided a generic submission from a legal counsel 
about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses and a further document 
in which it sets out its analysis of some of the contractual terms;
Im not persuaded that enough evidence to show that theres been theres been a 
breach of any applicable law or regulation for which Mitsubishi Capital would be liable in these circumstances and it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of 
the terms in the agreements that Mrs S signed were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mrs S and her relative and 
I consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mrs S and Mitsubishi 
Capital;
there was no reference in the November 2020 letter or the complaint form to the 
management charges or the terms relating to the management charges being unfair 
and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the management 
charges are unfair or that Mrs S and her relative have been required to pay any other 
unfair charges for their membership points;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs Ss relationship 
with Mitsubishi Capital was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs S and Mitsubishi Capital 
in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mrs S for the issues that she and her relative have had with their 
membership points but I consider that Mitsubishi Capitals response to the claims that 
had been made to it was fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Mitsubishi Capital to 
refund to Mrs S any of the money that shes paid under the loan agreement, to 
cancel the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action 
in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2023.
