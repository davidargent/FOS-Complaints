The complaint
Mr and Mrs M complain about their second charge secured loan with Shawbrook Bank 
Limited. Theyre unhappy with the rate of interest they have been charged, and that the 
broker who sold them the loan didnt explain to them how much the interest would cost them.
What happened
Mr and Mrs M took out this loan with GE Money Home Finance Limited in August 2007. 
They borrowed £88,500 over a term of 25 years, on a capital and interest repayment basis. 
The initial interest rate on the loan was 8.6% variable.
In July 2016, the loan was transferred to Shawbrook.
By August 2021, Mr and Mrs M still owed just over £67,000 on the loan. On 18 August 2021, 
they complained to Shawbrook. They said the interest rate they had been charged was 
extortionate and they hadnt been told when they took out this loan how expensive it would 
turn out to be.
Shawbrook said that Mr and Mrs M had taken out their loan through a broker, so a complaint 
about the advice they received should be directed to the broker. It also said interest had 
been applied in line with the loan terms and conditions and it had done nothing wrong.
Soon afterwards, in November 2021, Shawbrook wrote to Mr and Mrs M saying that it had 
reduced the interest rate on their loan from 10.15% to 4.2% and backdated the lower rate by 
10 months. 
Mr and Mrs M asked us to look into their complaint. Our Investigator concluded that we cant 
look into their complaint about what the broker told them when they took out the loan, 
because the lender wasnt responsible for that. He also said we only have the power to 
consider the interest rate charged on the loan after 18 August 2015, six years before Mr and 
Mrs M complained  although in doing so, we would need to take account of earlier rate 
changes which may have affected the rate charged during the period we can look at.
Neither Mr and Mrs M nor Shawbrook disagreed with the Investigators conclusion about the 
scope of our jurisdiction in this complaint, so the Investigator went on to consider the parts of 
the complaint he could look at. He didnt recommend that the complaint be upheld.
Mr and Mrs M didnt accept that conclusion and asked for it to be reviewed. They still thought 
they had paid far too much interest over the years.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First of all, and for the avoidance of any doubt, I agree with the conclusions our Investigator 
reached about which parts of this complaint I can look into. Mr and Mrs Ms broker is 
responsible for what they did or didnt tell Mr and Mrs M in 2007, and the time limit rules the 
Financial Ombudsman Service must apply to every complaint mean that I cant make any 
award or direction in respect of the interest applied to Mr and Mrs Ms loan before 18 August 
2015.
The starting point here is the loan agreement and terms and conditions which Mr and Mrs M 
agreed to when they took out this loan in 2007. The loan agreement says on the front page 
at section G that:
The rate of interest will increase or decrease if and to the extent that there is a change in 
GE Money base lending rate (see Condition 1(3) and 3(2) on page 2).
Condition 1(3) says:
References to GE Money base lending rate means the base lending rate of GEMHF [GE 
Money Home Finance] from time to time or if no such rate exists such other rate or rates as 
GEMHF may from time to time decide in which case GEMHF shall give the Customer not 
less than 30 days written notice of any such other rate taking effect.
Condition 3(2) says:
In the event of GE Money base lending rate increasing or decreasing after this agreement 
takes effect the rate of interest at letter G on the front of this agreement (or the rate of 
interest at that time) will be increased or decreased by the same percentage point(s) or 
fraction of a percentage point as GE Money base lending rate.
Having considered the agreement very carefully, Im satisfied its clear that the interest rate 
is variable, and it should vary in line with any changes to GE Moneys base lending rate 
(GEBLR). The GEBLR would have varied depending on GE Moneys cost of funding and risk 
analysis. Im also satisfied that the term is clear and fairly set out. So I think it should have 
been clear to Mr and Mrs M when they agreed to take out the loan that the initial interest rate 
wasnt fixed, it might vary and, if it did vary, what would impact that.
The GEBLR rate was publicly available, and weve obtained the historic rate information for 
the period of time relevant to this complaint. 
GE Money increased its interest rates to cover increased costs and risks to its business 
during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Its broadly accepted that businesses may need to 
increase interest rates to meet the increased costs of running their business and that those 
costs will change over time, and so I dont find that I can conclude GE Money was unfair in 
increasing its rates during this period. 
After January 2009, even though its cost of funding continued to increase, GE Money didnt 
pass any more of these costs on to its customers, instead maintaining the GEBLR at the 
January 2009 level. So, although the GEBLR diverged from GE Moneys cost of funding, this 
didnt disadvantage Mr and Mrs M.
I dont consider that GE Money breached the terms of its agreement with Mr and Mrs M, and 
I wouldnt expect the rate to follow another rate, such as the Bank of England base rate 
(BoEBR), where this isnt stated in the agreement.
Between 25 September 2014 and July 2016 (which is when Shawbrook took over the loan) 
the interest rate on Mr and Mrs Ms loan should have varied in line with the GEBLR. During 
this period, there were no changes to the GEBLR and no changes to Mr and Mrs Ms variable rate. So, I cant say that the lender acted unfairly during this period as the terms 
have been applied correctly.
Having considered everything, Im satisfied the interest rate term was applied fairly during 
the period the loan was with GE Money.
Mr and Mrs Ms loan, along with others, was transferred to Shawbrook in July 2016. When 
Mr and Mrs M took out their loan, it was on the basis of an interest rate that would vary, with 
the GEBLR being used as the reference rate, as set out in the loan terms. But the GEBLR 
ceased to exist when Shawbrook took over the loan. Shawbrook left the rate on Mr and 
Mrs Ms loan unchanged until November 2021, when it reduced the rate from 10.15% to 
4.2% (backdated to January 2021).
Ive considered this lack of variation in the rate very carefully, including what the loan 
agreement says and what happened with Mr and Mrs Ms individual interest rate. Having 
done so, Im satisfied that Mr and Mrs M havent been treated unfairly due to Shawbrook not 
varying the rate in that period. Ill explain why.
While Mr and Mrs Ms loan isnt a BoEBR tracker product, BoEBR is a useful external 
benchmark of market rates to use here to explain why I dont think Mr and Mrs M have been 
disadvantaged by Shawbrook not varying their rate between 2016 and 2021.
Im satisfied the rate of 10.15% was correct when Shawbrook took over the loan in July 
2016. So, if the loan rate were to vary, it would have been from that starting point.
There have only been two periods since July 2016 when interest on Mr and Mrs Ms loan 
would have been charged at a lower rate had it tracked BoEBR. Those were:
from August 2016 to November 2017  a period of 15 months  when Mr and Mrs Ms 
interest rate would have been 0.25 percentage points lower if it had tracked BoEBR, and
from March 2020 to January 2021  a period of 10 months  when Mr and Mrs Ms 
interest rate would have been 0.40 percentage points lower if it had tracked BoEBR.
That is set against:
a 19-month period (from August 2018 to March 2020) when Mr and Mrs Ms interest 
rate would have been 0.25 percentage points higher if it had tracked BoEBR, and
the fact that Shawbrook decreased the interest rate to 4.2% in January 2021 
(backdated from November 2021) when the interest rate would have been 9.75% at 
that point if it had tracked BoEBR.
Up until the latest point for which we have details  which is July 2023  Shawbrook 
maintained Mr and Mrs Ms interest rate at 4.2%, despite BoEBR increasing significantly 
since 2021. Had Mr and Mrs Ms interest rate tracked BoEBR, by July 2023 their interest rate 
would have been 14.65% - whereas they were charged 4.2%.
Full details of this can be seen in the table below.

Im satisfied that if Mr and Mrs Ms interest rate had operated differently and instead followed 
an external benchmark like the BoEBR since July 2016 then Mr and Mrs M would have 
incurred more interest over that period than they in the event did. For that reason Im 
satisfied that they havent lost out financially due to the interest rate not varying since July 
2016 (other than the 2021 reduction to 4.2%)  and I cant conclude that Shawbrook treated 
them unfairly.
Finally, Mr and Mrs M have said that they hadnt realised how small an impact their monthly 
payments would have on their loan balance. As our Investigator explained, I cant consider a 
complaint about what their broker told them when they took out the loan. But it may be 
helpful to explain that, in the early years of a loan, much more of each monthly payment 
goes towards repaying the interest. Over time, as the loan balance reduces, more of each 
payment goes towards repaying the capital  so the loan balance will reduce more quickly 
towards the end of the term than it does at the beginning.My final decision
For these reasons, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M and Mr M to 
accept or reject my decision before 13 November 2023.
