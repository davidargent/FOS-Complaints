K821x#15Complaint
Miss L complains Elevate  Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to her 
irresponsibly.
Background
Miss L took 9 loans  with Sunny between November 2014 and May 2016.  Her first loan was 
an open-ended credit agreement  where  she could borrow up to a set credit limit of £750.  
Ive included some  of the information weve received about these loans in the table below. 
Miss Ls drawdowns against  the first agreement are prefixed with Flex.  The repayments on 
this agreement were calculated according to a formula, with a minimum or scheduled 
payment due in line with Miss Ls pay cycle on agreed dates over a five month/20-week 
period.

*Miss L didnt fully repay  loans  3 to 5 and Sunny  wrote off small balances on each of these 
on 3 September  2015. Its not clear  why this happened.
When Sunny  considered  Miss Ls complaint, it said that it shouldnt have given her the
open-ended credit agreement and offered to refund the interest paid together  with 
compensatory interest.  Sunny also said that as the loan was paid on time there wouldnt be 
any adverse information  to remove  from Miss Ls credit file.     
Our adjudicator thought that loans 5 and 9 shouldnt have been given to Miss L. Sunny 
disagreed with the adjudicator. But it said it would maintain  its offer for the open-ended  credit  
agreement and also refund the interest  paid on loan 9 together  with compensatory interest.   
The complaint has now been referred  to me to consider. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Ref: DRN64476062Sunny had to assess Miss Ls applications for borrowing to check if she could afford to pay 
back the amounts  shed  borrowed  without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way 
which was proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could have  taken into 
account a number of different things, such as how much  was being lent, the size of the 
repayments and Miss Ls income and expenditure. With this in mind, I think in the early 
stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Miss L. These factors include:
Miss L having a low income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Miss L having a large number of loans  and/or  having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Miss L coming back for loans shortly after previous  borrowing  had been  repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Miss L.
Sunny was required to establish whether Miss L could sustainably  repay  her loans  not just 
whether she technically  had enough  money to make  her repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments  could of course  be an indicator that Miss L was able to repay her 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case.  The FCAs 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made 
without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have  realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude  those  repayments  are 
unsustainable.
Ive considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Miss Ls complaint.
As it appears Sunny agrees it shouldnt have given  Miss L the open-ended credit agreement, 
theres no longer  a dispute about whether  it should  have been  lent. Sunny  says it will refund 
interest on this loan together with compensatory  interest. I think this is reasonable. I 
appreciate why Sunny feels there  wont be any adverse information on Miss Ls credit file. 
But as it has agreed  this loan shouldnt have  been  lent, I think it would be reasonable that 
Sunny ensures that this is the case.  And if there is any adverse information, then I think  its 
fair that this should be removed. For clarity, Ive included this loan in the putting  things  right  
section below. However, my decision focuses  mainly  on Miss Ls remaining loans.
I agree  with our adjudicator that it was unlikely Miss L would  be able to repay loans 5 and 6 
sustainably, and this is something Sunny ought to have suspected. 
Ref: DRN64476063Loan 5 was the fourth occasion  within three  months  that Sunny had lent to Miss L; it 
overlapped with loans  3 and 4, which she had yet to repay. Loan 5 also doubled Miss Ls 
outstanding borrowing and the level of repayments she was expected to make.  Additionally, 
as our adjudicator  pointed  out, proportionate  checks for loan 5 would  have revealed  to 
Sunny that Miss L had an outstanding short-term loan with another lender that needed to be 
repaid. This other loan was a £400 payday loan with an expected repayment of 
approximately £500, so more than a third of Miss Ls reported £1,400  monthly income was 
already committed to paying another short-term lender. I appreciate Miss L then didnt take 
any additional borrowing from Sunny between April 2015 and October 2015, but I dont think  
this was necessarily a sign that she was getting  back on track  with her finances.  I say this 
because she was repaying loans 3 to 5 until at least July 2015,  and loan 6 was taken out 
within a few weeks of the remaining balances on those loans being written off. The amount 
of loan 6 (£200) was also higher than the average  of the previous  advances.    
Overall, I think its likely Miss L would have struggled to repay  loans 5 and 6 in a sustainable  
way, and I think thats something  Sunny  should have seen too, had it carried  out 
proportionate checks. 
By the time Miss L had applied for loan 7 it was a year into her lending relationship with 
Sunny. Loan 7 was for a further  £200  and lent whilst loan 6 was outstanding, which  doubled 
the highest repayment that Miss L needed to pay. Loans 8 and 9 were held simultaneously  
with two other Sunny loans with the result that the highest repayment increased further. And 
with the borrowing extending over a period of almost 18 months (with the loan amounts  
broadly increasing  during this period)  it seems more likely Miss Ls underlying  financial 
situation was worsening rather than improving.  Miss L also showed some more  obvious 
signs of difficulty, being  a week late making a repayment on loans 7 and 8. 
I think Miss Ls pattern  of borrowing should  have suggested to Sunny  that she didnt just 
have a short-term  cash-flow  problem,  but a persistent  shortfall in her financial situation which 
she was borrowing in order to make up. The fact she was borrowing larger amounts as time 
went on suggests either her situation  was getting worse  or she was needing  to increase her 
borrowing to fill the gap in her finances and service  the interest on her existing  lending.  High-
cost, short-term loans of the kind offered  by Sunny are not suitable for this kind of use, and I 
think Sunny  should  have  recognised the signs Miss L was likely using the loans in this way.
Taking all of this into account,  I agree with our adjudicator that its most  likely the point  had 
been reached where the loan history  and loan pattern indicated that the lending was likely 
unsustainable for Miss L. So I dont think Sunny should have lent loans 7 to 9 either.  
Ref: DRN64476064 Putting things  right
Sunny shouldnt have given Miss L the open-ended credit agreement or loans 5 to 9. So its 
not right that she should have had to pay interest, fees or charges on these, or have them 
affect her credit  file in a negative way. So to put things right Sunny should:
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Miss L towards interest, fees and 
charges on these loans.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Miss L which  were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss L originally made  the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled.
C) Pay Miss L the total of A plus B.
D) Remove any adverse  information  it has recorded on Miss Ls credit file in relation to the 
open-ended credit agreement and loans 5 and 6. The overall pattern of borrowing for loans    
7 to 9 means  any information recorded about them is adverse, so these should be removed 
entirely from Miss Ls credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Miss L a certificate showing  how much  tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Miss Ls complaint in part and direct Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) to take the actions outlined in the putting things right section above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 January 2020.
