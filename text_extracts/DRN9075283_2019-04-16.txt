K820x#14complaint
Mrs F says Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) mis-sold her an Additions packaged bank  
account. Shes used  a Claims Management Company (CMC) to make her complaint.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mrs Fs complaint and didnt think  Barclays  had 
mis-sold the packaged  account. The CMC asked  for an ombudsmans  decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mrs Fs complaint. 
I think Mrs F freely chose  to take the Additions account and used the benefit  the 
preferential overdraft terms   that she more likely than not upgraded for. Equally while Im 
open to the possibility Mrs F wasnt provided  with everything she shouldve been, I havent 
seen anything to suggest clearer information  wouldve changed her decision to take the 
account in the first place. So, in these circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mrs Fs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs F to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 May 2019.
