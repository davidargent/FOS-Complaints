The complaint
Mr G complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA closed his account and withheld the 
funds. PayPal requested ID documentation and finally accepted documentation provided and 
released the funds. Mr G would like compensation for the delay in the release of his funds.
What happened
Mr G had an account with PayPal.
PayPal blocked Mr Gs account on 13 February 2020 and requested proof of ID. After 
reviewing the information provided PayPal closed Mr Gs account on 15 February 2020. 
PayPal withheld the balance in the account for 180 days.
After the 180 days, PayPal still didnt release the funds. PayPal asked Mr G for proof of ID 
and address.
Mr G provided documents to PayPal, but they were not satisfied with the documents 
provided.
Finally, on 20 December 2020 PayPal released the funds. It accepted documents that Mr G 
had previously provided.
Mr G was unhappy that PayPal had held the funds for over 180 days without offering him 
compensation.
Mr G complained to our service. One of our investigators looked into the complaint. He 
thought PayPal had done nothing wrong when they closed the account and retained the 
funds. 
Mr G was unhappy with the findings. He said PayPal had eventually released the funds after 
he provided PayPal the same ID document a second time  so Mr G thought PayPal could 
have released the funds sooner. Our investigator considered this point. He said PayPal had 
made an error in accepting the ID document and releasing the funds in December 2020. He 
then went on to assess the impact of the error PayPal had made on Mr G. He thought that 
as Mr G had received his funds sooner as a result of the error there was no impact on him, 
and no compensation was due.
Mr G was unhappy with this. He said he couldnt see how not being able to access his funds 
had no impact on him. He also queried what PayPal said about his ID not being valid.
As there was no agreement the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill start by setting out some context for the review of Mr Gs account. UK legislation places 
extensive obligations on regulated financial businesses. Financial institutions must establish 
the purpose and intended nature of transactions as well as the origin of funds, and there 
may be penalties if they dont. This applies to both new and existing relationships. These 
obligations override all other obligations. Having looked at the evidence I am satisfied that 
this is what PayPal was doing when it reviewed and blocked Mr Gs account.
Closure of the account and retention of funds
A financial institution is entitled to close an account with a customer just as a customer may 
close an account with a financial institution. But before a financial institution closes an 
account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the terms and conditions of the 
account. As the investigator has already set out the relevant account terms and user 
agreement, I wont be repeating them here.
Mr Gs account was closed on 15 February 2020. Looking at the terms and conditions I am 
satisfied that PayPal was entitled to close the account. So, Im satisfied PayPal didnt do 
anything wrong when it closed the account in line with the account terms.
PayPal withheld the funds in the account for 180 days. And having looked at the terms of the 
account Im satisfied they are entitled to do so. I dont think they have done anything wrong 
when they withheld Mr Gs funds for 180 days.
Mr G says he was frustrated that after 180 days PayPal didnt release his funds and 
continued to ask for ID documents. Mr G says he provided PayPal with the ID documents 
they requested, and he doesnt feel PayPal should have held on to his money for longer than 
180 days.  I appreciate that this was frustrating for Mr G. So, Ive considered if PayPal acted 
fairly when it didnt accept the documents Mr G provided. Looking at the evidence I am 
satisfied that PayPal s concerns about the validity of the ID documents were reasonable. It 
follows I dont think they acted unfairly when they requested more documentation and they 
withheld funds for a period over 180 days.
I know that Mr G would like to know the reasons for PayPals behaviour  the review and 
closure of the account as well as the retaining of the funds. Whilst Mr G mayve expected to 
be given the reasons PayPal isnt required to give him a specific reason for reviewing or 
closing the account. So, I cant say PayPal has done anything wrong by not giving Mr G this 
information  as much as hed like to know.
Mr G has said that PayPal released the funds after it accepted ID documents it had 
previously rejected and therefore, he feels he could have had access to his funds sooner.  
PayPal has explained that it didnt think the documents provided by Mr G were valid and it 
had made an error when it released the funds to Mr G when he produced a document he 
had previously presented to PayPal.  
Because of the error that PayPal made Mr G had access to his funds sooner than he would 
have, so I dont think he has suffered a detriment by PayPal accepting his ID documents in 
error. If anything, he is in a better position than he would have been, so I wont be awarding 
compensation for this.
In summary looking at the evidence before me I dont think PayPal acted unfairly and I wont 
be asking them to do anything else to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 February 2022.
