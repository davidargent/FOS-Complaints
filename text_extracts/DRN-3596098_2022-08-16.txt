The complaint
Mr V complains about the decision by Simplyhealth Access to turn down his private medical 
insurance claim.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
The policy explains that consultant referred diagnostic tests and procedures are 
covered. It also says the consultant must hold a current licence to practice and be (or 
have been) a consultant in an NHS hospital or the armed services. Finally, it says the 
consultant post must be a substantive appointment and the consultant must be 
included on the General Medical Councils (GMCs) specialist register.
Mr V accepts that Simplyhealth made him aware, before he had his scan, that the 
referral would need to be made by a consultant included on the GMC specialist 
register. Simplyhealths call notes support this. Mr V later advised Simplyhealth that 
the practitioner who had referred him for the scan was on the GMC specialist 
register, though he accepts this was an error.
Unfortunately, the practitioner who referred Mr V for his scan wasnt on the GMC 
specialist register. Im satisfied it was therefore reasonable for Simplyhealth to turn 
down the claim, as this was in line with the policy terms. 
Whilst I recognise my decision will disappoint Mr V, I dont find that Simplyhealth did 
anything wrong. 
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 September 2022.
