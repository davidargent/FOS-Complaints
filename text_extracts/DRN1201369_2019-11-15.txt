K820x#14complaint
Mr B and Mr R, on behalf of their company (Company W) complain that 
National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) treated them unfairly by closing Company Ws 
business account. 
background
On 11 March 2019, NatWest wrote  to the directors of Company W. It said:
We have recently undertaken a review of your banking arrangements with us and 
reached the conclusion that we will no longer provide these facilities.  You will 
therefore need to make alternative banking arrangements  outside  of 
The Royal Bank of Scotland  Group
You must repay all unarranged borrowing by 10 May 2019
All of your banking arrangements, including your accounts will be cancelled  and 
closed on 10 May 2019
We assure you that we have reached  this decision after careful consideration, 
however our decision is final and we are not prepared to enter into any discussion in 
relation to it.
Mr B called NatWest to ask why it decided to close the business account  and if it would have 
any impact on his other accounts.  The person  Mr B spoke to said he couldnt  discuss  the 
reasons for the banks decision and confirmed  it was just the business account  that the bank 
had taken the decision to close. Mr B complained  that NatWests decision was unfair. 
On 25 March 2019, Mr B called NatWest again. He said Ive received, me and my partner 
have received, letters from yourselves shutting all accounts down including business 
account within 60 days. The person Mr B spoke  to explained NatWest  doesnt have to give 
a reason, but he could appeal the banks decision to close his account. During this call, 
NatWest asked for details  of the accounts  and Mr B said Ill just choose one of these  ones 
that are on the letter. Ill give you [another account  number]. Mr B wanted a reason for the 
account closures, saying  NatWest was being unfair  he said that whilst he and Mr R are 
gamblers, its above board.  NatWest reiterated its not required to provide a reason  for its 
decision to close their account. 
Mr B called the bank  later the same  day. He checked when the business account was due to 
close. He said he knew he had 60 days notice for his personal  accounts. 
Unhappy with NatWests  response,  Mr B and Mr R referred this complaint to our service on 
behalf of Company W. Mr B and Mr R say NatWests decision to close this account was 
discriminatory and may be related to their legitimate gambling.
One of our investigators  reviewed this complaint but didnt  uphold it. The investigator was 
satisfied NatWest was entitled to close  Company Ws account  and provided appropriate 
notice of its intention  to close it. Our investigator didnt think  there was any evidence of 
discrimination in NatWests decision to close Company Ws account.  
Ref: DRN12013692Mr B and Mr R reiterated their concerns about NatWest  and asked an ombudsman to review 
their complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The terms and conditions  of Company  Ws account set out that it can close the account as 
long as it gives at least 60 days notice. Im satisfied NatWest gave the notice required and 
that Mr B and Mr R received it. 
Mr B and Mr R want to know  why NatWest decided to close this account and believe its 
decision is related  to their gambling. The terms of their account  dont  require NatWest  to 
disclose the reason for its decision so I cant say it was obliged to tell Mr B and Mr R why it 
decided to close Company Ws account.  On a call to NatWest,  I did hear Mr B explain his 
suspicions about why NatWest decided to close their account, but I dont think  NatWest said 
it decided to close this account because they gamble.
Whilst I appreciate Mr B and Mr R are disappointed with NatWests decision,  I think  it was 
entitled to give  and did give them  60 days notice of its intention to close  this account.  
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above, I dont  uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B and Mr R on 
behalf of Company W to accept or reject  my decision before 15 December  2019.
