The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wont refund a number of payments 
made out of his account by standing order that he says he didnt make, and about the 
service he received when raising this.
  
What happened
Mr A noticed a standing order for £40 going out of his account every week that he didnt 
recognise. The reference on the standing order was for a credit card with another bank, but 
Mr A said he didnt have a credit card with that bank, and wouldnt have paid it from his 
NatWest account if he did. So he phoned NatWest to report the standing order as fraud and 
ask for it to be cancelled.
NatWest couldnt say when or how the standing order was set up on the call, or give any 
more information about what it was for. But it did later write to Mr A saying the standing order 
had been set up in 2006 and suggesting he contact the other bank named in the reference 
about it. Mr A wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so referred his complaint to our 
service.
When providing its file to our service, NatWest included a copy of the standing order 
mandate used to set up the standing order, which was signed by Mr A. And Mr A has since 
accepted that the standing order was genuine. So our investigator who looked at the case 
didnt think NatWest should have to refund any of the standing order payments. NatWest 
also offered Mr A £50 as compensation for the poor customer service it provided, which our 
investigator felt was fair. Mr A disagreed, so the complaint has been passed to me.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Since our involvement in the case, Mr A has accepted that the standing order was set up by 
him and that he did have a credit card account with the other bank named on his statements. 
So it wouldnt be reasonable to require NatWest to refund any of the payments made as a 
result of the standing order and, in my decision, Ive concentrated on whether the 
compensation NatWest has offered is fair.
Mr A says he had to call NatWest a number of times on a number of different days, spoke to 
many different advisors and spent a significant amount of time on the phone. He also says 
NatWest took significantly longer to provide him with an answer than it said it would, didnt 
phone him back when it said it would several times and that he didnt receive a letter 
NatWest said it had sent. Mr A says he found this very frustrating and stressful.
NatWest has only been able to find a record of one call about the standing order, and its 
sent us a recording of this call. Having listened to it, I agree the customer service NatWest 
provided could have been better. And I dont doubt that there were further calls, and further 
customer service issues, as Mr A has said. But the call was made by Mr As daughter to 
NatWest, rather than by Mr A himself. And, from what Mr A has said, it appears his daughter 
dealt with most of this issue with NatWest on his behalf.
The Financial Ombudsman Service can only award compensation to the eligible complainant 
in a complaint, which in this case is Mr A, not his daughter. And we can only award 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience suffered by the complainant, not for that 
suffered by their representative. So while I dont doubt that there were customer service 
failings by NatWest, it appears most of the distress and inconvenience these caused will 
have been suffered by Mr As daughter, rather than by Mr A himself.
NatWest has also explained that, due to how long ago it was set up, the standing order 
mandate was stored on a separate system which its telephone advisors wouldnt have been 
able to access. And I dont think this is unreasonable. So I dont think its unreasonable that 
the advisors couldnt immediately tell Mr A when the standing order was set up.
Mr As statements also showed that the standing order was being paid to another bank, and 
included reference numbers for the payments. So its not clear why neither Mr A nor the 
other bank could identify what the standing order was for. And I think its important to note 
that Mr A was ultimately incorrect when he said he hadnt set up a standing order for a credit 
card with the other bank from his NatWest account, and the investigation wouldnt have 
taken as long as it did if he had recognised this from the information on his statement or 
when told when the standing order was set up.
So while I appreciate the impact this matter will have had on Mr A, I dont think it would be 
fair to hold NatWest responsible for all the distress and inconvenience he was caused. And I 
think the £50 NatWest has offered is fair and reasonable compensation in all the 
circumstances, for the distress and inconvenience it caused Mr A.
  
My final decision
National Westminster Bank Plc has already made an offer to pay £50 to settle this complaint, 
and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So my decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr A £50, if it hasnt 
already done so.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 December 2021.
