The complaint
Mr W complains that Lloyds Bank PLC failed to correctly calculate the closing balance of a 
credit card. 
What happened
Mr W had a credit card with Lloyds that was closed due to arrears in December 2008. Lloyds 
said Mr W owed a total of £10,690.78. 
In 2013 Lloyds sold the debt to another business. In 2018 Mr W made a complaint about 
Payment Protection insurance (PPI) that was sold in connection with his credit card. The 
complaint was upheld and Mr W received a settlement from Lloyds. 
Mr W also complained that Lloyds had added an interest refund of £1,989.20 to his account 
balance of £8,701.58 in error. Mr W has pointed out the final Lloyds credit card statement 
features a refund of interest of £1,989.20.
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Ws complaint but didnt uphold it. The 
investigator said interest refund noted on Lloyds December 2008 closing statement referred 
to its charge off process  the process if follows when terminating an account due to arrears. 
The interest refund quoted didnt refer to money Lloyds was due to pay Mr W. As a result, 
the investigator said the total balance of £10,690.78 Lloyds says was outstanding on the 
date Mr Ws credit card was closed is correct. 
Mr W asked to appeal and has pointed to various balances quoted on statements he 
obtained via a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). Mr W has explained hes been unable 
to reach the same figure as given by Lloyds. As Mr W asked to appeal, his complaint has 
been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr W has asked why his statement gives an outstanding balance of £10,512.97 on 12 
November 2008 but the closing balance was quoted as £10,690.78. Lloyds has confirmed 
the difference of £177.81 represents the additional interest applied to Mr Ws credit card 
between 12 November 2008 (when the statement was produced) and 12 December 2008, 
the date it closed the account. Im satisfied thats why the balance on 12 November 2008 
was lower than the default balance. 
Lloyds has explained that the way it closed Mr Ws account in December 2008 meant the 
final statement referred to a refund of interest of £1,989.20. Im sorry to disappoint Mr W 
but this wasnt interest he was owed by Lloyds, it was a systems adjustment. 
I understand Mr Ws been unable to reach the same balance. Ive looked at the available 
information to see whether its accurate. 
When Mr W complained about PPI, Lloyds produced an account reconstruction. The account 
reconstruction shows all balances, monthly interest charges, fees and spending on the 
account up to December 2008. It also shows Mr Ws payments and any arrears that built up. 
If Mr W doesnt have a copy of this document, hes welcome to request it from our 
investigator. Ive also looked at the statement information available in conjunction with the 
rest of the file and everything Mr W has sent us. Im satisfied £10,690.78, the figure Lloyds 
said was the final outstanding balance as at 12 December 2008, is accurate. I havent found 
Lloyds made a mistake in calculating the final balance. 
Mr W has also queried the balance that was sold by Lloyds in August 2012. I can see that 
the balance in March 2012 was £10,113.78 as quoted in the Notice of Assignment Lloyds 
sent him. The account transactions show that Mr W made payments in April, May, June and 
July 2012 and I can see they were forwarded to the new debt owner by Lloyds. So whilst I 
agree the balance given in the Notice of Assignment wasnt correct at the point Lloyds sold 
the debt in August 2012, I am satisfied all the payments Mr W made were applied to the 
outstanding balance. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr W but Im satisfied the figures given by Lloyds are correct. As Ive 
said above, the interest refund referred to in Lloyds final statement was an internal 
adjustment it made. The figure given wasnt in relation to refund that was owed to Mr W or 
for interest that hadnt been correctly charged. As Im satisfied Lloyds didnt make errors 
when calculating the outstanding balance, Im not telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2021.
