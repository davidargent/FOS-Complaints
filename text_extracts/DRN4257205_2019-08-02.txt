Mrs P complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid was irresponsible  when it 
provided her with a number of loans.
background 
Mrs P took seven loans  with QuickQuid between March 2008  and September  2009. They 
ranged from £150 to £650. Below is a table I've prepared from some of the information  
QuickQuid has provided about Mrs Ps loans.

QuickQuid initially objected to this Service looking into Mrs Ps complaint  because it said that 
shed complained too late. We explained why we thought we could  look into it and our 
adjudicator upheld her complaint about  Loans 5, 6 and 7. QuickQuid doesnt wholly agree 
with our adjudicators  assessment of the merits of Mrs Ps complaint but has made an offer 
to put things right in respect of Loans 6 and 7. This wasnt in line with what our adjudicator 
recommended. QuickQuid also said that there was an outstanding balance on Loan 7 and 
wanted to deduct that balance from any compensation  it has to pay to Mrs P.
Mrs P didnt accept the offer. As no agreement was reached, the matter came to me - an 
ombudsman - for a decision. A few weeks ago I issued a provisional decision.  This was 
because, although Id reached the same outcome as our adjudicator,  I wanted  to clarifying 
how QuickQuid should put things right. And I wanted to give the parties an opportunity  to 
come back  to me with anything further they wanted me to consider  before I issued  my final 
decision. 
This is my final decision. If Mrs P accepts it, it will be binding on the parties.
my findings
Ive once again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general  approach  
to complaints about short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules, guidance and 
good industry practice  on our website. 
Mrs P has told us that she accepts my provisional  decision. QuickQuid has also responded 
and I've thought carefully about what it has said. But Im not persuaded to change my mind.  I 
realise it will be disappointed but I hope  that my explanation below will help it understand 
how I have reached my decision.
To begin with, this is what I said in my provisional  decision:
Ref: DRN42572052Broadly speaking QuickQuid  needed to take reasonable  care when providing loans to 
borrowers and to take account of their interests when  doing so. It had to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate checks before  
providing the loans. And as well as considering  the individual affordability of each loan, 
QuickQuid should also have stepped back and looked at the overall  pattern of lending to see 
if there was a point at which it ought to have realised it wasnt in the best interests of Mrs P  to 
continue making advances. In other words, did the pattern of lending suggest  Mrs P was in 
difficulty or that the borrowing had otherwise become  problematic? And if so, did QuickQuid 
act fairly  and reasonably  by continuing to approve advances after that point?
Mrs P hasnt raised any objection to our adjudicators findings in relation to Loans 1, 2, 3 
and 4  the loans he didnt  uphold. So it seems to me that those  loans are not in dispute. With 
that in mind, Im thinking  about  what happened  from Loan 5 onwards (aware  that QuickQuid  
itself accepts that something went wrong  with Loans 6 and 7)  and how QuickQuid should  
put things right.
By the time Mrs P took Loan 5 this was her fifth loan in seven months.  The amounts had 
generally been increasing  and shed  been  late in making a repayment on Loan 3 for which 
she was charged  a fee.  Additionally, there was only ever a few days (usually  five or six) 
between Mrs P repaying one loan and taking  the next.  From her statement of account  it looks 
as though  there  was an eleven day gap between Loans 2 and 3 but I've seen emails which 
show that she actually applied  for this loan on 3 July  so the gap was in reality  only about 7 
days. Just five days after repaying Loan 4 Mrs P came back to QuickQuid to borrow  the 
highest amount yet. She had declared the same monthly income throughout  - £1,900.
Mrs P went on to extend Loan 5 on four occasions so it took her 177 days  to repay a loan 
intended to last 56 days. She was again charged a late fee on this loan. And five days after 
repaying Loan  5 she asked QuickQuid for another loan  this time £650.  The largest  of the 
repayments was due to be £812.50. This was a significant proportion of Mrs Ps income and 
left her with a very reduced disposable income  from which she had to meet her normal 
monthly expenses such as her mortgage, bills, food and transport.
Mrs P struggled to repay Loan 6 as agreed.   It was extended. She then missed a payment 
and an arrangement to pay the balance over two dates, four days apart, was agreed. Having 
clearly struggled to repay Loan 6, QuickQuid provided Mrs P with Loan 7 just six days later.
I'm satisfied  that QuickQuid  shouldve known that further borrowing after Loan 4 was likely to 
be unsustainable for Mrs P  and was potentially  harmful  given the high interest  she needed 
to pay and the record  of repeat borrowing  would  leave on her credit file.  The pattern  of 
lending suggested  that Mrs P was using high cost short term loans to bridge the holes left in 
her finances  by having to repay earlier loans.  This led to a cycle of her having  to borrow more  
and more  to make ends meet. This wasnt sustainable.   So QuickQuid was irresponsible to 
provide Loans 5, 6 and 7. And I uphold  Mrs Ps complaint about  those loans.
In QuickQuids statement of account it shows that as of 3 September 2010 there was an 
outstanding balance of £797.49 on Loan  7. When QuickQuid initially made an offer to Mrs P it 
wanted to deduct £650 outstanding principal on Loan 7. 
But Mrs P has shown  us a letter from a third party debt collector to whom  the debt had been  
sold. This was dated  31 July 2012. It stated that the outstanding balance was £797.49 but in 
order to draw a conclusion  to the matter they were willing to offer Mrs P an opportunity to 
agree a repayment value that was 70% less than the balance owing on the provision that 
paying that sum would exonerate her from any further liability. The sum stated was £239.25.    
Mrs P also sent us a copy of a transaction confirmation dated 31 July 2012 showing  that a 
payment to the third party  was being processed. 
Ref: DRN42572053More recently QuickQuid has confirmed that it has heard from the third party  that there was 
still a balance outstanding  of £558.24  as Mrs P had made a payment of £239.25 to the third 
party in August 2012.  
From what I can see on the statement of account, it seems Mrs P paid QuickQuid £364.01  
towards Loan 7 before it was sold on. That together what she paid to the third party (£239.25) 
amounts to £603.26.  I accept that this doesnt amount to the full amount of principal she 
borrowed (£650) as it leaves  the sum of £46.74 principal still outstanding. 
Usually our approach would be to allow a business to offset an outstanding principal  balance 
against any refund. But in this case I think the fair thing  to do is to treat all the payments 
Mrs P made towards Loan 7 as payments towards the principal and then to write off the 
outstanding balance. Im not intending to allow QuickQuid  to deduct  any outstanding balance  
on Loan 7 from the compensation payable  in respect of Loans 5 and 6. 
In response to my provisional decision,  QuickQuid  says it disagrees with my conclusion that 
it shouldnt have provided Mrs P with Loan 5. Amongst other things it says she didnt show  
any signs of financial struggle during her first four loans. I explained in my provisional 
decision why I think that at the point Mrs P took Loan 5 further borrowing was likely to be 
unsustainable and potentially harmful. The pattern  of lending  before then was demonstrating 
a reliance on short-term high-cost credit to meet the gaps in her finances left by the 
repayment of previous  loans. 
So Im satisfied that QuickQuid failed to take account of Mrs Ps interests and acted unfairly  
when it provided  Loan  5 and the following loans to her. And Im upholding Mrs Ps complaint  
about Loans 5, 6 and 7.
putting things right
QuickQuid hasnt commented on how I proposed it should put things right.  So I see no 
reason to change  what I said in my provisional  decision.
I'm satisfied that QuickQuid was irresponsible when  it provided Loans  5, 6 and 7 to Mrs P   
the loans taken on 28 October 2008,  28 April 2009  and 3 September  2009. And I require 
QuickQuid to put things right in the following way:
refund  all interest and charges Mrs P paid to QuickQuid on the loans she took 
on 28 October 2008 and 28 April 2009 (Loans 5 and 6 in my table);
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from 
the date they were  paid to the date of settlement*;
remove all interest and charges from Loan  7 and treat all the payments made 
by Mrs P towards  Loan 7 as though they were towards the principal. This will 
leave a small principal outstanding  balance  which should be written off:
the number  of loans taken from 28 October 2008 onwards means any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 
approved from this point onwards should be removed  from Mrs Ps credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mrs P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN42572054my final decision
For the reasons  explained in my provisional decision and above, I uphold  Mrs Ps complaint  
in part and require CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right in the way I've outlined.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 September 2019.
