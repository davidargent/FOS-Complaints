The complaint
Miss H said shed asked NewDay Ltd to cancel her card, and set up a payment plan for her.
But she said it hadnt done that. Miss H wanted NewDay to remove all the interest and
charges on her account from 11 January 2021, and set up the plan shed asked for then.
  
What happened
Miss H said that shed first contacted NewDay using the app, on 11 January, and asked it to
set up a payment plan for her. But the alerts didnt work on her app, so she wasnt notified
when she received a reply to her messages.
Miss H then wrote to NewDay with an offer of payment. She set out some information about
her monthly expenditure, and initially offered £50. In a later letter, she said the most she
could now afford was £40 per month.
Miss H wanted NewDay to waive all the interest and charges it had applied since she first
asked it to close the card, on 11 January.
NewDay said it had sent Miss H two complaint response letters. The first one dealt with the
problems shed been having with the app, NewDay apologised for that and paid Miss H a
gesture of goodwill of £10. NewDay said it had tried to ring Miss H to discuss her payment
plan with her. It hadnt yet been able to speak to her, but would call again.
NewDay then wrote again on 4 March, to say that it understood Miss H didnt want to speak
to it. It said in this letter that it had been able to put a payment plan in place with her, but it
doesnt appear that this was actually done at this time, because NewDay also said it sent
Miss H an income and expenditure form on that date. No response was received.
NewDay said it wouldnt remove the interest and charges which had been applied since
January. It said those were valid.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said NewDay made a
number of efforts to get in touch with Miss H. But Miss H didnt want to speak to NewDay.
NewDay also sent Miss H an income and expenditure form by post, but hadnt got any reply.
Our investigator said NewDays regulator requires it to assess Miss Hs circumstances. And
to do that it needs detailed information on her income and expenditure. Our investigator said
that until Miss H provided this information to NewDay, it didnt have to remove interest and
fees from her account.
Miss H didnt agree. She said shed already provided her income and expenditure, in a letter 
to NewDay. And her complaint letters also recorded that NewDay hadnt been in touch. Miss 
H wanted to see all the letters and call recordings, so she could disprove what NewDay had 
alleged. When these were sent to her, she said she couldnt open them. She hasnt 
responded to our services request for a different format that she would find easier to use.
Because no agreement was reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I proposed only to 
uphold it in part. This is what I said then: 
Although Miss H did previously indicate she wanted to comment further on the 
evidence NewDay has offered, it doesnt seem as if she still wants to do that. And I 
think the key evidence in this case is the evidence that Miss H has supplied herself  
in particular the information she shared with NewDay about her income and 
expenditure. So I think I can fairly provide a provisional decision on this case now.
Miss H first attempted to discuss a payment plan with NewDay using its chat facility. 
This doesnt appear to me to be well placed to set up a payment plan, and I think it 
wouldve been helpful if Miss H had been told from the start that NewDay was likely 
to want to talk to her.
Miss H persisted with the app for some time, then she wrote to NewDay. Shes taken 
the view that she sent NewDay enough information for it to set up a plan, because 
she told it her approximate income, and listed expenditure. She thinks it should then 
have set up a plan, and backdated this to 11 January, when she first asked it to help.
I can see that at one point NewDay said it had set up a plan for Miss H, but it hadnt. 
It says it didnt have enough information to do so.
I know that Miss H has repeatedly said that shed given NewDay all the information it 
needed to set up her plan, and had provided income and expenditure information. 
But I dont think that the information Miss H has provided was enough for NewDay to 
set up a plan for her. 
Miss H told us shed set out what she could afford. But I still think that a detailed 
consideration of Miss Hs income and expenditure was important. NewDay would 
know that people in financial difficulties often overestimate how much they can pay 
towards a debt. So NewDay would want to look closely at what Miss H could afford, 
and it would want to make sure it wasnt asking for too much money.
And theres another reason why it would be helpful for NewDay to talk to Miss H. A 
plan can have an impact on Miss Hs credit file, so NewDay needs to explain any 
impact to Miss H. I think that is usually best done over the phone.
But I can see that NewDay also offered to do this by post, if Miss H wanted to 
complete the relevant forms. I havent seen anything to suggest that Miss H has 
completed these. So I dont think NewDay had to put a plan in place for her.
I do think that there have been instances where NewDay could have provided better 
service to Miss H. I think it might have helped if she was told early on that she would 
probably need to speak to NewDay to set up the plan she wanted. And I dont think 
she should have been told NewDay had set up a plan for her, when what it had 
actually done was sent an income and expenditure form by post, for her to complete. 
I think NewDay should pay Miss H £100 for the impact of these lapses in service.
But I dont think that NewDay has to remove all the interest and fees on Miss Hs 
card, back to 11 January 2021. Ive explained why I think that NewDay was right to 
say that Miss H would need to give it more information before it could set up a plan.I can see NewDay did try to work within the app initially, but Miss H apparently wasnt 
seeing notifications to say that NewDay had asked her questions there. And it told us 
it has called her, but she hasnt wanted to discuss payment onto her account. 
NewDay has told us it made repeated efforts to contact Miss H. And I do not simply 
rely on what NewDay says here  Miss H also told us that shed been bombarded 
by efforts to contact her about her account. Whilst it is likely that some of those 
contacts were requests for payment, I do think it is likely that NewDay has repeatedly 
tried to get in touch with her about her plan.
For those reasons, I dont think that NewDay has made a mistake by not setting up a 
plan on 11 January, or shortly thereafter. And I think it did what I would expect it to 
do, in terms of trying to get in touch with Miss H to get the extra information it 
needed, to set up a plan for her. So I dont think NewDay has to make the refunds 
that Miss H wants now. I know Miss H will be disappointed, but I dont think this part 
of her complaint should be upheld.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss H said that she was sending us proof that shed provided a detailed income and 
expenditure to NewDay. She said she knew this was received and placed on its system. 
Miss H attached a letter dated 16 March 2021, which she has sent to our service before, and 
which I considered before reaching my provisional decision in this case. 
The letter Miss H showed us doesnt contain the level of detail that I would expect to see in 
an income and expenditure assessment. I also note that its not consistent with other 
information on her income and expenditure that Miss H had sent to NewDay. On 13 
February she provided some information on her monthly expenses to NewDay, and included 
there rent of £550. But only a month later, she records her rent as £500 per month. 
It is of course possible that Miss Hs rent had changed during this time. But I would expect 
NewDay to have noted this inconsistency, and Id also expect it would want to resolve it 
before setting up a plan for Miss H, as well as to gather the more detailed information which I 
would normally expect NewDay to consider before assessing what Miss H could afford. So I 
still dont think NewDay had to set up a payment plan in response to Miss Hs letter. 
NewDay said it had understood that Id provisionally decided it didn't make a mistake by not 
setting up a payment plan on 11 January 2021 or shortly thereafter. But Id asked NewDay to 
pay Miss H £100.00 in compensation because I thought there were instances where 
NewDay could have provided better service to Miss H as follows:
-When Miss H was trying to use its messaging service, NewDay could have told her 
she would probably need to speak to us to set up a payment plan.
-NewDay told Miss H that a payment plan was set up for her when instead an income 
and expenditure form had been issued by post.
NewDay said Miss H initially contacted it on 11 January through the messaging service. She 
wanted her card to be cancelled and a payment plan to be set up. NewDay said it has 
accepted that she experienced issues, has apologised and compensated her with £10.00.NewDay says that the messaging service shows Miss H was advised to call NewDay on 20 
January 2021, seven working days later. NewDay said although it appreciated this caused 
Miss H some inconvenience, her monthly statements and letters sent in December 2020 had 
NewDay's phone number. NewDay said that, as Miss H struggled to use its messaging 
system, she could have called NewDay when she found this system problematic. Her call 
would have been transferred to the Customer Care Team, and a staff member could have 
gone through her income and expenditure details over the phone and set up a payment plan.
NewDay said it wasnt suggesting Miss H didnt experience problems with its messaging 
service But it did feel that she could have done more to mitigate the delays she experienced.
I understand the point that NewDay makes here, but I think that in the situation Miss H 
described, NewDay was always likely to want to speak to her about her income and 
expenditure. So I still think it would have been helpful for NewDay to set this out at the start.
NewDay also said that it couldnt see any evidence that it had told Miss H that a payment 
plan was set up for her. It wanted me to set out when this happened. 
NewDays final response letter, dated 4 March 2021, said I understand our Customer Care 
team has now made contact with you, and a £50 a month payment has been agreed. But 
the notes from its collections team show that Miss H spoke to it briefly on that date. She 
didnt want to provide income and expenditure information over the phone, and asked 
NewDay to accept her previous offer of £50. She also asked NewDay to respond to this offer 
in writing. But those notes also show that NewDay then decided not to accept this offer, and 
an income and expenditure form was posted to Miss H, on this date. 
So I do think NewDay told Miss H a plan was agreed, when it wasnt, and that was unhelpful.
Ive considered the further points that both Miss H and NewDay have made, but I havent 
changed my mind. Ill now make the decision I originally proposed.
  
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must pay Miss H £100 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 November 2021.
