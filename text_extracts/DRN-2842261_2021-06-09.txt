The complaint
Mr T complains that, when a payment was made into his current account by mistake,
National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) applied it to his overdraft and then off-set the
remaining balance against an outstanding loan. Mr T says this has caused him problems, as
the mistaken payment needs to be returned to the payer.
  
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on 26 April 2021, a copy of which is attached as it forms part 
of this final decision.
The parties have both seen the provisional decision. Mr T hasnt provided any further 
comments. NatWest has agreed to return the sum of £1,342.80 to Mr Ts employer (B). But it 
has said it cant carry this out in quite the way I had suggested. Ive explained this in more 
detail below.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent been provided with any new information which changes my mind about the merits 
of this complaint. So, I still think NatWest should return the sum of £1,342.80 to Bs bank, 
which is what I recommended in my provisional decision. This is the amount of Bs mistaken 
payment less the £480 which was paid out by standing order on 27 December 2019. 
As I explained before, I dont think NatWest needs to repay the £480 because it had advised 
Mr T in its letter of 5 December 2019 to cancel any standing orders on his account. Mr T 
hadnt cancelled this standing order, so I dont find it to be NatWests fault that the payment 
went out. And, in the sense that the money went to the recipient set up by Mr T, Mr T has 
had the benefit of that money.
In order to repay the £1,342.80, I had previously indicated that NatWest should reverse the 
set-off of £355.35 which was made to Mr Ts loan account on 6 January 2020. That would 
have meant putting the £355.35 back into Mr Ts current account. The repayment could then 
have been made from there, using the £355.35 plus the £987.45 which had been used to 
clear Mr Ts overdraft. But NatWest has said it cant approach the repayment in this way 
because Mr Ts current account has now been closed.
NatWest has said it can instead debit Mr Ts loan account with the amount of £1,342.80 and 
return this sum to Bs account. I think thats a reasonable approach, as long as there is no 
detriment to Mr T in approaching it this way. 
The approach set out in my provisional decision meant that Mr T would go back to having an 
overdraft with NatWest and that his loan account would be debited by £355.35. Debiting the 
full £1,342.80 from the loan account means that Mr T wont have the overdraft. But hell owe 
£1,342.80 more on the loan than he does today. Mr T was always going to go back to owing 
this amount to NatWest, as I explained in my provisional decision. But it wouldnt be fair for 
him to be any worse off as a result of owing it all on the loan as opposed to split between the 
loan and the overdraft. So NatWest should make sure that he is no worse off, by way of 
interest or charges for example, as a result of it handling the repayment in this way.
Subject to that, I think this is a fair outcome in all the circumstances of this complaint. Once 
NatWest has returned the sum of £1,342.80 to B, NatWest and Mr T should seek to agree a 
mutually acceptable arrangement to clear Mr Ts debt, whether under the DMP or otherwise.  
    
My final decision
For the reasons above, and as set out in my provisional decision (attached below), I uphold 
this complaint in part. My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should:
debit Mr Ts loan account by £1,342.80;
ensure that the debit does not give rise to any charges or interest or trigger any other 
negative consequences in relation to the account (other than the debit itself); and
return the sum of £1,342.80 to Bs bank, where it came from.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2021.

Copy of provisional decision
The complaint
Mr T complains that, when a payment was made into his current account by mistake,
National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) applied it to his overdraft and then off-set the
remaining balance against an outstanding loan. Mr T says this has caused him problems, as
the mistaken payment needs to be returned to the payer.
What happened
Mr T has an overdraft and two loans with NatWest. In December 2019, he entered into a
Debt Management Plan (DMP) and his NatWest current account became non-operational.
Mr T was told to cut up and return his bank cards, which he says he did. NatWest told Mr T
to arrange alternative banking facilities and arrange for any credits into his account to be
redirected to his alternative bank account. He had an account with another bank which he
began to use as his active current account, instead of the NatWest account.
Mr Ts employer (who Ill call B) had the details of this other bank account and had paid his
November salary into it. But, when it came to pay his December wages, B pressed the
wrong button and sent the money to the old NatWest account by mistake. B immediately
realised what had happened and sent another payment to Mr Ts active account at the other
bank, so that Mr T had his December money. But this meant that B had paid out the
December wages twice, so it wanted the NatWest payment back.
Mr T says that B contacted its own bank when it realised it had sent the payment to the
wrong place. But he says that Bs bank advised that, if the NatWest account was closed, the
payment would bounce back automatically. It seems that Mr T was under the impression that
his NatWest account was closed. In fact, it was simply non-operational, meaning that,
although Mr T couldnt actively use it, it was still open and could receive payments. For this
reason, the payment wasnt automatically returned to B. It credited Mr Ts account.
Mr T says that, when the payment didnt bounce back to Bs bank, he called NatWest himself
to tell it what had happened. He says the person he spoke to was unhelpful and advised him
to come to the Financial Ombudsman Service. He doesnt have any evidence of making this
phone call now, and NatWest cant find any record of it. NatWest says that it wasnt
contacted at the time by either Mr T or B.
The amount of the payment from B was £1,822.80 and it credited Mr Ts account on 16
December 2019. The account was overdrawn by £987.45 at the time, so the payment
immediately put it into credit by £835.35. A standing order of £480 went out to a third party
on 27 December, leaving the account in credit by £355.35. On 6 January 2020, NatWest
exercised a right of set off over this sum and applied it to Mr Ts loan account.
When Mr T complained to NatWest about this, it said it had acted in line with the terms and
conditions of his account and didnt uphold the complaint. Mr T then came to this service and
our investigator looked into it. She didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly and didnt ask it to
do anything. But Mr T remains unhappy and the situation with Bs mistaken payment is
unresolved. B needs to be paid back but, for the reasons above, Mr T isnt in a position to
return the payment. He says this is causing him a great deal of stress and is straining the
relationship with his employer. He wants NatWest to refund the money to B. He would then
like to go back to making payments to NatWest under the DMP.
NatWest now accepts that the payment into Mr Ts account was a mistake by B. But it hasnt
agreed to do anything about it because it says there hasnt been a bank error on NatWests
part. It says that B needs to raise a claim through its own bank for the return of funds. This
has happened within the last month. But Bs bank has said that, as the funds credited Mr Ts
account, theres nothing it can do. As the situation remains unresolved, the case has now
come to me for a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.I note NatWests comment that this complaint was originally about its use of the right of set
off only, and not about returning the funds to B. There are several aspects to this complaint.
But its clear from Mr Ts complaint form that he wanted NatWest to pay the money back to
B. Im satisfied that its within my remit to consider this issue. Since the involvement of this
service, NatWest has been involved in detailed discussions about the mistaken payment and
the need for B to be paid back. So Im satisfied that its had the opportunity to make clear its
position on this issue and it has done so.
Having considered everything carefully, Im planning to uphold this complaint in part. I
understand that NatWests position is that it hasnt made a mistake here so it shouldnt have
to return the funds. But, even if NatWest hasnt done anything wrong, it is in the best place
to help resolve the dispute. The role of this service is to resolve complaints and to decide
them by reference to what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. Here,
Im satisfied that NatWest is the party which is able to take the steps needed to resolve the
problem and bring about a fair outcome. So I intend to ask it to return some of the funds to
Bs bank. Ill explain my findings in more detail below.
Mr T says his account was supposed to be closed and so the money shouldnt have been
able to go in. But Im satisfied that the account wasnt closed and that NatWest wasnt
required to close it. It was non-operational, which meant that Mr T couldnt use the account,
but it remained open to receive payments, for example under the DMP. NatWest confirmed
that the account would become non-operational in its letter accepting the DMP. I understand
that the distinction between a closed account and a non-operational account may not have
been clear to Mr T. But I dont find that NatWest was at fault for allowing the payment into
the account.
NatWest says that Mr T made no attempt to withdraw the funds at the time. But he couldnt
have done so as he had no payment cards or cheque books (following NatWests advice to
return them) and the account was by that stage non-operational. So I dont think non-withdrawal of the 
funds indicates Mr Ts agreement to them being used by NatWest to clear debts.
NatWest also says that Mr T didnt contact it to request access to the funds, so it doesnt
think it did anything wrong by exercising its right of set off. Its a point of difference between
the parties as to when Mr T first contacted NatWest about the payment: he says it was in
December 2019, NatWest says it wasnt until after 6 January 2020. Its also in dispute as to
whether or not Mr T informed NatWest at the time that the payment had been a mistake. I
havent seen any evidence which confirms the dates or content of any phone contact
between the parties. On balance, I find it unlikely that NatWest knew the payment into Mr Ts
account was a mistake when it exercised the right of set off.
But its now clear that the payment into Mr Ts NatWest account was a mistake by B and
NatWest accepts that. It was a mistaken, duplicate wages payment. It wasnt Mr Ts money.
So I dont think NatWest is entitled to use it to pay Mr Ts debts. I dont think NatWest knew
this at the time, but it does know now and is able to correct the position.
NatWest says that, if it had been told at the time that the payment had been made by
mistake, it would have told Mr T that B needed to raise a claim through its own bank.
NatWest says this would have rectified the issue. But B has now raised a claim through its
own bank and that claim has been unsuccessful. The reason given is that payment has
credited before the account was closed so B has been advised to deal direct with the known
beneficiaries. I find it likely that the outcome would have been the same even if the claim had
been made in December 2019.
Because B isnt able to claim the money back through its own bank, it is looking to Mr T to
recover the money. But Mr T doesnt have access to the money because it has been applied
to the overdraft and loan by NatWest and he cant operate the account. Mr T has explained
that the situation is causing him difficulties. He went from a position of owing money to
NatWest which was being repaid under the DMP, to owing a lump sum to his employer
which is straining his work relationship.To put things right and resolve this complaint, I think NatWest should reverse the set-off it
made on 6 January 2020 and return the sum of £1,342.80 to Bs bank. This is the amount of
Bs payment less the £480 which was paid out by standing order on 27 December 2019. I
dont think NatWest needs to repay the £480 because it had advised Mr T in its letter of 5
December 2019 to cancel any standing orders on his account. Mr T hadnt cancelled this
standing order, so I dont find it to be NatWests fault that the payment went out. And, in the
sense that the money went to the recipient set up by Mr T, Mr T has had the benefit of that
money.
NatWest should then adjust Mr Ts current and loan accounts to put them in the position they
would be in without the benefit of Bs mistaken payment. Once this has happened, Mr T will
owe that money to NatWest again and NatWest will have the right to pursue Mr T for the
outstanding overdraft and loan balances. The parties should seek to agree a mutually
acceptable arrangement to clear the debt, whether under the DMP or otherwise, and Mr T
will need to actively engage with NatWest to achieve this.
I understand that this situation has been very stressful and prolonged for Mr T. But I think a
fair outcome will be achieved if the above steps are taken. I dont plan to make an award for
distress and inconvenience here, despite the upset which I know Mr T has experienced. Nor
do I intend to award interest on the sum to be returned to B. Thats because I dont find that
the problem here was of NatWests making, so I dont think it would be fair to ask it to pay
compensation or interest. Im asking NatWest to reverse the payment (save for the £480)
because the recent developments in this case confirm that the payment into Mr Ts account
was a mistake and that it cant be recovered through Bs bank. Mr T hasnt had the benefit of
that money (other than the £480), so he cant return the funds to B. NatWest is the only party
which is able to correct the mistake here.
My provisional decision
For the reasons above, my provisional decision is that I intend to uphold this complaint in
part and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to:
reverse the set-off of £355.35 which was made to Mr Ts loan account on 6 January
2020;
return the sum of £1,342.80 to Bs bank, where it came from; and
adjust Mr Ts current and loan accounts to put them in the position they would be in if
the mistaken payment by B had never been made.
