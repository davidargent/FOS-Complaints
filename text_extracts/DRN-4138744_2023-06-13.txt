The complaint
Mr L complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC wont refund the full amount of money he lost 
after he fell victim to an authorised push payment (APP) scam. 
What happened
The background to this complaint is well-known to both parties, so I wont repeat it in detail 
here. But in summary and based on the submissions of both parties, I understand it to be as 
follows.
Mr L complains that starting on 04 March 2021 he made several payments from his account 
held with Barclays to what he thought was a legitimate investment with a third-party 
company.

In 2021, Mr L says he was called by a company and convinced into investing in 
cryptocurrency. Mr L was assigned an account manager who helped him set up an account 
and a wallet to deposit funds. At the same time and unknown to Mr L, the person posing as 
the account manager also gained control of his computer and wallet through an app he 
convinced Mr L to download. 
In March 2021 Mr L began depositing funds into his wallet and as his investment increased, 
he continued to send regular payments to increase the funds available to invest. 
Over the period of Mr L sending the funds, he says he had several account managers and 
was able to withdraw funds on two occasions. When Mr L tried to withdraw more money 
from his account and was unable to, he became suspicious and concluded that he had been 
the victim of a scam. So, he logged a complaint with Barclays. 
Barclays looked into Mr Ls complaint and partially upheld it. Barclays said that even though 
the transactions were beyond the scope of Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM) rules 
(as the payments went to a legitimate bank account and then transferred to a wallet in the 
consumers name), it decided to offer a partial refund of £47,049.50. This represented 50% 
of the payments Mr L made from 27 January 2022. Barclays acknowledged that from 27 
January the payments were unusual for the account and that no intervention was made until 
the final payment. Furthermore, Barclays waived a £9,500 Barclays loan and offered 8% 
compensatory interest and a £150 distress and inconvenience payment.
Barclays offered 50% of the total paid as it felt Mr L hadnt done enough to safeguard himself 
against the scam, what it referred to as contributory negligence. Mr L didnt agree with the 
offer of settlement, so he brought his complaint to our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt find Barclays needed to pay any further 
money to resolve the complaint. She said that the payments made up to 27 January 2022 
were relatively small and in line with the other spending on Mr Ls account around that time. 
So, she didnt think these shouldve been flagged by Barclays as suspicious or at risk of 
financial harm. 
Our investigator went on to say that the payment of £3,000.00 onwards shouldve been 
flagged by Barclays and it wasnt, so it was fair to make an offer of settlement from this date. 
Our investigator also agreed that the offer should be for 50% of what was sent from this 
date. 
Mr L didnt agree with the investigators view, so the complaints been passed to me for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Prevention
In broad terms, the starting position in law is that a bank is expected to process payments 
and withdrawals that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance with the Payment 
Services Regulations and the terms and conditions of the customers account. And I have 
taken that into account when deciding what is fair and reasonable in this case.Im very aware that Ive summarised this complaint briefly, in less detail than has been 
provided, and in my own words. No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on 
what I think is the heart of the matter here. If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt 
because Ive ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual 
point or argument to be able to reach what I think is the right outcome. Our rules allow me to 
do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as a free alternative to the 
courts.
Im satisfied that although Mr L didnt intend his money to go to a fraudster, he did authorise 
the payments. I understand he wouldnt have authorised the payments if hed known the 
investment was a scam, but Barclays are expected to process payments that a customer 
authorises or instructs it to make, and that is what it did. The Payment Services Regulations 
(PSRs), state that payments are authorised if the payer consented to them and, in this case, 
Im satisfied Mr L consented to the payments as at the time he believed he was making 
payments for the purposes of a legitimate investment.
However, where the customer has been the victim of a scam, it may sometimes be fair and 
reasonable for the bank to reimburse them even though they authorised the payments.
Taking into account the law, regulatory rules and guidance, relevant codes of practice and 
what I consider having been good industry practice at the time, I consider Barclays should 
fairly and reasonably:
Have been monitoring accounts  and any payments made or received  to counter 
various risks, including anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, 
and preventing fraud and scams;
Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that 
might indicate its customers were at risk of fraud (amongst other things). This is 
particularly so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, 
which banks are generally more familiar with than the average customer; and
In some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken 
additional steps, or made additional checks, before processing a payment, or in 
some cases declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect customers from 
the possibility of financial harm from fraud.
Our service has referenced the relevant rules, codes of practice and good industry practice 
at the time in many previous decisions published on our website.
Having considered the circumstances of the payments Mr L made, I very much agree with 
the investigator and Barclays when they highlighted the first payments up to 27 January 
2022 were reasonably in line with other payments Mr L was making from his account around 
that time. Mr L had made payments of the same amount and slightly less, so Im not 
persuaded Barclays shouldve flagged these as suspicious or unusual and alerted Mr L or 
done further checks. 
I am satisfied that the payments after that date were much higher and were out of character 
for Mr L s spending. So, these shouldve flagged, and Barclays have correctly agreed to 
refund some of this money from that date. 
Recovery
Barclays didnt attempt to recover any of the funds, but Im not convinced this wouldve had 
any impact on getting Mr Ls money back. After the payments were made, I couldnt 
reasonably expect Barclays to have done anything further until Mr L notified it of the scam. 
And here, Mr L didnt instruct Barclays to send the payments directly to the scammers but instead to cryptocurrency account(s) held in his own name. Thats what Barclays did. I dont 
think it was ever likely that Barclays would be able to facilitate recovery of the payments after 
Mr L moved the payments from his cryptocurrency account(s) onto the scammers. So, I dont 
think I can hold Barclays responsible for Mr L being unable to recover his funds.
Should Mr L bear some responsibility for his loss?
Ive thought carefully about whether it would be fair and reasonable to hold Mr L partially 
responsible for the loss he has suffered. And on balance, in the individual circumstances of 
this case, Ive decided Mr L should bear some responsibility for the loss. 
Mr L wasnt an experienced investor and he had only just started investing in cryptocurrency. 
Mr L sent a large amount of money to the scam over the course of the year with a small 
amount withdrawn. With this level of investment, Id expect a high amount of due diligence to 
be done into the company and the investment before the money was sent. 
Mr L says he was called out of the blue and told about the investment. Cryptocurrency was 
widely reported on in the media around this time as having a high rate of scams, I too 
wouldve expected Mr L in his profession to be more cautious about sending such high sums 
to something he had very minimal information or knowledge of. 
As someone that works in finance, Mr L would likely be aware of the potential risks of taking 
out loans for investment purposes and that its unusual advice for a legitimate company to 
give someone. Mr L was also told to lie about the purpose of the loans, and I think this 
should have raised concerns for him on the legitimacy of the investment.  
In summary Im satisfied that Mr L sent a considerable amount of money with minimal to no 
research. For that reason, Im persuaded that Mr L shouldnt get the full amount of the 
investment back. Im therefore satisfied Barclays decision to reduce the compensation by 
50% was a fair and reasonable one
I also agree with the investigator when shes said that the £9,500.00 loan Barclays agreed to 
write off is over what I wouldve suggested it pay had the complaint come to our service 
without Barclays already agreeing to pay half the money. Therefore, for the reasons Ive 
explained, Im satisfied Barclays offer is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the 
case, and I wont be asking it to do anything more. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint or require Barclays to pay any more 
money to Mr L. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 July 2023.
