K820x#14complaint
Mrs J complains Shop Direct  Finance  Company Limited trading as Very (SDFC) hasnt 
properly calculated the amounts due on her account.
background
Mrs J has an account with SDFC. Mrs Js account offered different payment arrangements,  
depending on the items purchased. This included buy now pay later (BNPL)  where  a 
customer can defer payment until a specified date and no interest is charged as long as 
payment is made in full by that date.
Mrs Js account was made up of a number of purchases, some of which  incurred interest, 
and others  that didnt  - BNPL. And the BNPL items  incurred interest  at different points in the 
future dependent on when  the payment needed to be made.
In December 2016 Mrs J said she asked SDFC for a final settlement amount to be able to 
close her account. She was first told she owed more than £7000, but later was told she 
owed £5991.60. Mrs J said she paid the lower  amount as she believed this was the final 
settlement amount and her account  would then be closed.
When Mrs J saw her account hadnt  been  closed she called SDFC to find out why. She was 
told the £5991.60 was her outstanding  balance  at the time of her call but this amount hadnt 
included items shed purchased under the BNPL option. SDFC apologised as it should have 
told Mrs J, for her to close her account; she needed  to pay all of the outstanding  balances 
which included her BNPL balance. 
To put things right, SDFC refunded the interest  and charges  that had been added  to Mrs Js 
account, after her December payment, as some of the items had passed the end of the 
BNPL period and had started to accrue interest. It also offered £25.00 compensation and 
removed any adverse markers  that had been  applied to her credit file. But it said she still had 
an outstanding  balance to pay for the items shed purchased under the BNPL  option. And for 
purchases shed  made since  her December payment, as she was still using the account. 
 Mrs J wasnt  happy with SDFCs response and referred her complaint to us.
Our investigator said SDFC had agreed the information it had given Mrs J had been  
mis-leading but it had put things right. So, she didnt ask SDFC to do anything else.
Mrs J didnt agree and said SDFC had caused her a lot of upset and anguish  and the 
compensation offered didnt cover for this or the phone calls shed had to make  to try to get 
things put right.
Mrs J has asked for an ombudsman to make a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not upholding this 
complaint. Ill explain  why.
Ref: DRN84083682I should say first of all that its not our role to calculate what  the balance of Mrs Js account  
should be. What Ive done is to look at what  has happened and determine  whether SDFC 
should do more  to put things right.
I can see how misunderstandings might  have arisen here.  The range of offers available can 
make it difficult  to keep track  of what payments need  to be made and when. That becomes 
more complicated as more items are bought on different deals that expire  at different times. 
Mrs J used her account to purchase  BNPL items.  Her account also showed  she had items 
that werent bought on that basis or werent  paid for in full by the date the BNPL payment 
was due. Where this happened, the items  bought on BNPL terms moved to the general 
balance and interest was added. 
Mrs Js statement,  dated 17 December 2016  shows the outstanding balance of £5991.60 
and also that there  is a BNPL  balance of £1093.36. The BNPL  balance was for items 
despatched between February  2016  and June 2016.  Ive outlined below the number of 
items, the amounts and the date when the BNPL would  have  ended:
Despatched No of items Amt Chargeable
15.02.16 2 39.00 13.02.17
17.02.16 3 205.99 15.02.17
01.06.16 6 110.00 30.05.17
13.06.16 5 141.49 18.02.17
14.06.16 2 55.98 18.02.17
20.06.16 4 42.97 25.02.17
21.06.16 7 98.93 25.02.17
01.08.16 1 399.00 30.05.17
30 1093.36
Ive listened to the call Mrs J made at the end of December when she wanted to close her 
account. She was initially told she needed  to pay over £7000. There  is then some confusion  
between both Mrs J and SDFC about precisely what Mrs J wanted to do. Mrs J said she 
wanted the amount less interest as a final settlement.  As the BNPL balance wasnt yet due 
for payment, it hadnt accrued any interest, so she was told the amount which was accruing 
interest- £5991.60.  
This wasnt right as Mrs J had said she wanted to close her account.  So, she should have 
been given the total payment  that was needed  to do this  the outstanding balance  together 
with the outstanding BNPL balance,  a total of £7084.96 which  reflects the first amount 
mentioned at the start of the call.
I do agree  with Mrs J that what she was told wasnt the amount  needed  to close her account, 
so wasnt as helpful as it could have  been. But this doesnt mean that the total amount she 
owed was incorrect and so she still needs to pay her BNPL balance and for items she has 
purchased after her December payment.
SDFC has refunded Mrs J the interest and charges of £221.63 that had been added  to her 
account after she made her payment in December  2016. SDFC has also paid her £25 to 
compensate her for the misleading information  and removed any adverse markers from her 
Ref: DRN84083683credit file. So, Im satisfied SDFC had done enough to put things right and to compensate 
Mrs J for what has happened.  
SDFC has since offered a further £75 in compensation.  As Im not upholding Mrs Js 
complaint it is for her to decide if she wants to accept this.
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 October  2019.
