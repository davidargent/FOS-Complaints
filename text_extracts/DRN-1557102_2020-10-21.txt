The complaint
Mr W complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) unfairly found in a buyers 
favour after a dispute was raised in relation to an item he sold online. 
What happened
Mr W sold a phone via an online auction website on 1 March 2019 for £900. On 29 March 
2019 Mr W says he received £869.20 from the proceeds of the sale after PayPal took its 
commission. 
Mr W says the buyer raised a dispute via the online auction service but it was declined. The 
buyer went on to raise a dispute with PayPal on 10 April 2019 and said the phone they 
bought wasnt working properly. Mr W has told us he spoke with PayPal on 11 April 2019 
and was told the case had been closed. But PayPal contacted Mr W later that day and said it 
had decided that the phone should be returned and a full refund would be given to the buyer. 
Mr W has told us that he got the phone tested by the manufacturer and no faults were found. 
Mr W went on to sell the phone again for £810 and has asked for the £90 difference plus a 
refund of the commission. Mr W also asked for compensation to cover his time and the 
inconvenience caused to him. 
PayPal didnt uphold Mr Ws complaint and advised it had taken the information he provided 
into account but decided the dispute in favour of the buyer. But PayPal said that, as a 
gesture of goodwill, it was willing to return the £30.80 commission it had charged. PayPal 
refused to cover the difference between prices Mr W had been able to obtain for the phone. 
Mr W referred his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. They said 
PayPals terms advised it would make the final decision in relation to disputes between 
buyers and sellers and didnt uphold the complaint. Mr W has asked to appeal and questions 
why he was told, over the phone, that the case had been closed only to later find out it had 
been decided in favour of the buyer. As Mr W asked to appeal, his complaint has been 
passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In response to the investigator, Mr W has told us that on 11 April 2019 he spoke with 
someone at PayPal and thought the issue had been resolved. Mr W says he has repeatedly 
asked for a copy of this call but PayPal hasnt supplied it. Our investigator went on to request 
the call recording from PayPal as well but it says theres no record of a call from Mr W on 
11 April 2019 and no call recording to provide. But I can see how firmly and consistently 
Mr W has made the point that he spoke with PayPal and I dont doubt what hes told us. 
The issue here is that, even if Mr W was told the dispute had been closed, PayPal quickly 
contacted him to advise that it had been decided in favour of the buyer. I appreciate there 
was some confusion here, but Mr W has told us that PayPal confirmed the actual outcome of 
the dispute to him on 11 April 2019 so any confusion he experienced was reasonably short 
lived. 
Mr W says that PayPals decision to decide the dispute in favour of the buyer without 
supporting evidence was premature and unfair. I understand Mr W was able to subsequently 
get the phone tested and it was found to be fully working. But PayPals user agreement sets 
out how disputes between sellers and buyers will be considered and decided. By accepting 
the user agreement, Mr W agreed to abide by its terms. It says PayPal can: 
Make a final decision on any problem with a purchase raised by a buyer with a PayPal 
accountin favour of the buyer of Payment RecipientIn the event that PayPal makes a 
final decision on the problem in favour of the buyer or Payment Recipient, each party must 
comply with PayPals final decision.
The user agreement contains lots of information setting out how PayPal looks at and decides 
disputes. Ive set out the above section because it ultimately confirms that PayPal has the 
right to make the final decision on whether the dispute is upheld or not. Im satisfied that 
PayPal acted in line with the terms of its user agreement. 
As I havent found PayPal made an error and Im satisfied the outcome of the complaint was 
fair, Im not telling it to increase the compensation offered or take any further action. 
 My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2020.
