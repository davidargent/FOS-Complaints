K820x#14complaint
Mr F complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid  was irresponsible  to lend 
him money  that he couldnt afford to repay.
background
Mr F took out five instalment loans  with QuickQuid between July 2009  and July 2010. A 
summary of his borrowing is below:
Loan Date borrowed Amount Date repaid
1 06/07/2009 £200 28/08/2009
2 03/09/2009 £250 22/10/2009
3 31/12/2009 £250 15/01/2010
4 18/01/2010 £400 15/07/2010
5 15/07/2010 £600 13/05/2011
Mr F says that he was caught  in a cycle of having  to borrow  more  money  to repay  existing 
loans. Mr F says that if QuickQuid had carried out better affordability checks, it wouldve 
discovered that he was in arrears with other priority  bills.
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Fs complaint should be upheld in part. In summary,  
the adjudicator  didnt  think that it was reasonable of QuickQuid to loans two to five.
The adjudicator recommended that QuickQuid refund  all interest  and charges that Mr F had 
paid on loans two to five with interest  on the refund.  The adjudicator said QuickQuid should  
remove any negative information  about loans two to four from Mr Fs credit file. As Mr F had 
been borrowing  for an extended period of time,  the adjudicator also asked QuickQuid to 
remove all entries about loan five.
QuickQuid disagreed with the adjudicators view. It says that the Financial Conduct  Authority  
(FCA) doesnt set out minimum levels of disposable  income and that weve given  no 
explanation as to why Mr Fs remaining  disposable  income wasnt  sufficient.
QuickQuid points out that Mr F had a good repayment record  and there was a break of 70 
days between loan two and three.  QuickQuid  asks for evidence  that Mr F was in financial 
difficulties before it agreed loans two to five.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr F 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
Ref: DRN75944982With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that 
QuickQuid should  fairly  and reasonably  have  done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint. 
loan one
It was early on in Mr Fs lending relationship and he declared a net monthly  income of 
£1,592.  QuickQuid expected Mr F to repay a maximum of £250  in one instalment.
At this stage, I think that it was reasonable of QuickQuid to rely on knowing Mr Fs income  to 
decide that he could afford to repay loan one.
loans two to four
Mr F applied  for loan two shortly after repaying  loan one and he asked  to borrow  slightly 
more than before.  Although Mr F had repaid  loan early,  I still consider that QuickQuid 
shouldve been  doing a bit more to make sure that Mr F could afford to repay loan two 
onwards.
I think that as well as asking about  his income,  it was reasonable to expect QuickQuid to ask 
Mr F for details of his living costs  and regular financial credit commitments.  Even though  
there was a break of a couple of months between repaying loan two and applying for loan 
three, I dont  think that this was long enough to effectively break the chain of lending.  So by 
loan three,  I think that QuickQuid shouldve also asked  Mr F whether he had any other short  
term lending commitments.
As I dont have enough evidence to suggest that QuickQuid requested this kind of 
information, Ive looked at what it wouldve discovered with better checks.
Mr F had monthly living costs of just over £1,200 and regular financial commitments  of £250 
around the time of loan two. This meant that Mr F was left with about £112 of disposable 
income. This wasnt enough disposable income  to be able to afford the highest  repayment 
on loan two.
Ref: DRN75944983Mr Fs financial situation didnt improve over the course of loans three and four. Ive also 
seen some evidence  of Mr F borrowing from at least one other payday lender around  this 
time. Although by loan four, Mr Fs declared income had increased to £1,895, he was also 
expected to make larger repayments to QuickQuid.
I think that with better checks QuickQuid  wouldve  discovered that Mr F couldnt afford to 
make the highest  repayment on each loan from his disposable income. It follows that I 
uphold Mr Fs complaint about loans two to four.
loan five
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr F, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, so that QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Fs case,  I think this point was reached by loan five. 
I say this because:
Mr F applied for loan four almost immediately  on repaying loan three. Mr F then needed 
more time to repay loan four.
Mr F applied for loan five on the same day that he settled loan four. And loan five was  
Mr Fs fifth loan from QuickQuid in about 12 months.
the amount  that Mr F was borrowing each time had been  increasing since loan four. 
Loan five was for three times the amount of loan one. 
I think that the pattern of lending shouldve  alerted QuickQuid to the likelihood that Mr F 
was having problems managing his money. So I think it should  have  been  concerned  
that he wouldnt be able to repay  loan five sustainably.
I think that Mr F lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing for loan five. 
This is because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number  of loans, combined with the total length of time Mr F had been borrowing 
from QuickQuid, was likely to have  had negative implications on his ability  to access  
mainstream credit. This kept Mr F in the market for these  high-cost loans. 
So Im upholding  Mr Fs complaint about loan five.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges that Mr F paid on loans two to five;
 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
Ref: DRN75944984remove any negative information  about loans two to four from Mr Fs credit file;
the number  of loans taken by the time of loan five means  that any information about loan 
five is negative. So all entries about  loan five should be removed from Mr Fs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr F a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Fs complaint in part and direct CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 June  2019.
