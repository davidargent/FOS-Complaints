The complaint
 Ms I complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Debenhams (NewDay) refused to refund 
several disputed transactions made using her credit card. 
What happened
Ms I was on a shopping trip in the run up to Christmas. Shed made several purchases using 
her NewDay credit card and then used a bus to travel to another area. Ms I had her baby 
with her and numerous packages and a pram. When she got off the bus, she went for lunch 
and couldnt locate her credit card. Ms I didnt think anything was wrong as she had a lot of 
bags and assumed the card was in one of them. She paid for the lunch with a different card 
and eventually returned home.
The next day Ms I noticed several transactions totalling £94.49 that she didnt recognise and 
when she looked for her card it was missing. Ms I notified NewDay about the transactions. 
NewDays records show Ms I confirmed she still had the card. NewDay cancelled Ms Is card 
and re-issued a new one. 
Ms I pointed out to NewDay that she couldnt have made the transactions she was disputing 
because of the timings and the distance between the stores. Ms I said it would have been 
impossible to travel between the two areas based on the timings of the transactions.
NewDay didnt agree, they relied on the answer Ms I had given about still having her card 
and the timings of the transactions. NewDay said that a genuine transaction had been made 
after a disputed one and this meant that there wasnt a plausible explanation for the disputed 
transactions.
Ms I later believed shed lost the card somewhere on her journey, either on the bus or near 
the bus stop. She said the disputed transactions were all made close to the bus stop. Ms I 
pointed out that all these transactions were under the contactless limit, which meant that 
whoever had used the card wouldnt need the PIN number.
NewDay accepted theyd wrongly classed Ms Is case as a card not present issue and this 
caused a slight delay in their investigation. They awarded Ms I £15 for this oversight but 
refused to refund the transactions.
Ms I remained unhappy with NewDays investigation and brought her complaint to our 
service for an independent review. It was looked at by one of our investigators who thought it 
should be upheld and recommended NewDay refund the disputed transactions and to 
restructure the account by removing any interest or charges caused by the disputed 
transactions.
NewDay disagreed, they continued to make the point that Ms I had told them she still had 
the card in her possession when she first spoke to them the day after she noticed the 
disputed transactions on her account.
I gave both parties an opportunity to comment as I was minded to increase the 
compensation. In her response, Ms I said that shed been trying to close her account with 
NewDay, but without any success. NewDay responded that they thought the £15 
compensation was sufficient.
 The complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When considering what is fair and reasonable, I am required to take into account: relevant 
law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, 
where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time. 
In cases when there is a dispute about what happened, I base my decision on the balance of 
probabilities. In other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in the light of 
the available evidence.
The rules which are relevant to Ms Is complaint are the Payment Services Regulations 2017 
(PSRs) and where credit is used, the Consumer Credit Act 1974. In short, they say NewDay 
must refund any transactions which are not authorised.
NewDays terms and conditions related to the credit agreement state:
. You will not be liable for (and we will refund) any other transactions not authorised by 
you or an additional cardholder, including transactions made with the card or card number 
remotely (for example online, phone or mail order). We will refund the unauthorised 
transaction as soon as we can and in any event by the end of the next working day
Both parties have made their arguments based, in part, on the timings of the transactions. 
Ms I argued that it would have been practically impossible for her to make all the 
transactions based on the timings of the payments and the distance between the 
businesses.
NewDay made a similar argument based on their records that Ms I still possessed the card. 
They pointed out that a transaction Ms I recognised as genuine was made after the disputed 
ones and because shed confirmed she still had the card, this meant it was implausible that it 
was someone else whod made these disputed transactions.
Where there is conflicting evidence, I have concluded what I believe is most likely, on the 
balance of probabilities. 
Ms I told us that once she noticed the transactions, she looked for her card and couldnt find 
it. She then called NewDay. NewDay no longer have a recording of that call. NewDay 
produced a declaration they sent to Ms I following the call which refers to Ms I still having the 
card, but it doesnt appear that Ms I ever acknowledged the declaration. NewDay later 
confirmed they shouldnt have sent the declaration because theyd misunderstood the fraud 
being reported.
Ms I told us that she couldnt find the card and together with the transactions she didnt 
recognise on her account, was the reason for calling NewDay. Whilst I cant say what 
happened during the call, it would seem likely that the whereabouts of the card was 
discussed  because that was the principle reason why she was calling them. So, it would seem odd and out of keeping with her otherwise clear and consistent version of events to 
then tell them she still possessed the card.
NewDay continued to rely on their understanding that Ms I still had the card, and this was 
the main reason for seeking a decision. In their response to our service they said:
To the best of my knowledge, Miss I has not disputed that she told us the card was still in 
her possession, which I would have expected her to do if it had not been in her possession.
NewDays own records show that in February, Ms I told them shed lost her card, which is at 
odds with the position NewDay have maintained.  So, taking everything into account, Im not 
persuaded that NewDay accurately recorded Ms Is information when she reported the loss. 
NewDay later confirmed that some of the timings of the disputed transactions used a 
different time zone. Once this was corrected, it showed the series of disputed transactions 
claimed by Ms I happened once shed got off the bus and confirmed they were all 
contactless. NewDay didnt alter their position, even after the timings supported Ms Is 
version of events. It was no longer the case that a legitimate transaction had taken place 
between the disputed ones. 
I asked for further information about the transactions made on the card. NewDay were able 
to say that no further transactions were made on the card after the last unauthorised one at 
3.55 pm. They were unable to confirm if this was because the contactless limit was reached 
(based on the number of allowable transactions before the PIN would be needed) or 
because the card was cancelled, but I think its supportive of Ms Is version of what 
happened because no transactions above the contactless limit were attempted.
Without the PIN, the card would no longer be useful to an opportunistic thief, which I think 
was more likely than not the case here. Ms Is consistent testimony coupled with the pattern 
of contactless payments leads me to conclude that, on a balance of probabilities, Ms I didnt 
make the transactions shes disputed.
Because Im satisfied she didnt consent to the transactions, they are unauthorised, and this 
means that NewDay are required to refund them to Ms I. 
NewDay recognised they delayed the original investigation because they mis-classified it. 
They awarded £15 compensation and credited it to Ms Is account. But, I dont think that 
reflects the full situation caused by NewDay when investigating this complaint. NewDay 
relied, in part, on incorrect data to justify their position and deny a refund to Ms I.
NewDay continued to place significant emphasis on the phone call when Ms I reported the 
loss but didnt appear to take the updated timings into account or consider their own records. 
I dont think NewDay properly considered the complete picture which caused unnecessary 
ongoing stress and upset and should pay an additional £50 to Ms I to recognise this.
Ms I told us that shed been trying to close her account with NewDay, but without any 
success. I can see a reference in NewDays own notes that Ms I wished to close her account 
in March 2020, but this doesnt appear to have been taken forwards. It doesnt appear this 
request from Ms I formed part of the original complaint and theres nothing in NewDays final 
response letter about closing the account. 
Because this point wasnt part of the original complaint, our service wont be able to consider 
it until NewDay have had a chance to investigate the problem themselves. Ms I will need to 
make a separate complaint about this to NewDay and If Ms I remains unsatisfied with 
NewDays response, she can bring her complaint to our service. I hope that this can be resolved for both parties without this needing to happen though. 
Putting things right
 As I think its more likely than not that Ms I didnt make the transactions shes disputed, Im 
going to tell NewDay to refund the disputed transactions, ensure that any charges or interest 
added as a result of these payments are also refunded and pay an additional £50 for the 
stress and upset caused. NewDay should also pay 8% interest (simple) related to the 
repayment of the disputed transactions to compensate Ms I for the loss of use of the money. 
My final decision
I require NewDay Ltd trading as Debenhams to:
refund the outstanding disputed transactions totalling £94.49.
Refund any additional charges or interest added as a result of these payments. 
Pay 8% simple interest from the date of payments onto the account related to the 
disputed transactions to the date when repaid.
Pay an additional £50 compensation for the stress and upset caused to Ms I.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms I to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 September 2021.
