The complaint
Mr V complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refused to refund him for a purchase 
that wasnt delivered to him under its Buyer Protection policy.
What happened
In mid-2021, Mr V purchased an item online. The next day he received notification from the 
courier that the item had been delivered and signed for, but he didnt receive it. Mr V says 
nobody was at home at the time. He says there were instructions for the delivery not to be 
left in a safe place and proof of identity was required because of the high value of the item. 
Mr V says he tried to resolve the matter with the seller and the courier, but neither were 
willing to investigate it. He raised a claim with PayPal under its Buyer Protection policy, but 
PayPal found in favour of the seller.
Mr V complained to PayPal, but it said it was satisfied that its actions were correct, fair and 
reasonable. So, Mr V asked our service to look into his concerns.
Our investigator thought Mr Vs complaint should be upheld. He thought Mr V had provided 
compelling evidence to show that the item hadnt been delivered. He didnt think it was fair 
for PayPal to have declined Mr Vs Buyer Protection claim in light of this. He recommended 
that PayPal refund the value of the item to Mr Vs PayPal credit account, remove any interest 
it had charged in relation to the item and pay him 8% statutory interest for any payments 
hed made towards it. He also recommended that PayPal pay Mr V £100 for inconvenience.
PayPal disagreed with our investigators view and asked for the matter to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It said it felt the tracking information it had received would be accepted in 
most cases. So, the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold Mr Vs complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPals user agreement says that, in certain circumstances, a buyer who pays using a 
PayPal account may be entitled to reimbursement of the full purchase price of the item plus 
the original shipping costs (they) paid if any.
It goes on to say that PayPal Buyer protection may apply when you didnt receive your item 
for a seller (referred to as an Item Not Received claim).
The user agreement also says:
Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not 
Received claim, ifThe seller has provided proof of delivery.
PayPal says Mr Vs Buyer Protection claim was closed in favour of the seller because the 
seller had provided tracking information which confirmed delivery. Its provided a screenshot 
of the delivery information from the courier which suggests that the item was successfully 
delivered to Mr Vs address. This includes the wording your parcel has been delivered and 
received by (Mr Vs surname) followed by the time and date.
However, Mr V has provided evidence to show that the item wasnt delivered to his address. 
Hes sent copies of the proof of delivery photographs from the courier, along with 
photographs of items that were successfully delivered to his address by the same courier on 
other occasions. I think its clear from these pictures that the item in question wasnt 
delivered to the same location. The door is a different colour and appears to open outward 
rather than inward. Mr V has also sent us copies of his chat history with PayPal where hes 
referred to the delivery photos indicating that there was no one there and it was not his door. 
So, Im satisfied that Mr Vs testimony to PayPal is consistent with what he told us, and he 
also sent it evidence to support it.
Mr V has tried to seek redress from all parties involved in the purchase. I can see that the 
seller told PayPal: Customer can initiate lost package investigation with (the courier). But 
Mr V has also provided a copy of his communication with the courier who told him that it 
would only be able to raise an investigation at the sellers request. 
I appreciate PayPal would normally decline a Buyer Protection claim based on the 
information the seller had provided. But having considered all of the evidence, I dont think 
that doing this has resulted in a fair outcome for Mr V. I think PayPal should have considered 
the compelling evidence Mr V provided that showed the item wasnt delivered to him. 
The basis for a purchase is that the item must be delivered to the buyer and the evidence 
Ive considered shows that it likely wasnt. Because I dont think the sellers evidence proved 
the item was delivered, I dont think PayPal should rely on the exclusions in its policy to deny 
Mr Vs claim under its Buyer Protection policy.
PayPal has a further clause that says:
If the seller presents evidence that it delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favour 
of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods
Ive already explained why I dont think the evidence the seller provided shows that the item 
was delivered. It follows that I dont think PayPal can rely on this secondary clause to deny 
Mr V a refund. 
I can see that Mr V has put a lot of time and effort trying to resolve this matter with PayPal, 
the seller and the courier. I think some of this could have been avoided if PayPal had 
accepted his claim. It was no doubt a worry for him that he might not be refunded what hed 
paid for a high value item he hadnt received. So, I think it would be fair for PayPal to pay   
Mr V an additional £100 to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience hes 
experienced. 
Putting things right
PayPal should:
Refund Mr V the amount he paid for the item (£2,499.99) to his PayPal Credit 
account.
Remove any interest hes been charged for the above.If Mr V has made any payments towards the purchase since the dispute was 
declined, PayPal should refund these to him along with 8% per annum simple 
interest from the date the payments were made until the date the payments are 
refunded.*
Pay Mr V £100 for distress and inconvenience.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal to deduct tax from this interest. PayPal should give Mr V a 
certificate showing how much tax its deducted if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mr Vs complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et 
Cie SCA to put things right by doing as Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 May 2022.
