The complaint
Mr Y complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA did not uphold his claim under the
PayPal seller protection policy.
What happened
Mr Y sold an item and received £240.90 (minus a fee) from PayPal. But the buyer of the item
raised a chargeback with their bank stating that they hadnt received the item. PayPal sent
Mr Y a message that they were unable to verify the delivery information he provided them,
so they had debited £240.90 from his PayPal account. PayPal say that they looked into
whether Mr Y was eligible for their PayPal seller protection. But the tracking information that
Mr Y provided PayPal showed the item was delivered to a post office 26.6 miles away from
the buyers address so PayPal said they were unable to uphold his claim.
Mr Y brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator initially did not uphold Mr Ys
complaint. She said that while Mr Y thought PayPal werent helping him in his dispute, that
PayPal were entitled to not cover him under the seller protection as the tracking showed the
item was delivered to a different address to the buyers address.
Mr Y did not accept the view of the investigator. He provided her with a message which he
said was from the buyer and he said he had a video if our investigator wanted it, which was
evidence that the buyer had received the item. Our investigator issued another view of the
complaint. She upheld Mr Ys complaint and said that PayPal should allow him to retain the
full purchase amount. Our investigator said that on the balance of probabilities the buyer
wasnt at home when the item was delivered and that they had went to the collection point to
collect it. She said that the item had been signed for and that the tracking shows the initial
and surname of the buyer. Our investigator said that PayPal should look at the case
holistically and Mr Y had provided enough evidence that the item had been delivered to the
buyer.
PayPal disagreed with our investigator and requested an Ombudsman review the complaint.
They made a number of points which included that they couldnt accept screenshots of
messages or videos as evidence as they cant truly know the identity of the parties involved.
PayPal said their seller protection guidelines show the evidence that they accept is proof of
shipment and proof of delivery. In response to our investigator saying she felt that PayPal
did not review the case holistically, PayPal said they had reviewed the information outlined in
line with their user agreement.
As my findings differed in some respects from our investigators, I issued a provisional
decision to give both parties the opportunity to consider things further. This is set out below:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not in dispute here that PayPal were entitled, under the terms and conditions of the seller
protection, to refuse Mr Ys claim. But I do need to think about whats fair and reasonable in
all the circumstances of a complaint. In doing so, there will be times that a strict application
of any terms and conditions, will result in an unfair outcome for a customer in the individual
circumstances of a dispute. But Im not persuaded that by applying their terms and
conditions here that this had led to an unfair outcome, even if Mr Y may not see it this way
and Ill explain why.
PayPals seller protection is clear that in order to be eligible there is certain criteria which
needs to be met. One of the conditions that must be met for proof of delivery is an address
for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the transaction details page. So Ive
looked at the tracking information for the item sent. Unfortunately, this does not show the
buyers address. It shows that the item was delivered and signed for at a location which
PayPal have tracked 26.6 miles away from the buyers address.
Ive considered the information on file to see if the item was delivered to the buyer. There is
a signature on the tracking document. But without having a copy of the buyers signature Im
unable to verify the signature. In addition, although Mr Y has provided our service a
screenshot of a message and has a video available to send us, I wouldnt be able to verify
the parties involved here. And acceptance of a message or a video isnt a requirement of
evidence under PayPals seller protection.
In the PayPal seller protection section of the PayPal user agreement, the following is shown
under proof of delivery: Important: your choice of carrier and shipment options with that
carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.
Please ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide
delivered status at the correct address, or your seller protection claim may be denied. So
while Mr Y wasnt shipping goods internationally, Im satisfied that PayPal did set out in their
user agreement, clear requirements that the proof of delivery would need to show the
buyers address. In this instance it showed an address 26.6 miles away from the buyer.
The seller protection also states You must ship the item to the shipping address on the
transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction. If you originally ship the
item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later
redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection. We
therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you
will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery. So even if the item was
redirected to the address 26.6 miles away the terms here show that Mr Y wouldnt be eligible
for the seller protection. So based on the evidence Ive seen, PayPal followed their seller
protection terms fairly and denied Mr Ys claim. So it follows that I do not intend to ask
PayPal to do anything further.
I invited both parties to let me have any further submissions before I reached a final
decision. PayPal said they had no further points to add. Mr Y did not respond to the 
provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party offered further points for consideration, my final decision and reasoning
remains the same as in my provisional decision. I know Mr Y will be disappointed with the
decision, but I hope he understands my reasons.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 August 2021.
