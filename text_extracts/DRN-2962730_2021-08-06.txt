The complaint
Mrs B complains, on behalf of the estate of her late husband Mr B, about the fact Family 
Assurance Friendly Society Limited trading as OneFamily would not reinstate Mr Bs 
over 50s life cover policy.
What happened
Mr B held an over 50s life policy with OneFamily. In March 2020 OneFamily tried to collect 
the monthly premium but it was unable to do so. It said the direct debit had been cancelled 
at Mr Bs bank. So, it wrote to Mr B on 24 March 2020 to explain this and ask if he wanted to 
set up the payments again. However, Mrs B says Mr B did not receive this letter.
OneFamily wrote to Mr B again on 24 April 2020 when it still hadnt received a response or 
any premium payments. This letter was received and on 5 May 2020 Mrs B rang OneFamily 
and requested a new direct debit mandate and asked for how to pay off the outstanding 
premiums. Mrs B says they were unaware the direct debit had been cancelled. 
A new direct debit mandate was then sent on 7 May 2020. But Mrs B says it took some time 
before she received this. In the meantime, Mrs B said she contacted OneFamily by phone on 
more than one occasion but there were issues with OneFamilys phone lines and she wasnt 
able to set up a new direct debit over the phone.
Mrs B said she later received the letter sent by OneFamily and returned the new direct debit 
mandate with payment straightaway. But OneFamily says it never received this. The policy 
then lapsed on 24 May 2020. OneFamily wrote to Mr B the same day confirming this.
On 29 July 2020 Mr B passed away and Mrs B contacted OneFamily in September 2020 to 
make a claim. She was told the policy had lapsed and so Mrs B offered to pay the difference 
in premiums. However, due to the time lapsed without premium payments, OneFamily said 
this was not possible. 
Mrs B complained but this wasnt upheld by OneFamily, so she brought her concerns to our 
service. 
OneFamily told us it had no record of Mrs Bs attempts to contact it via telephone but it 
acknowledged it had very high call volumes at that time and some issues with its telephone 
lines, albeit that these were resolved very quickly. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt uphold it. They thought OneFamily had 
acted reasonably in the circumstances and had given Mr B sufficient opportunity to cover the 
missed premiums.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I was sorry to hear about Mr Bs passing. Ive read about the impact this has had on Mrs B 
and about how stressful the period leading up to his passing was. I dont doubt this had an 
impact on their ability to engage with OneFamily about the policy at this time. 
I think it would be helpful to explain that my role here is to look at whether OneFamily has 
acted reasonably in all the circumstances. So whilst its clear to me that these events took 
place at a very difficult time for Mr and Mrs B, I would only direct OneFamily to make a 
different decision if I thought it had acted unfairly. And having considered things, I dont think 
that it has  Ill explain why.
I can see that after it was unable to collect the March 2020 premium, OneFamily wrote to 
Mr B as Id expect  it did so on more than one occasion providing ways he could arrange to 
meet his payments. The second letter it sent clearly outlined the consequences of failing to 
meet the payment deadline in May 2020. Im also satisfied the grace period for missed 
premiums it allowed was in line with the terms and condition of the policy. I appreciate Mr B 
didnt receive the first letter, but Ive seen a copy of it and it was correctly addressed, so Im 
satisfied that it was likely sent. 
In response to the second letter, sent in April 2020, Mrs B called OneFamily and it sent her a 
new direct debit mandate form which Mrs B has told us she completed and returned. I think 
its likely she did return this given shed gone to the trouble of requesting it. Had OneFamily 
received the mandate, I think it would have processed it and obtained its outstanding 
payments. But it didnt, and it would appear the mandate was somehow lost in the post. 
Ultimately, I dont think this error is something OneFamily is responsible for. 
On 24 May 2020 OneFamily then wrote to Mr B to confirm it had cancelled his policy due to 
non-payment of premiums. Having seen a copy of the cancellation letter, Im satisfied it was 
likely sent and that it was correctly addressed. This cancellation was in line with the terms 
and conditions of the policy. And given I dont think OneFamily had evidence of the 
attempted payment, I think this cancellation was fair. 
Had Mr or Mrs B contacted OneFamily around this time, explained the direct debit mandate 
had already been returned and offered to meet the payments, I might have suggested the 
reasonable thing for OneFamily to do would be to reinstate the policy despite the missed 
deadline. But Mr and Mrs B did not and the next time OneFamily heard anything about this 
policy was in September 2020, several months later, in relation to the claim.
Its not clear to me from Mrs Bs account whether she recalls receiving this letter. 
Regardless, its obvious this was a very difficult time for Mr and Mrs B given Mr Bs 
deteriorating health and subsequent passing. And in this context, I can fully understand why 
they might have struggled to find the time to deal with this and/or may not have noticed the 
payments hadnt been taken over the following months. But I cant fairly say OneFamily 
ought to pay a claim on a policy that lapsed several months earlier and where the premiums 
had gone unpaid for over six months. Particularly when I think it acted appropriately in 
notifying Mr B and giving him the opportunity to meet the missed payments.
Ive thought about what Mrs B has told us about being unable to set up the direct debit over 
the phone. Whilst OneFamily has no record of her attempted call, OneFamily has confirmed 
it did have some temporary issues with its telephones. So, I dont doubt Mrs Bs testimony. 
But OneFamily has said these phoneline issues were brief and Mrs B talked about them 
happening before she received a copy of the direct debit mandate. Given this, whilst I agree 
that this is a problem OneFamily was responsible for, I dont think this alone prevented Mr B 
from meeting his payment obligations. So I dont think I could fairly ask OneFamily to 
reinstate the policy on this basis.My final decision
For the reasons Ive outlined above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr B 
to accept or reject my decision before 3 September 2021.
