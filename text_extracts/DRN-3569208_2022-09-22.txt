The complaint
Mr N is unhappy with how HSBC UK Bank Plc have treated a credit from Company T to his 
credit card account. Mr N believes he has not had the benefit of the credit and wishes the 
funds to be added to his account. 
What happened
Mr N made a purchase from Company T using his credit card, but later returned the goods 
and therefore expected £119.94 to be returned to his account. 
Mr Ns August 2021 credit card statement shows that a credit from Company T was made to 
the account on 6 August 2021. But looking at the balances on his statements Mr N doesnt 
believe that he has had the benefit of those funds. 
HSBC looked into matters for Mr N, but found that no error had occurred so Mr N brought his 
complaint to our service. Our investigator checked the debits, credits and balances showing 
on the copy statements from HSBC  and compared these to Mr Ns own statements. 
Having done so, the investigator concluded HSBC had done nothing wrong as Mr N had 
received the benefit of the credit from Company T. As Mr N didnt accept this, the complaint 
has come to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed all the submissions, including checking through all the statements provided 
from both parties, I think Mr N did receive the credit from Company T into his credit card 
account and so he has had the benefit of this sum. I will explain why. 
Reviewing the statements I can see that he has arranged for his monthly direct debit 
payment to clear whatever the outstanding balance is each month. I can therefore see why 
Mr N may have expected to see his account in credit given the sum from Company T would 
be an additional credit for the month of August. 
The outstanding balance from the July 2021 statement shows as £184.37 and the statement 
notes that Your nominated bank account will be debited by £184.37 on 17 Aug. Mr Ns 
August 2021 statement goes on to confirm the previous balance as £184.37.
However, for the month of August 2021 HSBC adjusted the direct debit payment to be taken 
because of the additional credit from Company T. The corresponding entry shown on Mr Ns 
August 2021 statement read: 17 Aug 21 DIRECT DEBIT PAYMENT  THANK YOU 
108.43CR. 
On 24 and 25 July 2021 Mr N made two purchases with his credit card totalling £14.65, and 
a further purchase on 31 July 2021 for £3.97. These purchases all fell into the August 2021 
statement period and together with the previous July 2021 balance (£184.37) brought Mr Ns 
total balance at this point to £202.99. 
The next transaction on Mr Ns August 2021 statement was the credit from Company T for 
£119.98. This therefore reduced the outstanding balance from £202.99 to £83.01. Mr Ns 
further purchase for £25.42 on 11 August 2021 increased the balance again to £108.43. 
Mr N made another purchase on 15 August 2021 for £10.15 but it doesnt appear this was 
processed in time to add to the outstanding balance before Mr Ns direct debit payment was 
credited to the account. In order to not leave the account in credit, HSBC adjusted the direct 
debit payment scheduled for 17 August 2021 from £184.37 to £108.43 in order to clear the 
outstanding balance as at 11 August 2021 instead. 
This meant Mr Ns purchase for £10.15 and two other purchases on 20 August 2021 brought 
Mr Ns final August 2021 outstanding balance to £20.82. The August 2021 statement 
confirms Your nominated bank account will be debited by £20.82 on 17 Sep. Mr Ns 
September 2021 statement then shows the previous balance as £20.82. 
Taking everything into account Im satisfied Mr N has received the benefit of the payment 
from Company T. The sum was credited straight away to reduce the outstanding balance on 
the card at the time it was applied. I therefore dont think HSBC have done anything wrong 
here.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold Mr Ns complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2022.
