K820x#14Complaint
Ms S complains  that National Savings and Investments (NS&I) havent paid her for premium  
bond prizes she has won.  She believes £200 is still due to her. 
Background
Ms S says she hasnt  been paid the prize money  relating to premium bond  wins from 
February, March and April 2018.  These consisted  of five separate  cheques  two for £25 
each from February 2018, one for £25 from March  2018, a £100 cheque and a £25 cheque 
for April 2018. The total of these is £200.  
She complained to NS&I. It responded and provided its final response to Ms S. NS&I  said 
they reviewed their records which confirmed the cheques Ms S is disputing were  re-issued 
on 1 May 2018  and were paid into her bank  account  on 15 May 2018. 
Ms S didnt accept NS&Is  final response and brought  the complaint to this service. Our 
investigator looked at it and said he didnt  think NS&I  had done  anything wrong. In its 
response to us, NS&I  offered Ms S £75 for the inconvenience caused  in supplying  the 
related records. Our investigator thought this offer was fair and reasonable. 
Ms S didnt agree with the investigators  assessment and has asked an ombudsman  to 
decide. The complaint has therefore  been passed to me. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I think  the offer of £75 
made by NS&I is fair and reasonable. Ill explain why. 
The key issue on this complaint is that Ms S believes she hasnt been paid £200 relating to 
premium bond wins from February, March and April 2018. 
The information Ive been provided  shows records of all five cheques having been  raised  
and sent to Ms S in May 2018. The records also show that Ms S has paid those amounts 
into her bank account on 15 May 2018.  Based on this information,  theres  nothing  to suggest 
Ms S hasnt received those payments or that NS&I  acted inappropriately in relation to this 
issue. 
During its investigation, NS&I offered Ms S £75 for providing incorrect  or conflicting 
information. Looking  at what happened, I think this offer is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. 
Overall, NS&I provided evidence to show the £200 has been paid to Ms S. While they could 
have been better in providing supporting information, I agree with the investigator  that the 
£75 offer NS&I has made is fair and reasonable. As Ms S has already received this amount, 
I dont think NS&I need to do anything further. 
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I dont uphold Ms Ss complaint against  National Savings and 
Investments. 
Ref: DRN39324182Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 January 2020.
