K820x#14Complaint
Mr S complains on behalf of his business   G. He complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited 
terminated Gs agreement  without explanation and are holding on to their funds.
Background
In July 2018, G entered into an arrangement with WorldPay. G say they entered into the 
arrangement on the basis  they could send and receive  money from overseas, including 
some specific countries. Dr S says he checked this on behalf of G with WorldPay by 
telephone call and it was agreed.
In August  2018,  following  a review, WorldPay issued G with a termination letter  giving two 
months notice. WorldPay didnt tell G why they decided to terminate the agreement. 
WorldPay confirmed they would hold the money  left in the account for the initial chargeback  
period of 120 days. Once the chargeback period had passed, WorldPay confirmed they 
would hold the funds indefinitely  and not refund the money  to G. 
The investigator who looked into the complaint didnt think WorldPay had acted 
inappropriately. She said WorldPay  were entitled  to terminate  the agreement, and said they 
gave enough notice. She also thought WorldPay were entitled  to the hold the funds. So, she 
didnt ask WorldPay to do anything to put things right. 
Mr S, on behalf of G, remained unhappy   so the complaint has been passed to me to 
review.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
investigator for broadly the same reasons. Ive explained further below.
Ive reviewed the terms and conditions of the agreement between WorldPay  and G. Based 
on these, Im satisfied WorldPay were entitled to end the agreement  and that they gave 
sufficient notice. I recognise G isnt happy  about WorldPays  decision here, but I cant fairly  
say theyve done anything wrong.
G says they asked WorldPay in advance about  making certain transactions. I havent  been 
able to listen to that phone  call so I cant make  a judgement here.  But even if WorldPay  did 
previously agree to what G says they did, I dont think it makes an overall  difference.  I say 
that because its up to WorldPay who they choose to have a relationship  with, and following 
a review, they decided  to terminate the agreement with G. As theyve acted in line with the 
terms and conditions when ending the agreement, I cant ask them  to do anything  differently.
Im aware G is missing  the funds it deposited. Im satisfied, based on the terms of the 
agreement, WorldPay  are entitled to withhold the funds indefinitely. Based on all the 
evidence, Im not persuaded WorldPay have acted  unfairly so I wont be asking them to do 
anything differently regarding the funds.
I realise Mr S will be disappointed by my decision,  and I recognise  the difficulty  he says his 
business is in because of this. But Im satisfied WorldPay  have  acted appropriately in the 
circumstances so I wont be asking  them to do anything.

For the reasons  Ive explained above, I dont uphold this complaint.

G, to accept or reject my decision before 14 August 2020.
