No information, over and above what appears in this table, has been provided by either party 
in relation to loans 1 to 4. 
After Ms W had complained Morses sent its FRL and gave reasons why it considered that it 
had carried out proportionate checks for loans 5 to 7 and from the information it had Morses 
considered the loans affordable. 
After Ms W referred the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, one of our 
adjudicators looked at it and treated loans 1 to 4 as one loan chain and loans 5 to 7 as a 
new loan chain because of the large gap between loan 4 being paid off in 2016 and loan 5 
being applied for in 2021. Our adjudicator made no determination on loans 1 to 4 and no 
further financial information has been sent to us by Ms W or her representative. As for loans 
5 to 7 he thought that Morses did not need to put anything right for Ms W. So, the complaint 
was not upheld.
Ms W has asked for it to be reviewed by an ombudsman but has sent no further information 
or financial evidence for any of the years covering the lending relationship.
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms W 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided not to uphold Ms Ws complaint in part and have explained why below.
Morses has said I would like to let you know that due to data retention and cleansing, the 
information we have provided you with is all we hold for this account. This is understandable 
about the older loans (loans 1 to 4) and Ms W has provided no information either. So, for 
loans 1 to 4 the only finding I can make is that on current evidence the loans were lent 
responsibly as I have nothing to contradict it. 
For loans 5 to 7 I do see that there was a large gap before loan 5 and I accept that it would 
have been reasonable for Morses to treat loan 5 as if Ms W was a new customer. 
Loan 5 was for a relatively modest sum of £510 and I have been provided with the financial 
information Morses had for Ms W for that loan. It showed that she had a weekly income of 
£300, outgoings of £167 and it had carried out a credit search. 
Reviewing that set of search results I can see that Ms W had had two County Court 
Judgments which ought to have placed Morses on alert. They were 13 months and 
30 months old before loan 5 but to get to the position where a person has had a CCJ 
registered against them they must have been in debt for some time. And I can see that the search indicated this Total monthly payments on all accounts 
excluding mortgages - which are currently active 518. This means £518. That translates into 
around £119 a week which does not appear to have been entered onto the spreadsheet 
Morses has provided in its Income and Expenditure assessment (I&E). Other loans of £30 a 
week had been entered and so I am calculating that an additional £70 a week before the 
loan 5 repayments. So, I think that the expenditure each week was more like £167 plus £70 
which comes to £237. With an income of £300 still Id think that loan 5 was affordable, but 
I think it would have been tight. 
Loan 6 was applied for before loan 5 was repaid. And considering what I know Morses knew 
about Ms Ws commitments to other debt then I think that an additional £15 a week likely 
would have pushed the credit commitments to a figure where I think that further enquiries 
about Ms Ws financial situation ought to have been made. 
And then Ms W applied for loan 7 which was for double the amount of the previous two loans 
- £1,050. So additional enquiries ought to have been done at that point and I do not think 
that they were.
But I have no information from Ms W about her financial situation for loans 6 or 7 and so 
I am not able to assess what it is that Morses may have discovered if it had asked for a few 
more details. 
So, I do not uphold Ms Ws complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Ms Ws complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2022.
