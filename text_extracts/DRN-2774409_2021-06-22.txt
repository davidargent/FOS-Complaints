The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) delayed in recrediting him 
with a payment that was deducted fraudulently, debited the payment twice, and then 
provided poor customer service in relation to his queries about this payment. 
What happened
Mr S holds an account with NatWest. 
On 15 December 2020 a payment of £34.91 was debited from Mr Ss account which was not 
recognised by him.
Mr S contacted NatWest about this when it was still pending on 11 December 2020. He was 
advised that they couldnt process the refund until the payment actually went through. It was 
debited on 15 December 2020 and NatWest recredited it on 17 December 2020. 
Mr S complained to NatWest about not being credited straight away and they paid him £20 
compensation for the misunderstanding about when he would be recredited. This payment 
was made on 14 December 2020. 
Mr S pursued this complaint further, and on 21 December 2020, he was given £60 
compensation for distress and inconvenience, and a refund of interest of £29.98. 
On 23 December 2020 Mr Ss account received a credit refund from the retailer for £34.91.  
This meant that Mr S had received the recredited payment twice. NatWest therefore needed 
to recoup their credit and they did this on 21 January 2020. 
Mr S complained to NatWest about not being refunded straight away, the re debit occurring, 
the number of calls he had had to make, being transferred between teams, not being given 
correct information, and the attitude of several members of staff that he spoke to. 
A final response was issued on 5 February 2021. NatWest accepted that that there had been 
confusion and that Mr S had to make several calls to sort this out. They also apologised for 
the staff being rude to Mr S and advised that this was being dealt with
Compensation of £84.91 was credited on 5 February 2021. 
Mr S was still unhappy with this and raised the issue with us.  
One of our investigators has looked into Mr Ss complaint and she thought that the payment 
offered by NatWest was fair. 
Mr S disagreed with our investigators view, and so the case has come to me to review.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have not upheld the complaint, and I will explain why below. 
I am satisfied that NatWest have not made an error. I have been through the statements 
provided by NatWest for the whole period, and also viewed the system notes about 
payments made. NatWest have recredited the fraudulent transaction as soon as they were 
able to on 17 December 2020 and have also refunded interest charges on 21 December 
2020. When they debited the payment again on 21 January 2021 this was because Mr S had 
also been credited by the retailer. 
NatWest did make this more complicated by crediting it again, and then recouping it twice, 
but I am satisfied that the net effect was that Mr S had received the payment back that had 
been deducted on 15 December 2020 and there was no financial loss to him. 
The question then is whether the compensation payment that NatWest have made is 
sufficient to cover the distress and inconvenience that Mr S incurred.
NatWest have agreed that the service provided to Mr S during this period was below 
standard.  He had to make several calls, wasnt always given the right information, was 
transferred between teams, and staff were rude to him. 
I can see from the statements that in total Mr S was paid the following amounts by NatWest:
£20 compensation on 14 December 2020
£60 compensation on 21 December 2020
£29.98 refund of interest on 21 December 2020
£84.91 comprising £34.91 refund and £50 compensation on 5 February 2021 
Mr S has therefore received a total of £130.00 compensation for distress and inconvenience, 
a refund of the payment which he has already been refunded, and a refund of interest. 
Whilst I appreciate that this whole episode has been distressing for Mr S and that NatWest 
have not been clear in their communications with Mr S, I am satisfied that £130 in this case 
is sufficient for the distress and inconvenience suffered over quite a short period, taking into 
account that Mr S has also received a refund of interest and the payment itself.  
  
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc do not need to do anything further.  
    
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 July 2021.
