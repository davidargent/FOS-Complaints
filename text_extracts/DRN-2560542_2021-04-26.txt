The complaint
Mr R complains that his card was getting blocked by National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest).
What happened
Mr Rs credit card was getting blocked for fraud prevention purposes. A block was applied on 
2 May 2020, 8 June 2020, and 26 June 2020.
Mr R complained that the blocks were too frequent for fraud prevention purposes, and he 
wasnt getting advised about them either. He had spent a lot of time getting through to 
NatWest to sort the issues out.
NatWest said the transaction on 8 June 2020 was for a fraud check  and a text message 
had been sent to Mr R. The payment on 2 May 2020 for not authorised by NatWest as it was 
a payment which was prevented by bank policy. And on those occasions, they didnt contact 
customers. They apologised for the poor service experienced by Mr R when he was trying to 
contact NatWests fraud team, and paid compensation of £30 for that.
Mr R brought his complaint to us. Hed also had a further block on 26 June 2020, with no text 
alert. Our investigator said NatWest had acted reasonably. On the blocks on 8 June 2020 
and 26 June 2020 - these were applied by NatWests fraud department as further checks 
were needed to confirm the payments were genuine. She could see that texts were sent. 
The transaction on 2 May 2020 was blocked as it was against the banks policy to agree this 
particular payment - and no text message was sent then.
Mr R asked that his complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see Mr R is frustrated. He says his account payments are being blocked too often, and 
when they are, he doesnt get any text messages. So, he doesnt know whats going on.
Ive looked at what happened. Unfortunately, fraud is all too common today  and NatWest 
do have the right to block payments where they want to check a payment, and where it is 
payment is for a service they dont wish to authorise. And  they will try to contact customers 
to let them know whats happened. In their terms and conditions, they say: We may refuse a 
transaction if:
 we believe there has been fraud on your account or it is at risk of someone using it to
make a fraudulent or unauthorised transaction;
 we reasonably believe that you (or an additional cardholder) did not authorise the 
instruction
 you use a service that we offer to restrict transactions of that type or to suspend your 
card
If we refuse a transaction, we will, if possible, give you the reason for the refusal and you
may be able to correct any information which led to it.
In Mr Rs case, I have seen in NatWests records:
2 May 2020  transaction declined due to bank policy on this type of transaction
8 June 2020  block added, text message sent successfully
26 June 2020  block added, text message sent successfully
So  NatWest acted in line with their terms and conditions, and in the case of the second two 
transactions, sent a text message to Mr R. Mr R says he didnt receive these. Weve 
checked that NatWest have the correct mobile number for Mr R  and they do. So  I can 
only think that there was a problem with Mr Rs network provider on the days and times in 
question. To be fair, NatWest cant be held responsible for this.
Mr R had also said he spent a long time trying to resolve these issues with NatWest. 
NatWest have apologised and made a payment of £30  which I can see was credited to Mr 
Rs account on 15 June 2020. I think this was reasonable. Mr R had said that the block on 8 
June 2020 caused him to find another car park and at an additional cost to him. NatWest 
said theyd consider paying for this if Mr R showed them evidence of this  but he hasnt 
brought anything forward.
So  I think NatWest acted fairly and reasonably here. I can see Mr R had been frustrated by 
what happened and so  he will be disappointed by my decision, but I wont be asking 
NatWest to do anything more here.
 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 May 2021.
