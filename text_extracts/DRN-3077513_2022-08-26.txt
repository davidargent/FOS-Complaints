DRN-3077513
The complaint
Mr D says that Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited (Aviva) have closed his pension policy 
while funds still remained within it. 
What happened
Mr D took out a pension policy in 2007 with Friends Provident, that was later acquired by 
Aviva. In 2016, Mr D placed this policy into drawdown, receiving an initial tax free lump sum 
of £17,154.34 on 1 June 2016, and investing the balance of £51,454.01 into drawdown. 
Mr D subsequently received a total of £64,000 gross taken as income as shown below:
5 August 2016 £16,000 (£998 tax deducted)
5 August 2017 £16,000 (£3,200 tax deducted)
5 August 2018 £16,000 (£3,200 tax deducted)
5 August 2019 £16,000 (£3,200 tax deducted)
When the payment was made on 5 August 2019, less than £16,000 remained in the account, 
which caused a problem with Avivas systems, and the pension account to be suspended.
It took Aviva some time to identify this problem, and further delays occurred when it was 
referred to Avivas actuarial department, owing to the original adjustment being incorrectly 
calculated, a second adjustment being required. Aviva also says that disruption owing to 
moving to home based working during the first Covid pandemic lockdown contributed to 
these delays.
Once a correct manual adjustment was made, enough additional units were added into the 
plan to allow the payment to be processed on the system and the plan to be closed.
The delay in closing the plan resulted in a statement showing an erroneous balance of 
£15,887.23 to be sent to Mr D in September 2019, leading him to believe that the plan still 
retained this value.
Mr D says this impression was reinforced by the letter that Aviva sent him on 19 March 2020 
relating to the Aviva Pension Invesco High Income AP Fund. This letter indicated he needed 
to take some action, stating that you currently have money invested in this fund or are due 
to invest in it and quoting his policy number. 
In March 2020, Mr D contacted Aviva to establish the value remaining in his pension plan. 
He was informed that the funds were exhausted and that the plan had been closed.
Mr D complained to Aviva, who investigated the case and offered him £400 compensation 
for the mistakes they had made in their handling of his pension plan causing him distress 
and inconvenience. Mr D was unsatisfied by this offer and instead asked for compensation 
of the amount shown on the incorrect statement he was sent in September 2019. The case 
was referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
His confidence in Avivas management of his investments was further eroded by its 
response to a query he raised relating to a letter he received from Norwich Union in March 
2008. Mr D believes that this relates to another policy which Aviva cant account for. I believe 
this to be a separate issue to this complaint, so have not considered further it in this 
decision.
After reviewing all the relevant information, our Investigator recommended that this 
complaint not be upheld, and that the sum of £400 compensation offered by Aviva was fair in 
the circumstances. Mr D disagreed, so the case has been passed to me to take a fresh look 
at the evidence and reach a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, and considered the view of our investigator, I have reached the same 
conclusion and shall not be upholding Mr Ds complaint.
This complaint arises from the fact that Aviva made a series of mistakes relating to the 
administration of Mr Ds pension, and so I must address what an appropriate level of 
compensation would be for any material financial loss suffered by Mr D, and the distress and 
inconvenience this situation has caused him.
As I mentioned earlier, Mr D received a total of £64,000 gross from his initial investment of 
£54,454.01 made into the plan in 2016. The difficulty here arises from the series of mistakes 
Aviva made relating to the last of the four payments, in August 2019.
These mistakes led to a statement being sent to Mr D in September 2019, showing that his 
plan still held over £15,000. However, the plan statement sent to Mr D the year before, in 
September 2018, also showed a similar value of over £15,000. Therefore, I dont think that 
Mr D could reasonably expect that the statement in September 2019 was correct, given that 
he accepts that a payment of £16,000 gross had been made in August 2019 and that this 
payment would have completely depleted his funds. Likewise, I dont think the information 
that was then sent to him about a fund closure could, reasonably, have been taken as 
meaning he had over £15,000 remaining in his pension. 
Taken together with that the fact that 4 annual payments of £16,000 gross each have been 
made, I cannot see that Mr D has suffered any material financial loss because he has 
received the correct amount from his pension and cant, reasonably, have believed his 
pension had any significant value left in it after August 2019. Indeed, one of the causes of 
this error was Mr Ds plan containing £321.67 less than the £16,000 payment made to him in 
August 2019, necessitating the manual adjustments. So Mr D has already benefitted 
financially from this error in his favour, which Aviva has not looked to correct.
Taking all this into account, I dont think an appropriate level of compensation should be 
anywhere near what Mr D has asked for. However, even though I dont believe Mr D could, 
reasonably, have considered his pension as still having a significant amount of value 
following the payment in August 2019, I can see his expectations were nonetheless raised.  
So, I think its entirely correct that Aviva should recognise the distress and inconvenience 
caused to Mr D when he was subsequently told about the errors that had taken place. In the 
circumstances, and with our usual approach to such payments in mind, I consider £400 compensation fair and reasonable. 
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I do not uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited should fulfil its offer to pay Mr D the sum of £400 
compensation, if it has not already done so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 September 2022.
