The complaint
Ms J complains about Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Limited (RSA)s handling of her 
buildings insurance complaint
All references to RSA also include its agents
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
RSA has accepted it made mistakes during the claim, and from looking at everything 
I agree there were times where it couldve done better such as when it incorrectly 
asked Ms J to pay an excess when an agreement had already been reached 
between her and RSA on how this was to be handled
I do think there have been times where RSA caused avoidable delays, such as its 
handling of the scope of works and progression of the claim. 
However, its not unusual for claims of this nature to take some time to be resolved, 
so I wont be holding RSA responsible for delays I believe were reasonably 
unavoidable
Ms J has outlined her existing health issues and how hard she found the claim
However, I have to make a distinction between how stressful she may have found 
them usually and if RSA did anything to exacerbate ther.  
Having reviewed everything, I do think some compensation is due to Ms J. I 
acknowledge the things shes told us, but I dont think a higher award is due. Having 
reviewed everything, I do think RSAs offer of £650 compensation is a reasonable 
amount of compensation
Ms J was unhappy about length of time complaint took to be handled by RSAs loss 
adjuster, but our service cant consider complaint handling
Ms J is unhappy about RSAs ongoing handling of her claim, but I am only able to 
address the complaint Ms J initially brought to our service, However, if Ms J makes 
further complaints to RSA and is unhappy with its response, she may consider 
referring future complaints to our service 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Js complaint
To put things right Royal & Sun Alliance should pay Ms J £650 compensation
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms J to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 January 2022.
