K820x#14complaint
Mr N complains National Westminster Bank Plc opened an account for him  but then closed 
it within days. Mr Ns also unhappy that NatWest didnt release money in his account to him. 
And he says NatWest were unhelpful and wouldnt give him any information. Mr N says this 
caused him a great deal of stress and inconvenience. He wants NatWest to compensate  
him.  
background
On 1 November  2018, Mr N applied to open  a NatWest current account.
Following Mr Ns application  NatWest  opened  an account in Mr Ns name and completed 
further credit  checks. On 5 November 2018,  Mr N transferred  £1,500 into his account. 
On 5 November  2018, NatWest sent Mr N an email and explained that new accounts  are 
subject to a range of checks, some  carried out at the point of completing the application,  and 
others completed in the background once the account has been  opened.  NatWest  said that 
now it had completed  its checks it had decided it no longer wanted to Mr N banking  facilities. 
When Mr N received NatWests email, he rang NatWest  to try and find out what was 
happening with his account.  And how he could access  the money which  hed transferred into 
the account. Mr N says he explained  to NatWest that he needed the money  to buy food and 
medication. Mr N says NatWest advisors  wouldnt give him any information and he had to 
make several phone calls to try and find out how he could get his money back.  
Mr N says NatWest  told him it was holding onto his funds whilst it reviewed his account.  And 
it asked him to provide evidence of his proof  of entitlement to the funds. Mr N says he sent 
NatWest paperwork to show  where the money  had come from. But it wasnt  until he 
threatened to involve  the police that NatWest confirmed he would be able to access his 
funds. On 7 November 2018, Mr N attended a NatWest branch and withdrew his balance. 
Mr N says this all caused him a great deal of anxiety  particularly because  he needed the 
money in his account for everyday living expenses. He wants NatWest to apologise and pay 
him £5,000  compensation. 
NatWest accepts it should have provided  Mr N with better service  when it dealt  with Mr Ns 
calls. NatWest apologised and offered to pay him £50 compensation for poor service.  It also 
said it hadnt done anything wrong when it reviewed and closed Mr Ns account.  
Mr N disagreed and brought his complaint to us. An investigator looked into Mr Ns 
complaint. He said NatWest had made  a commercial decision to close Mr Ns account and 
had done enough to put things right. Mr N disagreed. He said NatWest had told him that it 
was going to hold onto his money for up to six months whilst it liaised with a money 
laundering officer. And only returned his money after weeks  of torture,  lies, threats, wasted  
calls and emails, police  and CAB involvement and health support service becoming  
involved. As no agreement could be reached the complaint has come  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN53521742account closure
A bank  is entitled  to close an account with a customer just as a customer may close  an 
account with a bank. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which 
complies with the terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions  of the account  which both NatWest and Mr N had to comply with, 
say that it could close the account immediately. NatWest has done  this. So its entitled  to 
close the account as it seems its already  done.  
Mr N says NatWest  didnt  explain  why it closed his account. But under the terms and 
conditions of the account NatWest isnt obliged to tell a customer why its closing an account.  
So I dont  think its made a mistake by not providing  any reasons to Mr N in this case. 
Having said that, I can see in its email to Mr N on 5 November  at 3.14pm, NatWest said its 
decision to close Mr Ns account had been taken following completion of its credit  file 
checks. So I think Mr N wouldve had some  understanding of why NatWest had taken the 
decision to close his account. And Im not persuaded that it was unfair or unreasonable  for 
NatWest to make credit  checks about Mr N. 
NatWest can make  commercial decisions about who it offers banking services  to. They 
cannot unfairly discriminate against a customer.  But they can say they no longer wish to do 
business with individuals.  Thats because theyve got the commercial  freedom to decide who 
they want to contract  with. And this service doesnt  normally interfere with a banks legitimate 
commercial decisions.  Im satisfied that NatWest has exercised its commercial decision 
legitimately when it decided to close Mr Ns account.  
access to funds
NatWest was entitled to review Mr Ns account  under the account  terms and conditions. And 
its required to have  measures in place to review  accounts. As part of its review  process 
NatWest is entitled  to ask a customer for more information. And its not for this service to 
interfere with the banks processes. Our role is to see if the bank has made any mistakes 
and then put the customer back in the position  theyd  have  been  in if the mistake hadnt 
happened. 
Having looked  at the available  information I can see NatWest reviewed Mr Ns account and 
asked Mr N to provide information to show he was entitled to the money in it. Im satisfied 
that NatWest acted in line with its legal and regulatory obligations when it blocked Mr Ns 
account and asked him for information.  I accept that this caused Mr N difficulty.  I also note 
he made several phone  calls to the bank to try and find out when he could have access to 
his funds. But I can also see that once Mr N provided information about the money in his 
account, NatWest released the money  to him. NatWest did this quickly. So I dont agree that 
Mr N endured weeks of torture as hes suggested.  
Mr N says NatWest  were  unhelpful to him when he called to try and sort out access to his 
money. He says that he had to visit a bank  branch  to collect  his closing  balance  and he was 
kept on hold on the phone  for too long. He says all of this caused him distress and 
inconvenience.
Ref: DRN53521743I fully accept that Mr N was upset and I recognise the strength of his feelings.  NatWest does 
accept it should  have dealt with Mr Ns calls better. And its apologised to Mr N. It has also 
offered Mr N £50 for any trouble and upset this caused.
Overall, I think NatWest  has done enough to put things right.  Ive also kept in mind  that 
NatWest returned  Mr Ns funds to him within a day of informing him his account would be 
closed. So I think its offer is a fair and reasonable way to resolve  this aspect of Mr Ns 
complaint. And, while I appreciate Mr N wont agree, I wont be asking it to do anything more.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, National  Westminster Bank  Plc has made a fair and 
reasonable offer to settle this complaint. So I am not going to ask it do anything more.
If it hasnt  already done so, National Westminster Plc should pay Mr N £50. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 July 2019.
