The complaint
Mr M complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he paid for some holiday club membership 
points. Hes being represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr M and his wife had entered into an agreement for a trial membership of a holiday club 
and they entered into a purchase agreement in June 2008 to buy 1,000 holiday club 
membership points. The total price of the membership points (including membership dues) 
was £14,554 and they traded in their trial membership which was given a value of £5,000 so 
the amount due from them was £9,554. Mr M entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount and agreed to make 120 monthly 
payments of £193.98 to Barclays Partner Finance. Barclays Partner Finance says that that 
loan was settled in July 2009.
Mr M and his wife entered into an acquisition agreement in December 2008 to buy another 
740 holiday club membership points. The total price of those membership points (including 
membership dues) was £9,688 and Mr M entered into another fixed sum loan agreement 
with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount. He agreed to make 120 monthly 
payments of £155.20 to Barclays Partner Finance. The loan was repaid in March 2013.
Mr Ms representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in June 2018 under sections 
75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and about a breach of fiduciary duty. It said 
that the membership had been misrepresented to Mr M and his wife, the holiday company 
had breached the contract, Barclays Partner Finance had paid a commission to the holiday 
company but didnt obtain Mr Ms informed consent, and there was an unfair relationship 
between Mr M and Barclays Partner Finance.
Barclays Partner Finance issued a detailed response to those claims. It said that Mr M was 
out of time under the Limitation Act 1980 to bring any claim but it also set out the reasons 
that it didnt consider that his claims should be upheld. It also said that there wasnt the 
relationship between the debtor, creditor and supplier that was required for a claim under 
section 75. Mr M then made a complaint to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She believed that a 
debtor-creditor-supplier link had been established but she thought that Barclays Partner 
Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of the section 75 claim to turn it down. She said 
that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr M and Barclays 
Partner Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the 
conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She didnt consider that Barclays Partner 
Finance had acted incorrectly in connection with any commission paid to the holiday 
company and she said that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending 
was unaffordable for Mr M.
Mr Ms representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says that its astounded that no terms in the contract are considered to be 
unfair and that charges, hidden within the terms, are unfair and that the agreement is unfair 
pursuant to section 140A. It also says, amongst other things, that the holiday company didnt 
broker proper credit and the provision of finance was unfair and failed to reach the standard 
expected of a firm regulated by then Financial Conduct Authority. It has described its serious 
concerns about the way that the finance was sold to Mr M and it has also provided a generic 
submission from counsel about the holiday company and the unfairness of the contractual 
terms that it uses.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ms complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr M and his wife entered into a purchase agreement in June 2008 and agreed to 
pay a total of £9,554 for 1,000 membership points - Mr M entered into a loan 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount - Barclays Partner 
Finance says that the June 2008 loan was settled in July 2009;
Mr M and his wife entered into an acquisition agreement in December 2008 and 
agreed to pay a total of £9,668 for another 740 membership points - Mr M entered 
into a loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount - 
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that the December 2008 
loan was repaid in March 2013;
Mr Ms representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in June 2018 and its 
letter included the account number for the December 2008 loan but referred to the 
June 2008 purchase  there was no reference in its letter to the June 2008 loan 
agreement or the December 2008 purchase but in this decision Im going to respond 
to Mr Ms complaint as if he was complaining about both the June and December 
2008 purchases and loan agreements;
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ms complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that hed 
made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to his 
claims;
Mr Ms claims included claims under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining 
the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - 
Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims 
was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ms claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company and that the memberships were misrepresented to him and his wife and 
that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to them;if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr M could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the membership points in December 2008 as that was the latest time that 
any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been 
incurred as he agreed to pay £9,668 to the holiday company;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made 
to Barclays Partner Finance until June 2018, more than nine years later, so I 
consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to Mr Ms misrepresentation 
claim under section 75 and I find that it wasnt unreasonable for it to have rejected 
that claim;
Mr Ms representative has also referred to breaches of contract by the holiday 
company and the time limit for a breach of contract claim is also six years from the 
date on which the cause of action accrued;
I consider that Mr M could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about those breaches of contract when he and his wife entered into 
the purchase agreement in December 2008 so I consider that his cause of action 
accrued at that time, and he would have had six years from then to bring a breach of 
contract claim against either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but 
a breach of contract claim wasnt made to Barclays Partner Finance until June 2018, 
more than nine years later, so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a 
defence to Mr Ms breach of contract claim under section 75 and I find that it wasnt 
unreasonable for it to have rejected that claim;
as I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to Mr Ms section 75 
claims, theres no need for me to make any finding as to whether there was the 
required relationship between the debtor, the creditor and the supplier in these 
arrangements;
Mr Ms representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr M and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that the June 2008 loan was settled in July 2009 and 
Ive seen no evidence to show that the June 2008 loan continued after July 2009 so 
Mr M would have had six years from July 2009 to bring a section 140A claim against 
either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made 
until June 2018, nearly nine years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that his section 140A claim about the June 2008 
purchase is now time-barred; 
Barclays Partner has provided an account statement which shows that the December 
2008 loan was repaid in March 2013, less than six years before his representative 
made claims to Barclays Partner Finance about an unfair relationship, so I dont 
consider that Mr Ms claim under section 140A about the December 2008 purchase is 
time-barred;
Mr Ms representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance in June 2018 set out the 
basis on which it considered that Mr Ms relationship with Barclays Partner Finance 
was unfair including: the commission that it had paid to the holiday company without 
obtaining Mr Ms informed consent; the sales practices that it had used; Mr M had 
limited means and could only afford the membership with the aid of the finance; no 
choice as to the finance provider was presented to Mr M; and breaches of applicable 
codes and regulations;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company but, from what this service has 
seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less 
than 15% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner Finance wouldnt have breached 
any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory duty to 
disclose the amount of any commission paid in these circumstances - and I dont 
consider that the level of any commission that was normally paid in this type of 
situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays Partner Finance should have 
appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr M risked the relationship being 
unfair under section 140A  and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that theres been a breach of fiduciary duty by Barclays Partner Finance;
Mr M and his wife entered into the acquisition agreement in December 2008 but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that Mr M complained to Barclays Partner Finance about 
the commission that it had paid to the holiday company until June 2018 (about nine 
and a half years after hed entered into the December 2008 loan agreement and 
more than five years after that loan had been repaid) and I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have complained to Barclays Partner Finance about any 
issues with the commission before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr M and his wife were 
unduly pressurised into buying the membership points in December 2008, that Mr M 
was unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement in December 2008 or 
that the holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against them  Ive 
seen no evidence to show that Mr M complained to Barclays Partner Finance about 
those issues until June 2018 (about nine and a half years after he and his wife 
entered into the purchase agreement) and I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect him to have complained to Barclays Partner Finance about any such issues 
before then;
Mr Ms representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance in June 2018 made claims 
about the manner in which the membership points had been sold to Mr M  but that 
was referring to the June 2008 purchase and, if Mr M and his wife were concerned 
about the manner in which the points had been sold to them in June 2008, I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect them to have been more cautious before 
entering into an agreement to buy more membership points only six months later;
Barclays Partner Finance hasnt provided any evidence about the credit checks that it 
conducted or the assessment of the affordability of the loan for Mr M that it made 
before it lent to him in December 2008 - but the loan account statement shows that 
Mr M made the loan repayments of £155.20 each month from February 2009 to February 2013 and that he then repaid the outstanding balance of the loan in March 
2013 by a debit payment;
Mr M and his wife signed a members declaration in December 2008 which said: We 
understand clearly what we have purchased and, having carefully considered this, 
and our other financial commitments, are able to pay the amounts due on the dates 
agreed; and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan 
wasnt affordable for Mr M in December 2008 when it was made to him or that hes 
experienced any financial difficulties as a result of the loan repayments;
the loan was made to Mr M in December 2008 and was repaid in March 2013 but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that he asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its credit checks until June 2018 and, if he couldnt afford the loan 
repayments or was concerned about the credit checks that it had conducted, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have contacted Barclays 
Partner Finance before then;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr M was presented with a choice about the 
finance provider but Barclays Partner Finance described in its final response letter 
the process that the holiday company would have gone through before the loan was 
made to Mr M - Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it was 
unfair or unreasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to have lent to Mr M, that it has 
acted incorrectly in connection with the loan agreement or that it has failed to reach 
the standard expected of its regulator;
the holiday company was identified as the retailer on the loan agreement and 
account statements and this services records show that the holiday company was 
covered under its consumer credit jurisdiction from 2007 until 2014  which it 
wouldnt have been had it not been granted a consumer credit licence by the Office 
of Fair Trading;
in the absence of any persuasive evidence to suggest otherwise, I dont consider that 
its unreasonable to conclude that its more likely that not that the holiday company 
held the requisite licence when Mr M entered into the loan agreement and that the 
loan agreement was enforceable; 
the members declaration that was signed by Mr M and his wife included information 
about the management charges and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that the charges that Mr M and his wife were required to pay for the 
membership points that they acquired under the acquisition agreement were unfair;
Ive carefully considered what Mr Ms representative has said about the unfairness of 
the terms of the agreement that Mr M entered into with the holiday company in 
December 2008 (including the submission from counsel that it has provided) and the 
breaches of applicable regulations and codes that it has described but Ive not been 
provided with all of the contractual documents that would have been signed by Mr M 
at that time and it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in 
those agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr M and his wife and I 
consider it be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr M and Barclays 
Partner Finance;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Ms relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr M and Barclays 
Partner Finance in these circumstances;
I consider that Barclays Partner Finances response to Mr Ms claims was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr M for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays 
Partner Finance to refund to Mr M any of the money that he paid under the loan 
agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 June 2023.
