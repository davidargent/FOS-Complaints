K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains that Barclays  Bank  UK PLC unfairly  placed a Credit  Industry  Fraud 
Avoidance System (CIFAS) marker against his name. Mr R says the marker was added 
following payments  from his account which he didnt  authorise. He wants Barclays to remove 
the marker.
background
In 2015, Mr R opened a student  account with Barclays. The account  was normally  credited 
by Mr Rs mother, until around September 2015, when he began receiving credits from 
student loan companies. Mr R used his account  regularly for daily spending.
Mr R says on 11 February 2016, he lost his wallet  which  contained his bank card. Mr R says 
due to memory issues, hed written  his PIN on the back of his bank card. On 12 February  
2016, Barclays sent Mr R a new card to use, which he was able to do using his existing PIN. 
On 11 February 2016, £4,935.06 was paid into Mr Rs account.  On 16 February  2016, 
Barclays was contacted by another bank,  which  I will refer to as bank A, who said their 
customer did not authorise the payment  of £4,935.06 to Mr Rs account.  Following  this 
notification, Barclays  returned the remaining funds in the account, £331.63, to bank  A. And it 
decided to close Mr Rs account. Barclays also thought Mr R had misused his account  so 
they applied a CIFAS  marker.
Below is a table which lists the relevant  transactions and activity that led Barclays to place 
the marker  against  Mr Rs name:

Mr R says it was only when he tried to open a new bank account in 2018 that he discovered 
Barclays had placed a CIFAS marker  against  his name. Mr R said someone else is 
responsible for the transactions and he knows nothing about  the money which was paid into 
his account on 11 February 2016.  He said he lost his card,  which had his PIN number 
recorded on it due to his memory  problems. So it wouldve been easy for somebody else to 
use his bank card and account. Mr R said Ms S is a friend from university and theyve 
previously helped each  other out financially. So he didnt  dispute the payment of £4 sent to 
Ms S on 10 February 2016.
Barclays said that it wouldnt remove the CIFAS marker because:
it believed Mr R had wrongfully kept a large  credit and believed he carried  out the 
subsequent transactions;
Mr Rs new bank card was sent to his home  address and they werent  contacted by 
Mr R to say he hadnt  received  it;
the transactions were made using the genuine  card and the correct PIN and
Mr Rs account statements were correctly  addressed so Mr R would have been 
aware of the activity  on his account.  But theres  no evidence Mr R contacted Barclays  
to raise any concerns  about activity on his account. 
investigators view
The investigator didnt  think Barclays had done anything wrong when it applied the CIFAS 
marker. She said Mr R had received fraudulent funds into his account,  which  over a period of 
five days in ten separate transactions, had been moved out of the account. The investigator  
also said that the two attempted  payments to Ms S had been done via a mobile banking 
application. For this to be completed  Mr Rs five digit online passcode wouldve been  
required. And Mr R had not mentioned  sharing this with anybody else.  On the balance of 
probabilities, the investigator said it was likely Mr R had authorised all the transactions and 
retained a wrongful credit. So she said Barclays had been fair when it applied the CIFAS 
marker. 
Mr R disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to look at everything. He insisted that he knew 
nothing about  the transactions. And says he is a victim who is being held responsible for 
someone elses crimes. He wants Barclays to remove the CIFAS marker. 
my findings
Ref: DRN96589703Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive come to the same 
conclusions as the investigator. Ill explain why.
were the disputed transactions authorised by Mr R?
Mr R says someone else is responsible  for the transactions on his account between 11 and 
16 February 2016. Hes said he knows nothing about the £4,395.06, which  was paid into his 
account. And hes explained  that he lost his bank card, which  had his PIN number recorded 
on it. So it wouldve been easy for somebody  else to use his bank card and account. 
Barclays records show that Mr R reported his bank card as lost on 11 February  2016.  So it 
seems likely that Mr R carried  out the two transactions on 9 and 10 February 2016  an ATM 
withdrawal and payment  to Ms S. Ive also kept in mind  that Mr R hasnt disputed these 
transactions. Barclays hasnt been able to confirm exactly when on 11 February Mr R 
reported his card as lost, which  isnt surprising given the amount of time that has now 
passed. But said as soon as it was reported  lost it blocked the card. So it wouldnt have been 
able to have been used  by anyone  including Mr R.
On the same  day Mr R reported his card lost, £4,395.06 was paid into his account. Barclays 
cant confirm what time this happened. But from looking at Mr Rs account activity  at 14:36 
an ATM  withdrawal  for £300 was made. I think its likely that this withdrawal was made  
before Mr R reported his card lost, and after the large credit reached Mr Rs account. I say 
this because Barclays had blocked  Mr Rs card when he reported it lost. So the transaction  
wouldnt have been authorised. And the card wouldve been captured  by the cash  machine. 
But even if the machine  hadnt captured the card,  the withdrawal wouldve been declined  
because as of 10 February 2016,  Mr R didnt have enough money in his account  to make the 
withdrawal. Mr R says he cant remember if he made the withdrawal as it was so long ago. 
So I think its likely that Mr R authorised this transaction and was still in possession of his 
lost bank card when  the fraudulent funds were paid into his account.
Within minutes of this withdrawal two payments were attempted  to Mr Rs friend Ms S via a 
mobile banking  application. The first payment was for £4,000 and the second for £1,500.  
The IP address  used  to make the transactions were in the same area as the ATM machine 
used at 14:36. Barclays says these payments didnt  go through  as it had concerns  the 
payments werent  genuine.
Barclays has provided evidence to show that a new bank card was issued to Mr R and sent 
by first class post to Mr Rs address on 12 February 2016. Barclays  has also confirmed that 
a new PIN wasnt ordered, which means Mr Rs PIN remained the same as the one Mr R 
used for his lost card. Barclays says Mr R didnt contact them  to say he hadnt  received his 
new bank card. And it has provided  evidence to show that the new card was used for all the 
transactions from 13 February  2016.
Between 13 and 16 February 2016,  nine transactions  took place to withdraw  money from the 
account. These included ATM and Assisted Service Device (ASD) withdrawals. And card 
payments.
From looking  at whats happened here, there  are three  possible  explanations for how the 
disputed withdrawals came to be made. They are:
Ref: DRN96589704someone unknown  to Mr R made  the transactions;
somebody known  to Mr R was responsible for the transactions or
Mr R carried  out the transactions himself
The first is that someone unknown to Mr R made  the transactions.  This may explain the first 
transaction - the £300 ATM withdrawal. Especially if I also accept Mr R wrote his PIN on his 
bank card, which would explain how someone  else was able to get hold of Mr Rs PIN. 
But this explanation isnt plausible for the subsequent transactions. I say this because  the 
card used for this transaction was blocked after Mr R reported his card lost. This means  that 
someone unknown  to Mr R would have also needed  to be in possession of Mr Rs new bank 
card, which had been sent out to Mr Rs home  address.  So they wouldve needed to be 
aware of where  Mr R lived, known Mr R had reported his card lost and intercepted  the new 
bank card. The same person wouldve also needed to be in possession of Mr Rs mobile 
banking information.  But Mr R has told us he never disclosed  this information to anyone.  So 
when I weigh everything up, I think its unlikely that someone unknown  to Mr R made  the 
transactions.
The second  explanation is that somebody known to Mr R made the transactions.  I accept its 
possible that someone close to Mr R or living at his address is responsible for the 
transactions. And to have used Mr Rs account to receive the fraudulent credit.  But from 
looking at Mr Rs account activity this person would need to be in possession of both cards   
the lost and new card. I think this is unlikely.
I also think its unlikely that someone known to Mr R would try and make  two payments to 
Ms S, who Mr R has told us is his friend. I say this because there  would be no benefit  to 
them doing  this. I can also see that both payments to Ms S were attempted  within  minutes of 
the £300 ATM withdrawal  and via Mr Rs mobile  banking application, which to have been  
successful wouldve required Mr Rs five digit security passcode.  And Mr R has said he has 
not shared this information with anyone. So for someone known to Mr R to have carried out 
these transactions  they wouldve needed to be in possession  of both bank cards and Mr Rs 
online banking information.
Having looked  at whats happened  in this case I think its more likely  than not that Mr R 
carried out the transactions himself. I say this because:
Mr R says he sent money to Ms S from his account and other bank accounts  prior to 
10 February 2016;
Mr R says Ms S is a personal friend  of his;
its likely  Mr R withdrew £300 from his account  on 11 February 2016, the same day 
fraudulent funds were  paid into the account;
Barclays sent a new bank card to Mr Rs home address;
Mr R never contacted Barclays to report he hadnt received his new bank card;
there were no PIN changes and his new bank card had the same PIN as Mr Rs lost 
bank card;
the disputed  transactions  were authorised using Mr Rs genuine cards (chip) and 
PIN;
theres no convincing  explanation for how a third party could have gained possession 
of Mr Rs new bank card and known Mr Rs PIN;
Mr R never disclosed  his online banking  details to anyone  else;
Mr R says he was never approached by anyone else to use his account;  
Ref: DRN96589705despite Mr Rs concern about being  a victim  of someone elses crime  Ive not seen 
any evidence that he contacted the police and
Mr R didnt dispute the large amount  of money  which was paid into his account, with 
Barclays at the time.
So based  on this, I think its more likely than not that Mr R made  or authorised  the 
transactions that he disputes.
CIFAS marker
Barclays says it applied  the CIFAS marker  because bank A said their customer didnt 
authorise the payment made into Mr Rs account. And Mr R retained  a wrongful credit. In 
other words Mr R kept money that wasnt his. So Ive looked at whether Barclays was fair to 
apply the marker,  based on the evidence it had, the investigation it carried  out. And what  the 
rules say about applying such markers.
CIFAS guidance says the business  must have carried out checks  of sufficient  depth  to meet 
the burden of proof set by CIFAS,  which at that time was that Barclays needed to have 
enough information to make a formal complaint to the police or other  relevant  law 
enforcement agencies. And that any filing should be for confirmed cases  of fraud, rather  than 
mere suspicion.  
Its not in dispute  that Mr R received  fraudulent funds into his account. And for the reasons 
Ive already explained, I think its likely  R wrongfully retained these funds and authorised  all 
of the transactions he disputes.  On that basis, I think its fair that Barclays  reported Mr R to 
CIFAS. And Im not going to ask Barclays to remove the marker against his name. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 August 2019.
