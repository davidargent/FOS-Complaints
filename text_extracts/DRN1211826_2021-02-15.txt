K822xcomplaint
Mr S complained about ReAssure Limiteds  administration of his pension  and the delay this 
caused in him receiving  his pension payments.
background 
Mr Ss retirement date was due to be 2 January 2019. In October  2018  ReAssure  wrote  to 
Mr S to set out his pension options.  Of relevance  here, ReAssure said that Mr Ss total 
annual retirement  income would be:
£10,754.04 if he didnt take any tax free lump sum cash  from his pension  pot; or
£1,123.80  if a lump  sum of £35,003.60 was taken.
Mr S enquired about the information  he received  and in November  2018  ReAssure wrote to 
him again. It said the previous figure was incorrect in respect  of the income  he would receive  
if he took a tax free lump  sum and it had now been  recalculated. ReAssure now said that 
Mr Ss total annual retirement  income  would be:
£10,754.04 if he didnt take any tax free lump sum cash;  or
£8,097.72  if a lump  sum of £40,003.60 was taken.
On 11 December 2018 an independent financial  advisor (who I will refer to as T) wrote  to 
ReAssure on Mr Ss behalf to request information about his pension  including  the 
retirement options and the necessary forms to enable him to take his benefits. On 30 
January 2019  ReAssure  wrote to T and provided the necessary forms with the correct tax 
free cash  lump sum amount. ReAssure now (correctly) said that Mr Ss total annual 
retirement income would  be:
£10,754.04 if he didnt take any tax free lump sum cash;  or
£8,097.72  if a lump  sum of £35,003.60 was taken.
ReAssure received the completed forms and documentation on 20 February 2019. It wrote 
to Mr S on 8 March 2019 to confirm the annuity  had been arranged (backdated to 2 January 
2019) and the tax free lump sum of £35,003.60 would be sent.
Mr S later complained to ReAssure about  the incorrect information he was given and the 
delays in him receiving  his pension payments. ReAssure accepted it had made  mistakes  
with the information given  to Mr S and in setting up his annuities.  It apologised for the poor 
service and to resolve the situation  it offered £250  compensation for the trouble caused and 
£90 for the interest on the delayed payments.
Our investigator felt the complaint should be upheld. She was satisfied the compensation 
ReAssure had paid was fair; however,  she felt the interest on the backdated pension 
payments should  be at a rate of 8% rather than the Bank of England base rate plus 1% that 
ReAssure had used.
Communications then went back and forth about how much the interest  would be and how it 
was calculated. As it stands:
ReAssures total offer is £762.13 (£490.67 for interest on the tax free cash,  £21.46 for 
interest on the annuity payments,  and £250  compensation)
Ref: DRN12118262Mr S is prepared  to accept £1,050.83 (£529.37 for interest on the tax free cash, £21.46 
for interest on the annuity  payments, £250  for Ts costs and £250 compensation). 
As the parties couldnt  agree on the sum payable the case  has been passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
issue to determine
Ultimately, the issue for me to decide  is whether ReAssures  current  offer is fair and 
reasonable.
There are certain elements that are either  not in dispute or both Mr S and ReAssure  are in 
agreement. Those elements are:
ReAssure made  mistakes with the information  it sent to Mr S
these mistakes led to both the tax free cash and the initial  annuity  payments being paid 
later than they otherwise would have been
interest should be calculated at a rate of 8% simple per annum
fair compensation  for ReAssures handling of the matter  is £250
fair interest on the delayed annuity payments is £21.46.
I dont therefore  think its necessary  for me to dwell on those issues.
tax free cash
ReAssure has told us that payments are generally  made five to seven working days  prior to 
a customer receiving them. In this case, it said the tax free cash was paid to Mr S on 
7 March 2019. Mr S said he received the money  on 12 March  2019. So the date Mr S 
received the payment ties in with the date ReAssure says it sent it.
Had things gone  smoothly ReAssure would  have paid Mr S the tax free sum of £35,003.60 
on 2 January 2019. So, using what actually happened as a guide, Mr S would have received 
the payment around 7 January 2019.  So Mr S received the payment 64 days later than he 
most likely would have.
In my view, the fair remedy is for Mr S to be paid the tax free sum (which ReAssure had paid 
prior to Mr S complaining), plus interest to compensate for the fact Mr S lost out on the use 
of those funds  for 64 days. By my calculations, the interest is £490.88:
Lump sum payment = £35,003.60
8% interest per annum on £35,003.60  = £2,800.29
So daily interest = £7.67
64 days x £7.67  = £490.88
Ts costs
Mr Ss argument here is essentially that had ReAssure provided  the correct  figures  and 
forms it would have  been a simple matter  of him signing  and returning the forms in order to 
Ref: DRN12118263receive his tax free cash and set up the annuity.  But because of the incorrect information 
being sent, in order to protect his interests he was forced to appoint T to sort out the 
administrative mess.
In mid-2018 Mr S met a financial advisor  (who Ill refer to as E). Following  the meeting E 
wrote to ReAssure asking if Mr Ss policy could  be transferred. It was told it couldnt as Mr S 
was only six months from retirement  age. E told Mr S there  wasnt  much more  it could  do to 
help.
Mr S met E again following receipt of the pension  options in October 2018. A few days  later 
E told Mr S that it had checked  with ReAssure, who said there  had been  an error in the 
information that had been provided. E confirmed to Mr S that the correct annual  income 
would be £8,097.72 if he took the £35,003.60 tax free lump sum. E also told Mr S this 
income was fair and in line with Mr Ss expectations. 
Following receipt of the pension options  in November  2018 Mr S contacted  E again.  This 
time E suggested  to Mr S that he contact another financial adviser as his retirement date 
was nearing.
I understand that E provided its help and guidance  to Mr S free of charge.
Mr S then contacted T for help. T contacted ReAssure and asked for detailed  information in 
respect of Mr Ss pension,  as well as the retirement  options and necessary forms. Ultimately, 
T assisted Mr S in getting  the annuity arranged. Mr S has said that he paid T £500  for its 
services.
Its obviously a consumers prerogative  to seek professional help or advice. However, I dont 
usually ask businesses  to reimburse a consumer for any costs they incur in getting that 
help/advice. This is because I think most issues and complaints  can be resolved without it. 
Often a phone call or email to the business  involved is all thats  needed.
I usually only consider making a business reimburse  a consumer for professional costs for 
two reasons. The first is if the issue is so complicated that the consumer was out of their 
depth and the matter  couldnt be fairly resolved  without professional advice. The second  is if 
the relationship  between  the consumer and the business has completely broken down. I 
dont think either scenario  happened  here.
Its true that ReAssure  sent incorrect information  to Mr S twice; and I appreciate how that 
might have led to Mr S questioning and distrusting ReAssures competency. But Mr S knew  
what the correct figures were and that they were fair because E had already told him after it 
had checked with ReAssure. Im not therefore persuaded that Mr S was forced to contact T 
in order to get the matter resolved or that it could only have been  resolved with Ts help. It 
strikes me that the matter  could have been resolved  fairly easily  if Mr S contacted  ReAssure 
directly.
I dont therefore  think there are grounds to ask ReAssure  to contribute  towards the costs 
Mr S incurred.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  I require ReAssure Limited  to pay Mr S:
Ref: DRN12118264£250 compensation for distress and inconvenience, and
£512.34 (less tax if properly deductible)  for lost interest on the delayed  annuity and tax 
free cash  payments.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 March  2021.
