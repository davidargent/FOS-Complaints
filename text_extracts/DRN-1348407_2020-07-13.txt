The complaint
Mrs G complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
FCA Automotive Services UK Limited, trading as Fiat Financial Services, wasnt of 
satisfactory quality. Her daughter is also involved in the complaint.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Fiat Financial Services, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs G - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mrs G was a new car and I consider that it was 
reasonable for her to expect that it would be free from even minor defects;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car was supplied to Mrs G in September 2015 and her daughter says that she 
complained to the dealer in September 2016 about a squeaking noise and the dealer 
says that the brakes were cleaned in October 2016 but no fault was found  Mrs G 
also complained to Fiat Financial Services and it sent her its final response letter in 
November 2016;
the dealer says that the last time that it saw the car was in November 2017 because 
of a noise from the left hand wheel and a shock absorber was replaced but Mrs Gs 
daughter says that the fault has continued, the cars been taken to another garage 
and three years have been spent: investigating and attempting speculative fixes 
(both unsuccessfully) instead of progressing the matter effectively;
Fiat Financial Services accepts that Mrs G complained to the dealer about noise 
issues from the car in September 2016 and November 2017  and it says that it will 
take the car back and give her £1,000 compensation;
the investigator thought that the offer was a fair and reasonable outcome but Mrs Gs 
daughter has provided a detailed response to the investigators recommendation  
which Ive fully considered - but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that theres an ongoing fault with the car that caused it not to have been of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs G;
Mrs G complained to Fiat Financial Services in May 2019 that the fault with the car 
hadnt been resolved - but if there had been an ongoing fault with the car I consider 
that it would be reasonable to except Mrs G to have returned the car to the dealer 
more times than she has and to have followed up on her complaint to Fiat Financial 
Services much sooner than she did;
I consider that Fiat Financial Services offer to take back the car and to pay Mrs G 
£1,000 is fair and reasonable in the circumstances and its more than I would have 
required it to do - so Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require it to pay Mrs G the additional compensation that her daughter has claimed; 
and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Fiat Financial Services to 
take any action in response to Mrs Gs complaint  if she now wants to accepts its 
offer I suggest that she contacts it to see if the offer remains available to her.
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2020.
