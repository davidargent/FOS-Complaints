The complaint
T complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) misled it over its terms of 
business.
What happened
T opened an account with PayPal in April 2019 for some of its trading. In June 2019, PayPal 
placed restrictions on the account - a reserve balance was held, so T couldnt use some of 
its money. PayPal asked for financial and trading information. They asked T to repay an 
associated balance of £2797.66 debit. T did this in July 2019. PayPal continued to hold 
reserve balances. T stopped using PayPal in August 2019.
T complained. It said that the debit balance of £2797.66 was nothing to do with it. It said that 
the financial and trading information was given to PayPal on 11 June 2019. T called PayPal 
on 12 June 2019. It says that the call handler agreed that if the debit balance was paid off, 
then the reserve of 50% of invoices would be released in 30 days time and after that, a 
lower level of reserve would apply. T repaid the debit balance on 9 July 2019 even though it 
had nothing to do with it. But PayPal then continued to hold onto reserve funds  by then, 
these were about £18000 - for 90 days.
PayPal replied in December 2019. They said that Ts owner was associated to the 
outstanding debit balance and was responsible for it. It was part of their user agreement that 
they could hold reserves, based on a review of Ts risk exposure. They said they would 
speak to the call handler in question. They offered a goodwill payment of £75. 
T brought its complaint to this service in April 2020. Our investigator looked at what had 
happened. In December 2020, she said that she was satisfied that Ts owner was associated 
with the outstanding debit balance. The recording of the call on 12 June 2019 was not 
available. She didnt doubt Ts version of events. But it was a matter of commercial 
judgement on the part of PayPal to decide its terms of business  this was within its user 
agreement.  So, she thought that theyd acted reasonably and noted their offer of a goodwill 
payment of £75.
T asked that its complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or contradictory (as some of it is here) I 
must base my decision on the balance of probabilities. That is  whats more likely than not 
to have happened in all of the circumstances here, based on the available evidence.
T is annoyed at how its been treated by PayPal. T feels it was misled into paying off the 
debit balance  and was now short of cash as PayPal carried on holding money in reserve, 
which couldnt be used. T says that PayPal agreed on the telephone in June 2019  that if 
the associated debit balance was repaid, and financial and trading information was provided, 
the reserve would be released after 30 days  and then lower levels of reserve would apply, 
for up to six months. The information was given to PayPal. But the reserve  of about 
£18000 - wasnt completely released, and high levels of reserves continued - in July 2019, a 
reserve of 40% of funds was to be held for another 90 days, plus an amount of £9000 for 75 
days. 
 A small business needs cash to trade, so for T to have large amounts of money held by 
PayPal must have been difficult. T says it needed the cash to pay wages and suppliers. 
T has been consistent in what its said, and I do not doubt that what it has told us is right. But 
the key issue here is that with the passage of time, the call recording has been deleted - 
weve seen evidence that it has - and there are no notes on the account to say PayPal did 
agree to what T has said. 
But equally, I cant tell PayPal how to run its business  it makes its own risk assessments 
based on its knowledge of its customers and the information it gets from them. In this case, 
PayPal decided that based on its trading, it wanted to hold some of Ts cash in reserve. 
PayPal have shown us evidence that the debit balance of £2797 was associated to T, so it 
was fair to ask it to repay it.
And PayPals terms of business are set out in its User Agreement: 10.2 Actions by PayPal. 
If we have reason to believe that you have engaged in any Restricted Activities, we may take 
various actions to protect PayPal, a User, a third party, or you from Reversals, Chargebacks, 
Claims, fees, fines, penalties and any other liability. The actions we may take include but are 
not limited to the following:
b. Block your Account and/or hold any funds in the Reserve Account (including, without
limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by PayPal, where PayPals rights under
section 10.2 arise from your engagement in the Restricted Activity set out in section 9.1)
I can see that T feels strongly that it was misled and has been consistent it its story. So, it 
will be disappointed with my decision - but, with only incomplete and contradictory evidence, 
I cant say that PayPal have done anything wrong here. Theyve offered a goodwill payment 
of £75, which T hasnt yet accepted  but if it wishes to do so, it should contact PayPal to 
arrange payment.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2021.
