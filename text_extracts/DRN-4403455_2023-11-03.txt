The complaint
Mr D complains about PrePay Technologies Limited, trading as PrePay Solutions (Prepay), 
transferring his funds from EUR to GBP, causing a foreign exchange conversation rate cost.
What happened
I issued my provisional decision on 16 October 2023, and this is what I said:
Ive considered the relevant information about this complaint.
Based on what Ive seen so far, there will be a different outcome to what our investigator
proposed. Before I issue my final decision, I wanted to give everyone a chance to reply.
Ill look at any more comments and evidence that I get by 30 October 2023. But unless the
information changes my mind; my final decision is likely to be along the following lines.
The complaint
Mr D complains about PrePay Technologies Limited, trading as PrePay Solutions (Prepay), 
transferring his funds from EUR to GBP, causing a foreign exchange conversation rate cost.
What happened
Mr Ds account is with PrePay but branded Monese. PrePay decided to close Mr Ds account
and they asked Mr D for details of another bank account so they could transfer his balance.
Mr D says "I instructed (PrePay) to send EUR payment to my IBAN and GBP to my UK
account.
However, PrePay credited Mr Ds GBP bank account with EUR. This action meant EUR had
to be converted to GBP, resulting in a foreign exchange conversion rate being used. Mr D
calculated this as at least £228.20 and he complained to PrePay and requested a refund.
PrePay rejected Mr Ds complaint as they felt they acted on the information that he provided.
They did however offer Mr D a goodwill gesture of EUR140.
As Mr D considered the goodwill gesture to be lower than the exchange rate conversion
cost, he declined it and complained to our service.
Our investigators view was that PrePay made an error and should pay Mr D £248.36 (to
cover the exchange rate conversion) plus £50 compensation.
Mr D was satisfied with this outcome but PrePay didnt agree. PrePay explained this was
because Mr D provided two options and, as there was insufficient information to make a 
EUR to EUR credit, they used the other information he detailed. Our investigator 
acknowledged this, but the view remained the same.
As PrePay remain dissatisfied this case has been referred to me to look at.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have a different view to the investigator and Im partially upholding this
complaint. I will explain how I have come to my decision.
I looked closely at the request PrePay made to ascertain Mr Ds account details so they
could credit him with his funds.
PrePay asked for the following questions to be completed:
1. Account holders name
2. Account number and sort code (for UK payments)
3. IBAN and SWIFTBIC (for international payments)
4. Bank name and address
5. Your preferred currency (well use the daily exchange rate)
And Mr Ds response to PrePay was:
 use "xxx" (IBAN ref) for international transfers and "Sort code: xxx /Account number:
xxx" for UK payments.
PrePays view of this information provided by Mr D was that it was incomplete and although
he gave them two options, to credit either an account via IBAN or UK account, it was only
possible to credit the UK account because IBAN required SWIFTBIC information as detailed
in their request. So, as they had sufficient information to credit his UK account, they believed
this would meet his requirement. Similarly, with regards to the currency, Mr D did not
provide the requested information so PrePay understood that we can send the funds to
either of the options.
I am persuaded from Mr D comments to our service, which include I requested they send
me my EUR to another EUR account I own with another bank and "I instructed to send EUR
payment to my IBAN and GBP to my UK account, that he did present Prepay with two
options but didnt want an exchange rate conversion. However, I cant see that Mr D made
this clear to PrePay.
Our investigator thought that PrePay shouldve contacted Mr D. I think this wouldve been
good practice, especially as PrePay considered the form to be incomplete. However, PrePay
asked Mr D to fully complete their information request and, having looked closely at the
information provided, the missing detail and PrePays interpretation of Mr Ds response, I
can understand why PrePay went ahead and used the information provided.
Considering all the above, I think this issue couldve been avoided with different
communication from both parties. Mr D couldve completed Prepays questions and / or
made a clear request and PrePay couldve tried to contact Mr D to clarify matters. So, for
that reason Im partially upholding this complaint, and I think PrePays goodwill gesture,
which was to pay approximately half of the exchange rate loss that our investigator
estimated, is a fair and reasonable amount compensation here.
So, my provisional decision is that I require PrePay to pay Mr D £124.18.
My provisional decision
For the reasons Ive given above, its my provisional decision to partially uphold this
complaint.
I require PrePay Technologies Limited trading as PrePay Solutions, to pay Mr D £124.18
compensation.Ill look at anything else anyone wants to give me  so long as I get it before 30 October
2023. Unless that information changes my mind, my final decision is likely to be as Ive set
out above.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill start by thanking both parties for their responses. Also, I would like to point out that my 
role here is to be impartial  that is, to be objective and to be fair to both parties.
Mr D said:
"You are wrong. The issue is not about sending the money to the wrong bank account but 
charging FX fees (not FX rate, let me know if you don't understand the difference) for doing 
the transfer. I have asked to be paid back the FX fees which is twice more than what you are 
suggesting."
PrePay said:
We would like to confirm there is nothing else wed like to add at this time.
Although no further evidence has been produced, as Mr D is dissatisfied with both my 
understanding and provisional decision, I reviewed the file again.
Having done so, although I think PrePay couldve tried to clarify matters, I also still think Mr 
D contributed to the issue here.
Mr D didnt provide the information requested and although he says PrePay:
exchanged EUR for GBP without my approval and then sent money to the wrong
bank account
I found that Mr D provided PrePay with incomplete information and presented them with two 
payment options. 
PrePay had insufficient information to complete the EUR to EUR IBAN option for which an 
exchange rate conversion wouldnt have been necessary. However, although Mr D says 
PrePay sent money to the wrong bank account, he presented them with information GBP to 
my UK account that appeared to be a second option and, considering this, I think it was 
reasonable of PrePay to believe they were fulfilling Mr Ds request. 
I cant see that Prepay charged any fees here. 
In his complaint Mr D says PrePay charged me for an Exchange rate and describes his 
loss as:
You have exchanged my EUR to GBP (without my approval) and sent the money to my 
GBP account. Moreover, looking at the exchange rate (EUR/GBP : 0,883) on 24 January 
(when I received the money), I received £5,937 instead of £6,191; difference of £254.
EUR 7,000  0,883 is = £6,191. The difference (£254) is what I was charged.So, his dissatisfaction is with both the account credited and the exchange rate that was used 
to convert his EUR to GBP. 
When sending back the EUR 7000 a foreign exchange of 0.8482 was used rather than the 
0.883 Mr D would have liked. Whilst I understand Mr Ds preference for a mid-rate to be 
used, considering Mr Ds response to PrePay, together with information on foreign exchange 
transactions, wholesale rates and PrePays terms and conditions which include the following:
We transfer the relevant money and details of your payment request to a third party.
We use the latest exchange rate available to us from the third party we use to 
exchange currency and/or transfer the money. 
We pass this exchange rate onto you without adjustment there may be the possibility 
of a change in the exchange rate between the time you authorise the payment and 
the time the currency exchange is carried out by the third party. This means that the 
recipient of the payment may receive slightly more or less than you expected.
Information on the exchange rate and any applicable fees for international payments 
from your Card can be found on our Fees and Limits page. 
We use the Mastercard wholesale exchange rate and pass this onto you without 
adjustment. You can check the exchange rate and information on supported 
currencies by using the Mastercard Currency Converter Calculator.
So, Im satisfied that it was necessary for PrePay to use a foreign exchange rate to pay GBP 
to Mr Ds UK account and that the rate they used was fair and reasonable.
So, having considered everything again, whilst I appreciate Mr D will be disappointed, my 
final decision is that Im still partially upholding this complaint and Im not persuaded to 
require PrePay to pay more than £124.18, which is similar to their goodwill offer.
As mentioned in my provisional decision, I think this issue couldve been avoided with 
different communication from both parties. Mr D couldve completed PrePays questions and 
/ or made a clear request and PrePay couldve tried to contact Mr D to clarify matters. 
So, I think £124.18, which equates to approximately half of what Mr D expected to receive 
with a mid-rate, is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
My final decision
For the reasons given above and in my provisional decision, my final decision is that Im 
partially upholding this complaint.
I require PrePay Technologies Limited trading as PrePay Solutions, to pay Mr D £124.18
compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2023.
