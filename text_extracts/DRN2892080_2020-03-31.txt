K821x#15complaint
Mr R complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  lent 
irresponsibly to him. 
background
Between December  2014 and June 2018,  Mr R borrowed  15 loans from Sunny. His 
borrowing history is set out at the appendix  to this decision. 
Mr Rs first loan was a running  account  credit facility, which meant  that he was able to draw  
down funds up to his credit limit. In this case,  that limit was £750. Mr R used this facility three 
times, but I have treated  it as one loan. Following the running account facility, Mr R borrowed 
14 instalment loans. 
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be upheld in respect of loans 6 to 15. She 
thought that by this point, the pattern  of Mr Rs borrowing would have shown Sunny that 
continuing to lend to him was harmful. 
Sunny disagreed with that view.  It said there  were  significant gaps in Mr Rs borrowing and it 
reiterated the checks it had undertaken. However, Sunny said it recognised  it should  not 
have provided  loan 13 and it offered to settle  the complaint  on that basis.  
Another of our adjudicators then considered the matter. She thought  that there were three 
separate chains  of lending: loans 1 to 5; loans 6 to 13; and loans 14 and 15. With that in 
mind, she didnt think Sunny should  have agreed  loans  4, 5 and 13. This view was not 
accepted by the parties. So, the matter has been passed to me to make a final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN28920802the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
I agree  with our second adjudicator that there are three chains of lending  in this matter and 
that each should be considered separately. I do so below. 
Loans 1 to 5
Neither party disagreed with what  our adjudicators said about loan 1 (the running  account 
credit facility) and so I have not considered further  whether this loan was irresponsibly  lent. I 
have kept the circumstances  in mind though when considering the complaint as a whole. 
Looking at the instalment loans, I think that as loans 2 and 3 were relatively early in the 
lending relationship between Mr R and Sunny, the lender was entitled to rely on the 
information Mr R gave  it. Taking account  of the income and expenditure figures, I think it 
would have reasonably appeared to Sunny  that Mr R could sustainably afford these loan 
repayments. 
However, by the time, Mr R applied for loan 4, my view is that more  checks  should have 
been done. By this time, I think  it would have been proportionate for Sunny to undertake  a 
full review of Mr Rs financial circumstances.  Had Sunny carried out that review,  I think  it 
would have seen  that Mr R had a fairly significant amount of outstanding credit  that could 
have affected  his ability to sustainably repay loans 4 and 5. I agree with our adjudicator  that 
the complaint  should be upheld in respect of that borrowing. 
Loans 6 to 13
Almost a year had passed between Mr R borrowing  loans 5 and 6. So I think that was 
sufficient time for Sunny to consider  his application for loan 6 separately  to what had gone  
before. So for loans  6 to 8, I agree with our adjudicator that Sunny was entitled  to rely on the 
Ref: DRN28920803information he provided to it. And upon  doing  so, I think  the repayments would have 
appeared reasonably to be sustainably affordable. 
I think Sunny  could have  done more to find out about Mr Rs financial  circumstances  in 
respect of the subsequent loans. But even if it had done that, I dont think  it would have seen 
enough to suggest that it shouldnt agree to lend Mr R the loans. I can see that Mr R had 
some outstanding credit, but I dont  think it would have caused Sunny to think  he would have  
difficulty sustainably repaying his loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing if there was 
a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further  lending  was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. If that were so, Sunny  should  have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I agree with our second adjudicator  that 
this point was reached  by loan 13. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr R was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. He had taken out 8 loans within around  5 months.  So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr R was having  to borrow  further to cover 
the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and that his 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Loan 6 was for £700 and loan 13 was for £750.  At this point Sunny ought to have 
known that Mr R was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall  in their 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. Loan 13 was larger than loan 6, even though  it 
was taken out some time later. Mr R wasnt making any real inroads to the amount 
he owed Sunny. He had effectively  paid large amounts of interest  to service a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period.  
So, for this chain of lending,  I am upholding the complaint in respect of loan 13. 
Loans 14 and 15
By the time Mr R applied  for loan 14, almost two years had passed since  he borrowed loan 
13. And so I think it was reasonable  for Sunny to treat this as new lending. I can see that it 
checked Mr Rs income  and expenditure for these loans and from the information he 
provided, I think the loans  would have  appeared to be sustainably affordable. I dont uphold 
the complaint  about loans 14 and 15. 
In conclusion, Im upholding the complaint about  loans  4, 5 and 13. Sunny must take action 
to put things right.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 4, 5 and 13. 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Rs credit file;
Ref: DRN28920804the information recorded  about  Mr Rs credit file in respect of loan 13 is adverse. All 
entries about this loan must  be removed from Mr Rs credit  file.  
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding this complaint. Elevate  Credit International 
Limited must  put things right as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2020.
