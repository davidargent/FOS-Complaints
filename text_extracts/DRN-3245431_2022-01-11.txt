The complaint
Ms R says S.D. Taylor Limited trading as Loans at Home (LaH) lent to her irresponsibly. 
Ms R also says she was in a debt spiral and she couldnt afford the loan repayments. She 
thinks that LaH shouldve seen this and not lent to her. 
  
What happened
This complaint is about 95 home collected loans LaH provided to Ms R between September 
2004 and May 2018. Some of the information I have been provided, about some of the 
lending, is in the table below (Ive not included some loans to save space).

LaH has said that this Service shouldnt consider loans 1 to 66 as Ms R complained more 
than six years after they were lent. So, it doesnt think they are within the jurisdiction of the 
Financial Ombudsman Service. 
LaH has also said that loans 67 to 95 should be upheld. It offered compensation on the 
same basis that I would award if I were to uphold the complaint about this lending. Ms R 
hasnt agreed to this compensation. 
Our adjudicator firstly said that loans 1 and 2 werent within the jurisdiction of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service as they were sold before this service is able to consider complaints 
about this product type.  
But she thought Ms R had complained in time about loans 3 to 66 This is because whilst she 
made her complaint more than six years from when she started the loans there was no 
evidence to suggest she complained later than three years before she was aware or ought to 
have been aware she could complain.  
Our adjudicator then looked at the merits of the complaint and went on to partially uphold it. 
She said that by loan 11 the lending pattern itself looked to have become harmful, and so 
LaH shouldve stopped lending at this point. 
LaH disagreed with the adjudicators opinion about the jurisdiction of the complaint. It said 
that, essentially, Ms R was in arrears with her lending as early as 2009 and this continued 
going forward, notably in 2016 and 1017. So, she would have been aware that the loans 
were causing her problems more than three years before she made her complaint. And she 
should have been aware that she could complain about them much earlier than she did. It 
says this this approach would be consistent with other answers that LaH, and its parent 
company, have received from the Financial Ombudsman Service recently. 
Ms R didnt disagree with what the adjudicator said. 
Why I cant look into loans 1 and 2 and why I can look into loans 3 to 66
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments provided by Ms R and LaH to 
decide which loans we can consider. Having done so, I have reached the same conclusion 
as the adjudicator  that I have the power to consider loans 3 to 66 (its not disputed I can 
look at loans 67 to 95). Ill explain why. 
Loans 1 and 2 were started before this product was regulated in April 2007. I can only look 
at regulated loans, and so I cant consider these. 
In respect of loans 2 to 66. The rules I must apply say that, where a business doesnt agree, 
I cant look at a complaint made more than six years after whats been complained about, or 
if later, more than three years after the complainant (in this case, Ms R) knew, or should 
really have known she had reason to complain. This is set out in Dispute Resolution rule 
2.8.2R and can be found online in the FCAs Handbook. 
Its clear loans 3 to 66 were complained about more than six years after they were taken. 
However, Ive not seen anything to persuade me Ms R was aware or ought to have been 
aware more than three years before she raised this complaint, that she had reason to 
complain. LaH has said that when Ms R experienced repayment problems this shouldve 
caused her to realise she had reason to complain. But I dont think this is enough in this 
particular case to demonstrate that.
I say this because whilst experiencing repayment problems would no doubt have led Ms R to 
realise there was a problem (in terms of the financial difficulty), Im not persuaded this would 
have (or ought to have), in itself, made her aware that these problems were caused by LaH 
doing something wrong when it agreed the loans.
And I havent seen anything else to persuade me that Ms R was or should have been aware 
earlier of cause to complain more than three years before she complained. So, like our adjudicator, I think loans 3 to 66 were raised within the time limits I need to apply 
and that I do have the power to consider them. Ill now go on and consider whether or not I 
think the loans complained about were lent responsibly. 
And as Im sure LaH is aware we do look at each case individually and so outcomes can be 
different in seemingly similar cases. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
LaH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate or reasonable checks to make sure 
Ms R could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that LaH should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The current industry regulator defines sustainable as 
being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Ms Rs complaint in part and I have explained why below.
Ms R didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 3 to 10. And LaH agrees 
loans 67 to 95 should be upheld. Because of this I dont think there is any ongoing 
disagreement about these loans. And, for the avoidance of doubt, given the evidence I have, I dont disagree with what the adjudicator said about loans 3 to 10 and LaHs offer about  
loans 67 to 95. 
So, I wont comment in depth about this lending. I have included the offer LaH made in my 
putting things right section below. And loans 3 to 10 were part of the borrowing relationship 
Ms R had with LaH. So, they are something I will take into account when considering the 
other loans she took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 11 to 66 because I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of LaHs lending 
history with Ms R, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which LaH should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so LaH should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Ms Rs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 11. I say this because:
At this point LaH ought to have realised Ms R was not managing to repay her loans 
without difficulty. From loan 3 Ms R had taken out 9 loans within 12 months. These 
loans were intended to be longer term contracts so this was a significant number. 
And whilst the loan amounts werent always high this points to a continuing and 
frequent need for money.  
So LaH ought to have realised it was more likely than not that Ms Rs indebtedness 
was unsustainable and that she was possibly in financial difficulty.
Loan 3 was for £200 and loan 11 was for the same amount. And as I said earlier, 
Ms R was taking a large number of loans over short timeframes. So, her 
indebtedness at times was high. So, at this point, LaH ought to have known that Ms 
R was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an 
ongoing and sustained need. 
From loan 3 onwards Ms R was provided with a new loan within a very short space of 
time of settling her previous ones. And she often had more than one loan running at 
the same time.  For example, loans 3 to 6 were all ran at the same time. 
Ms R wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed LaH. Loan 95 was 
taken out around 13 years after her first. This is a very long time to be using this type 
of credit, as I think LaH has recognised when it has agreed to pay compensation for 
loans 67 to 95. Ms R has paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
LaH over an extended period.
I think that Ms R lost out because LaH continued to provide borrowing from loan 11 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Rs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the number of loans, and the length of time over which Ms R borrowed, was likely to 
have had negative implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 11 to 95 and LaH should put things right.
  
Putting things rightIn deciding what redress LaH should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms R from loan 11, as Im satisfied it ought to 
have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Ms R may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and this particular lender which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt 
a viable option, she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that, 
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how she would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Ms R in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Ms R would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce LaHs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it 
has done wrong and should put right.
LaH shouldnt have given Ms R loans 11 to 95.
A) LaH should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms R towards interest, fees 
and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where applicable, but 
not including anything it has already refunded.
B) LaH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms R 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms R originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) LaH should pay Ms R the total of A plus B.
D) The overall pattern of Ms Rs borrowing for loans 11 to 95 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Ms Rs credit 
file. If LaH has sold any of the loans LaH should ask the debt purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LaH to deduct tax from this interest. LaH should give 
Ms R a certificate showing how much tax LaH has deducted, if she asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Ms Rs complaint.
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms R to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 February 2022.
