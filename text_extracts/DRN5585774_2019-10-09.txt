K820x#14complaint
Mr S1 and Mr S2 are unhappy  National Westminster Bank  Plc closed down  their current 
account without  giving  them a reason why.
Mr S1 is the person who primarily brought this complaint,  so Ill refer to him throughout the 
majority of the decision.
background
In July 2015, NatWest  say they wrote to Mr S1 and Mr S2 letting them know they intended to 
close the account and gave 60 days notice.
Mr S1 complained to NatWest about the closure of the account.  He was concerned that his 
family believed the reason for the closure was because he had done  something wrong  and 
he wants to know why NatWest closed the account.
Our investigator looked into this complaint. She said she had seen no evidence of NatWest  
doing anything  wrong and so was unable to uphold  the complaint. Mr S1 disagreed. Mr S1 
said he feels hes been mistreated due to his name and doesnt  think  it was fair for NatWest 
to close the account without  giving  a reason. So the case has been  passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive decided not to 
uphold this complaint,  which I know will come as a disappointment to Mr S1 and Mr S2. Ill 
explain why.
I can appreciate Mr S1 and Mr S2s concern and frustration at finding  out NatWest  were 
intending to close  the account,  particularly after banking  with NatWest for a number of years. 
On occasion a bank will decide it no longer wants to do business with a consumer, as 
NatWest did in this case.  NatWest have sent me the terms and conditions  from around the 
time Mr S1 and Mr S2s account was closed  and I can see this says the bank can close  an 
account immediately  in certain  circumstances or for any reason provided it gives  60 days  
notice.
NatWest say due to the passage of time, they havent been able to send me a copy  of the 
exact letter that was sent to Mr S1 and Mr S2 informing  them  of the account  closure.  But 
theyve sent me a copy of a sample letter that wouldve  been  sent and I can see the letter 
explains the 60 days notice.  NatWest have said they sent the closure  letter in July 2015 
and as Mr S1 and Mr S2 havent disputed  being  given 60 days  notice, Im satisfied NatWest 
did give them 60 days  notice before the account  was closed. 
I appreciate Mr S1 and Mr S2 want to know the reason why NatWest  decided to close  the 
account and I understand  Mr S1s concerns about  what his family may think  about the 
account closure. But I have not seen any evidence to suggest  that the account closure was 
Ref: DRN55857742influenced by his name as hes said it was. And overall, I see no reason  to conclude that 
NatWests decision to close  the account  was unreasonable.  
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, I dont uphold Mr S1 and Mr S2 complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S1 and Mr S2 
to accept or reject my decision before 9 November 2019.
