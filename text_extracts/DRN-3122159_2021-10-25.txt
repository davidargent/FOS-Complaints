The complaint
Mr G complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) lent to him irresponsibly. Mr G is represented 
by a claims management firm, but I will refer to Mr G as the complainant.
What happened
Mr G applied for an Aqua credit card from NewDay in June 2014. His limits were increased 
as follows. All were offered by NewDay, except that in April 2016:
Mr G complains that NewDay lent to him irresponsibly. They didnt carry out enough checks 
into his circumstances when they offered the increases in limits. They should therefore 
refund all interest and fees that hes paid and remove adverse entries at credit reference 
agencies.
NewDay said theyd conducted enough checks. When Mr G applied for the card, he said he 
was earning £50,000 a year with unsecured debts of £6,500. He had a mortgage of 
£139,000. At the time of Mr Gs application, and for the increases, NewDay had carried out 
checks and theyd found that Mr G had no external debt problems  there were no defaults 
or CCJs, no arrears and no payday loans in existence. He was meeting all payments when 
due. On the Aqua card, Mr G had made all monthly payments  and they were a lot more 
than the minimum needed. There were a small number of over limit situations, but these 
werent significant. Generally, the balance of the account was well within the limit. And  Mr 
G couldve declined the offers of increases but didnt.
Mr G brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said he felt that the limit increases at, and 
after, September 2016 (to £2,050) shouldnt have been given without more checks being 
made. Monthly payments were only about 8% of the amount outstanding. While all Mr Gs 
other debts were being managed OK, there were significant increases in his other credit card 
debts shown. In March 2017, he took out a second mortgage of £54,905. He said NewDay 
should refund all interest and fees from September 2016, remove any adverse entries from 
Mr Gs credit file and agree an affordable repayment plan for the debt.
NewDay didnt agree and asked for Mr Gs complaint to be looked at by an ombudsman.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
Date Limit
June 2016 £900
November 2014 £450
April 2016 £1300 (requested by Mr G)
September 2016 £2050
March 2017 £3100
February 2018 £5100
August 2018 £6600I take a different view to our investigator.
All lenders have an obligation to lend money responsibly. We must check whether 
NewDay acted in line within the Financial Conducts (FCA) rules on creditworthiness 
assessment as set out in its handbook, (CONC) section 5.2. These say that a firm must 
undertake a reasonable assessment of creditworthiness, considering both the risk to it of 
the customer not making the repayments, as well as the risk to the customer of not being 
able to make repayments. We look at:
Whether the lender completed reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that the borrower would be able to repay any credit in a sustainable way?
If reasonable and proportionate checks were completed, did the lender make a 
fair lending decision made bearing in mind the information gathered and what the 
lender knew about the borrowers circumstances?
And a reasonable and proportionate check would usually need to be more thorough:
othe lower a customers income, and the higher amount to be repaid.
othe greater the number of loans and frequency of loans.
othe longer the term of the loans
Its important to note that the checks must be proportionate to the amount being lent  so 
the higher the amount, the greater the checks must be, and the lower the amount, then 
fewer checks can be made.
So  I must decide whether NewDay fulfilled their responsible lending obligations in the 
light of this guidance. And I think that on balance, they did  based on the data and 
information they could see about Mr G at the time of his application and at each increase 
in limit.
When Mr G applied for the card in 2014, he said he was earning £50,000 a year and had 
other debt of £6,500 and a mortgage of £139,000. Mr G had no other debt problems and 
all payments were being met. There were no defaults or CCJs showing on his records. 
There werent any payday loans. So that looked OK, and the card was agreed with a 
modest, low limit of £900. This was reduced to £450 in November 2014 (its not clear 
why) but then the increases were offered after that time. And  those are the issues that 
Ive looked at.
Ive looked at what NewDay could see about Mr G when they offered the increases. 
And I can see that between when Mr G took the card through to the last increase to 
£6,600 in August 2018, Mr Gs situation looked OK to NewDay  and I think they could 
only make lending decisions based on the information they had.
Looking at how Mr G conducted his NewDay account, he paid on time throughout, without 
a missed payment. There were a small number of over limit situations  three in 2015, and 
one in 2016  but these werent significant in the round. Payments were usually a lot more 
than the minimum needed at £100 a month. And sometimes, a lot more than the minimum 
was paid  for example, £1,000 in January 2017 and £1,765 in June 2016. Payments 
increased to £200 a month (and more) in December 2017 and thereafter  which was OK. 
The balances of Mr Gs account with NewDay were well within the limits  in general, the 
balances were between £1,000 to £1,500 below the limits.
Looking at Mr Gs other debts, - NewDay could see from his external records that he did 
have other debts. But they were OK in my view. His other credit card or unsecured debts 
were only £490 in October 2014 and rose to £3,291 by the time of the last increase in 
August 2018. But  I think these were OK, based on Mr Gs income of £50,000 a year.NewDay could see that he had total other debts of £173,269 in March 2016  which went 
up to £215,891 by August 2018. So  there was an upward trend showing here  as Mr G 
was clearly borrowing more. Mr Gs credit report shows that on March 2017 - he took a 
second mortgage of £54,000  which would reflect in the figure shown here. So  theres 
an argument to say that NewDay might have asked Mr G about this. But equally, Mr Gs 
external records show that he was making all payments to his lenders on time  there 
were no defaults or problems showing up. Neither were there any payday loans being 
taken  usually an indicator of problems. So  if NewDay had asked Mr G some more 
questions, Im not sure they wouldve caused them to decline the increases.
Looking at Mr Gs credit file  he did have a lot of other debts  and these were shown in 
the figures NewDay wouldve seen. But  also the credit file does show that Mr Gs 
problems appeared to get worse after the last increase from NewDay in August 2018. I can 
see from his credit report that he began to miss payments and defaulted with other lenders 
between 2019 and 2020. But  at the time of the increases in limits with NewDay  up to 
August 2018, things looked OK.
And so  I think that NewDay, based on the information they had, did lend responsibly to Mr
G. And so  my provisional decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Responses to the provisional decision:
NewDay agreed. Mr G didnt make any comments.
So  I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Because NewDay agreed, and Mr G didnt make any comments  I wont be departing from 
the provisional decision, and for the reasons I explained in it. So  my final decision is to not 
uphold this complaint.
 My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2021.
