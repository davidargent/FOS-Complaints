The complaint
Mr F complains about the amount that hes been charged by Lex Autolease Limited, trading 
as Black Horse Contract Hire, for damage to a car that was supplied to him under a hire 
agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr F had agreed that he would:  return the car in good condition (fair wear and 
tear excepted) ; and that:  the cost of repairs or replacement where the Vehicle 
is not returned in good condition and complete shall be borne by you - the 
agreement said that good condition means free from interior or exterior damage 
including dents, scratches, damaged paintwork caused by any reason other than fair 
wear and tear - 
the car was collected from Mr F and inspected by a third party on behalf of Black 
Horse in April 2019;
the inspection report identified damage to the cars bonnet, front bumper, left rear 
quarter panel, right front door and right rear quarter panel and recommended 
charges totalling £956 for that damage  it also included photos of the damage;
Mr F was charged for the damage but he complained to Black Horse about the 
charges and it issued a credit for £551 for three items of damage but it said that the 
scratched bonnet and dented left rear quarter panel were present when the car was 
collected and were more than fair wear and tear so the charges of £168 and £237 
were correct;
Mr F complained to this service and to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing 
Association about the charges because he says that its procedures hadnt been 
followed and he hadnt been provided with photos of the damage within 28 days of 
the car being returned;
the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association didnt uphold his complaint and 
nor did our investigator;
the photos in the inspection report clearly show damage to the cars bonnet and left 
rear quarter panel and I consider that the damage is more than would reasonably be 
considered to be fair wear and tear in accordance with the British Vehicle Rental and 
Leasing Association guide on fair wear and tear;
Mr F had signed the inspection report but he says that he wasnt shown pictures of 
the damage  and hes now been provided with them;
although Mr F wasnt provided with those photos until more than 28 days after hed 
returned the car, he was notified about the damage within that period  and I 
consider it to be clear that he didnt return the car in a good condition as required by 
the agreement so I consider that its fair and reasonable for Black Horse to charge 
him for that damage;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the charges are unfair 
or unreasonable or that theyve been charged incorrectly; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Black Horse to reduce or waive the charges for the damage to the cars bonnet and 
left rear quarter panel  or to take any other action in response to Mr Fs complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 October 2020.
