The complaint
Mrs S complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA closed her account without 
explanation, and withheld her account balance for about six months.
What happened
Mrs S had a personal account with PayPal, which she changed to a business account in 
March 2020. She used the account to receive payments in connection with her business, 
which was selling hygiene products online. But at the end of March, PayPal restricted her 
account, and later told her that it was restricting her account permanently. It said this was 
because she had violated PayPals acceptable use policy, but did not elaborate further. It 
said it would hold her account balance for 180 days, and then return it to her.
Mrs S denied having violated any of PayPals policies. She said that PayPals decision to 
hold her account balance caused her great financial hardship, because most of her money 
was in this account  about £27,400. She needed this money to pay her staff their wages, 
and also to pay her mortgage. She had to resort to borrowing money from relatives. She did 
not get access to her money until nearly the end of September, six months later.
Mrs S complained to our service. She says this was all very stressful for her, and it had 
taken a toll on her husbands mental health. She said that PayPal had caused her business 
to lose out on the opportunity to make thousands of pounds in profits, based on her sales 
figures before the account had been restricted.
PayPal was given time to investigate her complaint first, and then when Mrs S was not 
satisfied with the outcome, one of our investigators looked into the matter. He said he could 
only consider the impact on Mrs S, not on her husband, since her husband had not been a 
customer of PayPal.
PayPal gave its reasons for restricting the account. It said Mrs S had been price gouging, 
taking advantage of the covid-19 pandemic to sell her wares at inflated prices (which she 
denies). It also said that a number of her customers had raised disputes (either with PayPal 
directly, or via eBay), and so PayPal had decided that she had exceeded its risk appetite. Its 
terms and conditions said it could hold frozen funds for more than 180 days.
Mrs S said that most of these disputes had been resolved in her favour, and that the only 
real problem had been some deliveries being delayed in the post. She said she had 
refunded those customers, or sent them replacement products for free (and that some 
customers had ended up with both their money back and with the original product when it 
was delivered late).
Our investigator upheld this complaint. He said there was nothing about price gouging in 
PayPals acceptable use policy or its other terms of use, and that the total number of 
complaints was only about two percent of total sales  56 out of 2,750 transactions. He did 
not think that was unreasonable or disproportionate. Since many refunds had been made, he 
was satisfied that Mrs S had been resolving these disputes in good faith. He accepted that 
due to the amount of money PayPal had frozen, there would have been a significant impact 
on Mrs Ss daily living and on her ability to pay bills. He recommended that PayPal pay her 
£200 for her inconvenience, and also interest on the frozen account balance at the rate of 
eight per cent a year, for the period during which Mrs S had not had access to it. (That 
interest comes to about £1,100.)
Neither party accepted that recommendation. Mrs S said that the proposed compensation 
was not enough for everything she had been through. As well as the lost business, she had 
had to take out loans to cover her outgoings, and £200 would only cover one years interest. 
PayPal argued that the complaint should not be upheld at all, since it had acted in 
accordance with its policy. It provided evidence of 82 purchases which had been refunded.  
Both parties asked for an ombudsmans decision.
I wrote a provisional decision which read as follows.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Introduction
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am currently minded to uphold this complaint, and to increase the total compensation to 
£2,000. I will explain why.
PayPals user agreement makes it clear that it is not liable for any loss of profits. I dont think 
that is an unreasonable term. So although Mrs S has asked to be compensated for the 
money she would have made if her business had not been disrupted, I dont think it would be 
fair of me to require PayPal to pay her for that. I will confine the redress to compensation for 
her distress and inconvenience.
PayPal not explaining to Mrs S its reason for limiting the account
The user agreement says, in the section entitled Closing Your PayPal Account:
Where we decide to close your account we will provide you with notice of account 
closure and where practicable, the reasons for closing your account, together with the 
ability to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.1
When PayPal told Mrs S that it was permanently limiting her account, the only reason it gave 
her was that she had violated its acceptable use policy in some way. It did not specify what 
she had done, even when she asked. There is nothing in that policy about price gouging, nor 
is that in the user agreement either. That explanation (which was given to our investigator) 
seems to be retrospective reasoning. The other reason PayPal gave the investigator, about 
the customer disputes and refunds, is not covered by the acceptable use policy either, 
although it can be found in the user agreement. So I dont think PayPal complied with the 
clause about providing reasons for its decision.
There is however another clause elsewhere in the user agreement, which says that a 
decision to limit an account may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our 
management of risk and the protection of PayPal. So I have considered whether this clause 
absolved PayPal of its duty to give Mrs S the reason for its decision.
1 https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full#closing-accountI can see why PayPal would not wish to disclose the threshold at which it decides that a 
customers transaction history represents an unacceptable level of risk. But I dont see why it 
could not have told Mrs S in very broad terms that the reason it was limiting her account was 
because too many customer had raised disputes. So I think PayPal should have done more 
to comply with its giving reasons clause. Refusing to tell her what she had done wrong must 
have increased the emotional impact on Mrs S, since it made her feel that she was being 
kept in the dark and treated unfairly, and this was not necessary. Also, the allegation that 
she had breached the acceptable use policy appears to me to have been misleading.
However, if PayPal had told Mrs S it was because of the disputes, I dont think that 
information would have helped her to challenge the decision, because PayPal is entitled to 
decide for itself what level of risk it is prepared to accept. In this instance, it is for PayPal to 
decide if 56 disputes, or 82 refunds, out of 2,750 transactions, is too much, and I dont think 
it is for me to interfere with that decision by substituting my own view, provided that PayPal 
reached that decision in good faith.
Holding the entire account balance for six months
For the above reasons, I have decided to increase the compensation a little. But my main 
reason for increasing the compensation is not for the decision to limit the account, or how 
that decision was communicated to Mrs S, but because PayPal retained the entire account 
balance for so long. I dont think that was fair or proportionate, nor do I think that it was done 
in accordance with the user agreement.
PayPals user agreement does give PayPal the right to hold on to its customers money in 
certain circumstances. These are explained in the section entitled Restricted Activities and 
Holds. There is a long list of restricted activities (this is separate from the acceptable use 
policy). One of these is conducting business in a way that results in complaints, which has 
undoubtedly occurred in this case. There is not a minimum number of complaints set out in 
the rules, and although I dont think it necessarily follows that a single complaint would 
qualify, 56 complaints (even though that is only two percent of the total number of 
purchases) might reasonably qualify, given how broadly this clause has been drafted.
The user agreement then goes on to say that, in those circumstances, PayPal may:
Hold your money to the extent and for so long as reasonably needed to protect 
against the risk of liability (meaning PayPals liability), and
Block your PayPal account and/or hold any funds in the reserve account (including, 
without limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by PayPal, where PayPal's 
rights arise from your engagement in the restricted activity).
There are other clauses which elaborate on the purpose behind the first of those two 
clauses. One of them says:
PayPal's risk of liability in respect of card-funded payments that you receive can last 
until the risk of a chargeback closing in favour of the payer/buyer (as determined by 
card scheme rules) has passed.
So the point of holding a customers money is to protect PayPal against the risk that third 
parties may raise a complaint, a chargeback, or a claim against PayPal, arising from a 
transaction they had with a PayPal customer.
However, looking at the first clause, I cannot accept that PayPal reasonably needed to hold 
the entire account balance for six months. Only two percent of purchases had resulted in 
complaints, and only less than three percent of all purchases had been refunded. Even if PayPal expected more complaints to be made later, there do not seem to have been any 
reasonable grounds for thinking that this would extend to all of the purchases, or even to as 
many as half of them. But if PayPal was concerned about the risk of many further complaints 
being made, or the risk of chargebacks being raised, then it could have kept this under 
review, and released portions of the funds at intervals as the risk diminished over time. It 
seems to me to have been completely unnecessary to have retained the full balance for six 
months, without any review of whether this was reasonably needed.
I dont think the second of the two clauses quoted together above overrides the first one. 
I think they should be read together. So although that second clause says PayPal can hold 
onto funds for longer than 180 days, that still does not mean that PayPal can do so to a 
greater extent, or for longer, than it reasonably needs to, to protect itself.
I have also had regard to the FCAs sixth principle of business, A firm must pay due regard 
to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly. Just because PayPal is able to hold on 
to a customers money as a precaution, does not mean that it can or should do so 
indiscriminately as to either the amount of money held, or the duration of the hold.
For these reasons, I dont think that the way in which PayPal held onto Mrs Ss funds was 
fair, or in accordance with the terms governing the exercise of the power. It undoubtedly 
caused Mrs S great inconvenience, and I think this must have been apparent to PayPal at 
the time.
I think that £2,000 would better reflect the emotional impact on Mrs S.
Responses to my provisional decision
Neither party replied to my provisional findings, so there is no reason for me to depart from 
them and I confirm them here.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. I order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay 
Mrs S £2,000.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 September 2021.
