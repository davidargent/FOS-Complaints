The complaint
Mrs F says Morses Club PLC lent to her irresponsibly. She says that Morses didnt perform 
adequate checks before it granted her lending. And so, it wasnt appropriate to lend to her. 
What happened
This complaint is about 12 home collected loan Morses provided to Mrs F between 
September 2015 and April 2017.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She didnt think that Morses was wrong to 
have provided loans 1 to 6. But she thought that the pattern of lending itself was harmful by 
loan 7 and so it shouldnt have approved loans 7 to 12. 
Morses agreed with what the adjudicator said. It calculated compensation in line with the 
adjudicators recommendation. This was to refund the interest paid on these loans, plus 
interest for late payment at the rate of 8% simple. It removed any unpaid interest and 
charges from the final loan. It deducted from this any capital amount that Mrs F still owed to 
Morses. 
Mrs Fs representative disagreed with this method of compensation. It said that Mrs F was in 
an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) in respect of this debt and so any reduction in the 
amount she owed should benefit all of her creditors not just Morses. As no agreement has 
been reached the complaint has been passed to me.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate checks to make 
sure Mrs F could repay her loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there may come a 
point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that the 
lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
Neither Mrs F, nor her representative, disagreed with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 
to 6. Because of this I dont think there is any ongoing dispute about these loans. So, I wont 
comment further on this lending saving to say I agree with the outcome the adjudicator 
reached and for the same reasons. 
And they were part of the borrowing relationship Mrs F had with Morses. So, they are 
something I will take into account when considering the other loans she took.
Ive also considered the pattern of lending up to loan 7 and I think the lending history and 
pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that further lending would likely to be 
unsustainable. So, I think Morses was irresponsible to continue lending after this point. 
Again, there is now no disagreement that Morses was wrong to approve loans 7 to 12. So, I 
wont comment further on this part of Mrs Fs complaint. 
Ive considered the points Mrs Fs representative made in response to the adjudicators view. 
It says that the compensation should be altered to reflect Mrs Fs IVA terms. We were able 
to confirm that Mrs F is in an IVA. Our adjudicator asked for more detail about this, but Mrs 
Fs representative didnt supply this. So, we dont have copies of the IVA agreement or 
contact details for the IVA practitioner. 
But in any event the IVA is between Mrs F, her IVA practitioner and her creditors. Its not an 
agreement Im party to or bound by. I dont think it reasonable, or practical here, for me to 
alter the compensation to account for Mrs Fs wider circumstances. I think the compensation 
that the adjudicator recommended fairly compensates Mrs F for Morses mis-selling loans. 
It is likely that Mrs F is bound by the terms of the IVA and any compensation should be paid 
to the IVA practitioner. Mrs F should liaise with her IVA practitioner to determine how the 
compensation affects her outstanding other debts and her IVA agreement.
So, the points raised by Mrs F, and her representative, havent changed my decision and Im 
upholding this complaint and awarding compensation on the same basis that the adjudicator 
did.
  
Putting things right
Morses shouldnt have given Mrs F loans 7 to 12.
If Morses has sold the outstanding debts Morses should buy these back if it is able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If Morses is not able to buy the debts back then Morses 
should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.A) Morses should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs F towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything 
it has already refunded.
B) Morses should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs F 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs F originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Morses should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mrs F as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mrs F having made 
overpayments then Morses should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Morses should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus 
then the surplus should be paid to Mrs F.
E) The overall pattern of Mrs Fs borrowing for loans 7 to 12 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Mrs Fs credit file. 
Morses does not have to remove any outstanding loans from Mrs Fs credit file until these 
have been repaid, but Morses should still remove any adverse information recorded about 
these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to deduct tax from this interest. Morses should 
give Mrs F a certificate showing how much tax Morses has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mrs Fs complaint.
Morses Club PLC should put things right by doing what Ive said above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 October 2021.
