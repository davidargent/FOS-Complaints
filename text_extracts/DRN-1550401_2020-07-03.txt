The complaint 
Mr and Mrs Hs complaint is about Landmark Mortgages Limited and its actions in continuing 
to take two mortgage payments despite the mortgage having been redeemed. A complaint 
was raised after the first payment was taken but the second was taken as well. Landmark 
refunded the money and offered a total of £150 compensation but Mr and Mrs H feel this 
isn't enough compensation.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Theres no dispute that Landmark made a mistake, but my role isnt to punish
businesses for making mistakes; its to put the consumer back into the position that
they shouldve been in if the mistake hadnt been made.
Theres no financial loss as the money was refunded and Mr and Mrs H havent
mentioned that they suffered any additional loss.
Money never truly compensates for trouble and upset. Such compensation is based
on the trouble and upset Mr and Mrs H show theyd suffered or is likely that they
suffered. Ive no doubt they were inconvenienced and irritated by Landmarks
mistakes, compounded by the fact that the mistake was repeated after they first
complained. But I think £150 compensation is fair and reasonable in all the
circumstances.
For these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about Landmark Mortgages Limited. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision before 31 July 2020.
