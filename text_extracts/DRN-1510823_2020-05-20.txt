Miss N says that adequate affordability checks werent carried out before the loans were 
provided. 
Oakam said that Miss N raised her complaint more than six years after the first 11 loans 
were provided and so these fell outside of our jurisdiction. It said before the following loans 
were provided it carried out proportionate credit and affordability checks. It said that on the 
final two loans its affordability checks were carried out but werent processed in line with its 
standards and so it upheld Miss Ns complaint in regard to these two loans. Our adjudicator upheld this complaint in regard to loans four to 18. They explained why they 
thought all the loans fell within our jurisdiction and provided an opportunity to Oakam to 
respond. 
Oakam didn't provide further evidence in regard to the issue of jurisdiction. It said that the 
loans were provided in line with the rules in place at the time and that they were not all high 
cost credit intended for short term use as the majority had a term of at least 12 months. It 
further questioned what evidence showed loans four to 18 were unsustainable or caused 
Miss N harm.
As a resolution hasnt been agreed, this complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, 
to provide a decision on its merits.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We've set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Oakam needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Miss N could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumer's income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Oakam should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Oakam was required to establish 
whether Miss N could sustainably repay her loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further.The majority of the loans in this case were provided before CONC. At that time the relevant 
guidance was provided by the Office of Fair trading (OFT) and this also set out the need to 
make a reasonable assessment of whether a borrower can afford to meet repayments in a 
sustainable manner. This refers to issues such as being able to the make the repayments 
without undue difficulties throughout the life of the agreement and without having to realise 
security or assets. It then further sets out that without undue difficulty means without having 
to borrow further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ns complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold loans one to three and as neither party has disputed this I have 
not considered these loans further. I have however taken them into account when 
considering Miss Ns overall pattern of borrowing.
The loans were taken out over an extended period and there were no significant gaps in 
Miss N's borrowing therefore I have considered the loans as being part of one lending chain.
I note the comments Oakam has provided in regard to the affordability of the loans and the 
information it gathered in regard to bank statements and credit reports. However I also note 
that the bank statements showed Miss N was using other short term loan providers at the 
time and also that her credit report contained a number of entires that should have raised 
concern. 
I have also considered the overall pattern of Oakams lending history with Miss N, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Oakam should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Oakam should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ns case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan four because of the following reasons.
At this point Miss N had taken out four loans in 22 months and had been in debt with 
Oakam for the majority of this time. I think it reasonable that Oakam ought to have 
realised Miss N was not managing to repay her loans sustainably.
 
Miss N was rolling existing loans into new loans suggesting that she was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances.
 
Miss N recorded the reasons for her first loan as shopping and then the next loans 
were recorded as being needed as emergency funds. Given the period over which 
the loans were taken out I think this suggests the loans were not being used as 
emergency funds but instead had become part of the funds Miss N relied on. She 
continued to take out loans often with the reason being shopping further suggesting 
her reliance on these loans.
 
The amounts Miss N was borrowing were not reducing further suggesting that she 
was becoming reliant of this level of debt and that she wasn't able to make inroads 
into this.
 
I note the comments about the length of the loans. However the first few loans were for 12 
months or less and it is at this time that I think a pattern of borrowing had emerged which 
suggested lending to Miss N was unsustainable.Oakam continued to lend to Miss N and the amounts lent increased. While I note the terms 
of the loans also increased, I find that Miss N was taking on new debt at the time of repaying 
existing debt and her pattern continued to showed reliance on the loans.
I think that Miss N lost out because Oakam continued to provide borrowing from loan four 
onwards. These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ns indebtedness by 
allowing her to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
Because of the points made above, I'm upholding the complaint about loans four onwards.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Miss N paid on loans four to 18 and pay interest of 8% 
simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date they were paid to 
the date of settlement*;
 
in the event that loan 18 is still outstanding, all interest and charges should be waived 
on this loan and any payments made treated as payments towards the capital 
amount. If this results in overpayments then these should be refunded along with 8% 
simple a year from the date they would have arisen to the date of settlement*. If a 
capital balance remains on this loan then the refund above can be used to offset this.
 
the overall pattern of loans taken from loan four means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans four to 18 should be removed from 
Miss Ns credit file.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Oakam to take off tax from this interest. Oakam 
must give Miss N a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Ns complaint. Oakam Ltd should 
put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss N to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 June 2020.
