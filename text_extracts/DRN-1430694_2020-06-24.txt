The first loan was a running credit facility (RCF). This is different to the instalment loans 
Mrs H took afterwards.The RCF allowed a consumer to either request funds up to their agreed credit limit in one go 
or take multiple drawdowns up to their limit. It appears Mrs H had a credit limit of £150. 
Mrs H made a total of seven drawdowns on the facility.
Mrs H repaid the RCF on 19 December 2014, following which she took out a further thirteen 
instalment loans.
Mrs H says Sunny couldn't have thoroughly checked her credit history as her credit file 
clearly showed difficulties at that time. She told us she felt that Sunny constantly bombarded 
her with marketing materials and allowed her to borrow again and again which should have 
flagged that she wasn't using the loans as a short-term solution and had become trapped 
into borrowing in order to repay earlier loans.
Sunny said it had carried out creditworthiness and affordability checks before lending to 
Mrs H. It did not accept the credit provided was unaffordable.
Our adjudicator said she hadn't seen enough to say it was unfair for Sunny to provide Mrs H 
with Loans 1- 5. But she didn't think Loans 6-14 should have been given. 
Sunny disagreed with this view  it said, amongst other things, that there was no evidence of 
any financial difficulties as Mrs H had never been in arrears - the loans were repaid on time 
or earlier than scheduled. But it offered to refund £47.84 for Loan 14. This time Mrs H 
disagreed. As the parties havent reached any agreement, the complaint has been passed to 
me to make a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs H could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
 
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs H could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Hs complaint. Having done so, Ive decided to agree 
with our adjudicator and uphold this complaint from Loan 6 onwards. I will explain why.
Looking first of all at the RCF, Ive decided not to uphold this facility.
To be clear, Mrs Hs RCF wasn't a payday loan where she had to repay all of what she 
borrowed plus the interest due when she next got paid. She was given an RCF where there 
was an expectation that shed repay what she borrowed plus the interest due within a period 
of five months. So overall, I think that this means the checks Sunny carried out had to 
provide enough information for it to be able to understand whether Mrs H would likely be 
able to service and then repay this facility within a reasonable period of time and within the 
five months as set out in the agreement.
From 1 April 2014, the earlier guidance for this type of lending from the Office of Fair Trading 
(OFT) was re-worked and there was an expectation when Mrs H took out her facility that 
Sunny would review and monitor how Mrs H was using the RCF facility. CONC 6.7.2 says; 
A firm must monitor a customers repayment record and take appropriate action where there 
are signs of actual or possible repayment difficulties. 
So at the point in which Mrs H borrowed her RCF, it wasn't enough for Sunny to just assess 
the further lending based on what it knew when the RCF had initially been approved in 
August 2014. It also needed to monitor how Mrs H was using the facility - and then step in 
and provide help when or if it could see Mrs H was or was likely having financial difficulties.
Before granting the RCF Sunny asked Mrs H about her monthly income, and it also 
completed a credit check. Mrs H declared a monthly income of £1,905. Given this was the 
start of the lending relationship I dont think it was unreasonable for Sunny to have relied on 
the income information it was provided with. So, I dont think at this point it wouldve been 
proportionate of Sunny to have verified what Mrs H was saying about her income. 
As our adjudicator explained at the time Mrs H took out her RCF her account ran for a period 
of four months. In that time, I can see she made seven drawdowns and on three occasions 
she borrowed up to her credit limit of £150 but repaid the balance within one month each 
time. The account was fully repaid within the five months it was given for.Looking at the way Mrs H was using her RCF I dont think this would have alerted Sunny to 
the fact that Mrs H was likely having problems managing her money at this point. I think it 
was likely she was making use of and repaying the facility as it was intended and in line with 
the terms of the RCF. So Im not upholding Mrs Hs complaint about the RCF. 
Ive next looked at the loans Mrs H took out following her repayment of the RCF. 
I think the checks Sunny did before agreeing to provide Mrs H with the instalment Loans 2-5 
were proportionate. The amounts that Mrs H needed to repay would have seemed to be 
affordable compared with the disposable income shed declared. Taking account of the 
repayment amounts for these loans, Mrs Hs circumstances and thinking about the fact that 
this was in the early stages of her relationship with Sunny, I dont think Sunny needed to ask 
for further information from Mrs H before agreeing to lend.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldn't have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Hs case, I think that this point was reached by 
Loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs H was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Mrs H had taken around twelve advances of credit (including the 
drawdowns from the flex credit) with either short gaps or no gaps in the lending 
relationship. By Loan 6 there had been an overall lending relationship for around 
twelve months. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs H 
was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances and that Mrs Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mrs Hs first instalment loan was for £150 and Loan 6 was also for £150.  At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that Mrs H was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
 
From Loan 6 onwards Mrs H was provided with a new loan before settling her 
previous loan. She often had multiple loans outstanding at the same time she took 
out a new loan. For example, Loan 7 overlapped with Loan 6 and Mrs H took out 
Loan 8 whilst she was still repaying Loan 7. 
 
Mrs H wasn't making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 14 was 
taken out around two years after the RCF. And the amount hadn't reduced. Mrs H 
had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Mrs H lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
 these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Hs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs H borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mrs Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding the complaint about Loans 6-14 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
 
refund all interest and charges Mrs H paid on Loans 6-14;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 
the number of loans taken from Loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about Loans 6 - 14 should be removed from 
Mrs Hs credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mrs Hs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
