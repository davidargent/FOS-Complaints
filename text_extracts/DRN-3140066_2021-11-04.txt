The complaint
Mrs O complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) didnt refund her for a flight.
What happened
Mrs O bought some flight tickets in early 2020, for travel in the middle of 2020. But Mrs O 
couldnt travel because of the Covid pandemic.
Mrs O raised a buyer protection claim with PayPal, but PayPal declined to refund the 
transaction. Mrs O went to her card provider and raised a chargeback, and this was 
successful, she received a full refund for her flights.
Mrs O felt PayPal should have refunded the cost of the tickets as the rules around travel 
were very clear, she couldnt travel. Mrs O also said the Competition and Markets Authority 
(CMA) has said certain flight companies  including the one Mrs O booked with  werent 
refunding customers when it thought they should have.
Mrs O brought her complaint to this service and an investigator looked into things and felt 
the complaint should be upheld. The investigator felt PayPal should have refunded Mrs O 
when she raised her claim. Because Mrs O had already received a refund, the investigator 
thought a payment of Â£50 would be fair to compensate Mrs O for the trouble and upset of 
having to approach her own bank.
Mrs O accepted this assessment, but PayPal didnt. PayPal said it was right to decline the 
buyer protection claim as the flights had gone ahead. PayPal also said when the flights were 
booked there were no restrictions on travel, so PayPal did nothing wrong in allowing the 
payment to go through at the time.
On 15 September 2021 I issued a provisional decision. In it, I said:
PayPal facilitated Mrs Os purchase, but PayPal doesnt guarantee the flights or guarantee 
Mrs O will catch those flights. PayPal offers a buyer protection scheme which may be able to 
provide a refund in certain circumstances.
But buyer protection doesnt entitle Mrs O to a refund. And buyer protection doesnt cover 
every eventuality that may arise from a purchase.
The two options for buyer protection are item not received or significantly not as described. 
PayPal raised an item not received claim as Mrs O said she didnt receive the flight, she 
wasnt able to take it. I think this was the right reason to raise the claim under.
PayPals terms say if the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, 
PayPal may find in favour of the seller for an item not received claim even if you claim you 
did not receive the goods.
PayPal contacted the flight company as part of the claim. The flight company explained the 
flight had taken place, so it had delivered the goods. Because the goods had been delivered, 
PayPal declined Mrs Os buyer protection claim, and I think this was a fair decision.
Mrs O says she was unable to take the flight because of government rules and guidance 
about travel. I understand the reasons why Mrs O couldnt travel, but this doesnt change the 
fact the flights took place. And it doesnt change the terms of PayPals buyer protection.
Ive read the CMA case Mrs O has sent links to, and its clear the CMA believes certain 
airlines should be refunding people that were legally unable to fly. I think its likely Mrs O is 
one of those people affected by this lack of refund.
But I cant see anything that says Mrs O is entitled to a refund from the financial business 
she paid for the flights through. Mrs O probably has statutory rights with the flight company 
itself. This is, I believe, what the CMA is referencing  Mrs O could be entitled to a refund 
from the flight company direct.
I dont believe the CMA action is relevant to Mrs Os dispute with PayPal.
Mrs Os chargeback claim was successful, and Im glad Mrs O was able to get a refund for 
her flights. But a successful chargeback doesnt mean PayPals buyer protection should 
have been successful.
Chargeback has very different rules and more reasons for requesting a refund. PayPals 
buyer protection acknowledges this and says if the buyer protection fails consumers should 
dispute things with their card issuer.
I think PayPal was fair when it declined Mrs Os buyer protection claim. And because I dont 
think PayPal has done anything wrong, I cant fairly ask it to pay any compensation.
I asked Mrs O and PayPal to respond by 10 October 2021, but neither responded.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Mrs O nor PayPal offered any further evidence, my findings on this complaint 
havent changed. It follows that I dont uphold Mrs Os complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs O to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2021.
