The complaint
Mr T complains that a training course that he paid for using a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Carnegie Consumer Finance Limited was mis-sold to him. Hes being helped with his 
complaint by a representative.
What happened
Mr T entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Carnegie Consumer Finance that he 
signed in December 2018 to pay for a welding course. The price of the course was £7,800 
and he made an advance payment of £60 so the amount of the loan was £7,740 which he 
agreed to repay by 43 monthly payments of £180. The loan was interest free. 
Mr T complained to Carnegie Consumer Finance in December 2019 that the course had 
been mis-sold to him. It responded in detail and said that: Mr T hadnt completed the parts of 
the course that he had to complete before he started the practical training; he had contacted 
the course provider but hadnt raised the majority of his concerns with it; and the course 
remained available to him. It said that it had found no evidence to indicate that any 
misrepresentation or breach of contract had occurred and that there was no reason to cancel 
the remaining balance of Mr Ts loan agreement. 
Mr T wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. His letter of complaint 
referred specifically to three areas: information provision (and he said that course providers 
need to provide up front, clear, intelligible, unambiguous and timely information); terms and 
conditions (and he said that the course provider's terms and conditions that apply to 
students need to be fair and balanced); and complaint handling processes and practices 
(and he said that course providers need to ensure their complaint handling processes and 
practices are accessible, clear and fair to students). 
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He considered each 
of the three areas about which Mr T had complained. He was satisfied that the course 
provider had delivered what it said it would and he thought that Carnegie Consumer Finance 
had acted reasonably in respect of any responsibility it might face under the provisions of 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Mr Ts representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. He has provided an extremely detailed 25 page response to our investigators 
recommendations in which he sets out the reasons that he considers that the course was 
misrepresented to Mr T. He says in his summary that: he and Mr T disagree with our 
investigators conclusions; misrepresentation did occur in the sale of the course as there was 
no City and Guilds accreditation for the course; the service given to Mr T was absent, both 
from the course provider and from Carnegie Consumer Finance as he couldnt access the 
service; and thats a breach of contract in contravention of section 75.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
Mr T used credit in the form of a loan from Carnegie Consumer Finance to pay for 
the course and, in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right 
to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ts complaint about Carnegie Consumer Finance, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the course 
provider and that Carnegie Consumer Finances response to his claim under 
section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ts 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances but in complaints such as this one, where the 
evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I have to make my decision on 
the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have 
happened in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances;
I have read and considered Mr Ts representatives detailed response to our 
investigators recommendations, as well the other evidence and arguments, but I 
wont be responding to all of the information that Mr Ts representative has provided 
and will focus on what I consider to be relevant for me to decide whether Carnegie 
Consumer Finances response to Mr Ts complaint has been fair and reasonable;
Mr T signed a registration form for a welding skills course with the course provider in 
December 2019 in which he confirmed that hed been left with a complete course kit 
for appraisal, which included the study guide and plan of the course and that he 
understood how the open learning nature of the self-study program works; 
he also signed the fixed sum loan agreement, an affordability assessment and a 
credit application;
Carnegie Consumer Finance says that Mr T started the course but didnt complete 
the introductory modules that he was required to complete before he could start the 
practical training so he was unable to start the practical training;
it also says that the course provider had confirmed that it was a requirement for Mr T 
to be registered with City and Guilds on the day he commenced his practical training 
 but as he hadnt completed the introductory modules he hadnt become eligible to 
start the practical training and there was no need for him to be registered with City 
and Guilds;
Mr Ts representative says that the course was represented to Mr T as being 
accredited by City and Guilds but it wasnt accredited by them so the course was 
misrepresented to Mr T and hes provided information from his investigations about 
City and Guilds accreditation of the course;
Mr Ts complaint to Carnegie Consumer Finance, and his complaint letter to this 
service, didnt claim that the course had been misrepresented to Mr T because of the 
lack of City and Guilds accreditation and I dont consider that it would now be fair or 
reasonable for me to make any finding as to whether or not the course provider 
mispresented its City and Guilds accreditation to Mr T;
I consider that Mr T was provided with enough information about the course before 
he registered for the course, he confirmed that hed been left with a complete course 
kit for appraisal, which included the study guide and plan of the course and he had 
enough information to be able to start the course and then to contact the course 
provider;Mr T signed the registration form which said, immediately above his signature: I 
confirm the conditions overleaf form part of this agreement. I have read them and 
agree to be bound by their terms;
Im not persuaded that hes provided enough evidence to show that the terms and 
conditions arent fair or balanced, he agreed to be bound by the course providers 
conditions and, if he didnt agree with them, I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect him not to have signed the registration form;
Mr T and his representative clearly feel that the course provider didnt take Mr Ts 
complaints about the course seriously and didnt properly consider them  I can 
appreciate that that will have been frustrating for Mr T but I dont consider that to 
have been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the course provider and 
Carnegie Consumer Finance can only be liable under section 75 for a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the course provider;
Mr T and his representative clearly feel very strongly that the course was 
misrepresented to Mr T and that theres been a breach of contract by the course 
provider, but I consider that the course was adequately described to Mr T and was 
made available to him and he didnt complete the introductory modules that he had to 
complete before he could progress to the practical training;
the course provider said that the course remained available to Mr T but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that he has done any further work on the course;
I sympathise with Mr T for the issues that hes had with the course but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the course provider in these circumstances and I 
consider that Carnegie Consumer Finances response to his claim under section 75 
was fair and reasonable; and
I understand that Mr Ts account with Carnegie Consumer Finance has been settled 
but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require it to refund to him any 
of the money that hes paid for the course, to pay him any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2021.
