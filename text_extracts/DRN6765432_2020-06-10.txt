K821x#15Complaint
Mr S complains Elevate  Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him 
irresponsibly.
Background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  21 April 2020. 
An extract  from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will not repeat that 
information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to partly uphold the complaint. I invited 
both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. However, neither Mr Ss 
representatives nor Sunny responded to the provisional decision. 
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both Mr S and Sunny didnt respond to the provisional decision with any further 
comments or evidence they wanted me to consider. I see no reason to depart from the 
findings that I outlined in my provisional decision. 
So, in summary,  I still think Sunny made  an error when it provided loans 8  26 to Mr S. Ive 
explained below what Sunny needs  to do to put things right. 
Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:  
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 8 to 25; 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
for loan 26 Sunny  should rework the loan and apply  all payments made  by Mr S as if 
they had gone towards  the principal  sum borrowed. If and when  Mr S has paid more 
then the amount borrowed, then any surplus should  be paid to Mr S with 8% simple*  
interest from the date the over payment became due to the date of settlement. 
If after this Mr S still has an outstanding  balance, Sunny,  if it wishes  can use the 
refund due from loans  8  25 to offset any principal that was written off.
 
remove loans 8 to 26 from Mr Ss credit file entirely, this is because  the period of time 
Mr S owed  Sunny money means that any information still recorded about these loans 
is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax it has taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN67654322My final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I partly uphold Mr Ss 
complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr S as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 July 2020.

Complaint
Mr S complains Elevate  Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent to him irresponsibly.
Background
Mr S took one running credit account and then 25 instalment loans. Ive included some  of the 
information weve received from Sunny about these loans  in the appendix at the end of this decision.
Loan 1 was a running credit  facility (RCF) and this is different to the instalment loans  that Mr S took 
afterwards. 
The RCF allowed a consumer  to either request funds up to their agreed credit  limit in one go or to 
take multiple drawdowns up to their limit. Mr S had a credit limit of £150.  Each drawdown could be 
repaid via five monthly instalments. 
Our adjudicator didnt think it was wrong of Sunny to have granted  the RCF or the first three 
instalment loans. But he thought the remaining  instalment  loans (loans  5 to 26) shouldnt  have been 
given.   
It appears Mr S accepted our adjudicators assessment. Sunny hasnt agreed. But, it has accepted 
that something may have gone wrong when it provided loans 11 to 26, so it agreed to refund interest 
on these loans together with 8% simple interest. It also agreed  to update  Mr Ss credit file. 
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  And 
while Im still intending to partly uphold Mr Ss complaint, I dont think as many loans should be upheld 
and Ive explained  why below. 
Mr S doesnt  appear  to disagree  with our adjudicators findings that Sunny wasnt wrong  to grant the 
RCF or for Sunny to lend loans  2 to 4. It seems  therefore this lending is no longer in dispute.  So I 
havent made  a finding about these loans but I have kept them and so I no longer think  that I need to 
make a finding about it. 
Ive also not considered whether Sunny  should have lent loans 11 to 26 as it has already agreed it 
shouldnt. But for clarity Ive set out how I think  Sunny should amend Mr Ss credit file for these  loans.  
So instead,  this decision will focus  on whether  Sunny did anything wrong when it granted loans 5 to 
10. These being the instalment loans  lent between 30 May 2015 and 26 August 2015. But I have kept 
the other lending in mind when thinking about  the overall  lending relationship between Sunny  and Mr 
S. 
For the lending that remains in dispute, Sunny had to check if Mr S could afford  to pay back  the 
amounts hed borrowed  without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was proportionate 
to the circumstances.  Sunnys checks could have taken into account  a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments  and Mr Ss income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, I think  in the early stages of a lending  relationship,  less thorough checks  might have 
been proportionate.
Ref: DRN67654324But certain factors might  suggest Sunny should have done  more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for Mr S. These factors include:
Mr S having  a low income (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid  being especially  high (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to 
meet a higher repayment  from a particular level of income); 
Mr S having  a large number of loans and/or having these  loans over a long period of time 
(reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or 
was becoming,  unsustainable);
Mr S coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also suggestive  
of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable  for Mr S.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his instalment loans   not just 
whether he technically had enough money to make his repayments. Having enough money  to make 
the repayments could of course  be an indicator  that Mr S was able to repay his loans sustainably. But 
it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case. The Financial Conduct Authoritys (the industry  
regulatory) says in the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) states payments are sustainable if 
they are made without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time,  while meeting  other 
reasonable commitments and without  having  to borrow to make them. If a lender  realises, or ought  
reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context,  and thought 
about what this means for Mr Ss complaint.
Our adjudicator thought that Sunny shouldnt  have lent from loan 5 because  such  lending wouldnt 
have been sustainable. However, I dont  agree  and Ive explained  why below.  
I can see that Mr S had drawdown four times under the RCF.  He initially took £100 before drawing 
down a further  £73.08 the following month, taking his balance to the credit limit. He then repaid the 
outstanding balance before  borrowing a further £150 on 31 October 2014.  The outstanding  balance 
was then repaid in full on 25 November 2014. The fourth drawdown (£150) was taken on 9 December 
2014 and the RCF then paid off in full just over a week later.  
Two weeks later, on 31 December 2014, Sunny lent loan 2 (£150) which  was repaid on 23 January 
2015. There was then a gap of around three and a half months before loans 3 to 5 (all for £150), were  
taken out in May 2015. Loans 6 and 7 followed  in June 2015,  both being  taken out four days after the 
previous loan had been repaid.
I think  the lending activity  by loan 7 could  have  indicated  that Mr Ss underlying financial situation may 
have been deteriorating. I dont think though there was enough evidence  by that point to say that a 
pattern of unsustainable lending had become established.  I say this because  there had been a break  
between loans 2 and 3 and the level of lending overall,  whilst consistent, had been relatively  modest 
compared to Mr Ss declared income and appeared to be affordable for him. So Im not upholding his 
complaint about loans 5  7. 
However, Ive also looked at the overall pattern  of Sunnys lending history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there  was a point at which  Sunny  should reasonably have  seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further  loans. 
Ref: DRN67654325Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think that this point  was reached by loan 8. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have  realised  Mr S was not managing  to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken  out 8 loans  within  10 months and Mr S had been indebted to 
Sunny for around 7 months. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr S 
was having to borrow  further to cover the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving  in his 
finances.
Mr Ss first loan was for £150 and loan 8 was for the same sum.   At this point Sunny ought to 
have known  that Mr C was not likely  borrowing  to meet a temporary  shortfall in their income  
but to meet an ongoing  need.  
From loan 8 onwards  Mr S was provided with a new loan within days  of settling a previous 
loan. 
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 26 was taken  out 
nearly two years  after Mr Ss first loan. And it was for the same sum as his first loan. So Mr S 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think  that Mr S lost out because  Sunny  continued to provide  borrowing from loan 8 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number of loans which Mr S borrowed was likely  to have had negative  implications on Mr 
Ss ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him/her  in the market for these  high-cost 
loans.
Sunny has already agreed that it shouldnt  have  lent loans 11 to 26. I think  these loans had the effect  
of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him to take expensive credit over an extended  
period. And the sheer  number  of loans  was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ss ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost  loans.
 
So, Im upholding  Mr Ss complaint about his borrowing from loan 8 to loan 10. And taken together 
with what Sunny has already agreed for loans 11 to 26, have set out what  it should do to put things 
right as detailed below.
