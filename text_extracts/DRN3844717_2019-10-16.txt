K820x#14complaint
Ms W complains that Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Plcs (RSA) error in not updating her 
details on her pet insurance  policy has disadvantaged her. My references to RSA include its 
agents.
background
Ms W has pet insurance with RSA for her two dogs and two cats, and has done  for the last 
few years.  In March  2018 at the 2018/2019 policy renewal she spoke to RSA to change  her 
address details and she reduced  the cover  on the policy.  RSA told Ms W the premium  cost 
and she accepted it. 
In autumn 2018  when Ms W claimed  for treatment for one of her dogs  it came  to light that 
RSA hadnt changed her address or charged the correct extra premium due to the address 
change. RSA then corrected the address and waived the additional premium for the change  
during that policy  year.  But it said the 2019/2020 policy premium would include the increase 
for the correct address.  RSA paid Ms W £100  compensation for its error  in not changing the 
address earlier.
Ms W complained that if shed known in March 2018  that her policy  premium  should  have 
been higher because of her address change she would have looked  at other policy  options. 
She said as her dog now had a pre-existing medical  condition from the autumn  2018 
treatment she couldnt change her insurance  policy provider without that medical  condition  
being excluded  or being  too expensive to cover. Ms W wants  RSA to either not increase the 
premium or to reimburse  the additional premium for the 2019/2020 policy  renewal.
Our investigator thought RSA had acted  fairly.  He noted the quotes Ms W sent us for 
alternative insurance cover for 2019/20.  But he said they didnt show that a cheaper policy  
that gave the same  cover as RSAs policy would  have been available at the time of the 
2018/2019 policy renewal and they didnt cover her dogs pre-existing medical condition.  
Ms W wants an ombudsmans decision. She said the cheaper policies she found wouldn't 
cover her dogs pre-existing condition but the cover was either equal or better to RSAs  
policy. She believes RSAs error  has financially disadvantaged her.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont uphold this complaint.  Ill explain  why.
The quotes  Ms W sent us from alternative  providers are as at February  2019. She says the 
quotes dont cover her dogs pre-existing  medical  condition. So I cant  fairly compare the 
costs of those policies with RSAs more  expensive policy for 2019/20 which  does cover the 
medical condition.  Its clear from RSAs premium  breakdown in the policy  document  that the 
large increase in premium is for Ms Ws dog who had treatment in 2018. 
The February 2019 alternative providers policies  quotes are cheaper than RSAs 2018/2019 
policy. Ive not got enough  information  to say those policies give the same  or better  cover  
than RSAs 2018/2019 policy.  But even  if I accepted  they did, Ive no evidence  that the 
Ref: DRN38447172alternative quotes would have been  at those same  prices in March 2018 which is when 
Ms W says she would have looked  at the market for cheaper policies. Also, Ms W could 
have looked at alternative policies in any event at that time.
In addition, even  if Ms W could have got a cheaper equivalent or better insurance cover  
than RSAs policy in 2018/2019  I cant know what effect the claim for her dog might have 
had on another  policy.  So the 2019/2020 renewal cost for another  policy might have been 
more expensive than the saving Ms W may have made in 2018/2019.  
There's no evidence  for me to say that RSAs error in March  2018 in not telling Ms W of the 
correct extra  charge for her change of address has financially disadvantaged Ms W.
RSA acted fairly in not charging the additional  premium for the 2018/2019 policy and paying 
Ms W £100 compensation for its error. It can fairly charge the correct additional premium for 
her change of address  for the 2019/2020 policy.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 November  2019.
