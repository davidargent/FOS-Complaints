The complaint
Mrs D complains that John Lewis Financial Services Limited wont refund to her the money 
that she paid for two holiday club memberships. Shes being represented in her complaint by 
a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs D and her husband entered into a membership purchase agreement in April 2015 to buy 
a holiday club membership from a holiday company. The purchase price was £4,550 and 
Mrs D paid £2,275 of that amount using her John Lewis Financial Services credit card with 
the payment being made in May 2015. Mrs D also authorised a holiday club to charge a total 
of £2,275 to her credit card by twelve monthly charges of £189.58 from May 2015.
Mrs D and her husband then entered into a membership upgrade agreement in August 2015 
to upgrade their membership. The purchase price was £7,050 from which the £4,550 that 
theyd agreed to pay in April 2015 was deducted so the amount due from them was £2,500. 
Mrs D paid that amount using her John Lewis Financial Services credit card with the 
payment being made fourteen days later. Mrs D also made a payment of £1,675 to the 
holiday club using her John Lewis Financial Services credit card in August 2015.
Mrs Ds representative, on behalf of Mrs D, made a claim to John Lewis Financial Services 
in December 2019 under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the holiday 
company had breached the contract and had misrepresented the product to Mrs D and her 
husband. Mrs D and her husband had made other claims to John Lewis Financial Services 
about holiday products and it confused this claim as a duplicate of another claim so it didnt 
address it. 
As no response had been received from John Lewis Financial Services to Mrs Ds claim, a 
complaint was then made to this service that the holiday company was in breach of the 
contract by misrepresenting the contract to Mrs D and her husband and breaching the EU 
Timeshare Directive. Mrs Ds husband sadly passed away in October 2021.
John Lewis Financial Services then said that it had reviewed the documents that Mrs Ds 
representative had provided but didnt believe that the criteria for a section 75 claim had 
been met as it hadnt been shown that the product had been misrepresented to Mrs D and 
her husband to lead to any breach. It offered £100 compensation for the incorrect handling 
of the claim because it said that the claim shouldnt have been filed without being worked 
and its agent had made an error in doing that.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ds complaint should be upheld as he didnt 
think that John Lewis Financial Services decision to turn down her claim was unfair or 
unreasonable. He wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale 
and he didnt think that the contract had been breached. He said that John Lewis Financial 
Services had offered to pay £100 compensation because aspects of its service could have 
been better. He said that he thought that that was a fair outcome in the circumstances.
Mrs Ds representative, on behalf of Mrs D, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It says that it doesnt agree with our investigators recommendation and that 
Mrs D has found the whole situation extremely distressing and other executors of her late 
husbands estate have taken over the conduct of this complaint. It says, in summary and 
amongst other things, that:
Mrs D and her husband were sold the product as an investment that could be sold 
prior to the expiration of 2024 at a profit and they completed the application to sell it 
two months after their purchase which makes absolutely no sense if they werent 
advised that they would make a swift profit;
Mrs D and her husband purchased an initial timeshare contract in April 2015 which 
offered what was described as medium and the resale value was limited as it was not 
for peak periods so they decided in order to maximise their returns that they would 
accept the advice of the holiday company in relation to their investment and upgrade 
about four months later to a premium  high time;
it was never their intention to use the timeshare, and they paid a further £250 to list 
the property for sale about seven weeks after purchase;
the EU Timeshare Directive was breached because no advance payment, guarantee 
or acknowledgement of debt to the trader or to a third party is allowed before the end 
of the withdrawal period but the contract entered into in August 2015 was paid on the 
day as can be seen from Mrs Ds account statement; 
the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 
say that a trader must not market or sell a proposed timeshare contract or long-term 
holiday product contract as an investment if the proposed contract would be a 
regulated contract; and
Mrs D and her husband were unable to contact the seller a short time after their 
purchase.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ds complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mrs Ds claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
Mrs Ds claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the 
holiday company and that the memberships were misrepresented to her and her 
husband and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented 
to them;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not John Lewis Financial Services 
response to Mrs Ds claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mrs Ds complaint form says that the holiday company was in breach of the contract 
by misrepresenting the contract to Mrs D and her husband and breaching the EU 
Timeshare Directive, and her representatives letter to John Lewis Financial Services in December 2019 describes the misrepresentations that it says were made to Mrs D 
and her husband, including that:
they were advised that the product was of some substance but its now clear 
that its worthless and has no merit;
it was represented to them that the purchase would be an investment as the 
product would increase in value and, after a period of a few years, they would 
be able to sell it at a considerable profit, which was untrue; and
they were advised that they would be able to book exclusive accommodation 
and at a cheaper cost than holidays available online but theyve been unable 
to book any holidays whatsoever and have not used the product;
Ive been provided with a copy of the membership purchase agreement that Mrs D 
and her husband signed in April 2015 and the membership upgrade agreement that 
they signed in August 2015 but not the terms and conditions that were on the reverse 
side of those agreements or any other documents relating to the purchases;
the membership purchase agreement said that Mrs D and her husband were buying 
occupancy rights for an unspecified apartment that sleeps two people for one week in 
the medium holiday period commencing in 2015 and expiring in December 2024;
the membership upgrade agreement said that it cancelled and replaced the 
membership purchase agreement and that Mrs D and her husband were buying 
occupancy rights for an unspecified apartment that sleeps two people for one week in 
the premium-high holiday period commencing in 2016 and expiring in December 
2023;
the agreements gave Mrs D and her husband occupancy rights at a holiday club and 
Im not persuaded that those rights are worthless;
neither Mrs D nor her representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which it was represented to them that the purchases would be an 
investment, the conversations that took place or the information that was provided to 
them  but Ive seen no evidence to show that it was likely that the products would 
increase in value, that they were advised that they would increase in value or that it 
was likely that they would be able to sell their occupancy rights at a considerable 
profit;
Mrs Ds representative says that Mrs D and her husband completed an application to 
sell the product two months after their purchase and that they paid a further £250 to 
list the property for sale about seven weeks after purchase but its provided no further 
evidence to show that they did so  and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the holiday company represented to Mrs D and her husband 
that the memberships were an investment;
the agreements refer to exclusive rights of occupancy and Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mrs D and her husband wouldnt have received exclusive occupancy of the 
apartment but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they 
were advised that the accommodation would be cheaper than holidays available 
online;
Mrs Ds representative said in its December 2019 letter that Mrs D and her husband 
had been unable to book any holidays and theyd been unable to contact the holiday 
company to use the product, but it said in response to our investigators 
recommendation that it was never their intention to use the accommodation;
if the holiday company had made such promises to Mrs D and her husband but the 
promises werent contained in the documents that they were then signing, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have asked for the promises to be set 
out in writing;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the memberships were 
misrepresented to Mrs D and her husband by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the agreements by any such misrepresentations;
Mrs Ds representatives December 2019 letter says that Mrs D and her husband 
were to have exclusive rights of occupancy but theyve been unable to contact the 
holiday company at any time to use the product so the holiday company has 
committed a repudiatory breach of contract which cant now be remedied;
neither Mrs D nor her representative has provided evidence to show the steps that 
have been taken to contact the holiday company and, if they were unable to contact 
the holiday company, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have 
tried to contact the holiday club where the accommodation is based  but Ive seen 
no evidence to show that theyve done so;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence in these circumstances to show that 
theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company for which John Lewis 
Financial Services would be liable under section 75;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that there must be a debtor-creditor-
supplier agreement but, as Mrs Ds payments were made to the holiday club, and not 
to the holiday company, its now possible that there was no such agreement in place 
following the High Courts judgment last year in the case of Steiner v National 
Westminster Bank plc;
but as Im not persuaded that theres been a misrepresentation or breach of contract 
for which John Lewis Financial Services would be liable under section 75, I consider 
that theres no need for me to make any finding as to whether or not there was a 
debtor-creditor-supplier agreement in these arrangements;
Mrs Ds representative says that the EU Timeshare Directive was breached because 
Mrs Ds payment under the membership upgrade agreement was made on the day 
that she and her husband entered into that agreement;
Mrs D and her husband entered into the membership purchase agreement in April 
2015  it said that they had the right to cancel the agreement until 28 April 2015  
Mrs D paid £2,275 using her John Lewis Financial Services credit card with the 
payment being made in May 2015 (more than fourteen days after theyd entered into 
the agreement) and she authorised the holiday company to charge a total of £2,275 
to her credit card by twelve monthly charges of £189.58 from May 2015 (a month 
after theyd entered into the agreement) so I dont consider that any payments under 
that agreement were made before the end of the withdrawal period;
Mrs D and her husband entered into the membership upgrade agreement in August 
2015  it said that they had the right to cancel the agreement within fourteen days - 
Mrs D paid £2,500 using her John Lewis Financial Services credit card with the 
payment being made fourteen days after theyd entered into the agreement  so I 
dont consider that the payment under that agreement was made before the end of 
the withdrawal period;
Mrs D also made a payment of £1,675 to the holiday club using her John Lewis 
Financial Services credit card in August 2015 on the same day that she and her 
husband had entered into the membership upgrade agreement  but that wasnt a 
payment of the purchase price payable under the membership upgrade agreement 
and Ive not been provided with any evidence to show why that payment was made at that time  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
theres been a breach of the EU Timeshare Directive;
Mrs Ds representative says that the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and 
Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 were breached because the holiday company 
marketed the memberships as an investment  but Ive already said that Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
represented to Mrs D and her husband that the memberships were an investment so 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of those regulations;
John Lewis Financial Services didnt respond to the claims that had been made to it 
so I cant say that its response to them was fair and reasonable  but it accepted that 
it had handled the claim incorrectly as it shouldnt have been filed without being 
worked and its agent had made an error in doing that  and it offered to pay £100 
compensation;
I consider that its offer of £100 compensation is fair and reasonable compensation for 
those issues  and it said at that time that it didnt believe that the criteria for a 
section 75 claim had been met as it hadnt been shown that the product had been 
misrepresented to Mrs D and her husband to lead to any breach  and I consider that 
it was fair and reasonable for it then not to have upheld the claim; and
I sympathise with Mrs D for the loss of her husband and for the issues that shes had 
with the memberships, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require John Lewis Financial Services to refund to Mrs D 
any of the money that she paid for them, to pay her any compensation other than the 
£100 that it has offered, or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
If the £100 compensation hasnt been paid to Mrs D and she now wishes to accept it, I 
suggest that she contacts John Lewis Financial Services to tell it that she accepts its offer.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 December 2023.
