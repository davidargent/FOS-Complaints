DRN-2077064
The complaint
This complaint is about a mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI) policy taken out in 
2009. Mrs and Mr J said Santander UK plc, trading at the time as Abbey, mis-sold this cover 
to them.
Ill refer mainly to Santander for consistency.
Background
I issued a provisional decision about this in July 2020, comprehensively setting out why I 
thought the complaint shouldnt be upheld. And I asked both parties to provide any further 
submissions or information to me by 9 August 2020 at the latest. That decision should be 
read in conjunction with this final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve had a reply from Santander which said it had nothing more to add. Mrs and Mr J 
didnt reply, so Im interpreting that as them having nothing more to add. Having 
reconsidered everything again, theres no reason for me to change what I said in my 
provisional decision. For the reasons Ive previously outlined, Im not upholding this 
complaint.
My final decision
I dont uphold Mrs and Mr Js complaint. And dont require Santander UK plc to pay any 
compensation.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J and Mr J to 
accept or reject my decision before 8 September 2020.
