The complaint
Mrs H complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA acted unfairly by restricting her 
account due to the actions of another party.
What happened
Mrs H bought a laptop for her daughter  her daughter contributed towards this. Around a 
week later Mrs H tried to use PayPal and was told her account had been permanently limited 
because she had broken the terms of service. She says she has never broken the terms of 
service and that after many months she was told that she had dealt with someone who had 
broken the terms which was why her account had been limited. She says the only account 
she had received money from was her daughters. Mrs H says she is being treated unfairly 
as she is being punished for something she isnt responsible for.
PayPal said that Mrs Hs account was linked to another account that had ongoing issues and 
restrictions including a restriction for violation of PayPals Acceptable User Policy. It said that 
accounts werent linked by just sending money but by the cross-referencing of other account 
information. 
Our investigator didnt uphold this complaint. She said that PayPal was entitled to review the 
services it offers and decide if it considers an account too risky. While noting Mrs Hs 
concerns she said she didnt think that PayPal had done anything wrong in this case.
Mrs H didnt accept our investigators view. She said her daughter lived at home and so the 
address for the accounts would be the same and that they at times shared a computer. She 
said the actions on her daughters account were nothing to do with her and shouldnt affect 
her account. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand why Mrs H is upset by the actions taken by PayPal to permanently suspend her 
account, however for me to uphold this complaint I would need to be satisfied that PayPal 
had done something wrong or treated Mrs H unfairly.
PayPal has explained that in August 2020 Mrs Hs account was restricted after a routine 
review following a violation of its terms of use. It isnt unreasonable that a service provider 
will take actions to limit accounts when concerns are raised about an accounts usage. In 
this case a review was undertaken, and it was found the Mrs Hs account was linked to 
another account that had ongoing issues and restrictions in place. Mrs H believes this to be 
her daughters but due to data protection further details about the other account havent 
been provided. While I appreciate Mrs Hs comments about not having any role in the other 
account, I also accept that Mrs H agreed to the PayPal User Agreement and so agreed she 
wouldnt:
Control an account that is linked to another account that has engaged in any of these 
restricted activities. 
Circumvent any PayPal policy or determinations about your PayPal account such as 
temporary or indefinite suspensions or other account holds, limitations or restrictions, 
including, but not limited to, engaging in the following actions: attempting to open new or 
additional PayPal account(s) when an account has a negative balance or has been restricted, 
suspended or otherwise limited; opening new or additional PayPal accounts using 
information that is not your own (e.g. name, address, email address, etc.); or using someone 
else's PayPal account. 
PayPal has explained how the accounts have been linked and while I accept Mrs Hs 
comments about why certain information for her account and that of other family members is 
the same, this doesnt mean that PayPal has done anything wrong or acted unfairly by 
linking the accounts.
In this case as Mrs Hs account is linked to an account with ongoing issues, PayPal has also 
restricted her account. I appreciate this is upsetting for Mrs H and I am very sorry to hear 
how this issue has been magnified by the pandemic, but PayPal can make a commercial 
judgement as to who it provides services to. In this case I cant say that it has done anything 
wrong, or acted outside its terms, by taking the actions it has, so I do not find I can uphold 
this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 February 2022.
