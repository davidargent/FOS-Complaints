The complaint
Mrs J complains that National Westminster Bank plc wrongly declined a payment from her 
current account. 
What happened
In mid-June 2022, Mrs Js car insurance was due to renew automatically. Mrs J was 
expecting the insurer to take payment of about £250.00 from a card on her current account 
with NatWest.
But the insurer said the payment had failed. 
Weeks later, police stopped Mrs J on suspicion of driving without insurance. Mrs J 
complained to the insurer, who said NatWest had declined payment.
Mrs J also complained to NatWest that it had wrongly declined payment when she had the 
money available in her account. She also complained about a telephone conversation.
By a final response dated early November 2022, NatWest accepted the complaint in part. It 
apologised that it had given incorrect information during a telephone call in October 2022. It 
said it was paying £30.00 as compensation for the inconvenience. But NatWest said it hadnt 
received a payment request from the insurer.
In late November 2022, Mrs J brought us her complaint against NatWest about the failed 
payment.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
NatWest hadnt received any request for payment from the insurer.
Mrs J disagreed with the investigators opinion. She asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. She says, in summary, that we should look at both complaints together. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has shown us a screenshot of its search for payments in mid-June 2022 using the 
card ending 2932. From that, I accept that the insurer hadnt asked for payment on that card 
and NatWest didnt decline payment.
NatWest has also shown us a screenshot of its search for payments in mid-June 2022 using 
a card that expired in November 2021. From that, I accept that the insurer hadnt asked for 
payment on that card and NatWest didnt decline payment.
So I dont find that NatWest did anything wrong. I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct 
NatWest to do any more in response to this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct National Westminster Bank plc to do any more in response to this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 May 2023.
