K821x#15complaint
Mr and Mrs Ds complaint  is about  a claim they made on their home insurance policy. They  
are unhappy  about  what  the insurer has done to repair their home and the service  they have  
received. The policy is underwritten by Elite Insurance Company Limited, so it is responsible  
for any claim  decisions and handling.
background
In December 2016 a car crashed into Mr and Mrs Ds home. They  contacted their insurer 
and it accepted the claim and instructed a structural assessment done on the property. The 
surveyor said that some temporary support was needed and the front door and garage door 
shouldnt be used as a precaution. He was, however, satisfied that once  the temporary 
support was in place  the property was safe,  habitable and secure. This report  appears to 
have been submitted on 29 December 2016.  A structural engineer had oversight of the 
temporary support  arrangements  to ensure  they were adequate.
Mr and Mrs D had moved out of the property while it was assessed.  Elite confirmed that it 
would consider reimbursing any costs  they incurred when outside  their home up to the point 
the property was declared safe. The costs submitted by Mr and Mrs D were  agreed on 20 
January 2017  and paid shortly thereafter
By the beginning  of February the scope for the works that were  needed to repair  
Mr and Mrs Ds home  had been drawn-up and it had been approved by the insurer.  It was 
determined that there  would  need to be a partial rebuild of the front wall of the house, 
replacement of the garage  door and frame,  repairs to the staircase and hall flooring  and 
redecoration in various rooms. Mr and Mrs D were  told a couple of weeks later that they 
would need to move out during the repairs and alternative accommodation would be paid for.
Mr and Mrs D werent  happy with the scope of works as they were concerned about the 
floors  theyd become  very squeaky, which they werent before the accident. The surveyor 
attended the property again  and decided that when the contractor went in to start the repairs, 
it should arrange for the upstairs floors to be lifted and inspected.  This took the claim to the 
middle of March 2017.
Mr and Mrs D remained unhappy about their floors and a complaint was registered. A 
response to that complaint was issued  in May 2017  and confirmed that the surveyors  
recommendation for a further  inspection  of the floors  would be undertaken  when the 
contractor started the repairs.
Unfortunately the repairs werent able to start at that point as it was discovered that the 
contractor couldnt  source  exact  matches  for the blocks/stonework the outside skin of the 
house was made of. The insurers immediate  response to this was to find a reasonable 
match and have  the finish changed  by a specialist company so a fully match was achieved.  
However, it took around six months  for the contractor to get agreement  from Mr and Mrs D to 
reuse some of the existing blocks and accept the match for new ones. This agreement  was 
reached in the second half of November 2017.  
It was again confirmed that Mr and Mrs D and their family would need to move  out of the 
property for the duration of the repairs. This was expected to be around four weeks. Elite 
paid them just under  £1,000 for the cost of alternative accommodation. It appears, however, 
that they chose  to remain in the property  for some of the repair  period. 
Ref: DRN88839262Elites file indicates that Mr and Mrs D asked  that the repairs  not start until after the 
Christmas and New Year period. An agreed  date at the beginning  of 2018 was set, but the 
repairs didnt start until almost the end of April 2018 because of the possible impact  of the 
repairs on the health of a member of Mr and Mrs Ds family. The rebuild of the front wall was 
finished on the first May bank holiday weekend. The surveyor  attended at this point and was 
satisfied with the quality of the repairs. 
The hall window and front door were subsequently  refitted,  but there were problems with the 
fixing points. Elite was informed of this by the contractor on 23 May 2018. It also confirmed 
the cost of replacing both items.  It was around  a month later when these works  were booked 
with the window company. 
During May and June  2018 Mr and Mrs D raised various issues regarding the condition  of 
their home. These included problems with the rear patio doors, wanting the laminate flooring 
in the kitchen and lounge  to be replaced  (alongside that in the hall), wanting a new carpet on 
the stairs  and landing  (as it had become soiled during  the repairs) and the appearance of the 
front wall including concerns  over its symmetry with the new proposed window  and door. 
They also asked that they be paid £20,000  as they believed that the value of their home had 
reduced by that much  due to the accident. 
Elite agreed to replace the laminate  flooring in the kitchen, but not that in the lounge.  This 
was because the kitchen and hall flooring was a continuous stretch  of laminate, with no door 
bars or other methods  of separating  them.  However,  as the lounge was separated by door 
bars, it was not willing to replace that flooring. It was also concluded when the laminate was 
examined by the surveyor, that no damage  had been caused  by the impact,  although it was 
noted that the usual restraint at the edges,  in the form of beading or placement under 
skirting, was not present. Mr and Mrs D maintained  that this needed to be done because  the 
laminate in all three rooms matched.  
The patio doors were inspected by the company who had reinstalled  the front door and 
window and were  to install the replacements.  It concluded that the issue  with the patio doors 
was due to age and that they needed  adjusting. Elite said that as it was nothing  to do with 
the accident, it wouldnt complete any repairs. In relation to the carpets,  Elite confirmed that 
they were to be refitted and that it would arrange  for them to be cleaned. Mr and Mrs D 
werent happy and maintained that they wanted them replaced.
Elite confirmed that it was satisfied  with the repairs to the front of the property,  including the 
aesthetics. So it didnt  propose to do anything  more.
With regard to any loss in value that might have occurred because  of the accident and claim, 
Elite explained  that the policy didnt cover this type of loss. It pointed  out that they had legal 
expenses cover and they might be able to make a claim direct to the insurer of the person 
who crashed into their home.
At the end of June 2018 Mr and Mrs D stopped Elite from doing  any further works to their 
home. They raised their complaint with this service. The key points Mr and Mrs D were  
unhappy about when they came to us were:
They werent happy about the repairs to the front wall. They  think  the wall should have 
been completely  knocked down rather than patch repaired. They are unhappy with the 
Ref: DRN88839263match of the materials  used and that some of the stones were reused, as they dont  
believe this should  have been done.
The contractors caused  further  damage  when doing the repairs and just patched it up. 
They dont think this is acceptable.
Carpets werent protected during the repairs and became damaged. They  arent satisfied 
with them being cleaned, they want them replaced.
Floors are raised since the accident. 
They werent told that they could have got the works done themselves and used the legal  
expenses cover to claim the money  back from the third party. 
They are not happy  about the amount they were offered if they wanted to have the 
repairs done for themselves, as they believe this is significantly  less that the contractors 
were actually  paid.
We forwarded Mr and Mrs Ds complaint to Elite and it responded directly to them  in 
August 2018.  It said it had paid Mr and Mrs D the amount agreed for the period of the 
structural repairs. However, it said if they had incurred additional costs, if they provided 
evidence of those  costs, it would reimburse  them. In relation to the laminate flooring in the 
kitchen and lounge  the damage had occurred because the flooring wasnt fitted  correctly  in 
the first place. As such, it was not willing to make  any further settlement. It said it was sorry 
Mr and Mrs D werent  happy with the aesthetic  match of the repairs on the front of the 
house, but its inspections had determined  the match was acceptable. Elite also confirmed 
that it would  return  and complete the internal repairs and redecoration when Mr and Mrs D 
would allow it access to the property. 
One of our investigators  considered Mr and Mrs Ds complaint.  He didnt recommend that 
the complaint  be upheld.  
Mr and Mrs D didnt accept these conclusions.  They  commissioned a structural  engineer  to 
assess the repairs done to their home.  However, no report was completed on the structural  
stability of the repairs;  the engineer simply commented that an engineer should have been 
involved in the repair process.
As no new evidence  was provided by Mr and Mrs D the investigator  didnt change his 
conclusions. As agreement couldnt  be reached,  the complaint was passed  to me to 
consider.
On 5 September 2019 I issued my provisional  decision on this complaint. In that document  I 
set out my conclusions and reasons  for reaching  them. Attached  is the content  of that 
document. In summary, I found that Elite should  complete further  repairs to the laminate 
flooring, a further inspection of the upstairs  floor (and any necessary repairs). I also 
considered it should  pay Mr and Mrs D £750 compensation.
Elite accepted my provisional decision.  
Mr and Mrs D didnt accept the provisional decision. They remain concerned that the 
property was not assessed  by a structural engineer and the repairs  had not been designed 
Ref: DRN88839264and signed off by such an engineer. They remain unhappy that despite them asking Elite to 
have the house inspected  by a structural engineer, it refused.
They believe  the floors  throughout  the house  need inspecting  they believe damage  to the 
underlying floor (rather  than the laminate) was the cause of a leak on a central heating pipe 
leading to a radiator. They have concerns that there might be damage to walls  on the first 
floor behind fitted furniture. In addition they listed various issues  they believe are due to the 
accident and have either not been repaired  or inadequately repaired.  Some of these items  
were things looked into under the claim but didnt appear to be being pursued by the time the 
Mr and Mrs D complained  to us. Others were new issues.  I wrote  to Mr and Mrs D about 
their concerns and provided Elite with a copy of my letter. I have also attached the text of my 
letter, dated 23 October 2017,  below.
Elite didnt provide  any further comment.  Mr and Mrs D said that my conclusions  are not 
supported by any expert evidence and there is no guarantee  that their home  is structurally 
adequate. As such, they think  the way forward is that an expert needs to be appointed to 
assess their property. They have  asked that Elite be made  to have a proper survey 
completed of their home.  Mr and Mrs D also disagree with some of my comments about 
works they believe are necessary to the property, which I will comment  on further  in my 
findings. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments, including  Mr and Mrs Ds further 
comments, to decide  whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mr and Mrs D have  rightly said, this service assesses a case  like this based on the 
evidence available  and a significant  focus is placed  on expert opinion. I know that they dont 
accept the surveyor  Elite sent to assess their home was adequately  qualified to do so, but as 
I have already explained, I am satisfied he was. As such, I have  expert opinion  from a 
suitably qualified individual on which to place reliance. I dont consider the evidence or 
circumstances of the claim mean that it is necessary or would be appropriate for me to order  
Elite to commission a structural engineer to inspect Mr and Mrs Ds home. 
It is of course an option for Mr and Mrs D to arrange such  an inspection, but based on the 
evidence I have at present,  I cant require Elite to pay for it. If Mr and Mrs D were to 
commission a structural engineer and that engineers findings  materially  changed the 
outcome of the claim,  this service would likely expect Elite to refund the cost of the 
inspection and report. However, I cant  in the circumstances  require it to do so at the present  
time. 
Mr and Mrs D have said they are unhappy  with some of my comments  about works they 
believe should be done as part of the claim repairs. They have highlighted the matter of the 
patio doors.  They have now confirmed that prior to the accident  they had some  repairs  done 
on the doors. That may well be the case, but the expert who assessed the doors  when the 
problems were raised during the claim considered  the issues were to do with use and age, 
rather than the accident. So whilst Mr and Mrs D may have had previous repairs done, the 
continued use may have meant some further adjustments were needed. I must rely on the 
expert evidence and that says the doors were not damaged by the accident,  so I cant  
require Elite to complete  any works  on them.
Ref: DRN88839265As for the matter of potential damage  to the wall behind fitted wardrobes, Mr and Mrs D 
asked how I have come to the conclusion that furniture shouldnt be moved  to carry out an 
initial investigation and what  expert  evidence I have  relied on to support my reasoning. They  
have said there were cracks all over the house when the accident happened and to suggest 
that only adjacent  walls  should be looked at would be incorrect without expert evidence.
Firstly, I would confirm that I didnt say that only cracks in adjacent walls should  be looked at. 
As I explained to Mr and Mrs D the removal of fitted furniture is often a destructive process. 
It would not be appropriate for the insurer to cause more damage to their home without  good  
reason. So unless there are indications in the areas  surrounding the fitted furniture that there  
is damage behind  it, for example damage to the opposite  side of the same  wall, we wouldnt 
expect the insurer  to potentially destroy  that fitted furniture to look behind it on the off-chance  
there is some damage. There needs  to be evidence showing  that such  checks  are 
necessary and appropriate and I havent seen any such evidence.
I know that it will disappoint Mr and Mrs D, but having carefully considered  their further  
submissions and all of the original evidence, I havent changed  my conclusions  about the 
further actions  Elite should complete.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of the 
complaint Elite Insurance  Company Limited  should:
arrange to repair/replace  the laminate flooring in the hall and kitchen to provide a 
continuous floor as it was before the claim;
arrange to repair/replace  the laminate flooring in the lounge;
arrange for an inspection of the upstairs floors to be undertaken and any repairs  
necessary to be completed; and
pay £750 for the upset and inconvenience its handling of the claim caused 
Mr and Mrs D.
Ref: DRN88839266I am satisfied that once  the remaining repairs and decorative works are completed, 
Mr and Mrs Ds carpets  should be professionally cleaned  as Elite has offered to arrange.   
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr and Mrs D to 
accept or reject my decision  before  5 January  2020.

As no new evidence  was provided by Mr and Mrs D the investigator  didnt change his 
conclusions. As agreement couldnt  be reached,  the complaint has been passed to me to 
consider.
my provisional findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN888392610Mr and Mrs D have said that they are unhappy because  they werent told by Elite that they 
could have done the repairs  themselves and used  the legal cover provided by the policy to 
claim the money back from the third party. When an insurer is made aware  of a claim, I 
wouldnt expect it to do something that could be seen as it trying  to avoid its responsibility for 
that claim.  Suggesting that a consumer shouldnt make a claim but rather  try to pursue 
remediation through the courts isnt something an insurer would be expected to do nor would 
it be considered appropriate behaviour by this service  other  than in exceptional  
circumstances. I dont  consider Mr and Mrs Ds situation would fall into that category and as 
such, I cant find Elite at fault for simply dealing  with the claim they made.  
I note Mr and Mrs D are unhappy with the amount  Elite offered them  if they chose to arrange 
the repairs themselves.  They believe it is less than Elite has actually paid for the repairs. 
Had they selected the option of taking a cash settlement and it had proved  to be insufficient,  
that is something we could look into. However, given they chose to have Elite complete the 
repairs, whether the cash settlement would have  been enough for them  to have done so, is a 
hypothetical scenario.  The role of this service is to consider what  actually happened, not 
what hypothetically could  have if a consumer had made a different decision.  As such, I dont  
propose to spend  any further time on this issue.
I would also confirm to Mr and Mrs D at this stage that the insurance  policy  doesnt provide 
for any diminution in value  to the property  due to the accident having  happened and their 
home needing to be repaired. As such,  it isnt something I would expect Elite to pay.
I will now turn to the matter of the repairs that Mr and Mrs D are unhappy about. 
Mr and Mrs D think that the front of their house  shouldnt have been repaired, but rather  it 
should have been knocked  down and rebuilt. They are unhappy with the aesthetic match of 
the materials used  and dont think any of the original stones should have been reclaimed 
and reused.
The role of this service is to assess the evidence we have. In this case we have Elites 
expert being satisfied  the front wall of the property could be successfully repaired and no 
other expert report to contradict it. I also note the structural repairs  were  completed some 
time ago and Mr and Mrs D havent  suggested they have failed in any way. I would also 
comment that it is not unusual for reclaimed building supplies to be used in building  projects.  
Given this information,  I cant  reasonably  find that Elite was wrong to repair the front wall of 
Mr and Mrs Ds home  or to reuse some of the original stonework.
As for the aesthetics  of the repair, Elites records clearly show  that identical building  
materials couldnt be sourced. However, it brought in a specialist to tint the new stonework to 
match the old. Elites  representatives believe it to be a reasonable match.  Mr and Mrs D 
dont. In light of this I asked both parties to provide me with photographs of the exterior of the 
house following  the structural repairs having  been  completed. Elite said it didnt have any 
photographs. Whilst Mr and Mrs D provided  numerous photographs of other  things they 
thought had been inadequately repaired or needed repair, they didnt provide any of the front 
of the house. As such, whilst I dont disbelieve  Mr and Mrs D, I havent seen any evidence  to 
support their contention that the works  Elite had done on to the front wall of their home were 
inadequate. 
I now turn to the matter of the laminate floors in the kitchen and the lounge. I will firstly deal 
with the matter of that in the kitchen. Before the accident the laminate flooring appears  to run 
through the hall and into the kitchen  without break  of interruption. It was for all intents and 
Ref: DRN888392611purposes one floor.  Elite has cut the flooring at the kitchen door and added  a threshold. This 
is not the arrangement Mr and Mrs D had before the accident and as such, Elite has not 
fulfilled its obligations  under the policy to place them, as far as possible, in the same position  
as they were in before  the accident happened.
I have also considered the damage that has occurred to the flooring. Mr and Mrs D have 
described it as the floors  squeaking and creaking and there being bounce  in them. This 
would appear  to be consistent  with Elites experts  opinion that the floors were 
shunted/buckled during  the accident. Whilst it has said this wouldnt have happened had the 
floors had the usual  beading around the edges, I am not convinced that is the case.  The 
beading is there to cover  the expansion  gap at the edges of the floor. It is secured to the 
skirting boards and it doesnt secure  the flooring to the underlying floor.  
So if there has been some movement  on the horizontal plane, that would likely still have 
happened whether there  was beading  or not. Whether beading secured to skirting would 
have stopped any buckling of the floors is not something I can determine. However, the 
simple fact is that Elite has accepted there was damage to the kitchen and lounge floors  
following the accident. Whether the degree  of that damage would have been smaller if the 
flooring had been fitted in the normal manner cant be established.  What  matters is that there  
is damage, which is accepted wasnt there  before the accident and so is attributable to that 
accident. As such,  I consider  Elite is responsible for replacing/repairing the laminate flooring 
in the kitchen and lounge.  Given the flooring through the hall and kitchen was continuous, it 
should be replaced in the same manner.
I now move  to the issue of the upstairs  floor damage Mr and Mrs D have reported. They 
have described  the floor as raised  on the landing and that the floor in their bedroom  flexes 
so much when walked on, the bed shakes.  When  asked for clarification about what they 
meant by the floor being raised, a photograph was given of the threshold between  the 
landing and a bedroom. Unfortunately, due to the presence of carpet I cant  see any obvious  
damage to the floors.
In Elites representatives report of May 2018 stated  that it would arrange  for the carpets to 
be lifted upstairs, the floors inspected  and any repairs needed done. I asked Elite for any 
evidence of this inspection or repairs  and it was unable to provide any. As such, I can only 
conclude no inspection was done before Mr and Mrs D stopped the repairs.  Therefore, I will 
require Elite to arrange the inspection of Mr and Mrs Ds first floor to determine whether 
there is any damage to it due to the insured incident. Any repairs necessary should  be 
completed in line with the policy terms and conditions.
Mr and Mrs D have said the contractors  caused  damage to their home during the repairs.  
When asked for more details of what this damage  was they explained that the contractor 
who had attended  to repair the banister had broken it first and glued it back  together. They  
provided a photograph of the end of the banister rail where it meets  what  appears to the new 
newel post. This photograph shows a slight gap between part of the banister rail and the 
adjoining wood  and some  flaked paint,  presumably caused when it was detached from the 
adjoining woodwork  that had been  replaced. Whilst I dont disbelieve  Mr and Mrs D when 
they say new damage was caused  to the banister, I cant see any damage caused  by the 
contractor. What work appears  to be needed  would  appear to be part of the decoration 
works yet to be completed. 
It has been put forward that the carpets on the stairs and first floor of the house were soiled 
during the repairs  as no protection  was put in place. Elite appears  to accept that is the case. 
Ref: DRN888392612It has offered to have  the carpets professionally  cleaned. Mr and Mrs D have said this is not 
sufficient and they want the carpets  replaced.  I would  explain that where an insurer or its 
representative causes  damage or completes inadequate repairs,  it is normal  procedure for it 
to be allowed to attempt  to redress the situation. The damage to the carpets is reported as 
soiling. In which case, I cant say that Elites suggestion of having the carpets  professionally  
cleaned is inappropriate  in the circumstances. 
Photographs of cracks in internal plaster and around woodwork were also recently  provided  
by Mr and Mrs D. All of this damage  is slight and internal and would be dealt with during the 
decorative stage of the repairs.  Given these repairs have  not happened  because 
Mr and Mrs D stopped  the repairs, it wouldnt be appropriate for me to criticise Elite for the 
damage remaining  at this stage. 
Mr and Mrs D have also provided photographs  of the old door and window when they were 
reinstated into the repaired wall. They have commented on the lack of fit and how the 
contractors got around this. I accept this is the case. However, as both the door and the 
window have subsequently been replaced,  there is clearly no further work needed in this 
respect.
This matter has clearly been  going on much longer than it should, but I dont think I can hold 
Elite entirely responsible  for that. I say this as where  it caused  delays, such as in trying to 
source suitable building materials, they were unavoidable. That said,  it hasnt completed all 
of the investigations it said it would and it declined to repair  Mr and Mrs Ds flooring on the 
ground floor, despite it being  accepted that issues had arisen during the incident that was 
subject of the claim. The issues  have clearly caused them  a lot of upset and some 
inconvenience, and I am mined to award them £750 in this regard.
my provisional decision
My provisional decision is that I am minded to partially uphold  this complaint. If my 
conclusions remain the same following any further  submissions from the parties, I will 
require Elite Insurance Company Limited  to:
arrange to repair/replace  the laminate flooring in the hall and kitchen to provide a 
continuous floor as it was before the claim;
arrange to repair/replace  the laminate flooring in the lounge;
arrange for an inspection of the upstairs floors to be undertaken and any repairs  
necessary to be completed; and
pay £750 for the upset and inconvenience its handling of the claim caused 
Mr and Mrs D.
I am satisfied that once  the remaining repairs and decorative works are completed, 
Mr and Mrs Ds carpets  should be professionally cleaned  as Elite has offered to arrange.

Dear Mr and Mrs [D]
your complaint about Elite Insurance Company Limited
Thank you for your response to my provisional  decision.
I would  firstly  explain  that just because there  is structural damage  to a property, it 
does not automatically  mean that a structural engineer  needs  to be involved in 
the assessment  of a claim. In the majority of cases  an experienced surveyor or 
building engineer is capable of completing the assessment and repair  schedule.
You have  commented  that the initial assessment of the damage  recommended 
that a structural engineer  be involved.  That is the case but not in relation to 
assessing the damage or creating the schedule of repairs. Initially  the damaged  
area of the property needed  to be supported to ensure it was safe and not in 
danger of collapse.  It was the design  for the temporary support that it was 
recommended an engineer be involved  in and that recommendation was 
followed.
I havent seen any evidence that indicates a structural engineer was needed to 
assess the damage or determine the repairs that were needed in this case. As 
such, I cant fault Elite for not employing a structural engineer in this case.
You have  raised  the issue of the patio doors at the rear of the property not fitting 
properly. You state that you believe this is due to the impact. This matter was 
raised some time ago with Elite and, when it had the window/door company in to 
measure the repaired front wall for a new window and door, they asked that it 
assess the patio  door.  The window company didnt consider  that the accident  had 
caused the problem with the patio doors. Rather  the problem had been caused by 
use over time and the doors simply needed adjusting.
It is common that UPVC doors  and windows will need some adjustment  over time 
due to use. I am also satisfied that a company that specialises in producing, 
installing and repairing such doors and windows would reasonably be considered 
an expert in their field. As such, I accept its opinion  that the problem with the 
patio doors  was not caused by the accident  and doesnt fall for Elite to repair.
In relation to the windows and doors throughout your home that you have now 
said dont shut with ease, this is the first mention I have seen of this issue. It 
doesnt appear to be something that has been  raised with Elite prior to you 
asking it to stop repairs. As it hasnt had the opportunity to assess  whether  there  
is a problem and if that problem is linked to the accident, it wouldnt be 
appropriate for me to comment on this issue at the present  time.  If you ask it to 
do so, it will likely assess this issue when it returns to the property to complete 
the floor inspection I said it should  do in my provisional decision.
You have  said that the door and window  that have been installed in the rebuilt wall are 
smaller than before. This has meant that there were gaps around the window and beneath  
the door that the business filled with a thick layer of putty of a different colour. You have 
Ref: DRN888392614also said the door is broken in the middle.  Youve pointed to the photographs you provided 
in May of this year to support this.
As I pointed out in my provisional  decision,  when the business  finished rebuilding  the front 
wall of your property, the apertures for the window and door were of a slightly  different size 
to those in the original wall. Elite temporarily reinstated the original door and window, with 
the associated  additional sealant to fill the gaps. This is clearly  the stage at which the 
photographs you have  provided where  taken. I say this as the boarding  used to secure the 
property during the rebuild of the wall is clearly present in one of the photographs.
However, in May 2018 it arranged for the above  mentioned window and door business  to 
measure up for permanent replacements that fitted  the new openings. Elite has said these 
were fitted  in June  2018 before you stopped  the repairs. However, if that is not the case  
and you prevented the fitting being  done, please  confirm that is the case.
Youve said the garage door needs  fixing as well as the roof. I have again referred back  to 
the business file and I note that the condition of the garage has previously been  raised  
with it. It arranged for the surveyor to inspect the garage, including the roof. It was 
suggested that neighbouring properties were  showing evidence  of the same issues  you 
were raising. The surveyor considered the damage  was due to the initial  settlement of the 
property, rather than the effect  of the accident. As there is no expert evidence  to call this 
finding into question, I cant  conclude  Elite has any liability under your insurance claim in 
this regard.
I note your comments regarding the wooden  floors, both upstairs and down. In my 
provisional decision I required  Elite to inspect the floor on the upper  floor, so I dont intend 
to comment further on that issue.
As for the ground floor, you have  said it is shown in the photographs  you have provided that 
the floors  have moved and the floorboards  are now flush with the radiator pipes. I have re-
examined the photographs you have  provided and whilst they evidence the movement of 
the laminate flooring, they dont evidence any movement in the underlying floorboards. In 
addition, I would note that it would be usual  for the hole in the floorboards  to be only slightly  
larger than the diameter of the pipe going to the radiator. As for the leak that occurred on 
one of the pipes,  the insurer appears to have  repaired it without question  and, given the 
laminate flooring had clearly moved due to the accident: that may well have been the cause 
of the damage,  rather than any movement to the underlying floorboards.
You have  said that you dont think the floor downstairs was properly inspected;  that you 
think the floorboards  should have been lifted. You are entitled to have an opinion about 
how the damage to your property was inspected,  but that doesnt mean you are right.  The 
surveyor and contractors  are experienced in what they do and in the absence of any 
expert evidence to say their assessments are wrong, I wont be asking Elite to do 
anything more.
With regard to the potential for damage to walls that are not accessible due to fitted  
furniture, unless there is evidence that indicates  there is damage behind  the furniture,  I 
wouldnt expect a business to undertake  investigations that might  cause damage to 
that furniture. The type of evidence that would  indicate further investigations might be 
warranted would be significant damage on the opposite side of the wall. You have 
given the example that you are concerned about the gable  wall in a first floor room.  If 
the exterior of that wall were  to evidence damage, which was likely to be mirrored 
Ref: DRN888392615internally, I would expect  an insurer to investigate further. However, the suspicion that 
there might be damage would not be sufficient reason. I havent  seen  any evidence 
that would indicate Elite needs to carry out further  investigation  of areas  obscured  by 
fitted furniture.
I note your comments about  the contractors telling you that the schedule  of works was an 
open one, but then refusing to do some things  you asked them so; saying that they were  
like it before the accident. I would explain that when repairs start on a claim like yours it 
isnt unusual to find additional  works that need doing. An example could be when the 
laminate flooring was removed in the hall, damage  to the floorboards  could have  been  
discovered. Whilst that wasnt the case,  if it had been, then the schedule  of works would 
have been expanded to cover the additional  damage without  the need to get authority from 
Elite. However, that doesnt mean that the contractors  should have included any work you 
asked to be done into the schedule. Only additional  works that were  clearly caused by the 
accident would be included. At present I havent seen any evidence  of Elite refusing to add 
damage clearly attributable to the accident  to the schedule  of repairs.
It is often the case that home-owners will notice faults with their home after an incident that 
they believe werent there before  the incident  and attribute them to the incident. However, 
it is not unusual  for it to be established that the faults were always there,  but not noticed  
the incident, whatever it was, then caused  the home-owner to actively  look for problems 
and identify existing  ones, rather than new ones. It would  appear that was the case with 
the patio doors at the rear of the property - the issue caused  by use and wear  appeared to 
you as a new one.
I note that you say you have no confidence in relying  on repairs  directed or completed by 
unqualified professionals. I am sorry you feel that way, but whilst the individuals who were  
involved with your claim were not structural engineers, that does not mean they werent 
appropriately qualified  to assess the claim or complete the rebuild  tasks.  Indeed, having 
looked at the qualifications of the individual who assessed the damage to the property and 
drew up the schedule of works - he is a fellow of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors 
 I cant accept  that he was not qualified to assess the damage caused to your home and 
the repairs needed.
You have  mentioned that you moved  your family  out of the property because of its 
condition and the effect it was having  on both mental  and physical wellbeing. In a situation  
where the works being done or condition of a property would have a detrimental  effect  on 
the health of those living there,  we would expect an insurer  to pay for alternative 
accommodation and any associated costs. Elite did this when  the structural  repairs  were  
being done. However, I am not persuaded Elite should pay for the costs of you having 
moved your family out of the property after the structural repairs  had been completed. The 
outstanding repairs  are of a mainly decorative nature and would not render a property 
uninhabitable.
Whilst I have considered all of the additional  issues  and points you raised  in response to 
my provisional decision, I am not persuaded to change it. There are some new issues you 
have mentioned, such as windows  being  stiff, which you can approach  Elite to consider. I 
would suggest  if you wish it to look at these matters you ask it to do so in advance of the 
inspection I have  already  said should  be done  being  arranged so as to limit the number of 
visits and inconvenience  to yourselves.
Ref: DRN888392616If you wish to make any further comment or provide any additional evidence before I 
reassess your complaint, please  reply  as soon as possible and in any event by 5 November 
2019, so I can progress  the complaint. If you are unable to do so, please  let [our 
investigator] know. 
Yours sincerely
