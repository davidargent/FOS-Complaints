The complaint
Mr and Mrs P complain that National Westminster Bank Plc caused delays with their 
mortgage. They missed the contractual completion date for their property purchase. They 
ask that NatWest compensates them for their costs related to this (about £25,000) and for 
their upset. Mr and Mrs P are represented by their solicitor.
What happened
NatWest issued a mortgage offer to Mr and Mrs P in January 2022. Mr and Mrs P 
exchanged contracts for their purchase in mid-February 2022 with an agreed completion 
date of 4 March 2022. After exchange, NatWests solicitor raised a query with NatWest as 
the property was in four titles. 
Mr and Mrs Ps representative says while NatWest accepted the property titles, it caused 
delays before doing so. Mr and Mrs P purchase completed on 9 March 2022 and they 
incurred costs due to the late completion, as well as suffering considerable worry. 
Our investigator said NatWest didnt know about the multiple titles until 22 February 2022, 
after contracts had been exchanged. It didnt agree to the completion date of 4 March 2022 
or give any guarantees this would be met. Our investigator said NatWest was entitled to 
check its security wasnt affected and it didnt cause any avoidable delays. Our investigator 
said NatWests offer of £200 compensation as a gesture of goodwill was fair.
Mr and Mrs Ps representation said on their behalf:
Hed sent documents to NatWests solicitor before exchange and no issues were raised 
about the number of titles.
4 March 2022 was a reasonable completion date, allowing reasonable time for NatWest 
to process the certificate of title and make funds available.
It should have only taken two to three working days to establish the titles didnt detract 
from the security.
The representative said NatWest acted too slowly and £200 wasnt fair compensation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs Ps purchase completed on 9 March 2022, instead of the contractual completion 
date of 4 March 2022. They incurred costs as a result. What I have to consider is whether 
this was due to errors or unreasonable delays by NatWest and if so what compensation (if 
any) is fair and reasonable.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the 
balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in 
light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances. 
A valuation of the security property was carried out in mid-December 2021. Initially, the 
valuer said the property wasnt suitable security. Issues included the amount of land, 
buildings additional to the main house and an occupant living in one of these buildings, as 
well as the valuer noting the property might be in multiple titles. The broker advising Mr and 
Mrs P provided information to the effect that the property was residential only and would be 
sold with vacant possession. NatWest was satisfied with this and the valuer issued a 
valuation report in early January 2022. 
Under the section of the valuation report headed does the proposed security include 
property on a separate site from the main dwelling or does it appear to comprise multiple 
titles? the valuer said it was understood that the property is held under more than one title 
and legal advisers should confirm. 
During the application process Mr and Mrs P had nominated solicitors that werent on 
NatWests panel. Solicitors satisfactory to NatWest were nominated on 7 January 2022. 
NatWest issued a mortgage offer on 10 January 2022. Completion of the mortgage was 
dependant on NatWest being satisfied with the property title. The representative says while 
NatWests standard instructions (to its own solicitor) required a report if the property was in 
more than three titles, he wasnt aware of this before Mr and Mrs P exchanged contracts. 
The solicitors acting for NatWest informed it on 22 February 2022 that the property was in 
four titles and asked it to confirm whether it would proceed. 
By this time Mr and Mrs P had exchanged contracts with a completion date of 4 March 2022. 
I can appreciate Mr and Mrs P were worried about meeting the completion date, or even if 
NatWest would complete the mortgage.
NatWest is entitled to make a commercial decision about its lending policy. It will lend when 
the security property has multiple titles provided certain conditions are met. There must be a 
clear report on title and confirmation from the valuer that the property is suitable security. 
Due to the number of titles here NatWests policy required the matter to be reviewed and 
agreed by an underwriter. 
NatWest says it escalated the issue to a senior underwriter and then to its legal department. 
The underwriter wanted the valuer to confirm that the property being in four titles wouldnt 
affect the value. NatWest raised a query with the valuer on 4 March 2022 (a Friday). The 
valuer asked for colour plans on 7 March 2022 (the next working day), which the solicitor 
provided the same day. The representative says the valuer could have responded more 
quickly, but I dont think I can fairly say that NatWest should (or could) have required the 
valuer to work at the weekend. The valuer said that provided the transfer included all four 
titles as described in the solicitors correspondence the valuation wasnt impacted. Funds 
were released on 9 March 2022. 
While the representative says NatWest had no regard to the urgency of completion, I think 
thats unfair. NatWests records suggest it did understand the matter was urgent, and it 
wanted to get an answer to Mr and Mrs P. It expedited release of funds when it received 
confirmations from the valuer and its solicitor.
The representative says the matter related to the four titles was straightforward, and 
NatWest could have given approval within a few days. Hes critical of NatWests processes, 
such as having centralised notes rather than direct communication between teams, and the 
solicitors not being able to speak directly to the underwriter making the decision. But I have to be fair to both parties. NatWest is entitled to put in place and follow internal processes. Its 
teams will also have been dealing with applications from other customers. 
Mr and Mrs Ps representative says NatWest could have dealt with the matter more quickly, 
and I understand the point he makes. But thats not the same as finding that NatWest 
caused unnecessary and unreasonable delays. 
Mr and Mrs P had agreed a completion date, and there was a cost to them if this was 
missed. This meant the matter was urgent for them. But NatWest wasnt told the property 
was in four titles until after contracts had been exchanged. I cant fairly say that NatWest 
should have waived its usual process or prioritised Mr and Mrs Ps application over other 
customers. I think, in fairness, that NatWest was entitled to review the title issue, take advice 
from its legal advisers and valuer and make a decision about whether it was happy with the 
security being offered. I dont think the time taken by NatWest to do this and release funds 
was unreasonable such as to make it fair and reasonable to require it to pay compensation 
to Mr and Mrs P for the costs associated with their late completion. 
I appreciate that the £200 offered by NatWest as a gesture of goodwill is significantly less 
than the amount of compensation Mr and Mrs P asked for, and they will be disappointed with 
my decision. But for the reasons Ive given, I dont think its fair and reasonable to require 
NatWest to pay compensation. I leave it to Mr and Mrs P to decide if they want to accept the 
£200 offered by NatWest as a gesture of goodwill (if it hasnt already been paid). 
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P and Mrs P to 
accept or reject my decision before 7 February 2023.
