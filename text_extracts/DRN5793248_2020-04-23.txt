K822xcomplaint
Mr M complains about two missed appointments  to collect a car when his hire agreement  
with Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Volkswagen Finance, ended.
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
adjudicator so I wont repeat them again  here. Instead Ill focus on giving  the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the adjudicator for these reasons:
Volkswagen Finance  had arranged for a third party  to collect the car on its behalf in 
January 2019  when  the hire agreement  ended  and there doesnt seem  to be any 
dispute that two appointments  to collect the car were missed  by the third party;
the car was collected from Mr M later that week and he has described  the distress  
and inconvenience  that he was caused by the missed  appointments;
he complained  to Volkswagen Finance and it apologised for the level of service that 
hed received and offered him six bottles of wine as a gesture of goodwill;
Mr M didnt consider that the offer of the wine was a suitable response to his 
complaint  but I consider  that it was well intentioned and was part of an apology  that 
was offered by Volkswagen Finance for the issues that hed experienced;
I consider that the distress and inconvenience that Mr M was caused by the two 
missed appointments  and the third appointment  justifies  some compensation and I 
sympathise with him for the issues that he was caused  but I agree with the 
adjudicator that £100 compensation is fair and reasonable  compensation in these 
circumstances;
Im not persuaded that the distress and inconvenience  that Mr M was caused and 
which hes described justifies a higher  award of compensation; and
Mr M has been charged for some excess mileage which he accepts and says that 
hes been incorrectly charged for some replacement tyres  by Volkswagen Finance  
but the issue about the charge for the tyres wasnt included  in his complaint to 
Volkswagen Finance  or this service so Im unable to consider it as part of this 
complaint  if he wants to complain  about the charge for the tyres he should  
complain to Volkswagen Finance about it (if he hasnt already done  so) and then, if 
hes not satisfied  with its response, he may be able to make  a separate  complaint to 
this service.
Ref: DRN57932482my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and I order  
Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited,  trading as Volkswagen Finance, to pay him 
£100 to compensate him for the distress  and inconvenience that he was caused:
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 May 2020.
