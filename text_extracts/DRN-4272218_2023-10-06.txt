The complaint
Mr H is unhappy with several aspects of the service he received from National Westminster 
Bank Plc (NatWest) surrounding a refinance arrangement. 
What happened
To briefly summarise: Mr H has two loans with NatWest both of which have been in a 
position of arrears for some time. Mr H agreed a refinance arrangement with NatWest in 
December 2021. The initial arrangement was dependent upon a six-month plan designed to 
demonstrate Mr Hs ability to pay, so as to provide NatWest with confidence that any 
subsequent longer arrangement would be viable and affordable for Mr H. 
Mr H successfully completed the initial six-month affordability arrangement in May 2022, at 
which time a further, longer-term refinance arrangement was supposed to be agreed 
between NatWest and himself. However, rather than contacting Mr H to discuss the further 
arrangement as they should have done, NatWest transferred Mr Hs accounts to a debt 
recovery agency (DRA). 
Mr H wasnt happy about this and contacted NatWest about it. NatWest responded to Mr H 
on 17 August 2022 and apologised for what had happened and arranged the recovery of the 
accounts from the DRA. NatWest also agreed to amend Mr Hs credit file for the months in 
question so that no incorrect adverse information was reported to it, and they also offered to 
make a payment of £150 to Mr H as compensation for the trouble and upset their mistake 
had caused. Finally, NatWest confirmed that once the accounts were brought back from the 
DRA that they would contact Mr H to discuss the further refinance arrangement. 
NatWest completed the recovery of Mr Hs accounts from the DRA on 12 September 2023. 
However, rather than contacting Mr H to discuss the refinance arrangement as should have 
been the case, they sent Mr H a text message asking him to repay the full balances of the 
two loans. Mr H wasnt happy about this, and he also wasnt happy that the compensation 
cheque hed received from NatWest wasnt for £150 as theyd promised but was only for 
£100. So, he raised a further complaint. 
NatWest responded to Mr H on 15 September 2022 and apologised for the error and said 
that he would be contacted by their refinance team in the near future. NatWest also arranged 
to cancel the £100 cheque that Mr H had received and to credit him with £150 as should 
have been the case. And NatWest also credited a further £100 to Mr H as compensation for 
the frustration and inconvenience hed incurred. 
On 16 September 2022, NatWest completed their refinance arrangement calculations and 
sent the details to Mr H for his review. Mr H wasnt happy with the proposed refinance 
arrangement and contacted NatWest about it on 23 September 2023. Specifically, Mr H was 
unhappy that £2,465.42  relating to the highest overdrawn balance on his NatWest current 
account in the three months preceding the original refinance arrangement in December 2021 
 wasnt included in the refinance proposal as hed been promised it would. And Mr H also 
felt that NatWest had calculated the total of his two loans incorrectly, quoting it as being 
£9,450 when in fact it should have been £9,050.
NatWest responded to Mr H on 8 December 2022 and confirmed that the total of his two 
loans was £9,450. NatWest also explained that when Mr H discussed the refinance 
arrangement with them in December 2021 that he had been incorrectly told that his highest 
overdrawn balance from the prior three months could be included. 
The correct information that Mr H should have been given was that the highest overdrawn 
during the 30 days prior to the December call could be included, which in Mr Hs instance 
was £1,180.45. However, NatWest also confirmed that because Mr H hadnt used his 
overdraft facility in the last 30 days before NatWest calculated the refinance proposal on 16 
September 2022, that as per their policies the refinance arrangement would only include the 
loan balances, and that Mr Hs overdraft facility would now be removed. 
NatWest apologised for the misinformation that Mr H had been given in December 2021, and 
they also apologised for contacting Mr H regarding repayment of one of his loans while his 
complaints with them were in place. NatWest also agreed to credit a further £250 to Mr H, in 
addition to the £250 he had previously received, and they confirmed that Mr H would now 
need to liaise with NatWests refinance team to secure the refinance arrangement that theyd 
proposed to him.
Mr H contacted NatWest again on 3 January 2023. Mr H explained that he was unhappy that 
NatWest had spelt his name wrong on their complaint response letter of 8 December 2023. 
NatWest apologised to Mr H for this and credited his account with £30 as compensation for 
the distress hed incurred as a result.
Mr H also explained to NatWest at that time that he no longer wanted to refinance his debts 
with them and wanted to continue with the original loan repayments. NatWest confirmed to 
Mr H that this would be possible, but that because loans were now in a position of significant 
arrears, as per the loan agreements  of approximately £4,000 and £2,600 respectively  
that an arrangement would need to be agreed for Mr H to clear those arrears alongside the 
regular loan payment amounts he would need to resume making. 
NatWest also confirmed that to come to any such arrears arrangement with Mr H, they would 
need to conduct an income an expenditure assessment with him to confirm the affordability 
of any potential arrangement. NatWest confirmed that theyd placed a two-week hold on the 
accounts to allow Mr H to contact them to conduct the income and expenditure assessment 
with them. Finally, NatWest explained that if Mr H did want to continue with the refinance 
option that the previous affordability arrangement that hed undertaken with them had now 
expired, meaning he would have to complete a new six-month affordability arrangement as 
hed done previously from December 2021 to May 2022. 
Mr H contacted NatWest again around that same time as he was unhappy that interest had 
been applied to his loans while the refinance arrangement remained unresolved. NatWest 
responded to Mr H on 5 January 2023 and confirmed that no interest had been accrued on 
either loan during the time that they had incorrectly been with the DRA  for the months 
June, July, and August 2022. But NatWest also confirmed that following the return of the 
accounts to NatWest in September, interest had resumed being applied to the outstanding 
balances in line with the terms of the loans and NatWests policies.
Mr H spoke with NatWest later in January and asked them to look at his complaints again as 
he was unhappy with the responses that hed received from them. Shortly afterwards, Mr H 
raised a further complaint with NatWest because he was unhappy that NatWest had called 
him about his outstanding loan balances while he had complaints outstanding with them that 
hed asked to be reopened. 
NatWest responded to Mr H in March 2023 and confirmed that his complaints had been reopened as hed requested but that the agent that hed spoken with hadnt applied a contact 
hold to his accounts as they should have done. NatWest apologised to Mr H for this and 
credited him with £50 as compensation for the upset and trouble hed incurred.
Finally, NatWest again contacted Mr H and confirmed that they stood by the responses to 
his complaints that had already been issued to him. Mr H wasnt satisfied with NatWests 
position on his complaints and so referred them to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at what had taken place. But they felt that the responses that 
NatWest had issued to Mr H already represented fair outcomes to all aspects of Mr Hs 
complaints. Mr H remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H has provided several detailed submissions to this service regarding his complaint. Id 
like to thank Mr H for these submissions, and I hope he doesnt consider it a discourtesy that 
I wont be responding in similar detail here. Instead, Ive focussed on what I consider to be 
the key aspects of this complaint, in line with this services role as an informal dispute 
resolution service. 
 
This means that if Mr H notes that I havent addressed a specific point hes raised, it 
shouldnt be taken from this that I havent considered that point  I can confirm that Ive read 
and considered all the submissions provided by both Mr H and NatWest. Rather, it should be 
taken that I have considered that point but that I dont feel it necessary to address it directly 
in this letter to arrive at what I consider to be a fair resolution to this complaint.
Its immediately notable that Mr H hasnt adhered to the repayment terms of his loan 
agreements with NatWest such that both loans are now in a position of significant arrears. 
Mr H had asked NatWest to agree to a refinance arrangement with him in December 2021. 
But its my understanding that, to date, over a year after NatWest sent the refinance 
proposal to NatWest in September 2022, Mr H hasnt agreed to a refinance arrangement 
with NatWest. 
Im aware that Mr H is unhappy with the refinance proposal put forwards by NatWest. But, 
having reviewed that proposal  which might reasonably no longer be available to Mr H due 
to the length of time that has now elapsed  Im satisfied that it was fair and that it accurately 
captured the loan balances that Mr H owed at that time.
Mr H was given incorrect information about the details of the refinance arrangement when he 
first spoke with NatWest in December 2021, specifically in reference to the potential 
inclusion of an overdraft balance. But it doesnt follow that because NatWest made a mistake 
and gave incorrect information to Mr H that they are duty bound to honour that incorrect 
information. And Im satisfied that the apology, explanation, and compensation that NatWest 
have already paid to Mr H about this matter fairly resolves this aspect of his complaint.
Ultimately, its for NatWest to set the terms of any refinance arrangement that theyre willing 
to offer. Mr H can choose to either accept the refinance arrangement proposed to him by 
NatWest or revert to the original terms of the loan. 
However, it must be noted that because Mr H hasnt been making monthly repayments to his 
loans for many months that both loans are now in significant arrears. And it also must be noted that it isnt the case that Mr H was absolved of his responsibility to repay the loans 
because he raised complaints about those loans with NatWest.
This means that, if Mr H does want to revert to the original loan terms and cant clear those 
arrears or come to an acceptable and affordable agreement with NatWest to repay them, 
that NatWest may be put into a position where they may have to consider defaulting Mr Hs 
loan accounts for non-payment. 
So, while NatWest have made several errors here, which theyve admitted to, Im satisfied 
that they have taken the necessary corrective action  such as recalling the accounts from 
the DRA and correcting Mr Hs credit file  such that no further action is fairly required of 
them. And Im also satisfied that the cumulative compensation of £580 that NatWest have 
paid to Mr H has fairly compensation him for any trouble and upset these individual errors 
may have caused him.
But I also feel that Mr H himself must also be considered responsible for the current position 
of the loan accounts, because he hasnt made payments in line with his contractual 
responsibilities to do so or accepted the refinance arrangement proposal put forwards by 
NatWest  which as previously explained Im satisfied was fair and reasonable.
I can therefore only encourage Mr H to contact NatWest to discuss his options with them, as 
per NatWests requirements. I realise this wont be the outcome Mr H was wanting. But I 
hope hell understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 November 2023.
