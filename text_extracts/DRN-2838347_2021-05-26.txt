The complaint
Mr F complains that he wasnt able to set up a repayment plan to clear his overdraft when 
National Westminster Bank Plc decided to close his account.
 
What happened
Mr F said NatWest decided to close his account, and it asked him to pay back his £5,000 
overdraft within 60 days. He said he wasnt complaining about the closure of his account. He 
was complaining because when he asked to set up a payment plan to pay the money back, 
NatWest said it couldnt do that. It just passed his account to debt collectors instead.
Mr F said that he hadnt decided to close the account, and he was happy to continue to pay
the amounts hed previously been paying to settle his debt. He said he wouldnt be in breach
of any of the agreements that he had with NatWest.
NatWest said it had given Mr F the benefit of the doubt, and accepted that he had rung, and
been passed to another department. But it couldnt find records of him trying to set up a
payment arrangement.
NatWest said that Mr Fs account was passed to the recoveries department because the
debt wasnt cleared by the time his account was closed on 29 January 2020. A default was
then placed on Mr Fs credit file. NatWest said that it had given Mr F 60 days notice of his
account closure. And Mr F could only have avoided a default by paying his debt in full within
those 60 days.
NatWest wanted to stress that overdrafts are repayable on demand, and that it had no
records of contact on its systems from Mr F after 6 November 2019, when it had told him it
was closing his account. But NatWest also said it had sent Mr F complaint responses in
November and in January.
Mr F said that he had rung NatWest. But when he rang, NatWest just passed him from
department to department. Mr F also said that NatWest had also denied receiving the letters
he sent. But he had showed NatWest that it had signed to say it received the letters he sent.
Ultimately Mr F said NatWest had told him it couldnt enter into a payment arrangement with
him, and it would just pass his debt to a collection agency. He thought that passing the debt
to a collection agency was unnecessary, and would damage his credit file.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said that although Mr F
hadnt been able to set up a payment plan with NatWest, the same actions wouldve been
taken even if he had spoken to the bank, because he wasnt able to pay his overdraft back
within 60 days. She thought that NatWests gift of a hamper provided a fair and reasonable
response to Mr Fs complaint of poor service.
Mr F didnt agree. He repeated that NatWest had told him to set up a repayment plan if he
couldnt pay within 60 days, but when he asked to do this, NatWest wouldnt. Mr F said
NatWest had managed to set up plans on the credit cards he held with them. But it said it
couldnt do the same for his overdraft, and it defaulted the debt instead.
Because no agreement was reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Mr F had a sizeable overdraft facility with NatWest, of £5,000. NatWest told us this 
was agreed in 2008. Although his usage of this facility varied, Mr F has only rarely 
been in credit since then.
Overdrafts are, as NatWest has said, repayable on demand. But I think its important 
to recognise that Mr F has made ongoing and extensive use of a very large overdraft 
facility, for over a decade.
The FCA has recently recognised that repeat use of overdraft facilities over a 
prolonged period of time can be a sign of financial difficulties, and it has put in place 
steps banks must follow to reduce ongoing reliance on overdrafts which have been in 
use for some time. I note those steps include particular circumstances in which its 
not appropriate just to remove the overdraft. Its not clear to me that NatWest 
satisfied itself that these circumstances did not exist here, before it closed Mr Fs 
account, and effectively removed his overdraft facility with 60 days notice.
And even if NatWest had taken steps to make sure that Mr Fs circumstances didnt
constitute actual or potential financial difficulties, I would still say that it was 
unreasonable for NatWest, having allowed Mr F to make extensive use of such a 
large overdraft facility for over a decade, to then ask Mr F to pay this overdraft off 
entirely, within 60 days. I think it must be likely that Mr F had become reliant on this 
facility, and for that reason I think that it was unreasonable for NatWest not to offer 
Mr F a repayment arrangement over a longer period, and then not to provide this 
when he requested such an arrangement.
I can see Mr F has repeatedly asked for an arrangement to pay off this debt. He 
hasnt been able to show us a record of the calls he said he made, but he has shown 
us three letters he sent to NatWest. And two of those were signed for by NatWest.
NatWest says that two of these letters were sent to the wrong part of NatWest, and 
may have been destroyed. It hasnt offered any explanation as to why they would be 
destroyed, rather than redirected to the right part of the bank. And NatWest cant 
explain why the third letter went unanswered.
Whilst this does appear to me to be poor service from NatWest, and must have been 
deeply frustrating for Mr F, this doesnt appear to have made a difference to the 
outcome of Mr Fs case. Thats because NatWest has been very clear that it would 
not offer Mr F any sort of a repayment arrangement. If he didnt pay in full within 60 
days, which we know he wasnt able to do, it would always have defaulted this debt, 
and passed it to recovery agents.
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont think that action was fair and reasonable in all 
the circumstances of this case. I think that NatWest shouldve responded to Mr Fs 
requests, and sought to reach an arrangement with Mr F, which would allow him to 
repay this debt over a short period of time, with no interest or other fees, and without 
defaulting his debt.Mr F might like to know that its usual for a default to be registered on a credit file 
once a debt is between three and six months in arrears. With that in mind, I think 
NatWest should now offer Mr F the following 
to remove the default on his credit file, and to give him six months from the 
date that my final decision in this case is accepted by Mr F to repay the 
outstanding overdraft on his personal account, with no interest and no 
requirement that the payments be made in regular instalments.
Mr F has told us that he would be able to pay in this time. I understand that he would 
prefer longer. But I dont think it would be consistent with the usual amount of time to 
pay which is given before a default is registered, to require NatWest to give him 
longer than six months.
My decision only requires NatWest to give Mr F six months to repay. If he isnt able to 
pay during this time, NatWest would then be able to default this debt again. So if Mr 
Fs position has changed at all recently, and he isnt in a position to pay off this debt 
within six months, he may be better off leaving the existing default in place, and 
discussing a longer-term agreement with NatWest to clear his debt.
Whether or not Mr F accepts this offer, I think that NatWest has still provided him with 
poor service when it decided to remove the overdraft on his account, and failed to 
respond to any of his communications about this. For that reason, I think that 
NatWest should pay Mr F £200 in compensation.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both sides responded.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr F confirmed that he was happy with my decision. And he said if this had been offered by
NatWest, he would not have made this complaint.
NatWest said it understood that I felt Mr F had a large overdraft for a considerable period of 
time and didnt feel it was fair to ask him to pay that back within sixty days.
NatWest referred to the reasons Mr Fs accounts were closed, which I dont need to set out 
here. (And I note Mr F didnt complain about this.) NatWest said when his account was 
closed it had asked for repayment within sixty days as per its terms and conditions, although 
the overdraft facility is repayable on demand. NatWest said it could not see that it had 
broken any terms and conditions.
NatWest said it was being asked to re-open an account for someone it had concerns
about. The process of recalling the account from the debt sale company and transferring the
account from Recoveries would be time consuming and onerous and would need a 
considerable amount of manual intervention. The account would need to be manually 
monitored during the period of six months Id allowed for Mr F to repay his debt.
NatWest said it was unsure where this defined period of six months has been derived from
as an account would normally be defaulted after three months of missed payments or 
arrears. It wanted clarification on that.NatWest also wanted me to give consideration to the events that have resulted in it
terminating banking facilities for Mr F. 
I think that there has been a misunderstanding on a key point of my decision. I am not 
asking NatWest to re-open an account for Mr F. I want NatWest to give Mr F time to repay 
the debt arising from his overdraft. NatWest doesnt have to reinstate that overdraft, provide 
Mr F with a bank card, an account, or any wider banking facilities. 
NatWest has said it has concerns about Mr Fs banking, which led it to terminate its 
relationship with him. But its clear that those concerns were never so significant that 
NatWest wasnt prepared to accept funds from Mr F to repay his overdraft. NatWest 
originally asked Mr F to pay the money back. And thats what my decision requires NatWest 
to do now  to let him pay the money back. Ill amend my decision to put this beyond doubt.
I think Ive already explained why I consider that NatWests actions, in inviting Mr F to set up 
a payment plan for this very longstanding debt then ignoring his efforts to do just that, were 
unfair and unreasonable. So I need to try to put Mr F in the position he wouldve been if that 
hadnt happened. Thats why I think NatWest should recall this debt, and remove the default.
I am allowing Mr F a modest amount of time to pay his debt. NatWest wanted to know why 
Id allowed six months. The ICOs Principles for the Reporting of Arrears, Arrangements and 
Defaults at Credit Reference Agencies states that the recording of a default may occur 
when you are 3 months in arrears, and normally by the time you are 6 months in arrears.  
I think its both fair and reasonable to use the same longstop for this arrangement as the ICO 
provides for a default, particularly as that same guidance says that If an arrangement is 
agreed [such as the agreement Mr F repeatedly tried to reach with NatWest] a default would 
not normally be registered unless the terms of that arrangement are broken.
I have considered NatWests objections, but I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the 
decision I originally proposed.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must offer Mr F a payment 
arrangement which removes the default on his credit file, and gives him six months from the 
date that my final decision in this case is accepted by Mr F to repay the outstanding debt 
arising from the overdraft on his personal account, with no interest and no requirement that 
the payments be made in regular instalments. Whether or not Mr F accepts that offer, 
National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr F £200 in compensation.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 June 2021.
