K822xcomplaint
Mr T complains that Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance  plc (RSA) is responsible  for poor 
service in connection with a home  emergency insurance policy.
background 
The Financial Ombudsman  Service treats  any complaint  about  a claim under an insurance 
policy as a complaint  against the insurer which was responsible  for dealing with claims.  In 
our final decisions we name that insurer but we dont name anyone else.
Mr T had a policy in the name of an insurance intermediary. He paid the yearly  premium by 
monthly instalments  of about £24.00.
RSA was the insurer responsible for dealing  with claims. Where I refer to RSA I include the 
intermediary and others insofar as I hold RSA responsible  for their actions.
The policy covered (among other  things)  repairs of Mr Ts central  heating  boiler  but not if it 
were beyond economic  repair (BER). 
On 5 July 2018 (during  an annual  service)  an engineer  found  that Mr Ts boiler needed  
repair. But RSA didnt  do the repair. And it didnt  visit again until two visits in October 2018. It 
concluded the boiler was BER. But it didnt tell Mr T that until after the policy  renewed  and 
the boiler broke down in January 2019.
Mr T complained that RSAs delay was responsible for the boiler becoming BER. In a final 
response letter in February 2019, RSA disagreed with that. But it said it was paying £100.00 
into Mr Ts account. Unhappy with that, Mr T brought his complaint to us.
Our adjudicator used  the name of the intermediary.  She recommended  that the complaint 
should be upheld  in part. She thought that there  had been a significant  delay in following up 
the repairs. Although  she couldnt say that the delay caused the further faults with the boiler, 
it did cause Mr T inconvenience.
She recommended that the intermediary  should pay Mr T  in addition to its payment of 
£100.00 in February  2019  - a further £100.00 compensation in recognition of the trouble and 
upset caused.  That is a total of £200.00.
RSA agreed with the adjudicators opinion.
Mr T disagreed and made some further  points. 
Our investigator treated the complaint  as against RSA. He recommended that the complaint 
should be upheld  in part. He still recommended that RSA should pay Mr T £200.00 for the 
delays throughout  the period of July 2018  to January 2019.
RSA agreed with the investigators opinion.
Mr T  with regret  - agreed  with the investigators opinion. He says, in summary, that:
He didnt receive renewal documents in December  2018. He thinks this was because  
RSA knew the boiler was BER.
Ref: DRN14089862The intermediary continued to debit his account monthly.
In January 2019 someone installed his new boiler  with the first years service free of 
charge.
On 2 May 2019 he cancelled the policy. RSA said it had paid the additional £100.00  
into his bank account. But it asked for a £215.00 cancellation fee and he made  a 
new complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The policy schedule for the year from 10 January  2018 records that Mr Ts boiler was over 
ten years  old. Ive noted its make and model.
The policy terms said that the annual service was separate  from the contract of insurance.  
But it said that if the annual service found  any faults they would  be dealt with under the 
insurance. I find it implicit that the engineer  would  either deal with the faults during the same 
visit or report  them promptly.
The policy defined an economic repair as one where  the cost of parts including VAT should 
not exceed 75% of the price of the same or a similar make and model to the boiler on cover.
The engineer who did the service in July 2018  reported as follows:
expansion vessel  gone, prv letting by.
From that I find that the expansion  vessel had failed and the pressure release valve (PRV)  
was leaking. 
But the engineer didnt  report  to RSA until 14 October 2018. Another engineer visited  on 17 
October 2018. He found an additional issue with the heat exchanger.
On 30 October 2018 there was an inspection by an engineer from the maker of the boiler.  It 
reported to RSA that the boiler needed parts namely the heat exchanger,  expansion vessel, 
PRV, filling  loop, heat gasket, trap and condensate hose. The total of its prices for these was 
£1,111.26. Of that, the largest  item was the heat exchanger at almost  £700.00.
RSA decided the boiler was BER. However,  RSA didnt communicate with Mr T about this.
RSA wasnt going  to repair the boiler.  But the policy continued to cover, for example, other 
parts of the central  heating  system, home electrics and plumbing and drainage. So I dont 
find it fair to direct  RSA to refund the instalments Mr T continued to pay.
Ive seen a renewal letter addressed to Mr T dated  19 December 2018. I accept his 
statement that he didnt  receive it. But there may have been problems with a third party 
delivery service. So I dont find that RSA didnt send it. The policy renewed on 10 January 
2019. 
On 21 January 2019, Mr T called for help as the boiler had stopped working. At that stage,  
RSA told him the boiler was BER. Mr T complained.  And I can quite understand his strong  
feeling that RSA had neglected his boiler and probably caused  it to fail.
Ref: DRN14089863But theres not enough technical evidence for me to say that the failure to replace the 
expansion vessel and PRV in July 2018  caused the failure of the heat exchanger.
Mr T got a new boiler. He hasnt shown us its price.  And he hasnt argued that the £1,111.26  
cost of parts for the old boiler exceeded 75% of the price of a similar boiler. So Im satisfied 
that RSA correctly decided that the old boiler  was BER. So I dont find it fair and reasonable 
to direct RSA to reimburse any part of the cost of the new boiler.
From about  8 February 2019 the monthly instalments increased to about £27.00.  And by 
May 2019 Mr T had cancelled the policy and complained about a cancellation  fee. But those 
matters came after the complaint he made  to RSA in January 2019,  to which it gave  its final 
response on 8 February 2019. So it wouldnt be fair for me to deal with the later issues in this 
final decision.
Overall, I find RSA is responsible for delay and poor communication. Whilst Im not 
persuaded that this caused  Mr T a financial loss, I dont doubt  that it caused  him extra  
distress and inconvenience particularly in January 2019. I agree with the adjudicator and the 
investigator that its fair that RSA should  pay Mr T a total of £200.00 compensation for this. 
And I understand that it had done  so by May 2019.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc to pay Mr T  in addition  to its payment of £100.00  
in February 2019  - a further  £100.00 compensation for distress  and inconvenience  insofar  as 
it hasnt already paid that.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2020.
