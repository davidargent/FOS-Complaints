The complaint
Mr P complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that hes paid for some holiday products. Hes being 
represented in his complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr P entered into an agreement for a trial membership of a holiday club in July 2010. The 
price of the trial membership was £3,995, he made a payment of £495 and entered into a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of £3,500. He agreed to 
make 36 monthly repayments of £126.32 to Barclays Partner Finance. 
Mr P traded in the trial membership in March 2011 and he and his partner entered into an 
acquisition agreement to buy some holiday club membership points. The price of the 
membership points was £23,805 and the trial membership was given a trade-in value of 
£5,995 so the amount due from them was £17,810. Mr P entered into a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of £20,806, which included consolidation 
of £2,996 that he owed under the July 2010 loan. He agreed to make 180 monthly 
repayments of £311.20 to Barclays Partner Finance. 
Mr P and his partner upgraded their membership in August 2011 when they entered into an 
acquisition agreement to buy some more holiday club membership points. The price of the 
additional points was £10,133 and Mr P entered into another fixed sum loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount. He agreed to make 180 monthly 
repayments of a further £152.06 to Barclays Partner Finance.
Mr Ps representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in April 2018, including a 
claim for misrepresentation under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It also said 
that the misrepresentations and practices in the sales presentation made the loan 
agreements unfair under section 140A of the same Act and that no proper assessment of 
Mr Ps creditworthiness was conducted before the loans were made to him.
Barclays Partner Finance issued a detailed response in which it set out the reasons that it 
didnt consider that those claims should be upheld, including that: the products werent mis-
sold; the debtor-creditor-supplier relationship required for a claim under section 75 wasnt 
present; Mr P was out of time to make his complaint; and only a court can make an order if it 
finds that the relationship between Mr P and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair. Mr P 
wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ps complaint should be upheld. She said that the 
information that this service had suggested that there was a debtor-creditor-supplier 
relationship but she thought that Mr P was outside of the time limits to make a claim under 
section 75. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between 
Mr P and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would 
reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She also said that there was nothing to 
suggest that Barclays Partner Finance lent to Mr P unfairly.
Mr Ps representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided evidence showing that Mr Ps relationship with Barclays Partner 
Finance is still in existence so it says that the six years limitation period hasnt started yet 
and Mr Ps complaint isnt statute barred. It also says that Mr P wouldnt have been aware 
that he had an actionable claim until he took legal advice in late 2016 and couldnt be 
expected to have been aware that the length of the term of the membership was unlawful  
so it says that the time limit is extended under section 32 of the Limitation Act 1980. It has 
also provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ps complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ps complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that hed 
made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to his 
claims;
Mr Ps claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ps claim under section 75 is that the holiday products were misrepresented to 
him and his partner and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr P could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his 
partner into buying the holiday products in August 2011 as that was when they 
upgraded their points membership and was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made to them and that was also the latest time 
that any loss would have been incurred as that was when Mr P also entered into his 
third loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made 
to Barclays Partner Finance until April 2018, more than six years later so was outside 
of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and I consider that his 
misrepresentation claim is now time-barred;
Mr Ps representative says that Mr P only became aware that he could make a 
misrepresentation claim to Barclays Partner Finance after he took legal advice in late 
2016  but when he had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist him for the 
purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of 
that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the 
cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to 
Mr Ps claims;
Mr Ps representative says that information was deliberately concealed from Mr P so 
the time limits are postponed under section 32 - section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact 
relevant to the debtors right of action has been deliberately concealed from them, 
the period of limitation doesnt begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment 
or it could with reasonable diligence have been discovered by them  and section 
32(2) says that deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be 
discovered for some time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in 
the breach;
Mr Ps representative has referred to an overseas court judgment about the legality 
of timeshare contracts in perpetuity and says that the purchase being unlawful and 
that he could exit the membership by giving 28 days notice was deliberately 
concealed from Mr P  but Mr P entered into the agreements between July 2010 and 
August 2011 and that judgment wasnt declared until 2015;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
deliberate concealment of any relevant information in these circumstances so I dont 
consider that section 32 is applicable in these circumstances; 
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract or any applicable laws or regulations for which Barclays Partner Finance 
would be liable in these circumstances;
Mr Ps representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr P and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Mr Ps representative has provided account statements showing that Mr Ps loan 
accounts were still open in September 2021 and April 2022 so I dont consider that 
Mr Ps claim under section 140A is time-barred;
Mr Ps representative has provided statements showing the ways in which it says that 
the holiday products were misrepresented to Mr P  but those statements are generic 
and incomplete;
Mr M signed documents including the trial membership agreement, the terms and 
conditions, a members declaration, a credit application and the loan agreement in July 2010; he and his partner then signed documents including an acquisition 
agreement, the terms and conditions, a separate standard form of the withdrawal 
notice that could be given, a members declaration and an information statement and 
Mr P signed a credit application, a consolidation statement and the loan agreement in 
March 2011; and Mr P and his partner signed documents including another 
acquisition agreement, the terms and conditions, a separate standard form of the 
withdrawal notice that could be given, a members declaration and an information 
statement and Mr P signed the loan agreement in August 2011;
having carefully considered the statements provided by Mr Ps representative, all of 
those documents and the other available evidence, Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the holiday products were misrepresented to Mr P and 
his partner;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr P was unduly 
pressurised into buying the trial membership in July 2010 or that Mr P and his partner 
were unduly pressurised into buying the membership points in March and August 
2011  nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr P was 
unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreements or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr P complained to Barclays Partner Finance 
about the sales practices used by the holiday company until April 2018 and I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained to Barclays Partner 
Finance about any such issues much sooner after hed entered into the agreements;
Mr P had signed separate standard forms of the withdrawal notice that could be 
given to withdraw from the purchases and, if he was concerned about the way that 
the products had been sold and didnt want to buy them, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have exercised his right to withdraw from the 
agreements  but Ive seen no evidence to show that he contacted the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance within any applicable withdrawal periods about 
withdrawing from them;
Mr P had entered into the trial membership agreement in July 2010 and an 
acquisition agreement in March 2011  if he was concerned about the way that those 
products had been sold to him I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him 
not to have entered into an agreement to buy more membership points in August 
2011;
Mr Ps representative says that no proper assessment of Mr Ps creditworthiness was 
conducted before the loans were made to him  but Barclays Partner Finance has 
provided copies of the credit applications that were made by Mr P in July 2010 and 
March 2011;
in July 2010 he declared that he was an employed homeowner and Ive not been 
provided with any evidence to show that he couldnt afford to make monthly 
payments of £126.32 for the trial membership;
in March 2011 he declared an annual employment income of £60,000 and an annual 
pension income of £34,000 and I consider that it would have been reasonable for 
Barclays Partner Finance to have concluded at that time that he could afford a loan 
with monthly repayments of £311.20;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that there had been material 
changes to Mr Ps financial situation between March and August 2011 and the loan 
account statements show that Mr P has continued to make the monthly repayments 
on his two outstanding loans;Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr P contacted Barclays Partner Finance about 
any issues with the affordability of the loan agreements or the credit assessments 
that had been conducted until his representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance 
in April 2018  if Mr P was concerned about any of those issues I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect him to have conducted Barclays Partner Finance 
before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loans werent 
affordable for Mr P when they were made to him;
Mr Ps representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company but Im not persuaded that it shows that Mr Ps relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Ps relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr P and Barclays 
Partner Finance in these circumstances;
I consider that Barclays Partner Finances response to Mr Ps claims in June 2018 
was fair and reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr P for the issues that he and his partner have had with their 
holiday products, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr P any of 
the money that hes paid under the loan agreements, to pay him any compensation 
or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 May 2023.
