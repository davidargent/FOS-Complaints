K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc removed  money  from his account 
without warning him, leaving him in an unarranged overdraft, and defamed his character.
background
In July 2018 over £15,000 was mistakenly paid into Mr Bs NatWest  current account  by a 
third party. He says he did not report it because he did not think he needed to. He says he 
had previously written to the third party to ask for refunds totalling about  £25, so he assumed 
that the refunds had been sent but that the wrong  figures had been entered.  He expected 
that this error would soon be identified and corrected. But when nothing  had happened four 
days later,  he says he opened a savings account and transferred all of the money there  for 
safekeeping, so he wouldnt accidentally spend any of it. He insists that he always  intended 
to return this money to its rightful owner  as soon as someone asked  him to.
NatWest says that the savings account  was actually opened the next day, not four days 
later, and it was opened in Mr Bs girlfriends  name, not his own. (But both parties agree that 
the money was paid into that account on the fourth day.)
Nothing happened after that until September, when  the third party  discovered  that it had paid 
the wrong person and asked its own bank  to get its money back. That bank contacted  
NatWest, and NatWest debited over £1,750 from Mr Bs account, leaving it in an unarranged 
overdraft. As a result, he was charged some fees. At the same time,  the bank wrote  a letter  
to Mr B telling him what it had done, but Mr B says he did not receive  that letter until five 
days later.  In the meantime, when he discovered  the money had been taken from his 
account he assumed  he had been  a victim  of fraud.  He visited a branch of NatWest,  with his 
girlfriend, and on that visit the money  was transferred from the savings account to Mr Bs 
account with a building society. (The branch staff did not check  their internal system notes 
and so they did not tell Mr B that the money  had actually been  taken by NatWest.) On the 
fourth day after the money was taken, NatWest told Mr B on the phone  what  had happened, 
and he lodged a complaint.
NatWest asked for Mr B to return the rest of the money, so that it could return it to the third 
partys account. But Mr B refused to do that until NatWest first returned  the money it had 
taken from his current account. NatWest would not do that, and told Mr B that when he 
returned the balance of the money  which he had already admitted was not his  it would  
waive or refund the overdraft charges and restore his account  to its original position. Neither 
party has budged  from its stance since then. On 1 October, NatWest sent Mr B its final 
response letter, which included this sentence: Once  you have become aware  that the owner 
of the funds was requesting the money  back, you have  then moved the funds out of 
NatWest, so we are unable to return them. Mr B complains that this is defamatory. He 
brought this complaint to our Service in November, shortly after NatWest  closed his account. 
He asked for proof that NatWest had returned  the £1,750 to the third party.
Our investigator did not uphold this complaint. He accepted that Mr B had moved the funds 
away from NatWest only because he thought his account had been  compromised by 
fraudsters. But he said NatWest had complied with its terms and conditions, and he 
accepted that if Mr B had just returned  the rest of the money,  then NatWest  would have  
restored his current account to its original position.  He didnt think  NatWest  had to prove 
what it had done  with the money. 
Ref: DRN98692062Mr B did not accept that decision. He said it was up to him, not NatWest, to decide if he 
should overdraw  on his account.  He said NatWest had damaged his credit  rating  by 
recording the overdraft  on his credit file; he asked  for this information to be removed. He said 
that the debt should not have been  passed to collections while it was still in dispute.  He said 
he had instructed lawyers  to bring court proceedings against  NatWest for defamation, in 
relation to the sentence  I have quoted  above.  He asked for an ombudsman to review  this 
case.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I do not uphold it. I will explain why.
Before I do that, I will say that I am not considering Mr Bs complaint about  the allegedly  
defamatory sentence in NatWests letter, because it will be the subject of court  proceedings. 
So I think that issue is best left to the court to decide.
It is not in dispute  that the £15,000  does not belong to Mr B. He says he would have 
returned it if he had been asked for it. I dont believe him, because even when nobody  had 
claimed it for two months, he continued to hold onto it. He never  got in touch  with its rightful 
owner, or with NatWest. So I think he was just trying to keep it for himself and hoping that 
nobody would notice.  None of his actions  in the 17 months since  September  2018 have 
done anything  to dispel that impression.
I dont know whether NatWests letter in September  was sent by first or second class post, 
so I dont know how likely it is that it took five days to arrive.  So I will give Mr B the benefit of 
the doubt about that, and presume  that he transferred the money away from NatWest 
because he thought his account had been  raided by a fraudster. Its a plausible  explanation. 
But when NatWest  told him that it had taken the money and why, any honest person  would  
have immediately returned the balance  to NatWest. It was completely unreasonable  of Mr B 
to withhold money which  he knew did not belong to him, and his decision to do so fatally  
compromises the credibility of his assertion that he always intended it give it back, and that 
he only moved it to the savings account in July to keep it safe.
Mr Bs case  is that he has always been willing, and still remains willing, to return all of the 
money to NatWest, just as soon as NatWest returns the £1,750 it took from him. I find that 
implausible, but even if I took a different view about  that, I would still find it to be wholly 
unreasonable to blackmail NatWest like that. There is no reason at all why he cannot  just 
return the difference between what was wrongly  credited to his account and what NatWest  
took. NatWest cannot be faulted for standing  its ground. If it did as Mr B asks, which of 
course it is under no obligation to do, then it would just be risking its own money  with no 
guarantee that it would  ever see a penny of the £15,000 which  remains in Mr Bs 
possession. No responsible bank would  agree  to such an outrageous demand.
I am entirely  satisfied that NatWest was fully entitled to remove the money from Mr Bs 
account, notwithstanding that it left the account  overdrawn. Paragraph 8.3 of the accounts  
terms and conditions say:
We may take a payment from your account if the payers  bank tells us that this 
payment was sent to you incorrectly. If this happens, well hold the money  and 
contact you to tell you whats happened. Well ask you to confirm if the payment was 
sent to you incorrectly. If the payment was sent incorrectly then well return it to the 
payer. If you tell us that the payment was not sent incorrectly then well return the 
Ref: DRN98692063money to you but we may have to pass your contact details on to the payers bank.  If 
we cant get in touch with you within 15 business days, then well return  the payment 
to the payer.
If the payment is a CHAPS payment, well ask you before we take the payment  from
your account.
The credit was not a CHAPS payment,  so the first and last sentences, taken  together, mean 
that NatWest can take the payment from its customers  account without telling him first. The 
second sentence also envisages telling  the customer afterwards, as does the fifth sentence. 
I dont think that paragraph is unreasonable. NatWest complied with its obligations under 
that paragraph by sending  Mr B its letter in September.  It offered  to cancel any charges once 
Mr B returned the money, so I dont  think  there  would have been any significant impact on 
him if hed just done that. That would have avoided  the debt being sent to collections, and 
the markers  on his credit  file. NatWest is entitled to record Mr Bs debt to it on his credit file.
Finally, I dont think its reasonable  for Mr B to demand proof of what NatWest did with the 
money. That is a matter between NatWest  and the other bank, but I have no reason to doubt  
that NatWest did what  it was supposed  to do. Also, NatWest does not have to pass  Mr Bs 
details to the third party  whose  money  it is so that they can deal with each other directly, 
because it is the responsibility of both banks to resolve this matter themselves.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 March  2020.
