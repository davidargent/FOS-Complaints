The complaint
Mr K complains about excess mileage he was charged for, by Lex Autolease Ltd (LA), after
he took the decision to return (early) a car that he had hired from it.
What happened
In August 2019 Mr K entered into a hire agreement (regulated by the Consumer Credit Act
1974) with LA for a car. The (minimum) hire period was set at 36 months with the annual
mileage set at 10,000 (excess chargeable at 14.3 pence per mile excluding VAT and
17.16 pence per mile including VAT) and the monthly rental cost set at £359.04.
In February 2021 the hire agreement was amended (with both parties agreement). Under
this amendment the (minimum) hire period was set at 24 months with the annual mileage set
at 5,500 (excess chargeable at 11 pence per mile excluding VAT and 13.2 pence per mile
including VAT) and the monthly rental cost set at £371.91.
In June 2021 Mr K contacted LA to discuss early terminating the hire agreement and the
cost of doing so.
In June 2021 LA sent Mr K an early termination quote. This outlined that the following
payments were payable by Mr K if he was to terminate the hire agreement on, or before,
15 June 2021:
early termination fee (including VAT) £371.91^
indicative excess mileage charge (excluding VAT) £128.92*
^ calculated on the basis of two monthly rentals remaining of £371.91 x 50%
* 1,172 miles x 11 pence
Mr K says he went ahead with the early termination of the hire agreement on the
understanding that he would be required to pay LA £371.91, nothing more.
On 7 June 2021 LA sent Mr K two invoices. One for £371.92 (including VAT) in respect of
the early termination fee and one for £142.94 (including VAT) in respect of excess mileage
(1,083 miles x 13.2 pence).
Both invoices said payment would be taken by direct debit on 22 June 2021.
On 22 June 2021 LA collected from Mr Ks bank account (by direct debit) the sum of
£371.92.
Initially Mr K submitted to our service that after LA collected £371.92 from his bank account it
then went on to collect £142.94 from it. And this caused him to:
go overdrawn
have to pay money into his bank account from another source (so as to bring it back
into credit)
have to raise a direct debit indemnity claim
However, when it was pointed out to Mr K that the above wasnt reflected in the bank
statements he had provided our service, he said that as far as he could recall LA did take
£142.94 from his bank account and maybe this wasnt reflected in his bank statements
because he acted quickly to rectify matters. But in any event, this particular matter had
caused him unnecessary stress and hassle.
On 27 July 2021 LA issued Mr K with a final response letter (FRL). Under cover of this FRL
LA said it accepted that it hadnt been as clear as it could have been in its communications
about the full cost of early termination, this being made up of an early termination fee
(50% of the remaining monthly rentals) and an excess mileage charge (pro-rated). And for
this it was prepared to reduce the excess mileage charge of £142.94 it was seeking the
payment of by £72 to £70.94.
In August 2021, and unhappy with LAs FRL, Mr K referred matters to our service.
Mr Ks complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that LAs
offer of a £72 reduction in the excess milage charge sum it was seeking from Mr K was, in all
the circumstances, fair and reasonable.
Mr K didnt agree with the investigators view, so it was passed to me for review and
decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in September 2022. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Mr K has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their
entirety. However, I trust that Mr K will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The purpose
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
I accept that the information provided to Mr K by LA, both over the phone and in writing,
wasnt as clear as it could have been. So, with this in mind, Ive gone on to consider what (if
anything) LA should have to do to fairly compensate Mr K.
Where someone has acted in good faith on what they understood something to be (because
it was misrepresented to them or not made clear to them), the appropriate remedy isnt to
put them in the position they would be in if their understanding had been correct, but the
position they would have been in had there been no misrepresentation or where things had
been explained clearly to them.
Now had LA made clear to Mr K the cost of early termination its my understanding (based
on what Mr K has said and submitted) that he would have done one of two things.
He would have terminated the hire agreement on the amended 24 minimum hire period
coming to an end or terminated it early on the date he actually did so.Had Mr K opted to terminate the hire agreement on the amended 24 minimum hire period
coming to an end then, and on the assumption he added no further miles to the cars
odometer, he wouldnt have been required to pay LA an excess milage charge of £142.94, or
an early termination fee of £371.92. However, he would have been obliged to pay LA two
further monthly rentals of £371.92 totalling £743.84. So, this option (everything else being
equal) would have been more costly and one, in my view, that would have been unattractive
to Mr K and one he wouldnt have exercised.
Therefore, in my view, it follows that had LA made it clear to Mr K the cost of early
termination he would have still gone ahead and early terminated and on the date he did so,
but without the stress and hassle he said he suffered.
Now Im satisfied that Mr K should be appropriately compensated for the stress and hassle
he said he suffered. But taking everything into account Im satisfied that LAs offer of a
charge reduction of £72 is, in all the circumstances, sufficient.
For the sake of completeness, Ive also considered whether LA has ended up being
disproportionately compensated by allowing early termination of the hire agreement and
seeking from Mr K the sum of £514.86.
Ive obtained valuations from the Glasss market guide. The approximate market value for
Mr Ks car had the hire agreement run its intended full term and Mr K had driven 11,000
miles was £22,000. The approximate market value for Mr Ks car when it was actually
returned and had been driven 10,998 miles was £20,230.
Whilst this might be surprising its likely the surge in price is due to a number of reasons
causing a rise in used car sales in 2021 which has led to an increase in prices for used cars.
This approximate trade value is £1,770 less than LA would have likely expected to receive
had the hire agreement run full term.
Had the hire agreement run its intended full term (with Mr K having driven 11,000 miles) LA,
in my view, wouldve received or wouldve expected to receive, £22,743.84 (a likely sale
price of £22,000 plus two further monthly rentals totalling £743.84).
With the hire agreement being terminated around two months early LA, in my view,
wouldve received or wouldve expected to receive £20,744.86 (a likely sale price of £20,230,
an early termination fee of £371.92 plus £142.94 excess mileage charge).
So, given what I say above, Im satisfied that by allowing early termination of the hire
agreement and deciding to seek the sum of £514.86 from Mr K, LA hasnt benefited
financially. 
Neither party responded to my provisional findings by the date I gave.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given neither party responded to my provisional findings I see no good reason to depart 
from them and I now confirm them as final.My final decision
My final decision is that Lex Autolease Ltd must stand by its offer to reduce the
excess milage charge its seeking the payment of from Mr K by £72, but it need do nothing
further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 November 2022.
