K821x#15complaint
Ms S complains  that NewDay Ltd wont refund her money  that was taken  out as cash 
advances (which Ill refer to as withdrawals  for ease). Shes  later complained  about  spending  
using her NewDay card as well. Ms S says that she didnt draw any money out or use the 
card to buy things. All of this happened  in 2017. And shes struggled to pay the interest and 
charges that NewDay has applied to her account because  of this.
summary
Having issued a provisional decision on this complaint,  we got further  information   first from 
Ms S, then NewDay.
In light of this new information Im now telling NewDay:
It doesnt have to refund any of the money  Ms S says she didnt withdraw or spend using 
her credit card;
To pay Ms S £200 for the poor service shes received;
To remove the default from Ms S credit record; and
To actively engage  with Ms S to agree a mutually acceptable repayment plan for the 
money she owes  and, for the avoidance of doubt, this also requires Ms S to actively  
engage with New Day.
background
how weve got to where  we are now
When this complaint first came to us (and NewDay), Ms S just said she hadnt  made  any 
withdrawals using her card. Our investigator thought NewDay  should refund  the money. 
NewDay didnt agree  so it asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint.
I did this and issued  a provisional  decision in December  2019. I didnt agree with our 
investigator. I didnt  think NewDay  had to refund Ms S. I thought  it strange Ms S had used 
the card for genuine spending between  the ATM withdrawals she was complaining  about. 
But I did think it hadnt given Ms S very good service. So I said I was minded to tell NewDay 
to remove the default  it had recorded on Ms S credit file and to pay her £200  for the poor 
service.
Ms S didnt agree with my provisional  decision.  In her reply  she said that she hadnt used her 
card to buy things between the withdrawals. So I asked  NewDay to investigate  this before 
coming to a final decision on both matters.
NewDay looked into things but  like the withdrawals  it thought Ms S was responsible for 
the spending. Weve asked Ms S if she has anything  further to add to what  NewDay  has 
said. But shes said she cant think of anything more.
So, Ive now got to the stage where I can issue a decision on both the withdrawals and the 
spending carried out using Ms S NewDay card.
what happened
Ref: DRN35520112Ill keep this section  as short as I can. A lot of detail about the withdrawals was set out in my 
provisional decision. I wont repeat all that here  as both Ms S and NewDay have had that 
decision. A brief summary is:
Ms S contacted NewDay at the end of August when she saw £150 had been withdrawn 
(from ATMs over three occasions)  using her credit card;
She says she didnt withdraw the money and asked NewDay to help her;
There was some confusion over what Ms S was asking NewDay to do  it thought Ms S 
was saying  there was a problem with the transactions  and wanted it to try and get the 
money back  (presumably from a retailer);
NewDay  sent Ms S a form to fill in  so it could investigate things for her;
Ms S says she sent the completed form back  but NewDay didnt get it (weve seen a 
certificate of posting which appears  to cover the form);
After some time, Ms S chased the matter up and NewDay  sent Ms S a second form to fill 
in;
Ms S sent the second  completed  form back early  in 2018  but, again, NewDay didnt get 
it (again, weve seen a certificate of posting  which appears to cover  the form);
When Ms S chased NewDay  again, it said it hadnt received either form and it was now 
too late for it to help her (due to the time limits that apply  to trying to get refunds);
By now,  Ms S was struggling  to make payments on her account   and because she 
thought NewDay  should do more to help her  she stopped  making payments; and
In May 2018 NewDay defaulted Ms S account.
Ms S wasnt happy with NewDays  response. So she contacted us and one of our 
investigators looked into things for her.
Its fair to say our investigator had great difficulty in getting as much information out of 
NewDay as wed like. Based on what was available,  he concluded NewDay should:
refund the withdrawals (although it wasnt entirely clear whether two or three withdrawals  
were being disputed);
rework Ms S account and remove any interest  and charges in respect  of the withdrawals;  
and
pay Ms S £100  for the distress and inconvenience shed suffered.
In coming to this conclusion, the investigator referred to the requirements of the Payment 
Service Regulations 2009 (the PSRs)  and the Consumer Credit Act 1974  (the CCA). These 
cover when a financial  business can hold a customer responsible for transactions like these.
The investigator said the CCA was particularly relevant as it meant NewDay couldnt hold 
Ms S responsible for the withdrawals on the grounds that shed  been  grossly negligent in not 
keeping her credit card (and PIN) safe. When a credit card is used it is counted as being  a 
credit token for the purposes of the CCA. And that restricts the liability  NewDay  can impose 
on Ms S.
Ref: DRN35520113NewDay didnt agree with the investigators conclusions. It said Ms S hadnt sent the form(s) 
back in time and its records showed Ms S credit card was being used between the disputed 
withdrawals.
The investigator didnt  respond to NewDays points  but  as it hadnt agreed  with his 
conclusions  said the complaint should  be referred  to an ombudsman  to review  and issue a 
final decision  on.
my provisional findings and provisional decision
Again, Ill keep this section as short as I can.
I wasnt satisfied wed investigated  the points made by NewDay   in particular the fact that 
Ms S appeared to have  been using her credit card for genuine  spending between  the times 
she said it was used  fraudulently to make the ATM  withdrawals. Nor had we considered 
what  if any  action  might be needed  now that Ms S account had been defaulted.
I could see Ms S felt quite  strongly  about  whatd happened here.  That was clear  from what  
she had said to us and to NewDay. And thats not surprising.  £150  was taken out as cash   
and Ms S was being charged interest  on that money. She was struggling  to keep up 
payments on her account. As she wasnt able to do this her account was defaulted by 
NewDay. That will have  an impact  on her for some time. So Ms S was bound to be 
concerned.
But  despite how difficult NewDay may have been in the earlier stages of this complaint  it 
did make  some valid points. And those  needed to be addressed.  After  considering  what  
NewDay has said, and reviewing the evidence that is available,  I didnt think  it had to refund 
the £150. It followed that NewDay  didnt  have to rework Ms S account. Nor did it have  to pay 
her anything for the distress and inconvenience shes suffered directly relating to the 
withdrawals themselves.
But I felt NewDay had provided Ms S with a very poor level of service when she contacted  it 
about the withdrawals.  NewDay  is the expert  here  not Ms S. So Id expect  it to work 
through what Ms S was actually complaining  about  and deal with the issue properly.
NewDay didnt do this. So I proposing to award  £200 to compensate Ms S for that poor 
service and the costs  she incurred in sending unnecessary forms to NewDay. And because 
I considered the poor service may have been  a significant factor in the problems Ms S had in 
making her payments, I proposed that NewDay remove the default from her credit record  
and try to agree  a payment plan so Ms S can repay the debt she has with NewDay  over a 
sensible period  of time.
how we go about  investigating complaints  and the PSRs and CCA
When we look into complaints we must have regard, amongst other things, to the relevant 
law and regulations.  And in this case, the PSRs and the CCA are the relevant regulations  
and law respectively.
What the investigator  said about the requirements of the PSRs  and the CCA are all 
technically correct. But the starting  point of any investigation is to consider all the 
circumstances of the complaint. And then  if we consider  the circumstances described to us 
(in this case  by Ms S and NewDay) are plausible  apply the relevant  law and regulations.
Ref: DRN35520114In other  words, is what were  being  told likely to have happened? And thats where  I didnt 
agree with the investigator.
use of Ms S credit card
Ms S said she didnt draw  the three lots of cash out (but I accepted there was some 
confusion here and she may have initially only told NewDay  about two lots).
I looked at NewDays  records  on these withdrawals. These show they were made using 
Ms S genuine card and her PIN was entered correctly (at the first attempt). So the 
transactions were  authenticated  (as required by the PSRs).
But those  records also showed  that just before the withdrawals  on 4 and 18 August, Ms S 
card had been used to buy things in retailers not far from where the cash was withdrawn. 
And it was used several times between these  dates. Ms S hadnt said anything about any of 
this spending  not being genuine.
So, somebody would have had to take Ms S card and get it back to her  on more than one 
occasion  without her noticing. And she hadnt  been able to think of any way that could 
have happened. Ms S said she doesnt  think anybody  close to her would have done this. 
And she told our investigator  she always keeps  her handbag with her. 
Ms S also told our investigator she kept a note of her PIN number in her wallet  (with her 
card) with an N next to it. She said she keeps a note of all her PINs this way. Thats  always 
going to leave Ms S open to her card(s)  being misused. While it may not quite be considered 
to be grossly negligent (as required by the PSRs  and other  guidance), its not something 
I could ignore.
The amounts of the three withdrawals also struck me as odd. Id expect a fraudster to try and 
maximise the amount they could get by using the card. Because  NewDay  hadnt provided as 
much information as Id hoped, I didnt know what the daily limit for cash withdrawals on 
Ms S account was. But it seemed  at least £100  is possible. Thats  the amount taken out one 
time. So it seemed  strange the later disputed withdrawals were  for much smaller amounts.
When I combined the lack of an explanation  for the use of the card around the time of the 
disputed withdrawals and the lack of security Ms S gave to her PIN, I didnt think itd be fair 
to tell NewDay to refund the £150.
actions by NewDay  and time limits for making claims under the CCA
Much was made by NewDay  of the time limits that would apply for Ms S to make  a claim 
under either section  75 of the CCA or the chargeback scheme. As our investigator said, 
these arent  relevant  as there isnt a dispute over goods not being  provided or not being as 
described. I had no idea why NewDay would think they are relevant.
But this confusion did indicate to me that NewDay didnt do as much as it should  have done 
to help Ms S when  she got in touch.  Not all customers  are familiar with details  of the various  
laws, regulations and rules that impact on how they use their accounts. Its reasonable to 
expect a financial business to be the expert  and guide their customers  through  these things.
Ref: DRN35520115Here, NewDay clearly  failed in that regard. It sent forms for Ms S to complete that were 
unnecessary. I thought  any fairly  basic level of enquiry  by NewDay  at the time Ms S 
contacted it would have revealed  what she was actually concerned about. That poor service 
compounded an already  difficult situation  for Ms S. So I thought NewDay should  pay Ms S 
£200 to make up for that.
It was also a concern  that NewDay says it didnt receive either  of the forms Ms S sent in. 
Wed seen copies  of two certificates  of posting for when Ms S says she sent the forms back.  
The dates on those  looked to be around the time wed expect. Our role isnt to tell any 
financial business how to operate.  Thats the role of the regulator.  But I hoped  this was an 
area NewDay would consider  outside  this complaint.
default and arrangement to repay  debt
Our investigator hadnt covered this in his consideration of Ms S complaint.
Neither NewDay nor this service would  suggest  to a customer  that they should stop making 
payments on a loan or credit facility  because of problems over disputed transactions.  So  in 
many respects  Ms S would normally have  to live with the consequences  of doing so, 
including having  a default noted on her credit record for six years.
But here  I had to take into account  the poor service NewDay  provided her with. It should 
have established  much earlier with Ms S what the actual problem was. Had NewDay  not 
wasted time sending unnecessary forms, I consider it quite likely Ms S would have accepted 
the position over the withdrawals and discussed how to repay the amount  owing on her 
credit card account much sooner.
Given what shed said about  the difficulties she was having it seems  likely that any such 
arrangement would have been  over quite a long period of time  perhaps 12 months or so. 
And any such arrangement agreed  with NewDay may have been noted on her credit record.  
So there may still have  been some negative impact  on Ms S credit rating.
My view was that NewDay should contact the relevant credit reference agencies  (CRAs)  and 
remove the default from Mrs S credit  record. Ms S should then actively  engage with 
NewDay to agree a plan to repay  the money she owes. NewDay  may report  this 
arrangement to the CRAs as it would accurately reflect the operation  of Ms S account.
If Ms S failed to engage with NewDay  or later broke any agreed plan for repaying  the 
money she owes, NewDay  would  be free to record that with the CRAs. This may result in her 
account being defaulted (again) and that being on her credit record for a longer time than the 
original one (as the six years for that started  in May 2018 and should  only run up to May 
2024).
summary
I couldnt be sure who made  the three  withdrawals  using  Ms S credit card.  Ms S was clear it 
wasnt her. But the use of her card then pointed  to it being somebody very close to Ms S  
particularly as they used it just after Ms S had and were able to get it back  to her without her 
realising  on more  than one occasion. I realised thats a difficult message to give  but it 
was where the available evidence led me.
Ref: DRN35520116Because of the unexplained use of Ms S card and the way in which she left herself open to 
it being misused, I didnt  think  itd be fair to tell NewDay to refund her the £150 that was 
withdrawn in cash.
But NewDay  had provided Ms S with poor service   so I said it should pay her £200 
compensation to make  up for this (to include her costs in sending in the unnecessary  forms). 
Much of what has followed since Ms S first got in touch with NewDay  at the end of August 
2017 is a result of that poor service.
Last, I thought  it quite  possible  the default  noted  on Ms S credit record may not have been 
applied in May 2018 had NewDay  acted properly, as set out above. So I thought  it should  be 
removed. But Ms S still owes NewDay money  so it should be repaid, in a timely manner 
agreed by both parties. This may have further implications for Ms S credit  record.
responses to my provisional  decision
NewDay didnt respond directly to the provisional  decision. Given the way it had earlier 
engaged with the complaint process and our service, this isnt entirely surprising.
Ms S did reply. She didnt agree. Again thats  not surprising. But she did raise an important 
new point. She now said that she hadnt  used her card for the spending between the cash 
withdrawals that shed contacted NewDay about in 2017.
I couldnt understand why Ms S had not raised this spending before. There was no mention 
of it when she contacted NewDay. And the spending would have been obvious from her 
account information. But it was only right that I ask NewDay to look into that spending as 
well.
NewDay took some time to respond  to Mrs S. But, in summary,  it was satisfied shed 
authorised the spending  as well as the withdrawals   and for largely the same reasons; the 
genuine card had been used and the PIN entered correctly each time.
We asked whether Ms S had anything  further to add to her complaint as a result of what  
NewDay had said in its second (further) final response. She said she didnt.
my further  findings
Ive now considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought carefully about what Ms S has said about the use of her card.  And Im still not 
persuaded by what she says. The pattern of the use of the card simply doesnt  fit that of a 
fraudster.
If Ms S didnt carry out any of the use of her card, Id have expected her to raise this with 
NewDay back in 2017. She only said the cash withdrawals  (at ATMs)  werent done by her. If 
she hadnt used  her card at any of the retailers, then Id have expected her to say something 
about this at the time. And  in particular   she didnt mention in in either of the forms that 
she sent back to NewDay.
I still dont think its likely  that somebody  unknown to Ms S would have used the card.  Theyd 
have to get the card out of her handbag and then replace  it after using it several times over a 
Ref: DRN35520117few weeks without Ms S realising. She hasnt  said anything about the card going  missing. 
And Ms S hasnt said anything about any of her other cards being taken or used fraudulently.
I cant rule out the possibility that Ms S spent and withdrew the money herself. She may 
simply have forgotten  she used  her NewDay card for these transactions.
As I said in my provisional decision,  keeping a record of her PIN (and those for all her 
accounts) with her card does leave Ms S open to her account being abused. But the fact that 
shes indicated she has more than one card in her handbag does suggest that she might 
simply have got mixed up and used  the NewDay card when she thought she was using 
another account  particularly as there has been no mention  of other  cards  being taken and 
used without her knowing.
So, on balance, I dont  think itd be fair for me to tell NewDay  to refund any of the spending  
or withdrawals Ms S says she didnt make  on her account.
But that doesnt mean I think  NewDay  has done a good job here. It hasnt. I still think  
NewDay could have  helped Ms S much more than it did  and much earlier. So the 
proposed actions I set out in my provisional decision stand.
I realise Ms S may be disappointed  by my final decision. She may want to take the matter 
further through other routes.  But it brings to an end what we can do for her in trying  to 
resolve her dispute with NewDay informally.  Im sorry  we cant help Ms S any further.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above,  my final decision is that NewDay Ltd should:
Pay Ms S £200 for the poor service  shes received;
Remove the default from Ms S credit record; and
Actively engage with Ms S to agree  a mutually  acceptable repayment plan for the money 
she owes  and, for the avoidance  of doubt, this also requires Ms S to actively engage 
with New Day.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 January 2021.
