K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA hasnt refunded a payment for goods 
that were significantly not as described by the seller.  Hed like the money refunded,  the 
seller banned  from using PayPal and compensation for consequential loss.
background
Mr M ordered products  online. He says they were not of the expected  quality. And, while  
hed bought exclusive rights to the product, when the contract  arrived it only gave him 50% 
of the rights.
Mr M contacted PayPal. He says it didnt offer help or support. Mr M says his project has 
been delayed  and hed like compensation for lost profits.
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld.  She said:
Mr Ms concern about the quality of the product wasnt covered by PayPals  buyer 
protection. But his concern about  buying exclusive rights to the product was covered.
Mr M opted  for exclusive  rights  when he made the purchase. The terms on the sellers  
website said this provided 100% of the publishing rights. The term exclusive was used 
consistently. This was what Mr M thought he was buying.  The investigator said owning 
50% of publishing rights is materially different  to owning 100%. She said PayPal should  
refund the payment.
PayPals service was poor when  Mr M contacted  it. It didnt listen to him or properly 
investigate his concerns. She said it should  pay £100 compensation for this.
The investigator said PayPal should  refund the cost of the transaction (£624.84)  with 8% 
interest and pay £100 compensation  to Mr M.
PayPal didnt agree. It said Mr M ticked the boxes to say hed read the sellers terms and 
conditions. It said the email trail between Mr M and the seller was a conversation  rather  than 
a contract. PayPal  said Mr M should  have checked  the contract before buying and it wasnt  
liable for him failing to check what hed purchased. PayPal said it hadnt  received proof that 
the sellers terms said the buyer would get 100%  publishing rights.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
Mr M bought  a product online. He expected  to receive exclusive rights to the product, 
including 100% of the publishing rights. The contract he received only gave him 50% of the 
publishing rights. Mr M was also unhappy  with the quality of the product.
Mr M paid through  PayPal. So he asked it to refund the payment under its buyer  protection.
Ref: DRN04508102PayPals terms set out the conditions for reimbursement. There  doesnt seem  to be any 
dispute that the first two conditions apply:  that this was an eligible purchase paid for from 
Mr Ms PayPal  account to the sellers PayPal account. Where there is a dispute is whether 
the product was significantly not as described.   
PayPals terms say that to be significantly  not as described the product must be materially  
different from the last description of it that the buyer  received from the seller. Its not enough 
that it didnt meet the buyers  expectations  if it was correctly described.
Its taken some time for PayPal to provide information to us and I understand Mr Ms 
frustration about  this. PayPal didnt provide recordings  of its calls with Mr M. It didnt provide 
the evidence from the seller  it says it relied  on when  deciding whether to refund the 
payment. Ive based my findings on the evidence available to me. 
I agree  with Mr M that the product he bought was significantly not as described. The 
sellers website provides  different price  options  each with different levels  of rights to the 
product. Mr M chose the exclusive rights  option.  This said the buyer would obtain 
publishing rights. Theres  an option  to read full license. This opens a sample license 
agreement which (at that time) said the licensee owns  100% of publishing rights.  
So I think Mr M believed he would receive 100% of the publishing rights to the product   as 
set out in the sample license. But the license contract he received said he had 50% of the 
publishing rights. I think this was materially different from what he thought he was buying.
Mr M was also unhappy with the quality of the product. I appreciate that this is to some  
extent subjective  and I dont know if the quality was correctly described by the seller. But as I 
think the product  was significantly not as described I dont need to consider this further.
Mr M says PayPal  didnt investigate his request for a refund properly. He says he offered to 
send evidence in the form of a PDF which PayPal declined. PayPal says it had already 
closed the request. But, based on what Ive seen, I dont think it carried out a fair 
investigation before doing  so. 
My role is to decide whether PayPal responded to Mr Ms request for a refund fairly. I cant  
reasonably require PayPal to ban the seller  from its services. Mr M says this has caused 
delays with his business venture. But whether this resulted in any loss  or the amount of 
any such loss  isnt sufficiently clear for me to require PayPal to pay compensation.
I think that PayPal should:
refund  the cost of the transaction  (£624.84) to Mr M;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on the refund  from the date Mr M made the payment to 
the date of settlement*; and
pay £100 compensation to Mr M.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal  to take off tax from this interest. PayPal  must  give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN04508103my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay the 
refund, interest  and compensation  set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 June 2019.
