The complaint
Mrs L complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) refused to allow her to make 
her loan repayments.
What happened
Mrs L in summary was in financial difficulties in 2022 and wanted to restart her loan 
repayments from September 2022. She says NatWest refused to allow her to restart the loan 
repayments on her two loan accounts. Mrs L makes other complaints, but this is the main 
complaint which has led to adverse information on her credit file which she would like 
removed. She says NatWests actions have led to arrears which she says are unaffordable.
NatWest has accepted making mistakes in respect of some of Mrs Ls complaints and has 
paid compensation. It says it didnt stop Mrs L making the payments but had to stop the 
direct debits when it was told of her financial difficulties. NatWest says it required income 
and expenditure forms to assess Mrs Ls position before it could agree to any repayment 
plan. It says it sent a number of letters to Mrs L about the arrears and told her she could 
make manual payments in any event.
Mrs L brought her complaint to us and says she tried to speak to NatWest about the position 
on hundreds of occasions. Our investigator explained which parts of the complaints we could 
look at and thought overall the compensation appropriate. The investigator thought Mrs L 
could have made manual payments and so didnt think NatWest was responsible for Mrs L 
not making the required loan payments at the end of 2022.
Mrs L doesnt accept that view.
I asked both sides for further information.
NatWest says Mrs Ls income and expenditure forms showed she was unable to afford a 
repayment plan.
Mrs L says she didnt receive any of NatWests letters telling her she could make manual 
payments. She hasnt provided her full credit file as requested by me
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NatWest has dealt fairly with this 
complaint, and I dont require it to do anything further in the circumstances of it. I appreciate 
Mrs L makes a number of complaints, but I have focused on what I think is the main 
complaint here which is her complaint about NatWest refusing to accept loan repayments. I 
also make clear that I think NatWest has paid appropriate compensation for the other 
complaint points and cant see Mrs L suggests otherwise in respect of them.
Banks and building societies must treat customers in financial difficulties positively and 
sympathetically. I can see that NatWest stopped Mrs Ls direct debits when told of those 
difficulties which is what I would have expected to take place before considering Mrs Ls 
financial position. Im satisfied that at that stage NatWest acted positively and 
sympathetically.
The key issue is if NatWest stopped Mrs L re-starting her loan repayments. I have looked at 
the information Mrs L gave NatWest about her finances and accept that on the face of it Mrs 
L was still in some financial difficulties. And it seemed unlikely she could afford the full 
repayments based on that information. So, I understand why NatWest was reluctant to re-
start the direct debit. But I also think that if Mrs L was adamant, she could afford the 
repayments, that NatWest could have considered re-starting the direct debits as I think it 
likely Mrs L was best placed to know if they were affordable. I accept that NatWest has to 
consider affordability and that there is a difficult balance to be achieved in these sorts of 
circumstances.
This complaint is about NatWest not allowing Mrs L to make the repayments and about the 
impact on her credit file. I would have liked to have seen that credit file to understand more 
about Mrs Ls financial position and the affordability of the loan repayments. But I can see 
NatWest sent Mrs L a number of letters about her loan arrears which made clear that she 
could make what is called manual payments towards her loan. I am satisfied that NatWest 
sent a number of letters in October, November and December 2022 which explained how 
Mrs L could make a transfer to her loan accounts. So, I think regardless of the fact Mrs L and 
NatWest could not agree a repayment plan that Mrs L could have made those transfers.
I appreciate Mrs L says she didnt receive those letters, but I am satisfied they were correctly 
addressed and that there were at least six sent to her. In any event I think it ought to have 
been clear to Mrs L that she could have transferred money to the loan accounts even if she 
didnt receive those letters. I find it was her responsibility to make the loan repayments as 
agreed and that NatWest hasnt made a mistake by reporting any missed payments to the 
Credit Reference Agencies.
Overall, I cant fairly conclude NatWest refused to allow Mrs L to make her required loan 
repayments. I have made clear that NatWest is obliged to consider affordability but there 
was nothing preventing Mrs L making the payments herself in any event. I have not seen 
any evidence that NatWest stopped Mrs L making required payments such as in letters. I 
find this now brings an end to what we in trying to resolve this complaint informally can do. 
No doubt Mrs L will speak to NatWest about the outstanding arrears and discuss the 
possibility of a repayment plan.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2023.
