The complaint
Ms Z complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) defaulted an old graduate 
account without making her aware. This has badly affected her credit rating.
What happened
Ms Z opened a student account with NatWest while she was at university. She hadnt used 
the account for some time and in 2019 had some problems with mail delivery while she 
found a permanent residential address. 
NatWest claimed itd sent a letter saying it was going to close the dormant account. But Ms Z 
never received it. And after the bank defaulted the account Ms Zs credit rating has been 
badly affected.
Ms Z said this has impacted her ability to look after her family and it was affecting her mental 
health. Shes happy to repay the debt but she wants the default removing.
NatWest was sorry to hear Ms Z didnt have a permanent address when itd sent letters 
about the account. It had sent them to the last known address. And itd followed the correct 
process before applying the default to the account.
NatWest could see Ms Z had called a number of times to discuss her complaint but hadnt 
received a call back. The bank apologised and said itd paid Ms Z £150 compensation for its 
poor service.  
Ms Z wasnt satisfied with NatWests response. So she contacted our service and our 
investigator looked into the matter. He could see NatWest had written to Ms Z in May 2019 
to say it was going to default the account due to the arrears thatd built up. 
Our investigator understood that Ms Zs circumstances might have changed in 2019. But 
hed not seen anything to show shed told NatWest she was no longer living at her previous 
address. So he felt it was reasonable for NatWest to issue the default notification to the 
address it held on its systems. It wasnt until the following year it became aware of Ms Zs 
situation, by which time the default had already been registered.
Our investigator appreciated the situation was very frustrating for Ms Z. But he was satisfied 
NatWest had to issue the default notice after it stopped receiving payments into the account. 
It had to record accurate information on a customers credit file. And he couldnt ask it to 
remove this information. 
Our investigator felt the £150 paid to Ms Z for its poor customer service in 2020/2021 was 
fair and reasonable. And he wouldnt be asking NatWest to do anything more. 
Ms Z didnt agree with our investigator. She hadnt received any account closure letters from 
NatWest even though a redirection was in place. And the default was stopping her buying a 
property. So shes asked for an ombudsmans final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear about the difficulties Ms Z has been through and the impact this has had on 
both her and her family. Ive looked very carefully at everything thats happened to see if 
NatWest did anything wrong when it applied the default on her account. And if so what it 
needs to do anything to put things right.
I can see that Ms Zs account was used until September 2018 when the balance showed just 
under £1600 outstanding. NatWest tried to contact Ms Z in March 2019 because the account 
had become dormant. And it wrote again to Ms Z in May 2019 because the balance was still 
owing. NatWest informed Ms Z the account would be defaulted unless payment was 
received. And it said the default would be reported to the credit reference agencies.
Ive not seen anything to suggest NatWest hasnt followed its procedures properly. It tried to 
contact Ms Z at the address it had on file. I appreciate Ms Z said shed put a mail redirection 
in place but I understand she was having problems with it. And Ive not seen anything to 
show Ms Z informed NatWest that shed changed her address or contact details.
I do appreciate that Ms Z was going through a difficult time. And the default marker is 
affecting her ability to get a mortgage and move forwards. But unfortunately the outstanding 
debt will have a negative impact on her credit file until its repaid in full - which I understand 
Ms Z is willing to do.
NatWest has apologised for not calling Ms Z back when she tried to get in touch after she 
became aware of the default. And its paid £150 compensation for its poor service. I think 
thats a fair response in the circumstances.
But NatWest has a responsibility to accurately report how an account has been managed to 
the credit reference agencies. And while I understand the difficulties Ms Z was going through 
at the time, I think its reasonable to assume she was aware there was an amount owing on 
the account.
Based on everything Ive seen I cant really say it was unfair or unreasonable for NatWest to 
make the account dormant when no further payments were received into or out of the 
account. 
And I cant say NatWest made any mistakes when it defaulted the account after it was 
unable to contact Ms Z about repayment of the outstanding balance. It tried to contact Ms Z 
using the details it had on file. And I cant hold NatWest responsible for Ms Zs change of 
circumstances or for the failed mail redirect. 
I realise Ms Z will be disappointed with this outcome. And I recognise the difficulties shes 
been through. But I cant ask NatWest to remove the marker from her account. And I wont 
be asking it to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 March 2022.
