The complaint
Mr H is unhappy with the response he received from PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
(PayPal) when he raised a dispute. 
What happened
What Mr H says
Mr H says that on 30 May 2020 he saw an advertisement for a gaming chair on an online 
marketplace for 23.95 USD. He decided to buy the chair and paid for it using his PayPal 
account. The chair wasnt delivered and so Mr H raised a dispute with PayPal. A few days 
later he received a package containing a babys bib. The reference number for the package 
was the same as the one for the gaming chair. Mr H contacted PayPal and changed his 
dispute to one for an item that is not as described.  
PayPal told Mr H it would refund his funds once it had received confirmation that hed 
returned the incorrect item. Mr H says he wont waste his time and money to do so. He says 
that the babys bib should be collected from his home or he should be paid compensation for 
his time in packaging up the bib and taking it to the post office. 
Mr H would like the cost of the chair to be refunded and to receive compensation for the time 
he has spent dealing with the dispute. He has also said that PayPal is allowing its services to 
be used by scammers who set up fake websites and advertise products at low prices 
causing customers a lot of hassle. 
What PayPal say
PayPal say Mr H bought an item for 23.95 USD on 30 May 2020. On 9 June 2020 he filed a 
goods not received dispute. Mr H later changed his dispute to goods significantly not as 
described. On 17 July 2020 PayPal asked Mr H to return the item delivered (the bib) to 
receive a full refund from the seller. It sent reminders to Mr H on 20 and 24 July 2020 and 
then contacted him on 27 July 2020 to say that as he didnt provide any tracking information 
or evidence hed returned the incorrect item it had closed the dispute in favour of the 
merchant who sold the chair.
PayPal states it has acted in accordance with the User Agreement all its customers agree to. 
Our investigation so far
The investigator who considered this complaint didnt uphold it. He said PayPal acted 
reasonably and in accordance with its User Agreement. Mr H chose not to return the bib and 
so would not receive a refund. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, I should explain to Mr H that Im required to consider the individual circumstances of 
his complaint and whether PayPal has acted reasonably. I cant consider wider issues like 
Mr Hs belief that PayPal allows scammers to use its service.
Its clear that Mr H is the victim of a scam and the scammer is responsible for Mr Hs loss in 
this case. What I need to decide is whether PayPal has acted reasonably in dealing with his 
dispute.
To use its service all PayPal customers are required to agree to its online User Agreement. 
Amongst other things, this sets out how PayPal resolves disputes about items that do not 
arrive or are significantly not as described. These say that in connection with such disputes 
PayPal may require both buyers and sellers to provide documentary evidence (including 
proof of delivery) at their own expense, and within a reasonable timescale, and take any 
other action PayPal specifies. It provides a non-exhaustive list of such actions, including, 
a. the buyer to post back to the payment recipient, to PayPal or to a third party (as
PayPal may direct) an item that the buyer claims is SNAD [significantly not as described] 
and to provide Proof of Delivery.
So I consider PayPal acted in accordance with its terms in asking Mr H to return the babys 
bib and to provide proof that he had done so. 
The User Agreement also sets out what will happen if a customer chooses not to do as 
PayPal has asked:
If you refuse to comply with PayPals requests, PayPal may make a final decision in favour 
of the other party. As a non-exhaustive guide, PayPal may request and require: 
a. the buyer to post back to the payment recipient. 
Im satisfied PayPals terms allow it to ask Mr H to return the bib to the seller and that his 
decision not to do so means PayPal can reasonably make a final decision in favour of the 
seller in this case (and not provide a refund to Mr H). I also dont consider PayPals request 
that Mr H return the bib and provide proof that he has done so to be unreasonable or unduly 
onerous. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have set out above, I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 November 2021.
