The complaint
Mr G complains about how BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited (BMWFS) administered 
and managed his request to voluntary terminate his hire purchase agreement with it.
What happened
In 2016, Mr G acquired a new car using a hire purchase agreement from BMWFS. The total 
repayable under the agreement was £23,245.59. Mr G was required to make 47 monthly 
payments of £311.89 and there was a final optional payment of £8,586.76 if he wished to 
buy the car at the end of the agreement. 
The agreement set out that Mr G had the right to terminate the agreement at any time before 
the final payment was due. In doing so, BMWFS would be entitled to the return of the car 
and at least half of the total repayable under the agreement. The agreement set out this was 
£11,622.80.
In November 2019, Mr G chose to exercise his right to terminate the agreement early. 
On 17 November 2019, BMWFS received Mr Gs written request to terminate the agreement 
early. On the same day it advised Mr G that his November 2019 payment of £311.89 wasnt 
required and wouldnt be collected.
However, Mr Gs November 2019 payment of £311.89 was collected by BMWFS.
After much communication between Mr G and BMWFS, BMWFS refunded Mr Gs  
November 2019 payment in December 2019 in two stages, a payment of £229.02 followed 
by a payment of £82.87.
Unhappy with the service he had received Mr G complained to BMWFS.
On 27 December 2019 BMWFS wrote to Mr G to say that it was upholding his complaint and 
that by way of compensation it was prepared to waive the excess mileage charge it was 
seeking from him, or would be seeking from him, of £294.97. BMWFS said its offer would 
remain open for acceptance until 10 January 2020 and if it wasnt accepted by this date the 
excess mileage charge of £294.97 would be marked back in its books as due and owing and 
non-payment of it going forward might result in negative information being recorded with 
credit reference agencies.
Mr G wasnt happy with BMWFS offer so referred his complaint to our service for 
investigation.
Mr Gs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that Mr G had 
been caused, by what BMWFS had done or hadnt done, a degree of distress and 
inconvenience (and possibly a small financial loss) for which he should be fairly 
compensated for. But taking everything into account, BMWFS offer to waive the excess 
mileage charge of £294.97 due and owing to it (although expired) was a reasonable one.
Mr G didnt agree and so his complaint has been passed to me for review and decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I can confirm that Ive come to the same overall conclusion as the 
investigator and for broadly the same reasons. There is also very little I can usefully add to 
what has already been said.
What has happened here isnt in dispute. That is BMWFS advised Mr G that his 
November 2019 payment wasnt due and wouldnt be collected, but it was. And after the 
November 2019 payment was collected there was some delay in BMWFS refunding it. Also, 
there were a number of Mr Gs communications that went unanswered and a number of 
undertakings made by BMWFS that it didnt action, or at least it didnt action in a timely 
manner.
So, all Im required to decide in this case is what BMWFS should do to fairly compensate 
Mr G.
I appreciate that Mr G will be disappointed, but Im satisfied that BMWFS offer to waive the 
excess mileage charge (which it says it did in March 2020) is both fair and reasonable.
I say this because Im satisfied that the excess mileage charge of £294.97 was properly due 
and owing to BMWFS. And had BMWFS not waived the excess mileage charge of £294.97, I 
would have awarded nothing more to Mr G than this sum by way of compensation for his 
direct losses, distress and inconvenience.
Mr G hasnt said that he suffered a direct loss (for example in bank charges or lost interest) 
over and above the £2.32 calculated by the investigator. So, in essence, BMWFS offer 
represents £292.65 (£294.97 - £2.32) for the distress and inconvenience this matter might 
have caused Mr G. And in my view given what both parties accept happened this sum is 
both fair and reasonable. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I find that BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited, having 
already waived the excess mileage charge of £294.97, need do nothing further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2021.
