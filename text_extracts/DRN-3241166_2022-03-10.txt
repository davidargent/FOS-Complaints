The complaint
Miss F complains about the amount that shes been charged by ALD Automotive Limited, 
trading as Kia Contract Hire, for damage to a car that she returned when the hire agreement 
ended.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Miss F under a hire agreement with Kia Contract Hire that she 
signed in September 2018. The period of hire was 36 months and Kia Contract Hire 
arranged for the car to be collected from Miss F by a third party when the agreement ended 
in September 2021 and the car was also inspected.
The inspection report identified a scuffed door plate and a hole in the carpet in the drivers 
footwell and a repair charge of £714.41 was recommended. The inspection report included 
photos of that damage. Kia Contract Hire charged Miss F that amount but she complained to 
it about the charge for the carpet. Kia Contract Hire said that the British Vehicle Rental and 
Leasing Association guidelines on fair wear and tear say that carpets shouldnt have holes. It 
said that car mats arent provided as standard with new cars but, if Miss F felt that they were 
needed to protect the carpets, they would have been available to purchase at her own 
expense. 
Miss F wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator 
didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She was satisfied that the damage 
fell outside of the fair wear and tear guidelines and said that Miss F ought to have been 
reasonably aware of this from the finance agreement and from Kia Contract Hires email 
prior to the car being collected.
Miss F has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says, in 
summary, that:
mats or something to protect the carpet would have prevented this from happening 
and she requested that when she collected the car but was told they wouldnt be 
provided;
if mats are required to stop this level of damage to the carpet from just driving the car 
for less than 30,000 miles, she would question the suitability of the materials used 
and whether they are fit for purpose;
its not reasonable to ask someone who leases a car to supply additional protective 
equipment at their cost when the car will never belong to them;
the inspector agreed that the wear and tear to the carpet was from not having mats 
and her resting her heel whilst driving;
the overall excellent condition of the car shows that it was well looked after and the 
mileage was substantially lower than the mileage allowance; and
Kia Contract Hire should be asked to evidence the fact that the carpet has been 
replaced.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Miss F signed the hire agreement which said: If you do not return the Vehicle in a 
suitable condition you must pay to have it restored to such a condition; and the 
terms and conditions say: The state of repair of the Vehicle is to be consistent with 
its age and mileage, assuming good treatment and allowing for Fair Wear and Tear. 
The Customer will pay to Kia Contract Hire all sums necessaryto restore the 
Vehicle to a roadworthy and good condition satisfactory to Kia Contract Hire; 
the terms and conditions define fair wear and tear as being in accordance with the 
British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association guidelines on fair wear and tear;
those guidelines say: The interior upholstery and trim must be clean and odourless 
with no burns, scratches, tears, dents or staining. Carpets should not have holes;
the car was collected from Miss F when the hire agreement ended and it was 
inspected by a third party on behalf of Kia Contract in September 2021;
the inspection report identified a scuffed door plate and a hole in the carpet  Miss F 
doesnt dispute that the damage had been caused to the car and has agreed to pay 
for the damage to the door plate but clearly doesnt feel that she should be liable for 
the hole in the carpet which was caused by her heel resting on the carpet when the 
car was being driven;
although I agree that the hole in the carpet was more than likely caused by Miss Fs 
heel resting on the carpet when she was driving the car, I consider it to be clear that 
the hole in the carpet is more than would reasonably be considered to be fair wear 
and tear in accordance with the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association 
guidelines on fair wear and tear and I dont consider it to be unfair or unreasonable 
for Kia Contract Hire to charge her for replacing the carpet in these circumstances;
if Miss F was aware that the carpet was being damaged by her heel, I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect her to have bought a mat (or taken other measures) 
to protect the carpet before there was a hole in it;
Im not persuaded that there was any requirement for Kia Contract Hire to provide 
mats for the car or that the damage has been caused because unsuitable materials 
were used or that it wasnt fit for purpose;
Miss F had agreed to pay to Kia Contract Hire all sums necessary to restore the car 
to a good condition, the inspection report says that the cost of replacing the carpet 
was £649.41 and I consider that Kia Contract Hire is entitled to charge that amount to 
Miss F under the agreement  and I dont consider that its required to provide 
evidence to show that the carpet has been replaced;
Miss F says that the cars mileage when it was returned was substantially lower than 
the mileage allowance  but the inspection report shows that the cars mileage was 
28,998 and the total contract mileage was 30,000 miles  so I dont consider that the 
car was returned with a substantially lower mileage than the total contract mileage;
Miss F had agreed to pay to hire the car for three years and she also agreed that 
shed make additional payments for mileage in excess of the total contract mileage  
there was no agreement that shed pay less for the car if its mileage when it was 
returned was less than the total contract mileage and Im not persuaded that the charge for the damage to the car should be reduced because Miss F had driven less 
than the total contract mileage; and
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Kia Contract Hire has 
acted incorrectly in these circumstances and I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable for me to require it to reduce, or waive, the amount that its charged 
Miss F for the damage to the car, to pay her any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 April 2022.
