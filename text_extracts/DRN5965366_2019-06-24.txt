K821x#15complaint
Miss A complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as Quick Quid)  gave her loans that she 
couldnt afford to repay. She asks that it refunds interest and charges.
background
Quick Quid gave 12 loans  to Miss A between August 2012 and November 2016. Miss A says 
she couldnt afford to repay the loans  without borrowing again. 
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld. He said Quick Quid 
shouldnt have offered loans  7 to 12 as Miss As pattern of borrowing suggested shed 
become reliant  on short term loans.
Quick Quid didnt agree. It said the amounts Miss A borrowed varied, there were breaks 
between her loans  and she repaid loans early, which didnt suggest she had problems with 
her loan repayments. Quick Quid asked for evidence of Miss As income and outgoings at 
the time to demonstrate she was dependant on the loans. It said the checks  it made after 
March 2015 showed these loans  were lent responsibly.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Miss A took out the following loans  with Quick Quid:

Loan 2 02.04.2013 £100 12.04.2013
Loan 3 16.06.2013 £100
Loan 3  top up 23.06.2013 £125 12.07.2013

Loan 12 25.11.2016 £500 11.01.2018*
*late fees and/or default interest applied to these loans.
Quick Quid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss A 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
Ref: DRN59653662number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
Miss As income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate.
Loans 1 to 6 (August 2012 to October  2013)
When Miss A took out Loan 1 she told Quick Quid her monthly income  was £900. She repaid 
Loan 1 in October 2012 and didnt borrow  from Quick Quid  again until April 2013. There  was 
a break  of about  two months between  Miss A repaying Loan  2 and taking out Loan 3. 
I think, given Miss A stated income, the amount of the loans and the gaps between  the loans 
the checks made by Quick Quid were proportionate  for Loans 1 to 3 (including the top up). 
Quick Quid says it did credit checks and the information  it received  didnt  suggest  any 
problems. 
Miss A took out three loans in the next three months, meaning  shed  taken out five loans and 
a top up in about six months. I think it would have  been proportionate  for Quick Quid  to make 
more checks before offering Loans  4 to 7. But, had it done so, I think  its unlikely it would 
have known these  loans werent  affordable. The information Miss A later provided to Quick 
Quid about her expenditure wouldnt have suggested this. And at this point  it wouldnt  have 
been proportionate for Quick Quid to verify what Miss A said by, for instance, asking for bank 
statements. 
Loans 7 to 12 (November 2013 to November 2016)
I think when Miss A asked  for Loan  7 Quick Quid should have realised further lending was 
unsustainable. 
By this time, Miss A had been borrowing from Quick Quid for about seven months without a 
significant break. 
The amounts Miss A borrowed varied  somewhat. But I cant see a consistent  reduction in the 
amount she borrowed,  especially when the top ups are taken into account. I dont think  the 
variation in the amount  borrowed  means the loans  were sustainable  especially taking 
account of the number  of loans, the time over which  Miss A borrowed and the increase in the 
amounts of the later loans. Late fees were applied to three of the last four loans. I think 
Quick Quid ought  to have realised Miss A was having to borrow  further to cover the gap in 
her finances  left by repaying the previous loan. 
The loans offered by Quick Quid  were  intended for short term use. But Miss A didnt make 
any real inroads into the amount she owed  Quick Quid  the later loans were for larger 
amounts than the earlier loans. In effect, Miss A paid large amounts of interest to service  a 
debt to Quick Quid  over an extended  period.  This borrowing wasnt sustainable.
So Im upholding  Miss As complaint about  Loan 7 and the later loans and top ups. Quick  
Quid should:
refund  all interest and charges Miss A paid on Loan 7 and the later loans and top ups;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
Ref: DRN59653663remove all entries about  Loan 7 and the later loans and top ups from Miss As credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Miss A a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order CashEuroNet  UK LLC to take the steps 
and pay the compensation set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 July 2019.
