DRN-2203429
The complaint
Mr D complains about the amount of money he received in Sterling when he transferred 
70,000 Euros to his National Westminster Bank Plc account.
What happened
A payment was received on 18 June 2020 by NatWest for an amount of EUR 70,000.00. The 
funds were converted to Sterling and £62,046.22 was credited to his account.
Mr D though he would receive more money following the transfer and complained to 
NatWest. When Mr D complained to the bank, it didnt think it had done anything wrong 
regarding the currency exchange because it applied its prevailing rate as it was required to 
do in the terms and conditions of the account.
NatWest did agree it had provided him with poor service when dealing with his queries 
initially. It credited £64.40 to his account. And following further information, it credited a 
further £46.20.
The investigator didnt think NatWest had done anything wrong regarding the currency 
exchange. It had used the rate set by its group and the investigator had checked the 
calculation based on this rate and concluded the correct amount had been credited to Mr Ds 
account.
Mr D disagreed. He thinks NatWest used a convenient rate for it and the result of that was a 
huge commission for it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Mr Ds frustration here; he didnt get as much money as he was expecting, and 
he feels NatWest has profited from this. I dont, however, agree NatWest has done anything 
wrong regarding the currency exchange. I agree that it didnt handle Mr Ds questions about 
the exchange well initially, but I think the compensation it has paid was fair and I wont be 
asking it to do anything more.
Mr D had a choice about whether the payment should be converted to Sterling before the 
transfer was made or converted on receipt by NatWest. By choosing to leave the conversion 
to NatWest Mr D chose to accept whatever NatWests prevailing rate was at the time. This is 
set out in the terms and conditions of the account. As I have seen evidence that NatWest 
applied that prevailing rate, I cant agree that it did anything wrong.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 October 2020.
