The complaint
Mr B complains that a finance agreement with Santander Consumer (UK) Plc trading as 
Volvo Car Credit (VCC) was misrepresented to him.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and I explained why I didnt propose to 
uphold it. I explained why I didnt think there was sufficient evidence to suggest that the 
dealership had advised Mr B that there was an option to voluntary terminate, and why I 
wasnt persuaded that an untrue statement of fact had been made or that there had been a 
misrepresentation. 
I invited Mr B and VCC to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wanted to 
make before I finally determined the matter.
Mr B replied and said all the discussions and initial paperwork indicated that he was entering 
into a PCP agreement. He said he hadnt entered into a PCP agreement before, so he didnt 
have any in depth knowledge of these types of agreements.
VCC didnt respond to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought about what Mr B has said. But it doesnt change my decision. Ive explained in 
my provisional decision why I dont think there was a misrepresentation here. Its not about 
whether the agreement was a conditional sale PCP or a fixed sum loan PCP. Its about 
whether the option to voluntary terminate was included. Theres nothing in the documents to 
suggest that the option was included, and I havent seen enough evidence to persuade me 
that the dealership told Mr B that there was an option to voluntary terminate. 
My final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2021.
