K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that a series of loans and a credit account were  approved  by 
CashEuroNet UK LLC in an irresponsible way. It traded as QuickQuid. 
Mr S is represented by a third party.
background
A loan table appears at the end of this decision which  is a brief summary of the approved 
loans. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at this complaint. His view was that from the second top-up 
approval decision of Loan 5 (which  appears on the table as Loan  5.2), QuickQuid ought to 
put things right. 
Mr S representative acknowledged the view and has added  nothing more. So from that it 
seems that Mr S is content with our adjudicators view. So I have not reviewed Loans 1 to 
5.1 as it seems that these are not in dispute  as non-upholds. 
QuickQuid disagreed but what it has sent to us in September  2018 I have discounted,  as it 
does not appear  to relate to this complaint. So I dont know  why it disagreed. I do have the 
submissions from QuickQuid  from February  2018  though, which I have taken into account. 
The loans still in dispute are Loans  5.2 to 8.1 and it is these I have reviewed in this decision. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Before lending money to a consumer, a lender should take proportionate steps to 
understand whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a 
sustainable manner,  without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key element was that any checks needed  to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being  
borrowed was due to be repaid. 
Loan 5 second  top-up
By the time Mr S was applying for Loan 5.2 in late January 2016 he had been borrowing 
from QuickQuid for almost two years. I agree with the adjudicator where he has explained 
that by this stage  of the lending relationship, QuickQuid ought  to have been carrying out a 
full review of Mr S financial situation. 
This second top-up approval meant that Mr S repayments were  high.  He had repayments 
due of £111.60 in February 2016,  £130.20 in March 2016 and £655.20 in April 2016.  
Ref: DRN73651542Looking at Mr S income, expenditure  and regular financial commitments from around  this 
time, I think that after he had repaid the highest  repayment of just over £655, he would  have 
been left with very little  about £86. 
I uphold Mr S complaint  in relation  to the second top-up for Loan  5, as I dont think  it was 
sustainably affordable. 
Loans 6 to 8 
In my view I think that a full financial review  of Mr S financial situation ought to have been 
carried out for Loan 6 and for each of the loans following. That could have  included  
reviewing any bank  statements for Mr S but this was one method of doing this and was not 
the only method.
Mr S took out his sixth loan in July 2016 and his monthly income was £1,470. He was 
spending £334 towards his normal living costs and £476 towards  his regular financial 
commitments. This translates into around  £660 in disposable income so this would not have 
been enough to meet the highest loan repayment of £744. 
Looking at Mr S statements I can see multiple  transactions towards online betting 
companies, and the month before this loan was taken, he was spending around £2,578 
towards this. So, I think this shouldve  alerted  to QuickQuid as to whether  he could  meet 
his repayments  sustainably. 
Mr S situation remained  broadly the same x and included  gambling transactions.  And so 
overall I think that if QuickQuid had carried out the full review I would have considered to 
have been the proportionate approach to these loans, it would have realised  that Mr S could 
not afford  to repay the second top-up on loan five, or the repayments  on loans six to eight. 
I uphold Mr S complaint  in relation  to Loans  6 to 8 including the top-ups on each. 
putting things right
Because QuickQuid,  should not have  given Mr S the loans he took, its not right that Mr S 
should have to pay interest  or charges on these, or have them affect his credit file in a 
negative way. So I think it should do as follows:
refund  any interest and charges  already  paid by Mr S in respect  of the second top-up 
of Loan 5 (approved January 2016) and those paid on  Loans 6, 7 and 8 including  
those top-ups;
 
apply 8% simple interest  per year to any interest  and charges refunded from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse payment information  about  the loans from Mr S credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest and it must  
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN73651543my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr S complaint in part and direct  that CashEuroNet UK 
LLC, trading as QuickQuid, put things right in the way I have said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 July 2019.
