The complaint
Mr T complains about interest applied to his credit card following successful chargeback 
claims. Mr T also complains about the way National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
handled his requests for refunds. 
What happened
In Autumn last year, Mr T contacted NatWest to challenge transactions hed found on his 
account. NatWest raised a chargeback clam and the disputed amounts were refunded to 
Mr Ts account. But in the months that following, Mr T incurred some purchase interest as he 
didnt clear the balance in full. Mr T complained and NatWest sent him a final response in 
January 2022. NatWest said interest had been applied following refunded payments and 
didnt agree it had made any errors. 
Mr T made further complaints and NatWest issued refunds of £8.65 on 15 February 2022 
(relating to interest applied on 14 January 2022) and £35.83 on 14 March 2022 (relating to 
the interest owed on 10 December 2021). NatWest sent Mr T a written response in June 
2022 and apologised for the service provided. NatWest said it had issued interest refunds as 
a gesture of goodwill and paid Mr T £50 to apologise. 
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Ts complaint. They thought NatWest had dealt 
with Mr Ts complaint fairly and didnt ask it to increase the award or take further action. Mr T 
asked to appeal and said NatWest had failed to show it had issued correct refunds, in line 
with the figures he gave in complaint letters. As Mr T asked to appeal, his complaint has 
been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware Ive summarised the events surrounding this complaint in less detail than the 
parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by my approach which reflects the informal 
nature of this service. I want to ensure all parties Ive read and considered everything on file. 
Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every point raised to fairly reach my decision. And if 
I dont comment on something, its not because I havent considered it. Its because Ive 
focused on what I think are the key issues. My approach is in line with the rules we operate 
under. 
Mr Ts explained to the investigator that the refund figures dont match his records. Ive 
looked at the statements provided along with records of NatWests refunds. I appreciate Mr 
Ts view that NatWest hasnt issued the correct level of interest refund. But the statement 
evidence Ive seen shows it has reversed payments as agreed in its final responses. 
I think its fair to start by noting NatWests explanation in its January 2022 final response. 
NatWest explained that if refunds from retailers were applied to the following statement 
period, the cardholder would need to clear the balance in full to avoid purchase interest 
becoming due in the meantime. I appreciate Mr Ts view that hed been unfairly overcharged 
by the retailer and website he completed the purchase through. But I can only consider 
NatWests actions. And as the disputed transactions werent cleared during the statement 
period, interest became payable. I havent been persuaded NatWest acted unfairly or 
outside of its account terms in the way it applied interest to the credit card. 
With that being said, NatWest clearly couldve done more to explain the situation in a clearer 
way to Mr T. NatWest refunded the disputed transactions to the card in October 2021 but 
Mr T was clearly not expecting associated purchase interest in the months that following. Im 
pleased NatWest agreed to issue refunds on a goodwill basis. And NatWest ultimately 
refunded and backdated the £35.83 interest payment that accrued up to 10 December 2021. 
Ive read and considered the information provided by both Mr T in his submissions and 
NatWest. Im satisfied has explained the basis on which its refunds were issued. And Im 
satisfied NatWest has paid a fair settlement. 
In addition to the goodwill refunds it issued, NatWest also paid Mr T £50 in recognition of the 
inconvenience caused by the way it handled his queries and complaint. I can see how 
frustrating Mr T has found the process of discussing the chargebacks with NatWest. In my 
view, the £50 settlement reflects the level of distress and inconvenience caused and, in 
addition to the interest refunds, is a fair way to resolve Mr Ts complaint. As Im satisfied 
NatWest has agreed a settlement that is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances, Im not 
telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc has already agreed a settlement that is 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2023.
