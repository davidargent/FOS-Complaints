The complaint
Miss E complains that NewDay Ltd didnt authorise a transaction from her credit card.
What happened
Miss E holds a credit card account with NewDay.
 
In November 2021, Miss E attempted to buy two rings from a luxury department store. Shed 
travelled some way to visit the department store to make her purchase, and shed also 
planned to celebrate afterwards. But the transaction was blocked twice, despite Miss E 
contacting NewDay to confirm that it was genuine.
 
The following day, Miss E raised a formal complaint. In summary, she said her trip had been 
ruined by NewDays actions. Shed been unable to complete an important purchase, for 
which shed travelled a long way, and shed been caused extreme embarrassment in the 
department store when her card was declined. Miss E felt shed done enough to confirm that 
it was her attempting the payment, so it should have gone through.
 
NewDay issued its final response on 10 December. It apologised for what had happened, 
and it acknowledged that Miss E had suffered some distress and inconvenience. NewDay 
explained that the transaction had been blocked twice by its fraud prevention systems. While 
NewDay understood that it wouldve been inconvenient for Miss E at the time, blocking the 
transaction was a reasonable course of action in-line with the terms and conditions of 
Miss Es account.
 
NewDay clarified that, sometimes, a transaction can be blocked more than once. This can 
happen for various reasons as part of NewDays processes for combatting fraud, and its 
fraud prevention measures are ultimately there to protect its customers. Despite that, 
NewDay recognised some distress and inconvenience had been caused. So, to resolve 
Miss Es complaint, NewDay paid her £80 which it credited directly to her credit card 
account. 
Miss E remained unhappy, and she referred her complaint to our service. An investigator 
here looked at what happened, but he didnt think NewDay needed to do anything more. In 
summary, he said:
NewDay has a duty of care towards its customers, and its entitled to set its own 
security and fraud-prevention processes. 
The terms and conditions of Miss Es account set out that payments can be blocked 
for security reasons, which is what had happened here.
NewDay had paid Miss E a fair and reasonable amount of compensation in the 
circumstances. 
Miss E disagreed with the investigator and she asked for an ombudsmans decision. So, as 
no agreement has been reached, the complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, while I know it will disappoint Miss E, Ive reached the same conclusion as 
our investigator and for largely the same reasons. Ill explain why. 
NewDay must have in place security measures and procedures in order to try to safeguard 
its customers accounts, and to ensure it complies with its legal and regulatory obligations.
Ive checked the terms and conditions of Miss Es credit card account, and Im satisfied they 
make it clear that NewDay may refuse to authorise a transaction where it has security 
concerns  as it did here. So, I dont think NewDay made a mistake by not allowing the 
transaction to go through. 
Having said that, I know the crux of the matter for Miss E is that she was attempting to make 
a legitimate transaction. After all, once the first attempt was declined, she spoke with 
NewDay  via its webchat service  to confirm that it was indeed her attempting to make the 
purchase. And it does appear that the block was initially lifted when Miss E first raised the 
issue, only for it to be reapplied when she tried to make the payment a second time just a 
few minutes later.
 
NewDay has explained that its fraud prevention process can flag a payment as potentially 
fraudulent, and not authorise it, more than once. This might happen for several reasons 
which automated fraud prevention systems, like NewDays, can pick up on. For example, if 
the payment is for a particularly large amount, if its a payment being made to a high-end 
retailer or if its a purchase outside of a customers usual spending habits. And all those 
reasons are applicable to Miss Es attempted purchase here.
 
Im pleased to note that Miss E was able to complete her purchase a couple of days later. 
Though I can, of course, understand how frustrating this situation must have been for her at 
the time. But while I empathise with Miss E, fraud is a very serious issue. And the fact is that 
firms have a duty to protect their customers from the ever-increasing threat of fraudulent 
activity. 
Id expect NewDay to have measures in place to pick up on potentially unauthorised or 
fraudulent payments  it would be irresponsible if it didnt. And unfortunately, on occasion, 
this means that legitimate transactions may be delayed or blocked.
 
While I know Miss E wants NewDay to review its systems and fraud-prevention measures, 
so this situation doesnt happen again, its not for this service to interfere with these 
processes. Ultimately, its for NewDay to decide its methods to meet its legal and regulatory 
obligations.
 
Miss E has also said she would like further compensation but, in all the circumstances, I 
dont think NewDay needs to do anything more. I say that because I think NewDay acted 
reasonably in following its fraud-prevention process, and I find that the £80 it has already 
credited to Miss Es account is enough to acknowledge the distress and inconvenience 
caused.My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 July 2022.
