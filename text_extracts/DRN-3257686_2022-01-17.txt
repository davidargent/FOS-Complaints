The complaint
Mr N complains Chetwood Financial Limited trading as LiveLend (LiveLend) acted 
irresponsibly when it provided a loan facility to him. 
What happened
Mr N says when he applied for a loan with LiveLend in November 2019, he was in financial 
difficulties and was struggling with a gambling problem, which should have been obvious to 
LiveLend if they had carried out more thorough background checks. Mr N says his bank 
statements would have shown LiveLend that his income and expenditure differed to his loan 
application and evidenced he was gambling. Mr N also says his credit report would have 
also shown at the time of his loan application he was using payday loans and making heavy 
use of his overdraft facility on his bank account. Mr N says he is suffering from depression 
and his finances are under pressure. Mr N has asked LiveLend to accept it lent to him 
irresponsibly, and as a result they should refund the interest charged to his loan account and 
remove any adverse entries from his credit file. 
LiveLend says it completed a number of checks when Mr N applied for the loan facility, 
including a full credit search and income verification checks. LiveLend says Mr Ns net 
disposable income showed the loan requested was affordable, and his credit history was 
satisfactory - based on this LiveLend didnt feel bank statements were required before 
approving the loan. LiveLend says Mr N was given the opportunity in the final stage of the 
loan application process, to confirm he was happy he could meet the monthly loan 
payments, before accepting the terms and conditions.
Mr N wasnt happy with LiveLends response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator felt LiveLend had carried out reasonable affordability checks to determine if the 
loan was affordable to Mr N. The investigator says that LiveLend wouldnt have been aware 
from the checks it carried out, that Mr N was suffering mental health issues and had a 
gambling problem unless they were informed of that. The investigator was satisfied the 
checks carried out by LiveLend were proportionate to the level of borrowing requested and 
sufficient enough for it not to ask for sight of Mr Ns bank statements.
Mr N didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
I sent both sides a provisional decision, where I said: 
Ive considered all of the evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to a different outcome to the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision. 
I was sorry to learn of Mr Ns financial issues and the other problems he is facing, and this 
must be a difficult time for him. When looking at this complaint I will consider if LiveLend 
acted irresponsibly when it provided a loan to Mr N in November 2019. 
Mr Ns complaint centres around, in his view, LiveLends failure to carry out sufficient checks 
on his financial position, before approving a £7,000 loan in November 2019. Mr N maintains 
LiveLend should have checked his background more thoroughly at this time and if it had 
asked for bank statements and properly looked into his credit history, it would have shown 
he was having financial problems and a gambling issue. Mr N also says, further and more 
detailed checks would have shown him using payday loans and full usage of an overdraft 
facility with his bank, leading up to the loan application with LiveLend.
The first thing to say is because consumers have other lending with other providers, 
including payday loans, this wouldnt on its own necessarily mean someone is experiencing 
financial difficulties. What is important, is when businesses like LiveLend provide lending 
facilities, they carry out reasonable and proportionate checks before doing so. Its worth 
saying there are no set rules what checks, lenders must undertake- this is in part dependent 
on the size and term of the borrowing. Here, Mr N applied for a £7,000 loan with LiveLend 
and completed an online application and from the information I have seen, he stated an 
income of £2,100 per month and he was in full time employment. LiveLend have provided 
confirmation to this service they conducted an income verification check over a 6 and 12-
month period which confirmed these income levels - this is a system provided by a major 
Credit reference agency to lenders like LiveLend, when they check loan applications like 
this. So, its fair to say LiveLend carried out reasonable credit checks here, but its one thing 
to carry out these checks and another to make sure when those checks have been made the 
information gathered from it, is fully considered and acted upon and Im not convinced it was 
here. 
I say this because I have been provided with a copy of a credit report by the same credit 
reference agency, LiveLend say they used at that time. LiveLend have told this service their 
credit checks didnt highlight any issues on Mr Ns credit files, however, thats not entirely 
correct. I have established from the credit report Mr N had a late payment to a loan company 
in July 2019, but more of a concern, is on one of Mr Ns bank current accounts, the report 
shows five consecutive months from August to December 2018, where a warning marker 
had been recorded. Ive established these markers refer to an Arrangement to Pay, which 
indicates there was an issue with Mr Ns bank account for a protracted period of time. Whats 
important here, is from the information I have seen, LiveLend never questioned this with Mr 
N to establish what the issue was, and its reasonable to assume if they had, it could have 
led to a different lending decision by them. 
As I mentioned earlier, this service considers any checks made by businesses like LiveLend, 
should be proportionate, but here the amount being lent was for a sizeable sum, committed 
for a period of three and a half years. While I can understand LiveLend may not ordinarily 
ask for sight of bank statements before approving a loan facility, in this instance as there 
was clearly some issues on one of Mr Ns bank accounts, I am satisfied that required further 
investigation.
While LiveLend will be disappointed with my decision, I propose LiveLend refund all interest 
and charges applied to Mr Ns loan account, to reduce the balance outstanding on that loan 
and remove any adverse credit information from Mr Ns credit file relating to this loan. In 
addition, LiveLend should pay Mr N £150 for the trouble and upset caused. I would also 
recommend, if not already in place, that LiveLend should set up a suitable payment plan with 
Mr N here. 
Both Mr N and LiveLend responded to my provisional decision, so the case has been 
passed back to me to make a final decision.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I gave both Mr N and LiveLend until 16 January 2022 to accept or reject my provisional 
decision. Mr N has accepted my provisional decision but LiveLend didnt agree and raised 
further points for me to consider. 
LiveLend says they wouldnt have altered their decision to lend despite the fact Mr Ns bank 
account had previously shown five successive months with an arrangement to pay marker. 
LiveLend make the point they are not a Prime lender and accept a certain level of adverse 
information for its applicants. LiveLend reiterate the point, they carried out credit searches 
and income checks and these met their lending criteria and felt, based on Mr Ns income and 
expenditure the loan was affordable. LiveLend says the issue with Mr Ns bank account 
happened 10 months prior to the loan they approved for Mr N and there had been no 
adverse information registered against Mr N  before or after that time. LiveLend says it was 
plausible Mr N had taken the loan with them to consolidate his debts and by so doing, 
reduced his monthly outgoings.
I understand the points LiveLend have made, but the first thing to say here is the fact, in their 
words, they are not advertised as a prime lender doesnt mean they shouldnt carry out 
sufficient and proportionate checks, before providing lending facilities. Its fair to say, in my 
provisional decision I have acknowledged LiveLend did carry out checks and searches, my 
issue was more that once carrying out those checks, they didnt act upon the information it 
highlighted. As I referred to in my provisional decision, this wasnt a small sum of money 
being lent and over a period of 42 months, so I would expect LiveLend to have at least have 
questioned the fact that for almost half a year Mr N had experienced issues with his bank 
account, 10 months prior to the loan being approved. So, I dont support LiveLends 
argument they had sufficient information about Mr Ns ability to repay the borrowing, without 
having first discussed this matter with him, to understand what had caused the arrangement 
to pay markers to have been registered by his bank. 
While LiveLend feel its plausible the loan Mr N took out was to consolidate other debts, so 
reducing his outgoings further, I can see no evidence to support that view, or that it has any 
bearing on why they didnt question the issue of the arrangement to pay markers, previously 
mentioned. 
With that in mind, I cant say the points raised by LiveLend has changed my original 
provisional decision and see no need to change or add to this, and so my provisional 
decision remains the same.
Putting things right
I instruct Chetwood Financial Limited trading as LiveLend to refund all interest and charges 
applied to Mr Ns loan account, to reduce the balance outstanding on that loan and remove 
any adverse credit information from Mr Ns credit file relating to this loan. In addition, 
LiveLend should pay Mr N £150 for the trouble and upset caused. I would also recommend, 
if not already in place, that LiveLend should set up a suitable payment plan with Mr N here.
My final decisionMy final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
