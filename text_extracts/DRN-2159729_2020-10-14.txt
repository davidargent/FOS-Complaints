DRN-2159729
The complaint
Mr D on behalf of M complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA unfairly kept his money 
and refused to release it for six months.
What happened
Mr D says PayPal asked him to provide documents in order to release his money which he 
did but PayPal said it would not release the money for six months. He says the money which 
is about £7,500 is a significant part of the business turnover and PayPals actions are having 
a huge impact on his business. Mr D would like the money released and says the six-month 
period in any event is unreasonable and doesnt take account of transactions made before 
the last one.
PayPal says it limited Ms account and made the decision to end its relationship with it. It 
says its user agreement allows it to retain money for 180 days in case of a claim or 
chargeback. PayPal said it explained to M why it ended the agreement and about its 
concerns.
Mr D brought the complaint to us, but our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought PayPal was holding about £3,846 of Ms money and thought it was entitled to do so 
under the agreed user agreement. The investigator also thought PayPal had explained why 
it had taken to steps it did and didnt think Mr D had provided clear evidence of required 
invoices.
Mr D doesnt accept that view and in summary says there were a number of refunds which 
were to be expected as orders increased. He says its not fair that the money was retained 
for so long and PayPals actions were unreasonable.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the overall view that PayPal has dealt fairly with this 
complaint and I dont think it has made a mistake by either ending its relationship with M or 
by retaining its money. I appreciate Mr D will be disappointed by my decision and I 
appreciate how strongly he feels about what took place.
I have looked at the user agreement between M and PayPal and Im satisfied that PayPal is 
entitled to place account restrictions in certain circumstances. Im also satisfied that PayPal 
has told us and Mr D what those concerns were, and I think in these circumstances those 
concerns were reasonable. I think its up to PayPal, when exercising its commercial 
judgement, to decide upon such matters in any event and its up to it to decide if concerns 
remain after a customer provides information to it. So, I dont think PayPal acted unfairly by 
concluding that there was a risk of claims or chargebacks and by deciding that it would act in 
line with the agreed user agreement and retain Ms money for 180 days.
I appreciate Mr D questions the length of the retention and why PayPal uses the last 
transaction date to start that period. But Im satisfied Mr D on behalf of M agreed to those 
terms and conditions found in the user agreement. And for the reasons I have explained I 
find PayPal acted in line with that agreement. I make clear to Mr D that its not our role to 
decide if an agreement is fair and reasonable and such matters would be for a court to 
decide upon.
Overall, Im satisfied that PayPal has acted in line with the agreed user agreement. And so it 
follows I cant order it to refund Ms money or do anything further in the circumstances of this 
complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask M to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 November 2020.
