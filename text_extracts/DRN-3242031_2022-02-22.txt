The complaint
Ms P complains about the way Creation Consumer Finance Ltd handled her claim under 
Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
What happened
Ms P purchased an item of furniture from a retailer and entered into a finance agreement 
with Creation. The furniture was broken when it arrived. Ms P complained to the retailer, who 
upheld her complaint and said it would carry out repairs.
Repairs were due to take place in December 2019 but were delayed because parts needed 
to be ordered. The retailer went into administration before the repairs were carried out.
Ms P raised a section 75 claim with Creation. Creation didnt respond within the timescale 
set by the FCA so Ms P brought her complaint to this service. She says the goods still 
havent been repaired and she wants a full refund.
Creation didnt respond to this services request for a case file, so the investigator completed 
the investigation based on the available information. The investigator said that the goods 
werent of satisfactory quality at the point of supply and that there had been a breach of 
contract. The investigator also said that Creation had had long enough to arrange a repair 
which hadnt happened, so Ms P should be entitled to a full refund together with 
compensation for the trouble and upset caused.
Creation didnt respond to the investigators view so Ive been asked to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres no dispute that Ms P was supplied with a faulty item. Creation hasnt provided an 
explanation for why it hasnt arranged a repair.
Based on what Ive seen, I think creation has had long enough to arrange a repair. Ms P has 
retained the item and hasnt got room in her house to get a replacement until this matter is 
resolved. I dont think its fair to expect Ms P to wait any longer for a repair.
Putting things right
Because Ms P was supplied with faulty goods, a breach of contract has occurred, and 
Creation must put things right. I think Creation has had a reasonable time to arrange repairs, 
but it hasnt done so. In the circumstances, I think its fair to ask Creation to issue a full 
refund and pay compensation for the trouble and upset caused to Ms P.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must:
Refund the full purchase price of £373.60 plus 8% simple interest from the date of payment 
to the date of settlement
Arrange for the goods to be collected at no cost to Ms P or pay Ms P the sum of £50 so she 
can arrange for the goods to be disposed of
Pay compensation of £150 to reflect the delays in resolving the matter and for the trouble 
and upset caused to Ms P
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 March 2022.
