K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains that Nationwide  Building Society  blocked his card over a genuine 
transaction. He says hes incurred financial losses as a result.
background
Mr H had to contact Nationwide to confirm whether a payment he was making was genuine. 
Because he didnt  get through the security  check, he had to go into the branch to clear the 
block on his card. He complained to Nationwide but it rejected  his complaint so he came to 
this service. Our investigator didnt think the complaint should  succeed but Mr H disagreed 
so its come to me for review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Based on the evidence  Ive seen, it 
appears Mr Hs card was blocked by the card company  verification process, not by 
Nationwide itself. So I dont think Nationwide has done anything wrong. 
It has apologised for the length of time Mr H spent  on hold trying to sort things out and 
credited his account with Â£50 as compensation for the inconvenience  this caused him. In my 
view that was fair and reasonable  compensation. I understand the block happened  at a very 
difficult time for Mr H and I realise this isnt the outcome he was hoping for but I hope he will 
understand the reasons.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, its my final decision that this complaint is not upheld.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 September  2019.
