K821x#15complaint
Mr L complains  that Harvey & Thompson  Limited (H&T) gave him loans that he couldnt 
afford to pay back.
background
This complaint is about cheque loans H&T provided to Mr L between October 2010 and 
October 2012 and two personal loans provided  in June 2013 and March 2014.  A summary of 
Mr Ls borrowing is set out in the tables  below.

As there was a gap in Mr Ls borrowing after repaying loan 9 of around  9 months our 
adjudicator treated this as a new loan chain. With the exception of the Sentinel  Loan and the 
personal loan Mr L provided  post dated  cheques in return for cash. The cheques  were 
presented on the due date or could  be rolled over for a fee. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that loans 2-9 of chain 1 and all 
the loans in chain 2 shouldnt have been given  to Mr L as he couldnt sustainably  afford  to 
repay them. H&T disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. In particular it said that the 
adjudicator was inconsistent with other adjudications where the first three  loans of a new 
Ref: DRN84095462chain were allowed. It said that if the adjudicator  didnt agree the complaint should be 
passed to an ombudsman.
So as no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence and arguments to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve  set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance  and 
good industry practice - on our website.
H&T needed to take steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this means  
that it should have carried out reasonable checks to make sure Mr L could repay the loans 
in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much  was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks  might be 
reasonable.
But certain factors might point to the fact that H&T should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
 the lower a customers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
 the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting  the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  A customer should be able to make  repayments on 
time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to 
meet the repayments. And it follows  that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably 
if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
H&T has said that the regulations and guidance only came  into place at a later time. But I 
dont agree that this is the case.  There were industry standards  in 2007  such as the FLA 
Lending Code  that, in some respects, were  based  on the same principles as current  
regulations. And in any event a business  should treat its customers fairly.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.  Ive decided  to uphold Mr Ls complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
Ref: DRN84095463It isnt clear whether  H&T disagree with the whole of the adjudicators view or only the first 
three loans  of chain  2. I have proceeded on the basis that the business  does  not agree that 
any of the loans should be upheld.
Mr L borrowed £400 for loan 1. This was his first loan with the business  and so I dont think it 
was wrong to give Mr L this loan.  There was nothing to suggest he wouldnt be able to repay 
it.
Before loan 1 was repaid Mr L took out another loan for £400 taking his total borrowing to 
£800. Mr Ls income was £1023  and so the repayment for both loans was a significant 
proportion of his income.  Asking for another loan for the same amount before the first was 
repaid should  have  alerted H&T that Mr L was having difficulty managing his money. Taken 
with the level of repayment  I dont think H&T should have given Mr L this loan. 
Mr Ls position didnt  improve  and before loan 2 was repaid he asked for loan 3. Mr L did 
repay loan 3 within a short period of time but loan 2 was still outstanding  and he proceeded 
to borrow loans 4, 5 and 6 which were  all fully repaid  at the same  time as loan 2 in 
December 2011  which was significant  time after taking them out.  
I think its fair to say that Mr L was starting to have significant problems making  the 
repayments over the time he had these loans.
So by loan 2 (given the amount  Mr L was borrowing) H&T shouldve been  concerned  that 
Mr L may have some  longer term financial problems rather  than just using the loans to help 
with a temporary cash flow problem.  H&T shouldve also become concerned about whether 
it knew enough about Mr Ls true financial situation.
I think a reasonable  check before approving loans 2 to 5 would most likely have shown that 
Mr L was having  problems managing his money over this time. The information Mr L has 
provided shows that his regular  income  was £1023 and so the level of repayment required 
on these loans was unsustainable as a proportion of his income. 
I think that H&T wouldve  found out this information if it had made  reasonable checks. And I 
think H&T wouldve seen Mr L wouldnt have been  able repay  the loans in a sustainable  way. 
So I think that H&T shouldnt have given loans 3 to 5 to Mr L and I think  hes lost out as a 
result of this. So Im intending to uphold Mr Ls complaint about loans 3 to 5.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 9 because I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of H&Ts lending  
history with Mr L, with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which  H&T should  reasonably  
have seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  And so H&T should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
up to loan 6 the amounts Mr L owed H&T remained the same or increased. This was 
largely due to Mr L being unable to fully repay his loans in a reasonable time. 
H&T ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr L was having  to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loans  was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Ref: DRN84095464Mr L wasnt making any real inroads into the amount  he owed H&T. Loan 9 was 
taken out around 19 months after Mr Ls first. Mr L had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect, service  a debt to H&T over an extended period.
I think that Mr L lost out because H&T continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ls 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
Im also of the view that all the loans in chain 2 should be upheld. I acknowledge that there  
was a gap of around 9 months  between  Mr L repaying loan 9 and asking for further 
borrowing. Given Mr Ls previous borrowing history and in particular the length of time taken 
to repay  his earlier loans,  I agree with the adjudicator, that H&T should  have done more to 
satisfy itself that any difficulties had passed. I think that H&T should  have done  more to 
verify Mr Ls income and outgoings to ensure any future borrowing was sustainable  and I 
cant see that it did this.
Mr L again took a significant period to repay  loans  1-3 of chain 2 and they were  all taken out 
before the earlier loan was repaid. Mr L was effectively carrying a £500 debt that did not 
reduce from October  2012 until June 2013.  This further suggests that Mr L couldnt afford to 
repay what he was borrowing. This debt was converted in to the Sentinel loan for £400 
which ran from June  2013 to March  2014 and the day it was repaid Mr L took out the 
personal loan for the same amount. I agree with the adjudicator that Mr L couldnt 
sustainably afford any of the loans in chain 2 and more  robust  checking would have shown 
this.
So I uphold Mr Ls complaint about  all of the loans except loan 1.
putting things right   what H&T needs to do
 refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on all loans except loan 1;
 pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
 remove any negative information  about loans 2 to 9 of chain 1 and loans 1 to 3 of 
chain 2 from Mr Ps credit file;
 the number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards for chain 1 and the Sentinel 
and personal loan means any information  recorded about  them is adverse. 
So all entries about these loans should  be removed from Mr Ls credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires  H&T to take off tax from this interest. H&T must give Mr L 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly  uphold Mr Ls complaint.
Harvey & Thompson  Limited should put things right by doing  what Ive said above.
Ref: DRN84095465Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr L to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 April 2020.
