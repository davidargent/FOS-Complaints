The complaint
Mr H complains that BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited (BMWFS) unfairly charged him 
£8,681.34 when he voluntarily terminated his hire purchase agreement (agreement) with it.
 
Mr H is represented in this complaint by a third party. But for ease I will refer to any 
submissions or evidence provided by the third party as if it had been provided by Mr H.
What happened
In 2017, Mr H acquired a used car using an agreement from BMWFS. The total repayable 
under the agreement was £59,983.94. Mr H was required to make an advance payment of 
£1,762, 48 monthly payments of £709.96 and there was a final optional payment of 
£24,143.86 if he wished to buy the car at the end of the agreement. 
The agreement set out that Mr H had the right to terminate it at any time before the final 
payment was due. In doing so, BMWFS would be entitled to the return of the car and at least 
half of the total repayable under the agreement. The agreement set out this was £29,991.97.
In 2020 Mr H voluntary terminated the agreement and returned the car to BMWFS, as was 
his right.
On returning the car Mr H was charged the following:
£347.00 damage charge
£4,590.01 excess mileage charge
£4,091.33 shortfall in 50% payment required to voluntary terminate
Mr H paid BMWFS the £347 damage charge. And this sum isnt in dispute.
Mr H hasnt paid BMWFS the £4,590.01 for excess mileage, or the £4,091.33 voluntary 
termination shortfall amount. And both these sums are in dispute.
The car was first supplied to Mr H with 30,300 miles on the odometer. The agreement details 
an annual mileage of 8,000 with a total maximum mileage of 62,967 (30,300 plus [8,000 x 49 
months/12 months]). The agreement also details that excess mileage is chargeable at 16.04 
pence per mile. 
When Mr H returned the car to BMWFS it had travelled 82,916 miles. And its for this reason 
that BMWFS charged him £4,590.01 (82,916 miles less 54,300 miles [30,300 plus 8,000 x 
36 months/12 months] x 16.04 pence.
When Mr H returned the car to BMWFS he had paid £25,900.64. And its for this reason that 
BMWFS charged him £4,091.33 (£29,991.97 less £25,900.64 [£1,762 advance payment 
plus 34 monthly payments of £709.96]).
Mr H disputes he should have to pay the sum of £8,681.34 being sought from him by 
BMWFS.
In summary he says that prior to entering into the agreement he had extensive discussions 
with the dealership (as supported by a number of electronic messages provided to our 
service). And following these discussions he was of the understanding that he could 
voluntary terminate the agreement (and return the car to BMWFS) at the time he ultimately 
did and he would have nothing further to pay.
Mr Hs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that it shouldnt 
be upheld. In summary he said that although Mr H had provided our service with a number 
of electronic messages exchanged between him and the dealership (covering a number of 
scenarios and options) these were insufficient for him to conclude that BMWFS should have 
to waive the sum of £8,681.34 it was seeking form him. Put another way, he said that 
BMWFS was entitled to hold Mr H to the written terms of the agreement he agreed to be 
bound by and which allow for a charge of £8,681.34 to be raised.
Mr H didnt agree with the investigators view and so his complaint has been passed to me 
for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I can confirm that Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator and for 
the same reasons. There is also very little I can usefully add to what has already been said.
Its clear Mr H has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed 
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their 
entirety. However, I trust that Mr H will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I 
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as 
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The purpose 
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them. 
I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or 
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
Having read all of the terms of the agreement as a whole, I dont think its either unclear or 
misleading as to what BMWFS can charge on it being voluntary terminated by Mr H. In my 
view it explains that Mr H would need to have paid, or would have to pay, at least 
£29,991.97 in payments (50% x £59.983.94) and that an excess mileage charge would be 
payable in the event Mr H travelled more (on average) than 666.66 miles a month whilst the 
car was on hire to him (at a cost of 16.04 pence per mile).
Despite what I say above, I accept that Mr H submits that regardless of what the agreement 
says, he entered into it on the strength of what he was told by the dealership. And this was 
that if he was to voluntary terminate it when he ultimately did, there would be nothing further 
for him to have to pay (including anything for excess mileage). 
I accept that some sort of discussion around the various termination options (including 
voluntary termination) that were open to Mr H took place with the dealership (including via 
electronic messaging), before Mr H decided to enter into the agreement that he did, and on 
the terms that he did.
But Im not persuaded that enough evidence has been provided for me able to reasonably 
conclude that the actual agreement Mr H entered into was misrepresented to him.In my view the evidence provided by Mr H lacks context and many of the numbers quoted 
in the various electronic messages that were exchanged, if not all of them, dont relate in any 
material respect to the agreement terms that Mr H ultimately agreed to be bound by. 
Furthermore, much of the evidence provided by Mr H could reasonably be interpreted as 
being in respect of the possibility of Mr H, at some point in time in the future, being able to 
part exchange the car with the dealership and have the agreement settled rather than Mr H 
being able to voluntary terminate the agreement, return the car to BMWFS, and have 
nothing further to pay.
I also think its worth reiterating what the investigator said. And that is the point in time in 
which an agreement can be voluntary terminated (with nothing further to pay) is dependent 
on several factors, including but not restricted to, the advance (deposit) paid, the monthly 
payments required, the length of the agreement, the size of the final (balloon) payment, the 
interest rate and the annual mileage set.
Furthermore, I think its worth pointing out that in my view it wouldnt have been particular 
onerous for Mr H, on having sight of the agreement he ultimately signed and entered into, to 
have worked out that the first point in time he could have voluntary terminated it with nothing 
further to pay (excluding damage and excess mileage charges) was after he had made his 
advance payment of £1,762 and 40 monthly payments of £709.96  making a total sum paid 
of £30,160.40 against 50% payable under the agreement of £29,991.97.
I also think that on having sight of the agreement he ultimately signed and entered into, that 
Mr H should have understood, or should have reasonably understood, that on voluntary 
terminating the agreement in certain circumstances an excess mileage charge would be 
payable.
I appreciate Mr H will be disappointed by my findings, but in summary Im satisfied that in the 
particular circumstances of this case BMWFS has done nothing wrong in seeking from Mr H 
the payment of £8,681.34.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 October 2021.
