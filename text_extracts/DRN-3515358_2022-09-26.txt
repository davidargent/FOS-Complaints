The complaint
Mr M complains that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
In January 2018 Mr M opened a credit card account with NewDay. He had an initial account 
limit of £1,200 which was increased to £2,400 in September 2018. Further increases in 
January and May 2019 resulted in an eventual credit limit of £4,300.
 
Mr M says that NewDay shouldnt have lent to him because he couldnt afford it. He 
indicates that if NewDay had done the checks on him which it should have done it would 
have realised he couldnt afford to repay the credit extended to him in a sustainable way 
over a reasonable period of time.
NewDay says that it did all the necessary and proportionate checks and these showed that 
Mr M could afford the credit that was extended to him.
Our investigator thought that NewDay shouldnt have lent to Mr M. They thought that 
NewDay should have completed further checks when it noted Mr Ms very low income and 
that these likely would have shown that he would struggle with any more debt. Our 
investigator thought that NewDays checks showed that Mr M had very little disposable 
income and would have struggled to make his repayments on the card in a sustainable way. 
Our investigator said that NewDay should refund any interest and charges paid by Mr M and 
it should remove any adverse information on Mr Ms record as a result of the interest and 
charges.
Mr M agreed with our investigators view. Despite a number of contacts with NewDay it did 
not respond to the view of the investigator. As NewDay did not respond with formal 
agreement, the case has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible 
lending - including the key relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our 
website and Ive taken that into account when considered Mr Ms complaint.
NewDay needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M could 
afford to repay what he was being lent in a sustainable manner. These checks could take 
into account a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment 
amounts, Mr Ms borrowing history and his income and expenditure.
 
NewDay says its credit check results didnt show anything negative to suggest it would have 
been unreasonable to have provided Mr M with the credit. It says it asked him about his 
income and it also had information about other credit he had elsewhere and that none of this 
caused concern. It says there was no evidence of hardship or vulnerability.
However, I think that the results of NewDays checks should have been a cause for concern. 
Mr M told NewDay that he earned only around £12,000 a year  less than £1,000 net a 
month. He had a mortgage of over £50,000 and no other income in the household. Even 
though it seemed he had only £400 in other unsecured debt his indebtedness score was 
high. NewDay didnt have any information about whether Mr M had any payday loans. I think 
these elements alone should have made NewDay seek a better understanding of Mr Ms 
financial situation before lending to him by at the very least verifying his income and 
expenditure.
Its not possible to tell exactly what additional checks NewDay might have done. In the 
absence of any further checks I think its reasonable to rely on the bank statements that Mr 
M has provided to this service to show what NewDay likely would have seen if it attempted 
to verify Mr Ms income and expenditure. Having reviewed these I think it is clear that he 
would struggle to repay any additional lending. His net income was actually only around 
£720 with his essential outgoings amounting to more than this. Mr M had no disposable 
income and no way of sustainably affording further credit.
 
I think it should have been evident to NewDay that Mr M wouldnt have had the capacity to 
sustainably repay the new account. It follows that I agree with our investigator that NewDay 
was wrong to lend to Mr M in the first place. 
Although it is not necessary for me to review the affordability of the further credit limit 
increases given my finding that NewDay should not have offered credit to Mr M at all, I think 
it is useful to set out what NewDay knew when it provided these increases.
Mr M quickly got into trouble with the credit after opening the account. Within three months 
of the account opening he was began to be regularly over the limit of his account and 
incurring charges for this. For a period of several months he seemed unable to bring his 
borrowing down below his credit limit and this was compounded by the charges imposed by 
NewDay. His available unsecured credit through other revolving credit sources increased 
greatly throughout the next few months until in September (when the first credit increase was 
provided) it had risen to over £4,000 and in December 2018 it reached nearly £14,000  
considerably in excess of a years gross income for Mr M. NewDay increased Mr Ms credit 
limit further in January 2019. This was clearly unaffordable for Mr M, and had he not been 
provided with the credit account in the first place these further increases couldnt have 
happened. 
Putting things right
As I dont think NewDay ought to have opened the account, I dont think its fair for it to be 
able to charge any interest or charges under the credit agreement. But I think Mr M should 
pay back the amounts he has borrowed. Therefore, NewDay should:
Rework the account removing all interest and charges that have been applied.
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Mr M along with 
8% simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. NewDay should also remove all adverse information regarding 
this account from Mr Ms credit file.
Or, if after the rework there is still an outstanding balance, NewDay should arrange an affordable repayment plan with Mr M for the remaining amount. Once Mr M has
cleared the balance, any adverse information in relation to the account should be
removed from his credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. It must give Mr M a 
certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if he asks for one. If it intends to apply the refund to reduce 
an outstanding balance, it must do so after deducting the tax.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ms complaint and direct that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua put things right in the 
way I have set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 October 2022.
