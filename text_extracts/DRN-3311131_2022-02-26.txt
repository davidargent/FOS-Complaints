The complaint
Mr W makes a number a number of complaints about National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) following a declined payment. 
What happened
Mr W says he went to a jeweller in July 2021 to buy an engagement ring. He says both of his 
NatWest account cards were declined which caused embarrassment. Mr W says he then 
went to a NatWest branch and asked to withdraw £3,300 from his account but was told the 
branch didnt have enough money for that withdrawal. He says he was able to withdraw the 
money from a different bank. Mr W says he, as a long-standing customer, has been treated 
badly and says this is a serious failing by NatWest.
NatWest says it has checked its records and can find no trace of an attempted payment by 
Mr Ws debit card. It says a declined transaction would result in an electronic footprint on its 
systems. NatWest says it has a record for an attempted payment by Mr W using his credit 
card which it approved but it says the merchant appears to have cancelled the transaction. It 
says it makes clear on its website that cash withdrawals over £2,000 require 24 hours notice 
and offered to make the payment by transfer but Mr W declined that option.
Mr W brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought there would be a record of a declined debit or credit card attempted payment and 
thought NatWest made clear on its website its cash withdrawal procedure. The investigator 
also thought NatWest had fairly offered to transfer the money.
Mr W doesnt accept that view and says NatWest has acted arrogantly and has refused to 
accept blame. He says NatWest owes him a duty of care and should not be able to hide 
behind the small print.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr W will be disappointed by my decision.
I have looked carefully at NatWests records and I cant see any failed debit card transaction 
attempts on the day in question. Im satisfied that if there was a failed attempt to pay by a 
debit card then an electronic footprint would have been created providing evidence of the 
failed transaction and the reason why. I can see that there is a record on NatWests systems 
of an attempt by Mr W to pay for the item by credit card. And that NatWest approved the 
transaction, but the merchant cancelled it. I dont think it clear what exactly took place, but I 
cant fairly hold NatWest responsible for the transaction being cancelled in these 
circumstances and dont think it made a mistake or acted unfairly.
I appreciate that Mr W attended a NatWest branch to withdraw what I accept was his money. 
But I am sure Mr W appreciates that NatWest does not hold each customers account 
balances in cash and has to have limits for cash withdrawals. I have looked at NatWests 
website and can see it makes clear that for cash withdrawals over £2,000 it requires 24 
hours notice. I dont think that information is contained in the small print as Mr W says but is 
prominently displayed within the relevant section online. 
I make clear to Mr W that we are not NatWests regulator and so its not our role to tell it 
what its withdrawal limits are in these circumstances.
I can see that NatWest offered to make the payment to the jeweller electronically. Its not 
clear what if any Mr Ws response to that was or why he didnt agree to that payment 
method. Im satisfied that NatWest offered an acceptable alternative to a cash withdrawal 
and acted fairly by making that offer.
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest was entitled to refuse Mr Ws cash withdrawal request 
and fairly offered an alternative. I cant fairly comment on another banks cash withdrawal 
policy. And Im satisfied that there is no evidence that I have seen that suggests NatWest 
blocked the payment attempts. But there is evidence the credit card payment was cancelled 
by the retailer.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 March 2022.
