K821x#15complaint
Mr J complains about a number of loans PDL Finance Limited  (trading as Mr Lender)  lent 
him. Mr J says the loans  were irresponsibly lent.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint where I set out a detailed back  ground to 
this complaint. Ive attached my provisional  decision here and it forms part of my final 
decision.
Both parties  have responded  to my provisional  decision and neither party  has fully agreed 
with my findings. Mr J has said he thinks Mr Lender shouldve taken its checks  further before 
lending loans 8 and 11. And Mr Lender has said its checks went  far enough before it lent 
Mr J loans 1 and 13.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And Ive also taken into account the 
comments both parties  have provided in response to my provisional decision.  And having 
done so, my decision remains unchanged  and Ill explain why below.
I agree  that loan 1 was the first loan Mr J was taking with Mr Lender but as I explained in my 
provisional decision, the circumstances of that loan persuade me that it wouldve been 
reasonable for Mr Lender to take its checks further.  Given that Mr J was due to repay what  I 
consider to be a substantial portion  of his declared income of £1,320,  Mr Lender shouldve  
been concerned  about  his ability to sustainably repay and should  have done more. The large  
proportion of his income  he had to repay  towards the loan makes it likely that hed struggle 
to repay.  It wouldve been reasonable to check his normal living costs and regular financial 
commitments. Mr Lenders check here werent  proportionate.
Mr Lender says it asked Mr J further  questions before lending this loan and Mr Js responses 
showed that he could afford the loan.  But given  that loan 13 was now Mr Js fourth loan in 
the lending chain and the loan was more than any of his previous  loans,  it wasnt reasonable 
for Mr Lender to rely on what Mr J told it at this stage and it shouldve  been verifying some of 
the information it was provided   such as requesting his pay slips or bank statements. Again, 
Mr Lenders checks werent proportionate here.
Mr J has said that Mr Lender shouldve taken its checks further before lending loans 8 and 
11. He said hed repaid the loans as payday loans and so Mr Lender shouldve been  doing 
more before lending.
I explained in my provisional decision  that before lending loans 8 and 11, Mr Lender checked 
Mr Js income,  expenses  and worked  out his disposable income. Both these loans  were  the 
second loans  in their lending  chains.  There was significant break in the lending  relationship  
between loans 6 and 7 and loans  9 and 10. To my mind, these breaks were significant 
enough to break the lending chain. What this means  is that given the length of time Mr J 
didnt borrow from Mr Lender  between  loans 6 and 7 and loans 9 and 10, Mr Lender could 
reasonably believe  that his finances had improved and that he didnt need to rely on these 
loans.
Ref: DRN83602942I accept that Mr J paid both loans 7 and 10 earlier than they were due but this was relatively  
early in the lending chain  and it wasnt unreasonable for Mr Lender  to think  a pattern of this 
repayment hadnt been formed  at the time it was lending loans 8 and 11.
Im not persuaded that Mr Lender needed to take its checks  further by verifying  the 
information Mr J provided when it lent loans 8 and 11. I think  it was reasonable at the stage 
of both these loans for Mr Lender to rely on what Mr J told it. Mr J has provided information 
to show that his actual financial circumstances meant he couldnt afford these loans but this 
isnt something Mr Lender wouldve found out from what I consider proportionate checks  and 
based on the information he chose  to disclose, these loans were  affordable.
Its likely  my conclusions wont fully satisfy  either  party but I hope my explanation will help 
Mr J and Mr Lender  understand  why I havent changed my decision.
As Mr Lender lent Mr J some loans that were unaffordable, it needs to put things right.
putting things right  what Mr Lender  should do
As I dont think  Mr Lender shouldve given Mr J some of the loans, it should;
 refund  the interest and charges Mr J paid for loans 1 to 6, 9 and 12 to 16
 add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when he paid them  until the 
date of settlement 
 remove any adverse information  about  these loans from Mr Js credit history
HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender must give 
Mr J a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Js complaint in part and require PDL Finance Limited to put things right as set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 June  2019.

complaint
Mr J complains about a number of loans PDL Finance Limited (trading as Mr Lender)  lent to him. He 
says the loans  were  lent irresponsibly as he couldnt afford the repayments.
background
Mr Lender lent Mr J 16 loans from August 2013 to April 2018. The first six loans were payday 
loans which were due to be repaid typically within a month, the other loans  were instalment loans 
due to be repaid within six to twelve  months.  Ive set out some of the loan information  in a table as 
an appendix to this decision.
When Mr J complained to Mr Lender about the loans, it upheld his complaint in part.
Mr Lender acknowledged that it shouldnt have lent Mr J loans 2 to 6 and agreed to refund the 
interest he paid towards those loans. Mr J wasnt satisfied with Mr Lenders  response and so he 
referred his complaint to this service where  it was looked at by one of our adjudicators.
Our adjudicator thought Mr Lenders checks for loans  1, 7, 8, 10 and 11 went  far enough. 
However, they thought Mr Lender  shouldve done more  before  lending loans 9 and 12 onwards 
but that proportionate checks were likely to have shown that loans 9 and 12 were affordable.  Our 
adjudicator recommended that loans  13 onwards should be upheld  on the basis that the repeat 
lending was unsustainable for Mr J.
Neither party  has fully agreed with our adjudicators assessment and as the complaint hasnt  been 
resolved, it has come  to me  an ombudsman  for a decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken  into account  the law, any relevant  regulatory  
rules and good industry practice at the time the loans  were offered.
At the time of loan 1, The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) was the regulator of lenders such  as Mr 
Lender and although the regulations at the time werent  prescriptive, Mr Lender was expected to 
check that Mr J could afford to repay each  loan before it lent to him. OFTs Irresponsible Lending 
Guidance states Assessing affordability  is a borrower-focussed test which  involves a creditor 
assessing a borrowers ability to undertake a specific credit commitment,  or specific additional 
credit commitment, in a sustainable manner,  without the borrower incurring  (further)  financial 
difficulties.
From loan 7 onwards, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) became  the regulator and its relevant 
regulations and guidance  include the Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC). CONC contains rules 
and guidance for lenders  about responsible lending.  Among other things, CONC  says lenders should 
carry out affordability checks which are proportionate in the circumstances of the loan - similar to the 
OFT guidance. The regulations also say repayments  should be sustainable (i.e. repayable from the 
borrowers income or savings)  and that lenders shouldnt allow a borrower to enter into consecutive 
credit agreements where it would be unsustainable to do so.
As Mr Lender should be aware, the fact that Mr J managed  to repay his loans doesnt mean that 
hes done so in a sustainable manner.
Ref: DRN83602944So in determining Mr Js complaint, Ive thought about the checks Mr Lender carried  out and whether 
those checks were sufficient and proportionate for each loan it lent. Ive also thought about whether  
any failings resulted  in Mr Lender lending to Mr J when  it shouldve known that he couldnt 
sustainably afford to repay.
were Mr Lenders checks proportionate?
Mr Lender has said it searched Mr Js credit file before lending and it asked him about  his income 
before lending loan 1 and took its checks further from loan 7 onwards by checking  his monthly  
expenses and working out his disposable  income.
Mr Lender has provided a summary of its search of Mr Js credit file and Mr J has provided a copy of 
his credit file and I cant see that there were  any defaults or county court  judgements (CCJs) 
recorded on his file.
loan 1
At the time of loan 1, Mr Js declared income  was £1,320. This loan was for £350 and from the credit  
agreement, Mr J had 23 days in which he had to repay £472.50 (capital + interest). I appreciate that 
Mr J repaid this loan within two days so he paid less in interest,  however at the time of the lending 
decision, Mr Lender wasnt aware Mr J was going  to repay the loan early. And so Ive considered  the 
affordability of this loan and subsequent loans  based on the contractual repayment  amounts.
As Mr Lender has agreed that it shouldnt have lent Mr J loans 2 to 6 and offered redress by 
refunding the interest Mr J paid towards this loan,  I havent reconsidered these loans  here as this 
redress is in line with what Id have directed Mr Lender to do if I decided it shouldnt
have lent. As far as I know this offer hasnt  been  withdrawn.
So my decision has focussed on the loans  that remain in dispute, loans 1 and 7 to 16.
I think  given Mr Js income, the repayment amount for loan 1 was a substantial portion  of his income 
and in the circumstances,  it wasnt reasonable for Mr Lender  to lend this loan without checking his 
monthly expenses and other credit commitments.  As such I dont think Mr Lenders checks for this 
loan went far enough. 
loans 7 to 9
There was a gap of around 10 months between the time Mr J repaid loan 6 and when  he 
borrowed loan 7. I think  this was quite a significant break in the lending and Ive taken this into 
account when thinking  about  Mr Lenders checks here.
These loans  were instalment loans to be repaid over six monthly instalments and the highest 
repayments for these  loans varied from around £373 to £386. Mr Js declared income was £1,350 
and according to Mr Lender, his disposable income was ranged from £514  to £734.
Loan 7 was for £800  an amount higher than any of Mr Js previous loans and he was going to be 
tied into repaying  this loan for six months. Given that it was the first loan in this chain, I think  Mr 
Lenders checks went far enough. As the circumstances  around loan 8 were similar to the previous 
loan, I also think Mr Lenders checks for loan 8 went far enough. And from the information  Mr J gave 
Mr Lender at the time, it suggests that he could  afford the repayment  of the loans.
However by loan 9, Mr J was borrowing  £1,000 and he had now been  borrowing from
Mr Lender for around 8 months  in this chain  and so I think Mr Lender shouldve taken  its checks  
further and shouldve asked  about his short term commitments as well. So I dont think  its checks for 
this loan went  far enough.  
Ref: DRN83602945loans 10 to 14
There was another  gap in the lending  between loans 9 and 10 of around 12 months. Again, I think 
this was a significant break in the lending chain. And so having considered the checks  Mr Lender 
carried out for loans 10 and 11, I think the checks went far enough given  that they were early  in the 
lending chain.  Both these loans were  to be repaid in six monthly  instalments  with the highest 
repayment amounts of £373  and £361. And based on the information Mr J gave Mr Lender, these  
loans seemed  affordable.
However for loan 12, Mr Lender  shouldve  been checking Mr Js short term commitments as well and 
for loans  13 and 14, it shouldve been looking to verify the information Mr J provided  about his income 
and expenses  before agreeing to lend. I say this because loan 12 was taken out within 3 days  of 
repaying loan 11, it was for a similar amount and Mr Lender shouldve been concerned  about whether 
Mr J was in a positon  to repay the loan.
There was a short break between  loans  12 and 13 but I dont consider this to be a significant break  
bearing in mind the large amounts of Mr Js previous  loans. Also, loan 13 was for an amount  higher 
than Mr Js previous  loans  and he was due to be tied into repaying the loan for 12 months and Mr 
Lender shouldve been looking to build a clear picture of his financial circumstances at this point 
including verifying some of the information Mr J provided.
By loan 14, I think Mr Lender shouldve been aware that Mr J was repaying these  loans as though 
they were payday loans,  hed repaid all the previous loans in this chain  much earlier than they were 
due and these payments  were more than £1,000 on each occasion. This essentially wouldve taken 
up almost all of Mr Js declared  income  so, it wasnt reasonable  to lend loan 14 without verifying 
some of the information  Mr J had provided.
So I think Mr Lender  shouldve done more before agreeing to lend loans 12 to 14.
loans 15 and 16
Again, there was a break  of nearly six months between loan 14 and 15 but given Mr Js history 
with Mr Lender, I think it shouldve been looking to build a clear  picture before agreeing to lend 
either one of these loans. It should also have been verifying some of the information Mr J 
provided.
Mr J was borrowing similar  amounts to his previous two loans and he was due to be tied into 
repaying these loans for 12 months. I consider this a significant amount  of time and it shouldve been 
concerned about Mr Js ability to sustainably repay the loans over the term.
what would sufficient  checks have shown?
loan 1
I think sufficient checks for loan 1 are likely  to have shown that Mr J couldnt sustainably afford to 
repay this loan. Ive used  Mr Js bank statements to reconstruct his financial circumstances at the 
time of some of the loans.  And from what I can see, Mr Js regular expenses  were around £500,  this 
included regular credit commitments and account fees and he had more than £400 outstanding in 
short term loans. Given his declared income  of £1,320, Mr J wasnt in a position to sustainably repay  
£472 for this loan.
Ref: DRN83602946loan 9 and 12
Mr J continued to borrowing  from other short  term lenders at the time of these loans  at the time of 
both loans, Mr J had more that £900 on each occasion outstanding  to other short  term lenders. And 
sufficient checks are likely to have shown that Mr J couldnt sustainably repay  these  loans as he was 
likely borrowing from other lenders to repay credit elsewhere.
loans 13 to 16
Had Mr Lender  verified some information about Mr Js income and expenses  as I think wouldve  
been reasonable for it to do before agreeing to lend these loans, its likely  to have found that Mr J 
was gambling  considerable  amounts regularly,  hed also continued to borrow substantial  sums from 
other short  term lenders.
In some months, hed gambled  more  than £10,000 and regularly  had outstanding short term 
commitments. I think the pattern of Mr J borrowing large  sums and repaying them within days of 
borrowing despite the twelve month term shouldve  have alerted Mr Lender that he may not have 
been repaying  out of his known income. This wasnt a sustainable position and in the circumstances,  
Mr Lender shouldnt  have been lending  to him.
In summary,  I think Mr J couldnt  afford to sustainably repay loans 1, 9 and 12 to 16. And Mr 
Lender shouldve carried out further checks before  lending and had it done so, as a responsible 
lender, I dont think it wouldve lent these loans to Mr J.
