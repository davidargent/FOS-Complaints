The complaint
Mr S is unhappy with how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA handled his concerns, when he 
contacted it about an upcoming inactive account fee.
What happened
Mr S has explained that in October 2020 he contacted PayPal for its assistance. This was 
because hed received an email from it, noting that an account he held with PayPal had been 
inactive. And a new fee was being implemented on accounts that had been inactive for 12 
months or more  and had a positive balance. This fee was £9.00 and due to be charged on 
16 December 2020.  
Given this notification, Mr S tried to access his inactive PayPal account online. Hes 
explained that at first he requested a password re-set, and was told an email would be sent 
to him, with a link for him to use. But this email never came. 
Mr S also explained that the tried to complete the customer verification process in a different 
way  by using the function that said a code could be sent to his landline. But, he then 
received a message from PayPal informing him his landline number couldnt be used, 
because of a technical error.
In addition to this, Mr S said there were other times when he was able to enter his security 
information  such as his password, and the Im not a robot security screen used. But, that 
at this stage, the website would get stuck  with it just showing the on-screen connection 
timer, but not moving on to the next page  essentially it just being stuck at this part in the 
process.
Mr S said he contacted PayPal about his issue on 30 October 2020. And he was promised a 
call back, within five to seven working days. But this didnt happen. On 11 November 2020 
Mr S contacted PayPal again, to raise his concerns. He let PayPal know he wanted the issue 
with is password resolved. And £75 compensation for the upset and inconvenience he has 
experienced as a result of the problem.
PayPal provided a response to Mr S concerns about the lack of a phone call, and the issue 
with accessing his account, on 8 December 2020. In this it said that whilst it could see Mr S 
had experienced some failed attempts at logging into his account, it didnt see any technical 
error on its part in relation to this. It also said that it had records that Mr S was later 
successful with logging into his account  and that this had been enough to ensure no 
charge for an inactive account was applied.
PayPal also noted it was aware Mr S had two accounts with it. And he may want to think 
about closing one of these, so as to avoid any inactivity fees in the future.
Mr S didnt feel this response resolved the issue. And so, he asked this service to provide an 
independent review. Mr S let this service know that he now felt that £150 would be a more 
appropriate compensation figure for the issues he experienced. And when speaking to our 
investigator Mr S said he now also wanted the PayPal account that was the subject of this 
complaint, to be closed by PayPal. 
Our investigator considered this complaint and didnt think it should be upheld. He said he 
hadnt seen evidence that Mr S problems with logging into his account were caused by 
PayPal. He noted that Mr S had been able to log into his account on a couple of occasions, 
and this meant he didnt get charged any inactivity fee. Our investigator did however agree 
that Mr S was given wrong information about receiving a call back. But he didnt think the 
impact of this caused enough trouble and upset to warrant a recommendation of 
compensation.
Lastly, our investigator understood that Mr S now wanted the account closed, and explained 
hes asked PayPal to do this  but hadnt heard as yet whether this had been completed.
Mr S didnt agree. He said:
Hed requested £150 compensation in relation to his complaint, and so wasnt happy 
that no compensation was recommended
Assuming 30 October 2020 was the first time he had tried to log into the PayPal 
account, it would have been this date that he was having issues as a result of 
remembering his password. But that following this his attempts to enter the account 
were met with obstruction by PayPal
When he apparently did manage to access the account on 31 October, 5 and 11 
November 2020, these were likely to have been the times he tried to log in, had 
successful password attempts, but then was met with the on-screen connection 
timer. Mr S felt this had to have been a technical issue with PayPal, given he was on 
PayPals website, and using its software
He had asked for his PayPal account to be closed but this hadnt been confirmed as 
completed
If PayPal had phoned him within five to seven days, as it said it would in October 
2020, he would have been told that hed been successful in logging into the account, 
and the matter would not have escalated as it has
The same issues with the inactivity charge may happen again in 2021, because the 
account had not been closed.
Since the above, PayPal have now confirmed that its transferred Mr S balance from this 
account  of £0.36 to his other account and was therefore in the process of closing the 
account. Our investigator confirmed this to Mr S, and he expressed his thanks for that.
Because Mr S didnt agree the investigators above outcome on this complaint, it has been 
referred to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint. Ive explained why below.
PayPal has explained that it changed the terms of its user agreement, so that accounts that 
had been inactive for 12 months or more, and had a positive balance, would be charged an 
inactive account fee. And its sent me a copy of its user agreement to show this was the 
case. 
Its also said it emailed Mr S because his account fell into this category  with it not having 
been active since 2016, and it having a balance of £0.36. Theres no dispute here that Mr S received an email about this. So, I havent needed to consider the communications received 
at that stage.
But what is in dispute is what happened with Mr S account following this. Mr S has accepted 
that his initial attempts to log in were due to a failure to remember his password. But, after 
this, he feels there were technical errors on PayPals side, as well as a failure to 
communicate with him about the issue. So, Ive thought carefully about these points. 
Mr S has raised that he couldnt access his PayPal account, firstly because of an issue with 
using his landline to receive a verification code. And secondly because after completing the 
Im not a robot security function, the account didnt load. A connection timer simply showed. 
Mr S feels this must have been technical issues with PayPal, because everything else his 
end was functioning properly. I dont dispute what Mr S has said about everything else 
working. But its difficult to conclude exactly what happened here. 
I say this because Im not able to see what Mr S saw at this time. There could be any 
number of reasons why errors occurred, or a screen didnt load as it should. I appreciate 
Mr S says he was using PayPals website and software, and so the most likely conclusion is 
that the errors were due to it. But PayPal has shown, in the form of screenshots that Mr S 
successfully logged into the account on a few occasions on its end. So, Im not satisfied 
there is sufficient evidence to show that PayPal did something wrong here. And therefore, I 
dont hold it accountable for the problems Mr S experienced at this stage.
Its important to note though, that even if I was to find PayPal were responsible for a 
technical error, which I dont, Im satisfied it didnt have a monetary impact on Mr S. PayPal 
has provided evidence to show, whether Mr S was aware of it or not, he had successfully 
logged in, and stopped any inactivity fee. So, there wouldnt be anything Id require PayPal 
to do in respect of any technical issues.
Mr S has raised that the failure of PayPal to call him back when asked meant he was unsure 
of what was happening with his account. 
PayPal hasnt provided any evidence to show that it did call Mr S back. And I have no doubt 
to dispute Mr S version of events here. I can see Mr S emailed PayPal after not receiving a 
call back, highlighting that this was the case. I can appreciate why Mr S feels let down here. 
If a call was promised to Mr S, I would expect that call to happen. So, I do think PayPal could 
have done more in relation this call.
So, Ive thought about the impact of this failure to call Mr S back. And I do recognise that Mr 
S feels £150 compensation should be paid to him. But it isnt this services role to punish a 
business for a mistake. Instead its our role to recommend compensation where doing so 
would be proportionate to recognise the level of trouble and upset caused. And in this 
instance, whilst I accept the failure to call back would be been inconvenient and frustrating 
for Mr S, I dont think there was any impact significant arising from PayPals failure here, for 
to me award compensation here. 
I note Mr S has said hed asked for his account to be closed. And I can see he did ask for 
this  once his case was referred to this service. But Im also aware that PayPals response 
to Mr S complaint did say to him he should consider whether he wanted to close his 
account. And I cant see Mr S responded to PayPal at this point and made a request for this 
to happen. 
My understanding is that following our investigators involvement the balance in the account 
has been moved, and PayPal confirmed it was in the process of closing the account. Neither party has shown any reoccurrence of concerns around an inactive account, that any charges 
have been applied to this account, or that the account closure hasnt happened. So, I dont 
think there is anything further that PayPal need to do at this stage.
My final decision
Given the above, I dont uphold this complaint  meaning I dont require PayPal (Europe) 
Sarl et Cia SCA to do anything more in respect of this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 March 2022.
