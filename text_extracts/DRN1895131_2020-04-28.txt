K821x#15Complaint
Ms L says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading  as Sunny)  irresponsibly lent to her.
Background
This complaint is about one running  account credit  facility  and eleven  high-cost short  term 
credit instalment loans  that Sunny provided  to Ms L between May 2014  and December 2017. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Ls complaint and thought that she shouldnt  have been provided 
with any of the instalment loans from loan 9 onwards. Sunny didnt agree in full. So the 
complaint was passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the key relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms L could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided. Having 
looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Ms L, I think  that Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that Ms L was unlikely to have been able to make  her payments in a 
sustainable manner  when it provided Ms L with instalment  loan 9. 
I say this because  Ms L exhibited a borrowing pattern of taking  out further loans not too long 
after repaying previous  ones.  Indeed  loan 9 was taken for double the amount of loan 8 and it 
was taken while loan 8 was being  repaid.  
Ref: DRN18951312Sunny continued  lending  to Ms L even  when this pattern was repeated and in circumstances 
where it ought reasonably to have realised  that any further loans were more likely than not 
unsustainable for her. 
Ms L had to pay interest and charges on loans that Sunny shouldnt have provided her with. 
So I think that she lost out and Sunny should  put things right.
Putting things  right  what  Sunny needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms L paid on instalment loans  9 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
all reference to instalment loans 9 to 11 should  be removed from Ms Ls credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms L a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Ls complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Ms L compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 May 2020.
