K821x#15complaint
Mr N says CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid irresponsibly  lent to him. Mr N also 
says that QuickQuid debited his account when it shouldnt have done and that caused him 
hardship.
background
This complaint is about two payday loans QuickQuid provided to Mr N between  January and 
July 2018. Loan 1 was taken out in January 2018 for £350, Mr N was due to make three 
repayments towards the loan; £56, £78.40 and £442.40. Loan 2 was taken out in July 2018 
for £550 and Mr N also needed  to make three repayments of £176,  £123.20  and £686.40.
Mr N has fully repaid loan 1 but theres  an outstanding balance on loan 2.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ns complaint in part and thought that QuickQuid shouldnt have 
lent him loan 2. QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr N 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr N should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr N could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN64094952Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint.
Affordability of the loans.
QuickQuid has provided information to show the checks it carried  out before lending  any of 
the loans to Mr N. From  what I can see, QuickQuid checked Mr Ns employment and 
housing status  and at the time, Mr N was renting and employed.  It also checked his income  
which is declared as £1,600 and his living expenses which varied from £850 to £852. 
QuickQuid also says it searched Mr Ns credit file, it hasnt provided the results  of its search 
so I cant say what its search revealed.  QuickQuid says it used information from credit 
reference agencies  to work out Mr Ns estimated disposable income. Although it hasnt 
explained how it calculated this figure,  it said worked out Mr Ns estimated disposable 
income for loan 1 as £629.75  and loan 2 as £750.
Mr N had three pay periods to repay  loan 1 which meant that on average he needed to pay 
around £192 each month  towards the loan. Given that this was Mr Ns first loan with 
QuickQuid, I think QuickQuids checks for this loan went far enough. Looking at Mr Ns 
income and expenses, it suggests he was in a position to afford  the loan repayments over 
the three month  period.
Mr N repaid loans 1 in May 2018 and in July 2018,  he requested loan 2. This was for a 
higher amount that his previous loan and I can see that he had difficulties repaying loan 1. In 
March 2018, he contacted  QuickQuid  to say he was in financial difficulties and his account 
was placed in hardship status. I can also see that when repaying this loan he wasnt able to 
follow the payment  schedule  set out by QuickQuid and repaid this loan more  than a month 
after it was due and he incurred late fee charges.
Given the level of difficulties Mr N had when repaying loan 1 and the knowledge  that 
QuickQuid had about his financial difficulties, I dont  think  it was reasonable to carry out the 
same level of checks before agreeing to lend loan 2. By the time Mr N was applying for loan 
2, QuickQuid should have been  taking its checks further and should have conducted a full 
review of Mr Ns financial  circumstances before lending.
Mr Ns disposable income for loan 2 was £750 and on average he had to repay  around  £328 
over three pay periods  towards  loan two. Mr Ns monthly repayments towards this loan was 
a significant portion of his disposable  income and in my opinion, QuickQuid shouldve  
recognised that there was a significant risk hed struggle to repay this loan and it shouldnt 
have lent to him. Particularly  given Mr Ns history with QuickQuid and what QuickQuid knew 
about him.
Ref: DRN64094953As it turns out, Mr N has been unable to repay  this loan and fell into financial difficulties and 
theres an outstanding balance  on the loan.
QuickQuid debiting Mr Ns account
When Mr N fell into financial difficulties with repaying loan 2, QuickQuid worked  out a 
payment plan with Mr N. I can see that on 12 November  2018, QuickQuid agreed a payment 
plan of £80 per month with Mr N and on the same  day it debited  his account with £80. Mr N 
says he didnt authorise QuickQuid to debit his account with £80 as he couldnt afford that 
amount.
QuickQuid has provided us with its system notes and Mr N has provided  copies of his bank 
statements for November  2018. And I can see that QuickQuid did debit Mr Ns account on 
12 November 2018 and on the same  day a refund was processed.  So I cant  see that Mr N 
was deprived of the funds. In fact Mr Ns bank statements show  that the refund was credited 
into his account  on 12 November 2018  before the debit was processed  and deducted  from 
his account on 14 November 2018. 
So while I agree that it wasnt  ideal that QuickQuid incorrectly debited  Mr Ns account,  I think  
it quickly took the necessary steps to rectify  the error. And in that regard, I think  it acted 
fairly.
In relation to loan 2, Mr N has lost out as a result of being lent this loan and QuickQuid 
needs to put things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
Theres an outstanding balance on loan 2, so QuickQuid  should remove  any interest 
and charges added to the current balance.
QuickQuid should treat any payments  towards the loan Mr N has made  as 
repayments towards the capital  amount of £550.  
If the steps above reflect that the principal has been repaid then any surplus should 
be paid to Mr N with interest of 8% simple a year from the date of payment to the 
date of settlement.
If theres still an outstanding capital balance after doing this then it should treat Mr N 
positively and sympathetically working with him to come  a reasonable payment plan 
within his circumstances.
When the loan has been repaid, QuickQuid should remove  any negative  information 
about this loan from Mr Ns credit file;
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ns complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should pay Mr N compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 September  2019.
