The complaint
Mr H complains that National Westminster Bank Plc no longer makes it possible to register 
his debit card for use abroad using his online account.
What happened
In March 2023 Mr H registered his credit card via his online NatWest account for a trip 
abroad. NatWest requested a call to complete the process and said it could only register 
credit cards, not debit cards and Mr H had to repeat the process. Mr H said he has to go 
through the same online and phone process each time he goes abroad. He said NatWest 
told him he would have to register his debit card via its banking app. He said he explained to 
NatWest that he cant as he doesnt have a suitable phone. 
Mr H complained to NatWest, but said it initially ignored his lack of a suitable mobile phone 
(he says hes never used an app). Mr H pointed out that it wasnt possible for him to follow 
NatWests policy to have an app and considers this policy to be ageist and biased against 
people who cant afford a suitable mobile phone.
NatWest confirmed that cards could only be registered its mobile phone app. NatWest 
referred to its website that states its no longer essential to register travel plans, but it can be 
done via the app as an option. NatWest apologised for Mr Hs phone experience and paid 
him £70 for call waiting time. 
Mr H was dissatisfied with NatWests reply and referred his complaint to our service. Our 
Investigator didnt recommend it be upheld. He said NatWest accepted it gave Mr H poor 
service by asking him to call to complete the registration when this wasnt possible without 
the mobile banking app. But he thought NatWests compensation of £70 is in line with our 
approach for the unnecessary inconvenience caused to Mr H, and being misinformed. 
Mr H disagreed and requested an ombudsman review his complaint. He said just because 
its no longer obligatory to register NatWest cards for foreign trips, its still discriminatory to 
prevent those who dont have a banking app from doing so. He said on previous occasions 
he had succeeded in getting his credit and debit cards registered by phone but hadnt always 
received good customer service. He said he was seeking compensation. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H thinks its unethical for a bank to demand its customers have the latest mobile phones 
in order to carry out basic banking functions. He finds it strange that NatWest has stopped 
registering a bank card for use abroad by online or phone means, when the identity of an 
individual is not in question.
I sympathise with Mr H for his frustration in trying to register his bank cards via his online 
account and when advised, by phone only to discover this wasnt possible. NatWest has 
acknowledged that it misinformed, and inconvenienced Mr H when it asked him to call to 
register his card, when that wouldnt have been possible for him. 
Theres no requirement from NatWest for a customer to register cards for trips abroad. 
NatWest makes this point on its website, but also states, How do I register if I want to do it 
anyway? Mr H knew he didnt have to register his cards, but thought it would minimise 
inappropriate blocking of transactions. I understand Mr Hs concern, but this isnt how banks 
protect accounts. Banks monitor payments as part of the fraud process and they are not 
thought to be questionable just because the transaction has taken place abroad. This means 
that a transaction may be blocked on the risk of it being fraudulent, as opposed to where it 
takes place.
And so, in practice a customers account may be blocked due to the use of the card in 
connection with a merchant considered to be high risk and one that could compromise the 
account. Or it may be that the transaction is well outside of what might be considered normal 
for a customer and is blocked for that reason. 
Again, registering the card for use abroad doesn't stop a block being placed on the account, 
as the bank is monitoring the nature of the transaction itself. This means that a bank card 
can be blocked abroad in the same way as it could be in the UK, even when the mobile 
banking app holds a register of travel plans. I can confirm that Ive used bank cards in the 
same country as Mr H for 30 years without registering them and have suffered no 
disadvantage. 
Having said this, Mr H wished to use the service offered by NatWest and his time was 
wasted to some extent on the phone trying to accomplish this. Im pleased NatWest has 
apologised to Mr H and paid him £70 compensation. I think this is a reasonable reflection of 
the inconvenience he has been caused.  
I think Mr H has raised his complaint mainly as a potential legal and regulatory issue about 
NatWests policy. It's not our role to tell a business how it should operate accounts, in this 
case NatWests mobile phone app. Our role is to decide what's fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of a complaint, and to do so we take the law, in this case the Equality Act 
2010 into account. 
In considering a complaint, we can only consider the actual impact on a consumer, not what 
might have happened. Although I can understand Mr Hs frustration with NatWest, I dont 
agree that NatWest has intentionally reduced the protection afforded to older customers 
travelling abroad, by blocking their ability to register their travel plans in advance. And I 
havent found any evidence that NatWest has discriminated against Mr H in its operation of 
the banking app.
NatWest should have provided Mr H with the correct information about registering bank 
cards for use abroad, but had it done so the outcome would have been the same in that 
theres no requirement to register travel plans anymore. So I agree with the investigator that 
NatWest hasnt been ageist in the operation and policy towards its phone app and so I cant 
uphold his complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 November 2023.
