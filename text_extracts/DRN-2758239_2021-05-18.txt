DRN-2758239
The complaint
D complains about TransferWise Ltds actions when trying to recall a payment they made in 
error. D doesnt think TransferWise have taken reasonable steps to get their money back, 
which in turn has caused them financial distress.
What happened
In September 2019, D asked TransferWise to transfer around 7,000,000 JPY to a company 
in Japan. Due to the way the information was presented to D by their supplier, D entered 
incorrect information when asking TransferWise to make the payment.
TransferWise executed the payment in line with the request made by D. However due to the 
incorrect details being entered, the money was transferred to a third-party bank instead of 
the intended recipient. The destination bank matched the account details with one of their 
customers and credited it to the account.
Around a month later, D was contacted by a third-party individual letting them know that they 
had received the money in their account. D got in touch with TransferWise to explain what 
had happened and asked for the money to be returned so it could be sent to the correct 
recipient.
TransferWises internal investigations highlighted the initial error made on the payment 
transfer request. TransferWise, along with their partner bank, sent several SWIFT messages 
to the third-party bank who received the credit in an attempt to recall it. TransferWise didnt 
receive a response from the third-party bank and therefore D, and the intended recipient, is 
still without the money.
Ds solicitor contacted the third-party bank directly. They said they hadnt received any 
SWIFT messages from TransferWise and asked that an indemnity be raised. D asked 
TransferWise to raise the indemnity but TransferWise said they werent obliged to do that. 
And they werent prepared to offer this to D as a solution to the matter, as they could then be 
held liable for any future issues with the payment.
D complained and said because of this issue, the company was struggling financially. D 
brought the complaint to our service.
The investigator who reviewed the complaint didnt ask TransferWise to do anything 
differently. She said that TransferWise executed the payment in line with the instruction and 
was satisfied that theyd made reasonable efforts to get it back by sending the SWIFT 
messages. 
D didnt agree. In summary, they said they dont think TransferWise took reasonable steps to 
get the money back because:
They didnt make telephone contact with the third-party bank, and
They sent the money to an account which didnt match the details entered. D thinks 
this is a breach of TransferWises contractual abilities.
The investigator responded to D and explained that where international payments are made, 
SWIFT messages are the recognised method of communication. And while she wasnt 
aware of what D meant by the details not matching  she confirmed that the IBAN and 
BIC/SWIFT codes did match  and thats all the regulations require. 
D responded and asked if it was the role of the service to ensure the third-party bank 
responded to the SWIFT messages. And they said that its unlikely the intended recipient of 
the funds, and the business where the funds were actually sent could be a match because of 
the different countries.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to review. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding Ds complaint. I know this will be disappointing for D so 
Ive explained my reasons below. Its also important for me to point out that my decision only 
focuses of the actions of TransferWise. Im aware D is also unhappy with the actions of the 
third-party company involved who is holding on to their money and not responding to the 
SWIFT messages sent by TransferWise. But I cant and wont comment on the actions of 
that company.
Ive reviewed the payment instruction which D sent to TransferWise  and Im satisfied 
TransferWise made the payment in line with the instruction they received. While Im aware D 
made an error when sending the payment instruction to TransferWise, I cant fairly uphold 
Ds complaint on that point. 
D has raised the inaccuracies between the intended recipient  a company in Japan  and 
the actual recipient  a third-party account with another financial business. D has queried 
why the payment was allowed to be transferred with these inaccuracies. In this case, the BIC 
and IBAN numbers D provided acted as the unique identifiers. And TransferWise credited 
the money to the correct account which D had specified, using those numbers. I cant fairly 
hold TransferWise responsible for sending the money to an incorrect account when they 
acted on the instructions given to them by D. And the investigator has helpfully explained 
that theres no further checks which need to be carried out, such as the payee name 
matching, for international payments. 
Its important for me to consider TransferWises actions once they became aware the money 
had been sent to the incorrect account. When D raised the issue with TransferWise, around 
a month afterwards, TransferWise proceeded to send a SWIFT message to the destination 
bank without any undue delays. TransferWise then went on to send a further two messages 
when they hadnt received a response. I recognise that D thinks TransferWise should have 
done more to get in touch with the third-party bank  like make a phone call. But I cant 
reasonably ask TransferWise to do that. 
SWIFT is an electronic messaging system used to send messages between financial 
organisations and therefore TransferWise have used an appropriate and recognised method 
of communication when trying to resolve the issue. Im satisfied, based on the evidence Ive 
seen, that TransferWise acted promptly in sending the first SWIFT message  and the 
subsequent SWIFT messages  in an attempt to recall the money which had been sent in 
error. Im aware the destination bank hasnt responded to TransferWises SWIFT messages. 
But that isnt the fault of TransferWise.D has explained that their solicitors got in touch with the third-party bank and they explained 
theyd need an indemnity from TransferWise. But TransferWise have said they arent willing 
to provide an indemnity as they could then be held liable for any future disputes with the 
money. I appreciate why this would be extremely frustrating for D, but I cant fairly say 
TransferWise have acted unreasonably by saying this. To explain, TransferWise have made 
a payment based on the instructions they received from D. Therefore, if TransferWise were 
to raise an indemnity and then the actual recipient raised a claim, TransferWise would be 
liable to pay that money to the recipient. I dont agree its reasonable for D, or anybody else, 
to expect TransferWise to take on that liability  especially when the initial error wasnt the 
fault of TransferWise.
Overall, I dont doubt this is a really difficult time for D, and no doubt it is causing a lot of 
financial distress. But to fairly uphold this complaint Id need to be satisfied that 
TransferWise have made an error or acted inappropriately. And based on the circumstances 
of this complaint, I dont think they have. And therefore, I wont be asking TransferWise to do 
anything to put things right.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 June 2021.
