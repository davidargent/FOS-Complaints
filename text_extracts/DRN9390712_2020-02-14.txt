Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ws complaint about loans 6, 7 and 13  20 and thought  these 
loans shouldnt have  been given. Money Solutions  disagreed on the basis that Mr W ceased 
borrowing for six months after loan 7  so it doesnt  agree that he had become dependent on 
short term loans. It also says that all the loans from loans 12  20 were repaid  on time 
without default.  And the amounts borrowed for loans 17, 18, 19 and 20 were 50% lower  than 
loans 12  16, which shows Mr W was able to reduce his reliance on short-term  loans. So as 
Money Solutions didnt  agree, the complaint has been  passed  to me to make a final 
decision.
my findings
Ref: DRN93907122Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Money Solutions needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure 
Mr W could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account  
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Money Solutions should fairly  and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Money Solutions was required to 
establish whether  Mr W could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. 
Our adjudicator didnt  feel that loans 1  5 and loans  8  12 should be upheld. Mr W seems  
to have accepted these  findings so as these  loans are no longer in dispute, I havent 
considered these further. But I have thought  about  all of Mr Ws loans when considering his 
overall lending  relationship with Money Solutions. 
Ref: DRN93907123Our adjudicator also considered the gaps in lending between loans 7 and 8 and between  
loans 11 and 12 to be significant enough  to represent breaks in the lending  chain.  This 
means that when Mr W came back to borrow loan 8 and loan 12, Money Solutions could 
treat these  as new sets of borrowing for the purpose determining  whether it was safe to lend 
to him. Neither party has disputed this finding,  so Ive also considered  these gaps to have 
broken the lending chain.  
Ive seen that Money Solutions carried out an income and expenditure check  for all of Mr 
Ws loan. But, looking at the first chain of lending, by the time Mr W came  back  to borrow  
loan 6, I think a proportionate  check wouldve included a more thorough check of Mr Ws 
financial situation. As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate check for loan 6 would most 
likely have shown that Mr W had several  short-term loans with other providers and had also 
been making payments into a debt management  plan. And in such  circumstances, I think  a 
reasonable lender ought to have realised that Mr W was not managing  his money  and so it 
should not have lent Mr W loan 6.  
Ive also looked  and the third loan chain and considered  the evidence  provided from Money  
Solutions about loans 13  15. The income  and expenditure records from the time show that 
Mr Ws loan repayments for these loans were  more than his available  monthly  disposable 
income. So, its clear from the evidence  that loans 13, 14 and 15 were not affordable for 
Mr W and its unlikely he wouldve been able to pay these  loans  back without borrowing 
further from Money Solutions, or another source. As a result,  I dont think Money  Solutions  
shouldve agreed  to lend Mr W loans 13, 14 and 15.    
Ive then moved on to looked at the overall pattern of Money Solutions lending  history with 
Mr W, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Money Solutions should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable  in either of these loan chains,  or otherwise 
harmful. And so Money Solutions should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case for the first loan chain, I think  that this 
point was reached by loan 7. I say this because:
At this point Money Solutions ought  to have realised Mr W was not managing to 
repay his loans sustainably. Mr W had taken out seven loans within  eight months, 
and even though he wasnt in debt to Money Solutions for the entire period, I think  all 
seven loans are close  enough to form one chain of lending and a pattern of regular 
borrowing. So Money Solutions ought to have realised it was more  likely than not 
Mr W was having  to borrow further  to cover  his the hole repaying previous  loans  was 
leaving in his finances.
Mr Ws first loan was for £200 and loan 7 was for £300,  so his borrowing  was not 
significantly decreasing  over this chain of borrowing. At the point  of application for 
loan 7 Money Solutions ought  to have  considered  Mr Ws history with them so far 
and realised that Mr W was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Money Solutions. 
Loan 7 was taken out eight months after Mr Ws first, and it was for a larger  amount. 
Even though Mr W repaid  all his loans on time,  he had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect, service  a debt to Money Solutions  over an extended period.
Ref: DRN93907124Money Solutions says that as Mr W didnt borrow again for several  months after loan 7, this 
shows that he wasnt dependant on these  loans, however, at the time Mr W applied for loan 
7 there  was no way for Money Solutions  to know whether  or not Mr W would  borrow  again. 
The fact remains that based on Mr Ws circumstances a responsible lender ought not to 
have given Mr W loan 7 in the first place. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case for the third loan chain, Money Solutions 
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful  
by loan 16. I say this because:
Mr W had been in debt with Money  Solutions in this loan chain  for more than eleven 
months, and he had taken out four loans in this time. 
The amount  he was borrowing was not reducing over this time, he had taken out four 
loans for £300,  and then applied for a loan 16 for £400. So, by this point Money 
Solutions ought to have  known  that Mr W borrowings was not decreasing  over time.   
Money Solutions says that loans Mr Ws loans were all paid on time with no defaults and 
Mr W never raised any financial difficulties with it. It also says that loans 17 - 19 were 50% 
lower than loans  12  16, so Mr W has shown that he reduced his reliance  on much higher 
loans and ceased to take any further  loans after loan 20. But again, this information was not 
available at the time Mr W applied for loan 16. And at the time of application  a responsible  
lender ought to have realised that Mr W had developed  a pattern of repeat lending  and not 
lent to Mr W further.    
So overall, I think that Mr W lost out because  Money Solutions provided Mr W loan 7 and 
continued to provide borrowing from loan 16 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 and 7 and loans 13 onwards. Money 
Solutions should put things right.
putting things right  what Money Solutions needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on 6 and 7 and loans 13 onwards ;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 6, 13, 14 and 15 from Mr Ws credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 and loans 16 onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about these loans should be removed 
from Mr Ws credit file.
Ref: DRN93907125 HM Revenue & Customs requires Money  Solutions to take off tax from this interest. Money 
Solutions must give Mr W a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Money  Solutions  
Limited should put thing right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2020
