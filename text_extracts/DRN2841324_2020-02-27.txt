Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Js complaint and thought  the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because Mr J had outstanding loans  with Sunny at the time which 
could have indicated  he was having  problems managing his money. They also felt Mr Js 
pattern of borrowing indicated he was becoming reliant on these types of loans. 
Sunny disagreed and said it had done robust  checks on Mr J before lending to him. But it 
offered to uphold Mr Js complaint for loan 10 and 11 but Mr J declined the offer. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr J could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN28413242the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Js complaint. Having done  so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 4. Mr J 
didnt respond  to the view. As there appears  to no longer be a dispute about these loans, I 
wont be making any findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 5 to Mr J and the results of these checks  
didnt raise any concerns.  But this was Mr Js fifth loan in less than two months so I think  
Sunny should  have  been looking to build a clearer picture than it did about Mr Js finances 
before lending to him again.  
But if it had carried out proportionate checks before lending loan 5, its likely to have found 
that Mr J was borrowing  from another  short-term lender as well as having loans 2, 3 and 4 
still outstanding  with itself. It will have also seen that Mr J had significant gambling  
transactions on his account and was struggling financially. Looking  at the information 
provided, at the time loan 5 was taken out, Mr J owed £122  to the other  short-term  lender 
and his bank statements  showed his gambling transactions had used nearly half of his 
visible income (which appears to be a lot less than the amount Mr J had told Sunny on his 
application). 
I think all of this should have been enough  for Sunny to be concerned  that Mr J wouldnt be 
able to repay his loan in a sustainable way. 
Ref: DRN28413243Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr J, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr J was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr J had taken out six loans within seven months and had been  
indebted to Sunny  for all this time. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely 
than not Mr J was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole repaying his previous  
loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Js indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Mr Js first loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £200.  At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that it was likely Mr J wasnt just borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  
in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr J was provided  with a new loan within  weeks of taking out a 
previous one. 
Mr J wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  11 was 
taken out 10 months after Mr Js first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr J had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr J lost out because Sunny provided  borrowing for loan 6 onwards because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Mr J borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Js ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN28413244putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 5 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Mr Js credit file;
any information recorded about  loans  6 to 11 is adverse. So, all entries about these 
loans should be removed from Mr Js credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited must give Mr J a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Js complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 March  2020.
