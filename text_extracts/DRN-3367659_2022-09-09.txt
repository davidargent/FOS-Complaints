The complaint
Mr D complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA made changes to online security following 
which he was locked out of his account for over nine months.
What happened
Mr D has an account with PayPal which hes used for over ten years. He says his account 
allows him, amongst other things, to sell items online.
In November 2020 Mr D says PayPal made changes to its online security meaning that he 
sometimes needed a one-time passcode (OTP) in order to use his account. He complained 
to PayPal saying that he wasnt receiving the code on his landline.
PayPal investigated Mr Ds complaint and said that it was having problems sending OTPs to 
landlines. PayPal apologised for the inconvenience and said that there were other ways in 
which Mr D could generate an OTP or receive one. PayPal said OTPs could be sent to a 
mobile phone  all he needed to do was register his number if he had a mobile  and he 
could generate OTPs using software that could be downloaded. Mr D says he tried to 
register his mobile number but couldnt do so because he had to pass security first and this 
meant receiving an OTP to his landline. He downloaded the software too but says it didnt 
work. PayPal also said that Mr D could email if he wanted to move money out of his account.
In May 2021 Mr D complained to us saying that hed spent a lot of time trying to resolve the 
problems he was having with PayPal but was still unable to use his account.
In August 2021, following our involvement, PayPal said that it had fixed the technical issue it 
was having sending one-time passcodes to landlines. Mr D confirmed the issue had been 
fixed and hes had access to his PayPal account since August 2021. However, he wanted 
compensation for all the distress and inconvenience hed been caused in the meantime.
Our investigator looked into Mr Ds complaint and said that PayPal had offered Mr D a 
couple of options that would have worked  he could have added his mobile number if hed 
called them and asked them to do so and he could have taken PayPal up on its offer to send 
an email if he wanted to move money out of his account. But our investigator did think 
PayPal could have done more, and that Mr D had been inconvenienced. So, they 
recommended that PayPal pay him £125 in compensation. PayPal agreed to our 
investigators recommendation. Mr D, on the other hand, didnt think that the compensation 
recommended reflected the distress and inconvenience hed been caused not having access 
to his account for nine months. He asked for an ombudsman to look into his complaint. So, 
thats what Ive done. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal accepts that there was a problem sending OTPs to Mr Ds landline between 
November 2020 and August 2021. There was, in fact, a straightforward solution to this 
problem. Mr D had a mobile phone to which OTPs could have been sent  all that was 
needed was for that number to be added to Mr Ds account. Mr D tried this but says couldnt 
do so because he had to pass security first which meant receiving an OTP to his landline. 
There was another way of doing this, however. PayPal could have added his mobile number 
if hed called them. PayPal didnt suggest this, and I do think they could and should have 
done so. Instead PayPal emailed Mr D  on 7 December 2020 and 11 February 2021  
instructions to download software that would generate OTPs. Mr D tried to use the software 
suggested but couldnt get it to work properly. In short, I do think both parties could have 
solved this problem sooner, but I agree too with our investigator that the greater burden for 
doing so was on PayPal. So, I agree that it would be right to award Mr D compensation to 
reflect the distress and inconvenience of not having full access to his account.
Mr D says he had to shield and couldnt do his normal job during Covid. Hes told us he 
wanted to buy and sell items online to raise money but didnt because any money he raised 
would have ended up stuck in his PayPal account. He says that this made his financial 
situation more difficult. I can, however, see that PayPal emailed Mr D on 15 April 2021 to say 
that it could arrange for funds in his PayPal account to be transferred to his bank account if 
he emailed a specific address. Mr D didnt do so  but its an option that would have allowed 
him to access any money he raised. PayPal didnt, however, suggest this April 2021. So, I 
think its fair to take some of the distress and inconvenience this caused Mr D into account.
Putting things right
I agree with Mr D that £125 doesnt fully reflect the distress and inconvenience he 
experienced whilst waiting for a solution. As Ive already said, PayPal offered a workaround 
in April 2021 that would have allowed Mr D to buy and sell online and I do think both sides 
could have found a solution sooner than August 2021. Taking all of that into account, I think 
an award of £300 is fair and reasonable. So thats the award Im going to make.
My final decision
My final decision is that I require PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to pay Mr D £300 in 
compensation in full and final settlement of his complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 October 2022.
