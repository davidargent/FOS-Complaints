K820x#14complaint
Mrs R says The Royal Bank  of Scotland Plc (RBS) mis-sold her a payment protection 
insurance (PPI)  policy.  
background
This complaint is about a credit  card PPI policy taken out in 2004.  The policy was added  to 
Mrs Rs credit card account when she applied for the card by post. 
Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint.  Mrs R disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  the sale of PPI on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding 
Mrs Rs case. 
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Rs complaint because:
 I think RBS made Mrs R aware that the PPI was optional  and that she chose to take it 
 although I can understand  why she can no longer  remember  this. 
 RBS didnt recommend the PPI to Mrs R so it didnt have to check if it was suitable for 
her. 
 Its possible the information RBS gave Mrs R about the PPI wasnt as clear as it should 
have been. But Mrs R chose to take out the policy  and so appears to have wanted this 
type of cover. She was not affected  by any of the exclusions  or limitations and the 
policy was competitively priced  and apparently affordable. So I think  it unlikely Mrs R 
would have made a different decision if better information had been provided. On 
balance I think she would  still have  taken out the policy.
Ive taken into account all of Mrs Rs comments, including what  shes said about her 
redundancy benefits. But this point doesnt  change  my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Rs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs R to let me 
know whether she accepts or rejects my decision before  9 November 2019.
