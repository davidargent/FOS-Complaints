K821x#15complaint
Mr L complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid, (QQ), and
Pounds to Pocket,  (P2P),  gave him loans  that he couldnt afford to repay. The complaint  
has been brought to this service on Mr Ls behalf by a claims management company. But for 
ease I shall refer below to all actions being  taken  by Mr L.
background
Mr L was given six payday loans and a flex credit account by QQ between September 2011 
and July 2013. And P2P gave him two instalment loans and two refinance loans between 
November 2012  and May 2015. The instalment loans were repayable by 12 monthly 
instalments. All the loans have been repaid. A summary of the loans  taken out by Mr L is 
shown below:

CashEuroNet said that it didnt consent to Loan  1 being considered as it was outside  the 
complaint handling time limits. It also said that the loan repayments  were for a small 
percentage of Mr Ls income. Its credit checks before Loans 6 to 9 didnt show  any active 
county court judgements or individual voluntary arrangements. 
The adjudicator said that she could consider Loan 1 and explained why. It appears that her 
numbering of the loans is different to my own above.  But its clear that she recommended 
that the complaint about Loans 5 onwards should be upheld.
CashEuroNet disagreed and responded to say that it hadnt  lent irresponsibly. In summary, it 
didnt agree that Mr L was persistently reliant on short term loans. It said that there were 
gaps between the loans. These werent  indicative of a borrower who was dependent on 
short term loans. It also said that the mere number  of loans  borrowed was insufficient to 
conclude that the loans  were unsustainable.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
Ref: DRN89860152complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Im sorry  to hear that Mr L was struggling financially  and that repaying the loans may have 
been difficult. 
When CashEuroNet first lent to Mr L the regulator  was the Office of Fair Trading and 
relevant guidance included  its guidance on irresponsible lending (ILG). From 1 April 2014 
onwards the regulator was the Financial Conduct  Authority and relevant regulations and 
guidance included  its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC). The ILG and CONC contained  
similar guidance for lenders about responsible lending. 
CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required to 
establish whether  Mr L could sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the consumer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ref: DRN89860153Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
CashEuroNet did a number of checks before it lent to Mr L. It asked him for details of his 
income. And for Loan 9 it also asked about Mr Ls expenditure. Mr Ls declared income was 
£1,485 until Loan 6 when  it increased to £1,583. CashEuroNet  also checked Mr Ls 
employment and housing status.  From  the information CashEuroNet gathered,  Mr L was 
employed and paid rent. 
CashEuroNet also checked Mr Ls credit file before agreeing to the loans. It has provided us 
with a summary of the results of its credit checks before Loans 6 to 9. It doesnt appear that 
there was any adverse  information on those summaries that I think should have caused 
additional concerns to the lender. But I havent seen  the complete  results of its checks. I 
cant see that we have received a copy of Mr Ls credit report.  So Im also unable  to say 
there were entries on Mr Ls credit file that shouldve concerned CashEuroNet.
The repayments that Mr L needed  to make on Loans 1 to 4 were relatively modest compared 
to the income  that he declared  to CashEuroNet. So given  Mr Ls repayment  amounts, what  
was apparent about his circumstances at the time,  and his history with the lender,  I dont  
think it wouldve been proportionate for CashEuroNet to ask him for the amount of 
information that would be needed to show the lending was unsustainable.  
And Ive not seen  anything in the information  Mr L provided or the information CashEuroNet 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying. So I dont  think  CashEuroNet was wrong to give Loans 1 to 4 to Mr L.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of CashEuroNets lending history  with Mr L, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which the lender should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet  should  have realised  
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by 
Loan 5. I say this because:
From  Loan 5 onwards, Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed 
CashEuroNet. Loan 5 was taken out around  eight months after Loan  1. Mr L had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to CashEuroNet over an 
extended period.  
Loan 5 was provided within three weeks of settling Loan  4. So CashEuroNet  ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr L was having  to borrow further to cover 
the hole that repaying  his previous loan had left in his finances. 
The chain of lending  of around eight  months  since Loan 1 doesnt reflect  the intended 
use of high-cost short-term credit  but suggests  Mr L was likely using the loans to 
substitute his income. 
There were  some  limited gaps from Loan  1 onwards between  loans  being  repaid and 
a new loan being granted including one of less than four months before Loan 3. But, I 
dont think it would  have been  reasonable for CashEuroNet to conclude  these gaps 
were any indication  that Mr Ls finances  had moved on from whatever situation  had 
required his previous loans.
Ref: DRN89860154I think that Mr L lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from Loan  5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the length of time that Mr L had been  taking out short term loans  was likely to have 
had negative implications on Mr Ls ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
The fact that Loan 5 was repaid early doesnt  mean it was repaid sustainably,  or 
without causing  Mr L undue difficulty.  
I should add Ive considered the points CashEuroNet made in response to the adjudicators  
view. 
CashEuroNet provided this service with a document which is titled  CEU Lending Criteria and 
Proportionate Checks, which isnt case-specific. This service has responded to 
CashEuroNets submission of this document on many previous occasions  and so Ill say no 
more about it here. But I have taken its contents into account.
CashEuroNet has made comments about  the gaps between the loans. But as Ive said 
above, I dont  think that its reasonable for CashEuroNet to have concluded from the gaps 
that Mr Ls finances had improved. Mr L had an established pattern of borrowing which ought 
to have concerned  CashEuroNet  irrespective  of the length of pauses between  Mr Ls 
applications. I also note that CashEuroNet said that Mr L didnt  take credit  on his flex credit 
account between  March 2014  and September 2014. But I note that Mr L had taken out 
Loan 6b during  this period  and was repaying Loans 6, 6a and 6b during this time. 
CashEuroNet also said that the mere number  of loans is an insufficient basis  to conclude  
that the loans  were  unsustainable. But, CashEuroNet will know from previous decisions (as 
well as whats set out on our website)  that there are cases where this service considers the 
overall lending  pattern  and not just the affordability of each  loan. When  a consumer borrows  
numerous loans  over a long period of time,  its most likely that the loans arent being used 
for their intended purpose of temporary  cash flow problems. 
So Im intending  to uphold the complaint  about Loans 5 onwards and CashEuroNet  should 
put things right as follows.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on Loan 5 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
all entries  about Loan  5 onwards  should be removed  from Mr Ls credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
