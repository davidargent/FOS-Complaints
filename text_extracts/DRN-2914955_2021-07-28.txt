The complaint
Miss J is unhappy that NewDay Ltd approved her for a credit account that was unaffordable 
for her at that time. Miss J is also unhappy that NewDay Ltd subsequently increased the 
credit limit on the account, which she feels was also unaffordable for her at that time.  
What happened
Miss J applied for a NewDay credit account and was accepted with an initial credit limit of 
£1,200. Approximately four months later, NewDay increased the credit limit on Miss Js 
account to £1,950. Miss J then fell into difficulties maintaining the credit account, and the 
account was ultimately defaulted by NewDay and sold to a third-party debt purchasing 
company. 
Upon review, Miss J felt that both the initial provision of credit and the later credit limit 
increase had both been unaffordable for her at those times. So, she raised a complaint. 
NewDay looked at Miss Js complaint. They agreed that Miss Js initial credit application 
shouldnt have been approved, but they felt that the later credit limit increase had been 
justified  based on a consideration of the checks that they had undertaken into Miss Js 
financial position at those times.
As such, NewDay offered to reimburse all interest and charges accrued on the account since 
inception, but they felt that the default that theyd recorded on Miss Js credit file was an 
accurate representation of how Miss J had managed the account, and so were unwilling to 
remove it.
Miss J wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this 
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that because NewDay 
had acknowledged that they should never have approved Miss J for a credit account in the 
first instance, this meant that NewDay should reasonably restore Miss J to the position that 
she would have been in had the credit account never been opened  which included 
removing the default from Miss Js credit file.
NewDay didnt agree with the view put forward by our investigator, so the matter was 
escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay have acknowledged that they should never have approved Miss Js initial account 
application and that Miss J should never have been given a credit account by NewDay.
In circumstances such as this  where a business has acknowledged that its made an error 
 what this service would expect would be that the business would restore the customer to 
the position that they would have been in had the error not taken place. 
In this instance, this means restoring Miss J to the position that she would have been in had 
her account application been declined by NewDay and therefore had no account ever been 
opened.
Had it been the case that Miss Js initial account application had been declined, Miss J 
would never have had a NewDay credit account on which to accrue arrears and on which to 
be ultimately defaulted. This means that had Miss Js initial account application been 
declined  as NewDay have acknowledged that it should have been  then Miss J would 
never have incurred a default on her credit file relating to this account.
Im aware that NewDay feel that the default should remain on Miss Js account because it 
represents a fair record of how Miss J managed the account. But by their own reckoning, 
NewDay should never have given this account to Miss J in the first place, and so it will 
almost always be the position of this service that, in circumstances such as these, the 
default should be removed from the customer-in-questions credit file. And this is my position 
in this instance also.
Miss J has benefitted from the credit amount that she used, so I dont feel that it would be 
reasonable for me to instruct NewDay to write off that credit amount. But I do feel that Miss J 
shouldnt incur any form of detriment in relation to that credit amount, given that Im satisfied 
that it was provided to her irresponsibly by NewDay.
It follows then that Ill be upholding this complaint in Miss Js favour and issuing corrective 
instructions to NewDay which will include that NewDay must repurchase the debt from the 
third-party debt purchasing company to which it was sold, and that NewDay must remove all 
reporting relating to this account from Miss Js credit file.
I hope that NewDay can understand, given what Ive explained above, why Ive made the 
final decision that I have.  
Putting things right
If they havent already done so, NewDay must reimburse all interest, fees, and charges 
incurred or accrued on this account since inception. 
If these reimbursements result in Miss Js account having a credit balance in her favour, 
NewDay must pay Miss J the credit amount along with 8% simple interest calculated from 
the dates of any overpayments to the date of the reimbursement to Miss J.
NewDay must repurchase or reclaim Miss Js account from the dept purchasing company to 
which it was sold and must agree an affordable, interest free payment plan with Miss J 
based on an assessment of Miss Js income and expenditure.
NewDay must remove all reporting relating to this account from Miss Js credit file such as 
though it had never been approved or opened.
NewDay must make a payment to Miss J of £100 to compensate her for any trouble and 
upset this matter might have caused.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or reject my decision before 25 August 2021.
