The complaint
Mr V complains that Oplo PL Limited wont refund to him the money that he paid for some 
holiday club membership credits using a loan from a finance provider. Hes being 
represented in his complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr V and his partner entered into a membership application agreement in October 2018 to 
buy some holiday club membership credits. The purchase price of the credits was £12,500 
and Mr V also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a finance provider in October 
2018 for a loan of £12,500 to pay for the credits. He agreed to make 179 monthly 
repayments of £127.60 and a final payment of £128.28 to the finance provider. 
Mr Vs representative contacted the holiday company in April 2020 and said that Mr V and 
his partner wanted to terminate their membership. Mr Vs representative then made claims to 
the finance provider in May 2020 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. It said that the credits had been misrepresented to Mr V and his partner, there was an 
unfair relationship between Mr V and the finance provider and that the finance provider had 
lent to Mr V irresponsibly. The finance provider didnt uphold those claims so a complaint 
was made to this service in July 2020. Mr Vs loan has now been transferred to Oplo and it 
has assumed the finance providers obligations under the loan agreement.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Vs complaint should be upheld. He said that hed 
not seen sufficient information to persuade him that the credits were described as being 
exclusive to members, that holidays would be cheaper than those available on the open 
market, that it was a financial investment or that there would always be availability  so he 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the point of sale. He also said that 
he hadnt seen any evidence to demonstrate that the holiday company had failed to fulfil one 
or more of the contracts terms. He said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest that the 
relationship between Mr V and the finance provider was unfair and he wasnt persuaded that 
a court would conclude that the relationship was unfair. He also said that he couldnt see 
anything to suggest that the loan wasnt correctly setup or that affordability wasnt fairly 
assessed prior to the loan being granted.
Mr Vs representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. His representative has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst 
other things, that:
the holiday company wasnt authorised to arrange the loan; and 
Mr Vs witness statement, the liquidation of a company related to the holiday 
company and the unfairness of the terms of the purchase agreement and club rules 
havent been considered.
Mr Vs representative has also referred to an investigators recommendation on another 
complaint about the finance provider thats been made to this service and the approach that 
it says should be taken to complaints.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr Vs representative complained to the finance provider under sections 75 and 140A 
and about its irresponsible lending - it said that Mr V and his partner were told that: 
they would be investing in their holidays by securing future holidays that 
would be significantly cheaper than would be available on the open market;
there was a ready re-sale market for the membership credits so Mr V and his 
partner would be able to sell them and that there were good prospects of 
them increasing in value;
the offer was only available for a very limited time and that if they didnt 
purchase the offer would no longer be available;
the resorts were exclusive to members only, werent open to the general 
public and were of an exceptional standard;
they wouldnt experience problems with availability; and 
the credits werent a timeshare;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
to be able to uphold Mr Vs complaint about Oplo under section 75, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday 
company and that the finance providers response to his claim under section 75 
wasnt fair or reasonable;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Vs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that - Im considering whether or not the finance 
providers response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr V has provided a detailed witness statement in which he describes the way that 
the credits were sold to him and his partner and the misrepresentations that he says 
were made to them - his representative has also provided evidence from other 
purchasers of credits about the way that sales were made to them; 
Mr V and his partner signed documents in October 2018 including a membership 
application agreement, the terms and conditions, an initial disclosure document, an 
exchange contract, a right of withdrawal form and a standard information form  and 
Mr V also electronically signed the loan agreement;
Ive seen no reference in any of those documents which refers to the credits as being 
an investment or as being likely to increase in value;
the standard information form says: The Resale Facility for [the credits] will be 
available to be applied for as of the year 2023 and cannot be relied upon as the basis 
for entering into a Membership. Resale values or timeframes cannot be guaranteed and are subject to offer and demand; and Ive seen no documentary evidence from 
that time to show that Mr V was told that there was a ready re-sale market for the 
product;
Mr V says that he and his partner were told that the credits werent a timeshare  
which I consider to be correct as the documents provided from the time of the sale 
show that the credits could be exchanged for holiday accommodation and other 
lifestyle products;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr V and his partner 
were told that the accommodation would be significantly cheaper than would be 
available on the open market, that there would be no issues with availability of the 
holiday accommodation or the lifestyle products, that the exclusivity of the 
membership, accommodation or lifestyle products was misrepresented to them or 
that the membership credits were misrepresented to them in any other significant 
way;
I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that Mr V and his partner were 
induced into buying the credits by misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
I understand that a management company related to the holiday company has 
stopped trading but the holiday company says that a new management company has 
been appointed to provide the membership services and Mr V and his partner have 
kept all of their contractual rights and the new holiday company continues to offer a 
full service for members;
I dont consider that to be a breach of contract by the holiday company and Im not 
aware of any other breach of contract by the holiday company so Im not persuaded 
that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company for which Oplo would 
have any liability under section 75;
Mr Vs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr V and 
the finance provider because of the alleged misrepresentations, the selling practices 
used by the holiday company (including a lengthy and confusing sales presentation), 
the documents not being clear and easy to understand, the membership being sold 
as an investment and not being suitable for Mr V, the foreclosure clause for non-
payment of management fees and other unfair clauses; and a secret commission 
paid by the finance provider to the holiday company;
the finance provider has said that Mr Vs claim under section 140A is outside of this 
services jurisdiction but it has accepted our investigators recommendation and I 
consider that this service does have jurisdiction to consider Mr Vs complaint under 
section 140A; 
I dont consider that theres enough evidence shows that Mr V and his partner were 
unduly pressured into buying the credits, that Mr V was unduly pressured into 
entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptable 
sales practices against them;
Mr V and his partner signed a form which set out their right to withdraw from the 
membership application agreement and the loan agreement clearly set out Mr Vs 
right to withdraw from the loan;
if Mr V and his partner felt that theyd been unduly pressurised into signing the 
agreements or that the holiday company had used unacceptable sales practices, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have exercised their rights to 
withdraw from the agreements - but Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr V tried to 
withdraw from either the membership application agreement or the loan agreement 
during the withdrawal periods;it would be for a court to decide whether the terms of the agreements are unfair - I 
agree with Mr Vs representative that the documents arent as clear and easy to read 
as they could be, but I dont consider that that makes them unfair and Im not 
persuaded that the terms of the agreements are unfair or that its likely that a court 
would find the agreements to be unfair;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by the finance provider to the holiday company but, from what this service has seen 
across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less than 
10% but Im satisfied that the finance provider wouldnt have breached any duty in 
making any such payment and wasnt under any regulatory duty to disclose the 
amount of any commission paid in these circumstances;
the loan agreement says: On or after the date when both you and we have signed 
this agreement, a commission payment may be made by us to one or more of the 
Credit Intermediaries named above; but I dont consider that the level of any 
commission that was normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to 
mean that the finance provider should have appreciated that not disclosing the 
amount of any commission to Mr V risked the relationship being unfair under section 
140A;
Mr Vs representative says that it was irresponsible for the finance provider to have 
made the loan to Mr V and that no meaningful affordability checks or assessments 
were made and Mr V says that since taking out the loan there have been times of 
financial strain as his and his partners circumstances have changed drastically;
Mr V says in his witness statement that a credit check was made and that his annual 
income at that time was £39,000 - the finance provider has provided information 
about the credit checks and affordability assessment that it made before the loan was 
made to Mr V  the affordability assessment shows that he had a net monthly income 
of £3,325 and it detailed his expenditure;
I consider that it was reasonable for the finance provider to conclude on the basis of 
that information that a loan with monthly repayments of about £128 was affordable 
for Mr V at that time;
although Mr V says that his circumstances have changed drastically he also says 
that his annual income has increased to £72,000  but changes that have happened 
since he took out the loan dont make the loan unaffordable at the time that the loan 
was made to him;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for 
Mr V at the time that it was made to him and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for him or that the finance provider 
lent to him irresponsibly;
if Mr V is experiencing financial difficulties and cant afford to make the loan 
repayments, I suggest that he contacts Oplo and explains to it his financial difficulties 
 its required to respond to any financial difficulties that hes experiencing positively 
and sympathetically;
Mr Vs representative says that the holiday company wasnt authorised to arrange the 
loan  but I dont consider it to be likely that the loan was arranged by the holiday 
company;
the loan agreement lists three different credit intermediaries  all of which are 
authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority  and I consider it to be more likely 
than not that one of those companies arranged the loan for Mr V;Im not persuaded that Mr V representative has provided enough evidence to show 
that the loan was arranged by the holiday company or that it was arranged by a credit 
intermediary that didnt have the required authorisation;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the relationship 
between Mr V and the finance provider was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely 
that a court would find the relationship to be unfair;
Mr Vs representative has referred to an investigators recommendation on another 
complaint about the finance provider thats been made to this service  but this 
service considers each complaint on its individual merits and, on the complaint to 
which his representative has referred, I have issued a provisional decision as I dont 
consider that that complaint should be upheld;
Mr V referred in his witness statement to a purchase of another holiday package that 
he made which resulted in his maintenance fees being reduced  but that package 
wasnt paid for using the loan agreement with the finance provider so I don t 
consider that Oplo would have any liability to him for any issues with that package;
I consider that the finance providers response to Mr Vs complaint was fair and 
reasonable and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it has 
acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr V; and
I sympathise with Mr V for the issues that hes described in his witness statement but 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Oplo to refund to him any of the money that he paid for the membership credits, to 
cancel his loan, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response 
to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Vs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 March 2023.
