K821x#15complaint
Miss N complains that NewDay Ltd gave her incorrect  information  about three refunded  
transactions and has miscalculated the amount she owed.
background
Miss N says she received  three refunds for purchases of £3.98,  £20 and £78 in around 
October/November 2018. She says NewDay didnt credit her account with these refunds and 
was told by it that it would include them in her December 2018 credit  card statement. Miss M 
says she spoke to NewDay  again as initially it said it hadnt  refunded  the money but then 
said it had. She says the account balance as shown on her November 2018 statement is 
wrong and NewDay  has held onto her money  since then. Miss N would like £1,000  
compensation for whats happened.
NewDay accepts it gave  Miss N misleading  information about the refunds and ought to have 
noticed they had been credited  to her account. Its apologised for those mistakes and paid 
£45 compensation.  It also says the three payments were  credited to her account  and 
appeared on the November 2018  statement.
Miss N brought  her complaint to us and our adjudicator upheld  it in part. The adjudicator 
didnt think the compensation award went far enough to take into account the misleading 
information and time Miss N spent trying to sort matters out. He recommended NewDay pay 
a further £100 compensation.  But the adjudicator looked  at Miss Ns account statements and 
didnt think NewDay had made a mistake  in calculating how much Miss N owed it and 
provided details  of his calculations  to Miss N.
NewDay hasnt replied  to the adjudicators view but Miss N doesnt accept it. In summary 
Miss N says the adjudicators calculations are wrong and has provided  a spreadsheet in 
which she says the amount  owed is about  a £100 too much.  She maintains NewDay has not 
taken into account  the refunded money.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the adjudicator and for the same  reasons. I realise  Miss N will be 
disappointed by my decision.
There is no question here that NewDay gave Miss N incorrect information on two occasions. 
I think NewDay ought to have been able to have explained that the refunds had been 
applied to Miss Ns account and when.  But I also think that NewDay  has fairly apologised for 
what took place.  The key question about  that part of the complaint is the level of 
compensation. Im satisfied that Miss N was concerned about the refunds and would have 
spent some time in contacting NewDay about them. So I agree with the adjudicator that 
NewDay should pay further compensation of £100.  Im satisfied the total amount is fair and 
reasonable and takes into account  that it took some  time for Miss N to be given the correct 
information. I appreciate  Miss N says that she would  like £1,000 compensation but I dont 
think such an award is justified and I dont think Miss N suffered any financial loss for the 
reasons I will explain.
Ref: DRN93362672I should explain to Miss N that we are not an auditing  service and so its not our role to check 
if an account statement  is correct. I have looked  at the spreadsheet Miss N has given us and 
I have looked  at Miss Ns account statements for October and November. Having done so I 
have no reason to conclude  that NewDays calculations are wrong. And Im satisfied that the 
balance it says Miss N owed was correct.
I can see that Miss N in her calculations  deducted  the refunds of £95.98  from her spending  
but has failed  to take those refunds off the payments.  Im satisfied that she has double 
counted the refunds by making a deduction  from the amount she owed and also included  
them as payments towards  the balance.
Overall Im satisfied NewDay hasnt made a mistake or acted unfairly in respect of the refund 
or kept Miss Ns money. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and order NewDay Ltd to pay Miss N 
£100 compensation in addition to the £45 already paid.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss N to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 April 2020.
