The complaint
Mr K complains that I Go 4 Ltd trading as WiseDriving (WiseDriving) cancelled his motor 
insurance policy because he didnt fit the necessary telematics device. He also complains 
that he was unable to contact WiseDriving for advice and support with fitting the device.
What happened
Mr K had motor insurance taken out via a price comparison website. WiseDriving were 
acting as a broker or intermediary, the policy was underwritten by another business. Mr K 
took out a telematics policy, where a telematics device or black box needs to be fitted to the 
vehicle. The box assesses the drivers behaviour and this information is usually used to help 
set the premiums the policyholder pays. Telematics policies are usually marketed on the 
basis that a consumer can save money by driving safely and conscientiously.
On the day he took out the policy, Mr K received a letter from WiseDriving via email. The 
letter said he needed to wait for his box to be delivered and install it within 14 days of taking 
out the policy. The letter contained a link to a video tutorial on fitting the box, and said fitting 
instructions would also be sent with the box.
Mr K says the delivery of the box was delayed, and when it arrived he tried to contact 
WiseDriving for advice and support with fitting it. He says he and his partner tried different 
methods of contact but were unable to speak to anyone. 
Because the box hadnt been fitted within 14 days, WiseDriving sent a letter to Mr K by post 
and email saying the policy would be cancelled in 7 days time if the box wasnt activated. 
The letter set out the charges that would be incurred if the policy was cancelled.
As the box wasnt fitted within the timescale given, WiseDriving sent a letter to Mr K by email 
confirming that the policy had been cancelled and setting out the outstanding balance of 
approximately £200.
Mr K wasnt happy with this and complained to WiseDriving. WiseDriving didnt uphold his 
complaint, saying the terms and conditions of his policy stated that he had to fit the box 
within 14 days of taking out the policy or it reserved the right to cancel. WiseDriving said it 
had been unable to trace any phone calls from Mr Ks number prior to the policy being 
cancelled. 
Mr K wasnt happy with this response and complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
uphold his complaint. She said WiseDriving had acted in line with the policy terms.
Mr K wasnt happy with this response so his complaint has been passed to me. Mr K wants 
to be refunded the over £100 he says he paid to sign up to the policy, and he wants the 
outstanding balance of approximately £200 to be waived.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint. Ill explain why.
Mr Ks insurance policy documents said:
Your WiseDriving policy is based on how you drive your vehicle. You must therefore have a 
WiseDriving device in use in your car so that we can assess your driving behaviour. We 
reserve the right to cancel the cover if you do not co-operate in having the WiseDriving 
device in use within 14 days of the policy purchase dateThis means having a WiseDriving 
device installed into your car
The welcome letter emailed to Mr K the day he took out the policy said:
Your box will need to be installed within 14 days of you buying your policy, or we may have 
to cancel your insurance.
Mr K has provided a record of a phone call he says he made to WiseDriving about the box. 
However the number in the record is that of a different company, not WiseDriving, and the 
call was made after the policy was cancelled. He has also provided a screenshot of a 
message sent to WiseDriving but this was several hours after the cancellation email. He has 
also provided emails he says he sent to WiseDriving but these are also dated after the policy 
was cancelled.
WiseDriving clearly explained to Mr K that he needed to fit the box within 14 days. In fact 
WiseDriving did give him a further seven days to do so. It sent him a video and written 
instructions on how to install the box. I cant see any evidence that Mr K tried to contact 
WiseDriving before his policy was cancelled. So I think in all the circumstances of this case 
WiseDriving acted fairly and reasonably in its customer service to Mr K.
Because WiseDriving acted as an intermediary in the sale of Mr Ks policy, it was acting on 
behalf of the insurer when informing Mr K of the cancellation and the outstanding sum he 
needed to pay. It would have been the insurer who decided on the charges and the 
circumstances in which they had to be paid. So if Mr K is looking for charges to be waived or 
refunded, it is open to him to complain to the insurer.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint. So I wont be asking I Go 4 
Ltd trading as WiseDriving to do anything.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 December 2022.
