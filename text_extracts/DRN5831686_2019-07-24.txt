K821x#15complaint
Mr K complains about loans he took out with CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid).  
He says they made his debts worse. He asks that Quick  Quid refunds interest and charges, 
with 8% interest, and removes the loans from his credit file.
background
Mr K took out seven  loans and six top up loans with Quick Quid between  July 2015 and 
October 2016. Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld. She said 
it wasnt wrong for Quick  Quid  to offer Mr K loans 1 to 4. But it shouldnt have offered him the 
top up for loan 4 or the later loans. The adjudicator said the amounts owed, the number of 
loans and the length of time Mr K had been  borrowing  should  have prompted  Quick Quid to 
make more checks, which would have shown  the borrowing  wasnt  sustainable. She said 
from loan 6 Mr Ks pattern  of borrowing suggested  the borrowing was unsustainable.
Quick Quid didnt agree and the complaint was been passed to me. I didnt agree with all of 
the adjudicators  recommendations.  So I sent a provisional decision to the parties to explain 
why and give them an opportunity to respond. In it, I set out my provisional  findings and 
provisional decision  which  are substantially the same as the findings and decision set out 
below. Quick Quid responded to my provisional decision saying they had no comments  or 
further information. Mr K didnt respond.

Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.

Quick Quid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr K 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
Ref: DRN58316862Mr Ks income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
Loans 1 to 4 (including top ups)
Mr K took out four loans  between July and December 2015.  Mr K told Quick Quid  his 
monthly income was about £1,850 and his monthly  outgoings were  £275. Quick Quid  says it 
did credit  checks  and the information  it received  didnt suggest any problems.
While I think Quick Quid might have done more thorough checks before  agreeing  the later 
loans, I dont think, given the amount of the loans  and Mr Ks stated income,  proportionate  
checks would have  given  it any reason  to think the loans werent affordable or that further  
checks were needed
Loan 5 onwards (including top ups)
I think when Mr K asked for loan 5 Quick Quid should have realised  further lending  was 
unsustainable. By this time, Mr K had been borrowing from Quick Quid  for more than eight 
months without a significant break.  Quick Quid ought to have realised Mr K was having  to 
borrow to cover the gap in his finances left by repaying his previous loan.
The loans offered by Quick Quid  were  intended for short term use. But Mr K didnt make any 
real inroads  into the amount he owed  Quick Quid.  He took out loan 7 in September  2017, 
more than a year after his first loan. And, with the two top up loans, he borrowed £950   a 
significantly larger amount  than his first loan of £50. In effect, Mr K paid large  amounts of 
interest to service a debt to Quick Quid over an extended  period.  I dont  think this borrowing 
was sustainable.
So Im upholding  Mr Ks complaint about  loan 5 and the later loans and top ups. Quick Quid  
should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loan 5 and the later loans and top ups;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove all entries about  loan 5 and the later loans and top ups from Mr Ks credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr K a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold parts of Mr Ks complaint. I order  CashEuroNet UK LLC to take 
the steps and pay the compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 August 2019.
