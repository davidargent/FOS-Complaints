The complaint
Mrs B complains about the amount that shes been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, for damage to a car that had been 
supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement and for an incomplete service history. Her 
husband is also involved in her complaint.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mrs B under a hire purchase agreement with Mercedes-Benz 
Finance that she signed in April 2017. She returned the car to the dealer in July 2020 and 
she signed a return programme vehicle appraisal. The car was then inspected by a third 
party on behalf of Mercedes-Benz Finance in August 2020 and the inspection report 
identified damage to the car and that a service was overdue. 
Mercedes-Benz Finance charged Mrs B £340 for the damage to the alloy wheels, £251 for 
the missed service and £135.70 for excess mileage. She complained to Mercedes-Benz 
Finance about the charges but wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this 
service. She says that she doesnt dispute the charge for the excess mileage, which I 
understand has been paid.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He thought that the 
end of contract charges had been charged correctly and that Mercedes-Benz Finance hadnt 
done anything wrong.
Mrs Bs husband, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. He says, in summary, that:
the inspection report only showed that there were three wheels that were deemed to 
be over the return standards, not four as has been invoiced;
further significant damage is shown on that report and it can only be fairly assessed 
that this damage has been done after the car was left with the dealer and the car was 
driven for 132 miles between return and inspection;
the car was returned to the dealer which is a normal and accepted process and 
Mercedes-Benz Finance and the dealer were fully aware that it was not possible to 
arrange for the car to be serviced due to the pandemic; and
they were told that the damage was only fair wear and tear.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
Mrs D signed the hire purchase agreement which said: At the end of the hire period, 
you must return the car to us in accordance with the terms and conditions of this 
agreement and the agreement included the vehicle return standards;
the vehicle return standards say: When it is time to return your vehicle  you must 
return the vehicle in line with the Vehicle Return Standards  When the vehicle is 
returned to us a Vehicle Return Standard Inspection will be carried out by trained 
technicians at the nominated Defleet Centre. The vehicle must be: free from any 
broken or damaged items ; free from any defects or condition that would be in 
breach of statutory requirements; free from accident damage; and in good, clean and 
marketable condition  the standards then explain what would be acceptable and 
unacceptable;
Mrs D returned the car to the dealer in July 2020 and the dealer completed a return 
programme vehicle appraisal which recorded the cars mileage as 32,509 and 
identified that all four alloy wheels were scuffed;
Mrs D signed that appraisal and immediately above her signature it says I agree that 
this is a fair and accurate appraisal of this vehicle  but she says that she was told 
that the damage was fair wear and tear;
the car was then collected by a third party on behalf of Mercedes-Benz Finance and 
it was inspected in accordance with the vehicle return standards in August 2020;
the inspection report recorded the cars mileage as 32,732 and identified damage to 
the car, including damage to all four wheels, and charges of £705 were 
recommended for the damage and it said that a service was overdue;
Mercedes-Benz Finance charged Mrs B £85 for the damage to each of the four alloy 
wheels, £251 for the missing service and £135.70 for excess mileage  Mrs B says 
that she doesnt dispute the charge for the excess mileage, which I understand has 
been paid, so I havent considered the excess mileage charge any further;
the inspection report includes photos of the damage to the alloy wheels and I 
consider that the damage is more than would be acceptable under the vehicle return 
standards and is more than would reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear;
the £85 charge for the damage to the left rear alloy wheel has a line through it on the 
inspection report but there are other charges on the inspection report that dont have 
a line through them but which havent been charged to Mrs B and Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that Mercedes-Benz Finance shouldnt have 
charged Mrs B for the damage to that wheel;
scuffs to all four alloy wheels were identified on the appraisal form and damage to all 
four wheels was identified on the inspection report which included photos of the 
damage  I consider that its more likely than not that the damage to the wheels was 
present when the car was returned to the dealer and that its fair and reasonable for 
Mercedes-Benz Finance to charge Mrs B £85 for the damage to each of the alloy 
wheels;
the vehicle return standards say: A full service history is required. The vehicle must 
be serviced and maintained in accordance with the manufacturers published service 
intervals within the Approved Workshop network;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that the car was overdue a service when it was 
returned to the dealer  which was for completely understandable reasons as a result 
of the government imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic  but Mrs B had 
avoided the cost of that service and Mercedes-Benz Finance would then have to 
incur a cost for servicing the car;I consider that its fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Mercedes-Benz 
Finance to charge Mrs B £251 for the missing service;
Mrs B says that the dealer has offered to pay the outstanding charges  but that is a 
matter between her and the dealer and isnt an offer with which Mercedes-Benz 
Finance, as the supplier of the car, was involved; and
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mercedes-Benz 
Finance has acted incorrectly in connection with the charges that its made for the 
damage to the wheels and the missing service  so I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable for me to require it to reduce, or waive, those charges, to pay any 
compensation to Mrs B or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 November 2021.
