K820x#14complaint
Mr J says Lloyds Bank  PLC (Lloyds) mis-sold him a Silver packaged bank account in 2009.  
Hes used a Claims Management Company  (CMC) to make his complaint.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr Js complaint and didnt think Lloyds had mis-sold the account. 
The CMC disagreed and asked  for an ombudsmans decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Js complaint. 
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Mr Js complaint. Id like to 
explain the reasons  for my decision. I think Mr J chose to take the account as hed had a 
free account  previously. He appears  to have had an identifiable need for the benefit the 
paperwork suggests the Silver account  was recommended  for  mobile phone insurance - 
and he couldve used  some of the other benefits  too. 
So overall I dont  think that clearer information wouldve changed Mr Js decision to accept 
what looks to have  been a fair recommendation made by Lloyds. And, in these 
circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Js complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 March  2019.
