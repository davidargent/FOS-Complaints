K821x#15complaint
Mr C has complained about five instalment loans granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC, 
trading as Pounds to Pocket (CashEuroNet). He thinks that CashEuroNet behaved 
irresponsibly in lending  to him and he wants it to compensate him. 
background
CashEuroNet granted  the loans to Mr C between May 2013 and November 2015. It 
refinanced the second, third and fourth loans with further lending. I have provided brief 
details of each  loan in the table below.

One of our adjudicators has already looked into Mr Cs complaint. The adjudicator  thought 
that CashEuroNet behaved irresponsibly in lending the third,  fourth and fifth loans and the 
associated lending which refinanced them, to Mr C and recommended  that it should 
compensate him for these  loans.  
CashEuroNet didnt  accept the adjudicators recommendation and so the case  has come to 
me to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice.
Each time CashEuroNet  lent money  to Mr C, I would have expected it to assess  his ability to 
repay the credit in a sustainable  way and to act responsibly on what  it found out and what  it 
knew. Depending on the circumstances,  it could have checked  Mr Cs income, his living 
costs, his long and short-term financial commitments and other aspects of his financial  
situation, including the way he had been  borrowing. Generally Id expect it to have checked 
things more thoroughly  if: 
Ref: DRN63852982Mr C was borrowing a large amount.
Mr Cs income  was low. 
Mr C was continuing to borrow over a long time. 
From what  Ive seen about Mr Cs circumstances, Im satisfied that if CashEuroNet had 
carried out proportionate checks for the first and second loans, and their associated 
refinancing arrangements  (loans 1, 2, 2a, 2b and 2c), it could reasonably  have concluded 
that he could repay  them  in a sustainable way. However, Im not satisfied  that this applied to 
any of the other loans.  
When CashEuroNet was considering offering Mr C loan 3, it should have seen that he was 
having difficulty managing his money.  Since he took the first loan, it had lent to him on four 
further occasions. He had refinanced the second loan three  times,  all within  four months. It 
seems to me that if CashEuroNet had carried out proportionate checks and acted 
responsibly on them, it would have seen that Mr C was unlikely to be able to repay  loan 3 
sustainably. I dont  think CashEuroNet should  have lent loan 3 to Mr C.
Shortly after CashEuroNet granted Mr C loan 3, it lent to him twice again  with loans 3a and 
3b. Again,  both of these were to refinance Mr Cs previous borrowing. And again  I think  that 
if CashEuroNet had carried out proportionate  checks and acted responsibly on them,  it 
would have seen  that Mr C was unlikely to be able to repay loans 3a and 3b sustainably. I 
dont think CashEuroNet  should have lent either of these loans to Mr C. 
By the time CashEuronet was considering loan 4, it had been lending  Mr C loans with high 
interest rates, which were intended for short-term use, for just over two years  without a 
significant break. Although the amount Mr C borrowed each time dipped  for a period, it had 
been rising again for several months.  At the point of loan 4, CashEuronet should have seen 
that Mr C was probably relying  on short-term credit for longer term use. It should not have 
agreed to his request for the loan, due to the pattern of his previous borrowing. This pattern 
of borrowing  then continued from loan 4 to loan 4a and loan 5, where CashEuronet lent Mr C 
increasing amounts.  Again, CashEuroNet should have seen that Mr C was not borrowing in 
a sustainable  way. 
So I think that from loan 4 onwards it was irresponsible of CashEuroNet to lend to Mr C due 
to his pattern  of borrowing. It should  have refused loans 4, 4a and 5; but it allowed them. 
Again, CashEuroNet should have  foreseen that Mr  C  was likely to use these high-interest 
rate loans for longer  then they were  intended,  which would have made  it more  difficult for 
him to obtain  cheaper forms of credit. 
CashEuroNet has told us that it can offer customers in financial  difficulty  help with making 
their loan repayments through a hardship payment plan. It has argued that as Mr C didnt  
ask for this type of help, he could afford the loans. I accept that CashEuroNet may have 
been able to offer this type of plan (although I cant tell if it would have been useful for Mr C), 
but this doesnt justify  the mistakes it made in lending to Mr C irresponsibly.
Similarly, CashEuroNet has pointed out that Mr C made most of his payments on time. 
Again, this may well have  been the case,  but it doesnt mean that CashEuroNets  lending  
was sustainable  given Mr Cs full financial situation.  
Ref: DRN63852983So I am upholding Mr Cs complaint about  the third, fourth and fifth loans, including  the 
associated lending for refinancing. CashEuroNet should now put things  right for Mr C by 
paying him fair compensation.
putting things right 
As CashEuroNet  should not have lent loans 3, 3a, 3b, 4, 4a and 5 to Mr C, it should: 
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid for these loans;
pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information  about  loan 3, 3a and 3b from Mr Cs credit  file; and 
remove all entries  about loans  4, 4a and 5.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest. 
CashEuroNet must  give Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  I have  set out above, I am upholding Mr Cs complaint about CashEuroNet  
UK LLC. It should put things right by paying  him the compensation I have described.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 August 2019.
