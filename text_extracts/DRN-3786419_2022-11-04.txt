The complaint
Mr B says Barclays Bank UK PLC irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
In October 2015 Barclays provided Mr B with a loan of Â£7600 over 60 months. Mr B says the 
lending was irresponsible.
I issued a provisional decision and said I wasnt upholding the complaint.  I explained that 
Barclays needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend irresponsibly, which meant 
that it needed to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to make sure Mr B could 
afford to repay what he was being lent in a sustainable manner.
I looked at the checks which Barclays had carried out before lending to Mr B and found that 
these were reasonable and proportionate. I went on to consider whether the decision to lend 
was fair and found that the loan was affordable for Mr B, having taken into account his 
monthly income and expenditure. I said there was nothing in the affordability checks carried 
out by Barclays which suggested that Mr B wouldnt be able to sustainably make 
repayments. I concluded that Barclays hadnt lent irresponsibly to Mr B.
I invited both parties to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wished to raise.
Barclays responded and said they agreed with my provisional decision.
Mr Bs representative responded and said she didnt agree with my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive taken into account the response I received from Mr Bs representative. However, this 
hasnt changed my decision. Im still of the view that Barclays didnt lend irresponsibly to Mr 
B.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2022.
