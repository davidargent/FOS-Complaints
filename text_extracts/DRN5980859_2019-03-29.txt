K821x#15complaint
Mr P complains that Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading  as Sunny, lent to him 
irresponsibly.
Mr P is represented by a third party. 
background
Mr P says through his representative that he found  himself unable to afford the loans and 
had to use multiple pay day lenders to pay off loans  each  month  leading  to a cycle  of debt.
Sunny has said that it conducted creditworthiness checks, assessed Mr Ps ability  to afford  
the loan repayments and manage his other debts. It said to Mr P after he had complained  to 
it: Based  upon  these  checks  it was considered responsible to advance credit.
Using the information and agreements which have been  sent to us I have created a table of 
the loans approved for Mr P. This is at the end of this decision. I will refer to the loans by 
those numbers in that table. 
Each of the loans  were instalment loans with six monthly repayment dates. Mr P appears to 
have treated most of them as if they were repayable within a month or two and mostly are 
repaid within  a month  rather like payday loans. There may be outstanding balances  still on 
Loans 16 and 19. 
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and his opinion was that:
Loans 1 to 4 Sunny carried out proportionate checks and he did not think  it needed 
to do more;
Loans 5 and 6 more should  have been done by Sunny,  but our adjudicator  was not 
able to come  to a final opinion due to lack of information  from Mr P.
Loans 7 to 19 the overall pattern of lending was considered  by our adjudicator to 
have been unsustainable  and harmful to Mr P. 
So our adjudicator thought that Sunny should put things right for Mr P in relation  to 
Loans 7 to 19.
Sunny did not respond and so the complaint remains unresolved and has been referred to 
an ombudsman for a decision. Both parties were informed of this and invited to send more  
evidence and information if they wished  to by a certain date. That date has passed and so 
the complaint  has been passed to me. Neither party has replied. 
From this I take that to mean that Mr P has nothing further to add and proceed on the basis  
that Loans 1 to 6 are not disputed. I will consider them as being resolved. I will look at 
Loans 7 to 19 within the context of the overall  lending history.   
Ref: DRN59808592my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr Ps case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ps complaint in part and have explained why below.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay his loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ps income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Ps complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did Sunny, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr P would  be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would those 
checks have shown  that Mr P would  have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Ps indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did Sunny act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Ps complaint.
Did Sunny, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that Mr P would be able to repay  in a sustainable  way? If not, would those  checks have 
shown that Mr P would  have been  able to do so?
In view of what I have  outlined in the background section of this decision,  I consider 
Loans 1 to 6 to be resolved and I say no more about  them.
Ref: DRN59808593I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for Loans 7 to 19 because 
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ps indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further lending.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
Loan 7. I say this because  in January 2016  when he applied for Loan  7 Mr P had already 
borrowed £1,100  in four months  with Sunny.  £400 of that was in one month   December 
2015. And then Mr P returned to borrow more  and it was for £400 which  was almost double  
his first loan and shows that the amounts Mr P was borrowing were  generally increasing. 
I think that Sunny ought to have realised  it was likely his indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. 
Although the number  of loans was becoming quite high, these were instalment loans that 
were being  repaid early. So the period of time that it took Mr P to reach  his seventh loan 
(around four months)  was relatively  short.
From and then after Loan  7, I think theres a difference between the intended purpose of this 
type of credit  and the way in which Sunny had allowed  it to be used. These loans were 
meant to be a short-term  solution to temporary  cash flow problems  as set out in the 
regulations and rules  governing this type of credit. Sunny persistently and repeatedly 
provided consecutive  loans to Mr P over an extended period of time  about  19 months.
Having carefully considered everything, I think the point at which this chain of lending  
became unsustainable and harmful was from Loan  7. A pattern of lending  had begun to 
establish itself before this point and after that I think Sunny ought to have realised it was 
becoming a well-established pattern. It likely masked an underlying  financial problem and 
further questions  ought to have been asked. 
I think that Mr P lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from Loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ps 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im upholding  Mr Ps complaint about  Loans  7 to 19 because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
Did Sunny act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive seen that Sunnys final response email  to Mr Ps representative makes reference  to Mr P 
asking for compensation for stress  and inconvenience, but I have not seen that aspect  
Ref: DRN59808594referred to in Mr Ps complaint. In addition, I have nothing to substantiate this from Mr P and 
no real evidence from Sunny to consider.  
So in the circumstances and having  thought  carefully thought about this element Ive not 
seen anything here that leads me to conclude Sunny acted unfairly  or unreasonably  towards  
Mr P in some other way.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on Loans 7 to 19;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 7 means any information recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  Loans 7 to 19 should  be removed from Mr Ps credit 
file
Sunny  is able to off-set the monies  Mr P may owe to it, from the total compensation 
sums due to Mr P. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr P 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. Any off-set needs to be 
done after tax. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Ps 
complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited should do as Ive set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I need to ask Mr P to accept or reject 
my final determination  on or before 29 April 2019.
