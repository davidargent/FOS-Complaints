The complaint
Miss A complains about fees and charges that National Westminster Bank Plc has added to 
her account. She said it shouldnt have done that when she was in financial difficulties. 
NatWest paid back some of the fees she was charged for 2019, but she wants the last six 
years to be refunded.
What happened
Miss A said that NatWest had been applying fees and charges to her bank account, at a time 
when she was experiencing financial difficulties. She wanted all of the charges shed paid 
refunded to her. 
NatWest said it had applied all fees and charges in line with its terms and conditions. It didnt 
have to pay those back. It said that it had refunded the fees that Miss A had been charged 
since January 2019, in August. But it wouldnt do more than this. It suggested some ways to 
help Miss A manage her account in the future.
Our investigator didnt uphold this complaint. He said he couldnt say the fees were unfair or 
too high, but he could look to se if theyd been applied correctly. And he thought they had. 
He knew Miss A had told us she was having financial difficulties, but he didnt think shed 
told NatWest that. He thought that NatWest had responded positively and sympathetically 
once it did know about the difficulties Miss A was having. 
Our investigator thought that the refund NatWest had paid provided a fair outcome to this 
complaint. Miss A didnt agree. She said shed contacted NatWest repeatedly about the 
charges on her account. She thought the bank knew she was in financial difficulties. 
Miss A said shed been charged £60 per month for years. She thought that when she 
contacted NatWest, it shouldve offered to lower her overdraft gradually and freeze the 
charges, but it didnt. She said this was her own money, and she wanted it back. 
Because Miss A didnt agree with our investigator, the case was passed to me for a final 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at Miss A's account. Although I can see a small number of months where her 
account charges are higher, in most months she is charged £10 or less. I dont think 
NatWest has been charging Miss A £60 per month throughout the time this account has 
been open. Our investigator explained that a court case some years ago means that our service cant 
say that charges for things like unauthorised overdrafts or unpaid items are unfair. And we 
cant say that these payments were too high. 
We can check if fees and charges have been applied in line with the terms of the account. I 
have looked at Miss As statements, and I havent seen anything to make me think that 
NatWest got this wrong.
Miss A thinks NatWest shouldnt have charged her, because she was in financial difficulties. 
She told us shed asked NatWest to repay charges on her account before, and it said no. so 
she thought it shouldve known about her financial difficulties. 
We do expect banks to treat customers positively and sympathetically once they know about 
financial difficulties. But NatWest says that Miss A has never told it that she was having 
financial difficulties. It says it just didnt know. Ive looked at Miss As account statements 
from when the account was open. And, although I can see that more recently she does tend 
to use her overdraft each month, I dont think that NatWest ought to have realised from this 
that she was having financial difficulties. 
Miss A did tell NatWest this in August last year. It then refunded the fees shed paid so far 
for that year, and suggested some ways that she could manage her account in future. I think 
that NatWest has now responded positively and sympathetically to Miss A.
I know Miss A will be disappointed, but I dont think NatWest has to do more than this. So I 
dont think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 May 2020.
