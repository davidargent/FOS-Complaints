The complaint
Mr H complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA havent credited his PayPal account 
with £100,000 that he won using a free gaming App.
What happened
In October 2021 Mr H said whilst using a free to play App Ill refer to as CK, he won 
£100,000 in gift cards. Mr H said the App showed the PayPal logo and so he withdrew the 
funds and credited them onto his PayPal account. But when he checked his account the 
£100,000 wasnt showing in his PayPal account. He complained to PayPal.
PayPal said they didnt have any affiliation to the free App Mr H said he used, and said it 
appeared to be fraudulent and misleading. They said there wasnt any evidence of the funds 
being put into Mr Hs account. And recommended he contact the App developer.
Mr H said the App was no longer available. He referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator said it was more likely than not that Mr H had been a victim of a bogus App. 
He said PayPal hadnt received the £100,000 and so he couldnt ask them to credit Mr H 
with this amount. 
Mr H didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I dont uphold this complaint. I know this will be a disappointment to Mr H as 
hed been led to think hed won a large amount of money. But while I empathise with the 
position Mr H finds himself in, for me to say PayPal must do something different I must first 
be satisfied that theyve done something wrong. I cant see that they have here which is why 
I wont be asking them to do anything else.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, or contradictory (as some of it is here),
I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities - in other words, what I consider is most
likely to have happened considering the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
Mr H has shown us screenshots pertaining to his winning more than £100,000. And the 
screenshot does have a PayPal logo as well as other business logos. But PayPal has said 
that they dont have any connection to the App. Its not unknown for the appearance of a 
business logo to make something look legitimate when it isnt. And this could be what has 
happened here, as Ive no reason to doubt what PayPal has said. 
PayPal has shown that they have reviewed Mr Hs PayPal accounts and they can find no 
record of the £100,000 being paid into them. They said that whenever a payment is received 
into a PayPal account an automated confirmation email would be sent to the email address 
held by PayPal for the account. Mr H hasnt shown any such automated email having been 
received from PayPal. 
So, Im satisfied the payment wasnt received by PayPal. And so, it would be for Mr H to 
confirm with CK as to the existence of the payment, and from which bank the payment 
would have been sent to PayPal.
I can see that PayPal havent placed any limitation or restriction on to Mr Hs PayPal 
account, and he is able to receive payments.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 March 2023.
