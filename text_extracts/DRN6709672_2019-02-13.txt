K820x#14complaint
Mrs F and Mr Z complain about the exchange  rate National Westminster Bank Plc
(NatWest) applied to an international  money transfer.
background
Mr Z attended a NatWest branch in August 2018  to make an international money transfer  to 
an account in Turkey of about £38,000. He says he was told what  the exchange rate was but 
when he, he found out a different rate had been  used. Mr Z says as a result he lost about 
£1,500 and would like NatWest to refund him that money.
NatWest says its not made a mistake and it applied the correct rate when the transaction  
was processed.  It says Mr Z attended  its branch on 15 August  2018 after the cut off time for 
making a transfer  that day. NatWest  says it told Mr Z that the transaction couldnt proceed 
that day and was told what the indicative rate was and that the rate could change. It also 
says the receipt  it gave  Mr Z also made  that clear.
Mr Z brought  his complaint to us but our adjudicator thought NatWest  hadnt made a 
mistake. He thought Mr Z had missed  the cut off time for making the transfer on the 15 
August 2018 and that NatWest had explained that the rate it gave him was indicative  only 
and subject to change.
Mr Z doesnt accept that view and says he wasnt told the rate could  change.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall conclusions  as the adjudicator.  I realise  Mrs F and Mr Z will be disappointed by my 
decision. 
Im satisfied that NatWest  couldnt process the transfer on 15 August 2018  as Mr Z had 
attended the branch after the cut off time for making  international  transfers.  I can see that 
the receipt for the transfer is timed at 16.49. So I dont think NatWest made a mistake  by not 
making the transfer that day. And I think NatWest  explained that to Mr Z as well as the fact 
that the exchange rate could change.
Im satisfied that the receipt Mr Z was given makes clear that the exchange  rate is indicative 
only and that the amount to be credited to the account in Turkey is also indicative. So I think 
NatWest has explained  that those amounts are subject  to change. I dont  think NatWest 
could provide a guarantee of an exchange rate for a transfer the following day. And that 
there was the possibility  of the exchange  rate changing in either direction which NatWest 
could have no control over.
So overall Im satisfied NatWest hasnt  made  a mistake here and so I cant fairly order it to 
refund Mr Z the difference in the amount he was expecting and the amount he actually 
received.
