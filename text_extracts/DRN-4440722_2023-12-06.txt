The complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain that Vacation Finance Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for some holiday club membership credits. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in October 2023 in which I described what 
had happened as follows:
Mr and Mrs S had two holiday club memberships and they entered into a 
membership application agreement to buy 11,650 membership credits from a holiday 
company in April 2019 for a purchase price of £10,500. They relinquished their 
previous memberships and paid £3,150 of the purchase price by bank transfer. They 
also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance for a loan of 
£7,350 and they agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £95.51 to Vacation 
Finance.
Mr and Mrs Ss representative made claims, on behalf of Mr and Mrs S, to Vacation 
Finance under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in February 
2020. It said that: the product was misrepresented to Mr and Mrs S; the contract was 
breached; commission was paid between Vacation Finance and the holiday company 
which wasnt disclosed to Mr and Mrs S which created a breach of fiduciary duty and 
caused an unfair relationship; and the loan was unaffordable.
Vacation Finance didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so a 
complaint was made to this service. Mr and Mrs Ss complaint form says that the 
holiday company and Vacation Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of 
their ability to afford the loan; Vacation Finance paid a commission to the holiday 
company which wasnt declared to them and the holiday company unduly pressured 
them into entering into the membership application agreement and the loan 
agreement; all rendering the loan agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A.
Vacation Finance then provided a detailed response to Mr and Mrs Ss claims. It said 
that it appeared from all of the information that it had seen that Mr and Mrs S 
purchased the credits to enjoy holidays and not as a financial investment so it didnt 
uphold the complaint regarding all allegations of misrepresentation. It said that its 
usual process involved obtaining income and expenditure information from the 
prospective debtor as well as conducting credit reference checks with external credit 
reference agencies  and that for it to approve a loan application, a customer needed 
to meet a certain minimum credit score and the monthly repayment had to be no 
more than a quarter of the customer's disposable income. It said that Mr and Mrs S 
advised in their loan application that they had a combined annual income of £38,000 
which exceeded its minimum credit score requirement and had a calculated monthly 
disposable amount of £565 so the monthly payment of £95.51 was deemed 
affordable. It also said that Mr and Mrs S have maintained their monthly payments.
It said that it paid no commission to the holiday company and that the club was being 
operated by a newly appointed club manager and full use of memberships remained 
available to all members who continued to make payment of the annual fees in line 
with their agreement.
Our investigator recommended that Mr and Mrs Ss complaint should be upheld. She 
thought that the holiday company had misrepresented the credits as something that 
would help them recoup their investment by being re-sold easily in the future and she 
said that the evidence suggested that that couldnt have been the case. She 
recommended that Vacation Finance should: cancel the loan and refund all loan 
payments with interest; and pay Mr and Mrs S the £3,150, with interest.
Vacation Finance hasnt responded to those recommendations so this complaint has 
been passed to me for a decision. Mr and Mrs Ss representative has raised 
concerns about the way that the finance was sold to Mr and Mrs S.
I said in my provisional decision: I dont consider that Mr and Mrs Ss complaint should be 
upheld for these reasons:
Mr and Mrs S signed the membership application agreement in April 2019 to buy 
11,650 holiday club membership credits  and they also signed a trade-in check 
list in which they confirmed that they were relinquishing their previous 
memberships;
they also signed other documents including the terms and conditions, a separate 
standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given, an initial disclosure 
document, a standard information form and the loan agreement;
the standard information form said that Mr and Mrs S were:  purchasing 
credits  which can be exchanged for rights of occupation and use in a unit of 
accommodation or a yacht or use of other lifestyle products such as luxury cars 
 until the Termination Date in accordance with the Membership Club Rules, the 
Reservation Rules and the Deed of Trust;
Mr and Mrs Ss representative made claims to Vacation Finance in February 
2020 and Mr and Mrs S then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter 
refers to claims under sections 75 and 140A, including that the credits were 
misrepresented to Mr and Mrs S, but their complaint form only refers to claims 
under section 140A and doesnt refer to a misrepresentation made by the holiday 
company;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods 
or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that 
section are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, 
to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor 
and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Ss claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Vacation Finances response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Ss representatives February 2020 letter to Vacation Finance says 
that the credits were misrepresented to Mr and Mrs S because they were advised 
that the product was of some substance and that the purchase would be an 
investment as the product would increase in value and, after a period of a few years, they would be able to sell it at a considerable profit  but it says that the 
product is worthless and has no merit;
Mrs S says that she and her husband wanted to sell their existing memberships 
in April 2019 but were told that there was no resale office and the chances of 
selling them were remote so pressure was put on them to buy the credits which 
they were told they could sell all or parts of from 2024  she says that they were 
allocated 11,650 points but could only use 320 each year for 25 years (which she 
says should have been 466 points each year) and were told that they could sell 
the points in 2024 and that if they didnt come every year they could rent out the 
credits and make some money  shes also provided a photo of what shes 
described as the salespersons scribblings;
the standard information form says: The Resale Facility for [the credits] will be 
available to be applied for as of the year 2024 and cannot be relied upon as the 
basis for entering into a Membership. Resale values or timeframes cannot be 
guaranteed and are subject to offer and demand; and it also describes the 
arrangements for accelerated usage of the credits;
the credits can be exchanged for rights of occupation and use in a unit of 
accommodation or a yacht or use of other lifestyle products so I dont consider 
that the credits are worthless;
the explanation that has been provided by Mrs S doesnt refer to the credits as 
being an investment and none of Mr and Mrs S and their representative has 
provided a detailed account of the circumstances in which Mr and Mrs S were 
told that the credits were an investment, the conversations that took place or the 
information that was provided to them before they bought the credits;
Im not persuaded that the salespersons scribblings show that the credits were 
represented to Mr and Mrs S as an investment and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the holiday company represented to Mr and Mrs S 
that the credits were an investment, that the credits were misrepresented to them 
by the holiday company or that they were induced into entering into the 
membership application agreement by any such misrepresentations;
the February 2020 letter also says that the holiday company has ceased to trade 
and has committed a repudiatory breach of contract - I understand that the 
holiday company went into liquidation in May 2020 and I consider that the 
liquidation of the holiday company would be a breach of contract for which 
Vacation Finance would be liable under section 75;
but I also understand that a new management company has been appointed to 
provide the services in connection with the credits that Mr and Mrs S had bought 
from the holiday company in April 2019 and that the credits are available for them 
to use;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Ss use of the credits has been 
adversely impacted by the liquidation of the holiday company and I consider the 
appointment of the new management company to have been a suitable remedy 
for any breach of contract and Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs S would be 
entitled to terminate their membership application agreement in these 
circumstances;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any 
other breach of contract by the holiday company for which Vacation Finance 
would be liable under section 75;
Mr and Mrs Ss representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs S and Vacation Finance because the holiday company and Vacation 
Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan;
Vacation Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt 
declared to them and the holiday company unduly pressured them into entering 
into the membership application agreement and the loan agreement;
the February 2020 letter says that the loan was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs S 
and their complaint form says that the holiday company and Vacation Finance 
failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan but none 
of Mr and Mrs S and their representative has provided detailed evidence about 
Mr and Mrs Ss financial position in April 2019 or to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for them at that time;
Vacation Finance says that its usual process involved obtaining income and 
expenditure information from the prospective debtor as well as conducting credit 
reference checks with external credit reference agencies  and that for it to 
approve a loan application, a customer needed to meet a certain minimum credit 
score and the monthly repayment had to be no more than a quarter of the 
customer's disposable income;
it also says that Mr and Mrs S advised in their loan application that they had a 
combined annual income of £38,000, which exceeded its minimum credit score 
requirement, and had a calculated monthly disposable amount of £565, so the 
monthly payment of £95.51 was deemed affordable;
Vacation Finance hasnt provided any further information about the affordability 
checks that it conducted at that time but I consider that it would have been 
reasonable for it to have concluded on the basis of the information that it says 
that Mr  and Mrs S advised in their loan application that they could afford a loan 
with a monthly repayment of £95.51;
it also says that Mr and Mrs S have maintained their monthly payments and Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mr and Mrs S when it was made to them, that Vacation Finance 
should have done more to assess the affordability of the loan for them, that the 
loan was mis-sold to them or that Vacation Finance has acted incorrectly in 
connection with the loan;
Vacation Finance says that it paid no commission to the holiday company and 
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that a commission was paid by 
it to the holiday company so Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that theres been a breach of any fiduciary duty;
Mr and Mrs Ss complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured 
them into entering into the membership application agreement and the loan 
agreement and Mrs S says that pressure was put on her and her husband to buy 
the credits but no further description of the undue pressure that was applied to 
them has been provided;
Mr and Mrs S had signed the separate standard form of the withdrawal notice 
that could be given to withdraw from the membership application agreement 
within 14 days without giving any reason  and if theyd been unduly pressured 
into entering into that agreement and didnt want to buy the credits I consider that 
it would be reasonable to expect them to have exercised their right to withdraw 
from the agreement  but they didnt do so;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs S were 
unduly pressured into entering into the membership application agreement or the loan agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptable sales practices 
against them;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Ss 
relationship with Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely 
that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and 
Mrs S and Vacation Finance in these circumstances;
although Vacation Finance didnt respond to Mr and Mrs Ss claims until after 
theyd complained to this service, I consider that the reasons that it then provided 
for not upholding their claims were fair and reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs S for the issues that theyve had with their credits, 
but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require Vacation Finance to refund to them any of the money that theyve paid 
under the loan agreement, to cancel the loan, to pay them any compensation or 
to take any other action in response to their complaint.
Subject to any further comments or evidence that I received from any of Mr and Mrs S, their 
representative and Vacation Finance, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to 
uphold this complaint. Vacation Finance hasnt responded to my provisional decision but Mr 
and Mrs Ss representative says that Mr and Mrs S dont agree with my provisional decision 
and have made the following comments:
they dislike the tone that Ive taken regarding the photographic evidence from the 
salesman and they say that Im implying that theyve made it up and did it 
themselves;
they cant provide more evidence as they didnt record the conversations that they 
had;
theyve not been contacted by the new management company; and
I come across as very pro Vacation Finance and theyre not sure why I keep referring 
to the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not persuaded that I should change my provisional decision. 
Mrs S said, in support of her complaint: I will take a photo of the salespersons scribblings (I 
sent this with the original letter) which may or not help. I referred to the photo as being of 
the salesmans scribblings but I dont consider it to be likely that Mr and Mrs S would have 
created the notes made by the salesman. Im not persuaded that those notes show that the 
credits were represented to them as an investment or that theres enough evidence to show 
that the holiday company represented to them that the credits were an investment. 
If the credits had been sold to them as an investment, I consider that it would be reasonable 
to expect them to have obtained more information from the holiday company about, for 
example, the nature of the investment, the return that they should expect and how that 
compared with the return on other investments. But none of Mr and Mrs S and their 
representative has provided a detailed account of the circumstances in which Mr and Mrs S 
were told that the credits were an investment, the conversations that took place or the 
information that was provided to them before they bought the credits.My role is to consider all of the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of a complaint. Im neither pro Vacation Finance nor pro Mr 
and Mrs S but, having considered all of the evidence, Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs Ss 
complaint about Vacation Finances response to the claims that had been made to it should 
be upheld. 
Ive asked our investigator to provide Mr and Mrs S with some contact information for the 
management company that has been appointed to provide the services in connection with 
the credits.
Mr and Mrs Ss complaint is about Vacation Finances response to the claims that had been 
made to it. The claim relates to the credits that they bought under the membership 
application agreement in April 2019. The other party to that agreement is the holiday 
company but its not the organisation about which theyre complaining so it wouldnt be 
appropriate for me to identify it in my decision and, for that reason, Ive referred to it as the 
holiday company.
I consider that the reasons that Vacation Finance provided for not upholding Mr and Mrs Ss 
claims were fair and reasonable so, although I sympathise with Mr and Mrs S for the issues 
that theyve had with their credits, I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Vacation Finance to refund to them any of the money that 
theyve paid under the loan agreement, to cancel the loan, to pay them any compensation or 
to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision before 5 January 2024.
