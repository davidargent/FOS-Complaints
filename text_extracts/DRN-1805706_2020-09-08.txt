The complaint
Mr R complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) acted irresponsibly by increasing his credit limit.
What happened
Mr R applied for and was approved for a credit card with NewDay to help improve his credit 
file. NewDay accepts customers with some negative financial information and markets its 
product as a way of helping customers to improve their credit file. 
The credit limit on his card was £900. Over a two-year period NewDay wrote to Mr R offering 
increases to his credit limit. In its letters, NewDay told Mr R to contact it within 30 days if he 
didnt want the increase. The letters also said that Mr R should consider his ability to repay 
before deciding. Mr R didnt reject the increases and his credit limit was £5200 when he 
contacted NewDay to complain. 
Mr R complained to NewDay saying it acted irresponsibly by increasing his credit limit when 
it shouldve been aware of his financial difficulty. As a result, he experienced undue stress 
and had to take out loans to cover the payments. He says NewDay took longer than eight 
weeks to reply. 
NewDay acknowledged that it took three weeks longer to reply to Mr Rs complaint than it 
shouldve done. However, because Mr R didnt reject the offers, or ask it to stop offering 
increases, NewDay thought the increased credit limits were affordable based on the 
information it held.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He thought that NewDay had completed all the 
necessary checks before offering the credit limit increases and there was no evidence that 
Mr R had used the card in a way which wouldve caused concern. 
Mr R didnt agree. He thought NewDay shouldve completed additional affordability checks 
before applying increases to his account. 
The complaint was passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear about the financial difficulty Mr R has found himself in. While I can 
sympathise with him, Ive decided not to uphold his complaint. Ill explain why.
Theres no dispute about NewDay approving Mr Rs original application for the credit card, 
and I understand he wanted the card so that he could improve his credit file. The key issue 
of complaint is that NewDay repeatedly increased his credit limit without taking into 
consideration his financial situation. There are rules and best practice guidelines that 
NewDay must follow when deciding to increase the credit limit, so I have looked at whether it 
acted in line with them.
Before offering a credit limit increase, NewDay shouldve considered how the increase might 
affect Mr Rs financial situation by looking at the information it already had, whether it was 
likely Mr R could make the payments, and information held by credit reference agencies. 
NewDay provided evidence of the information it used to complete these checks and, more 
recently, copies of the monthly statements. Mr R provided me with a copy of his credit report. 
Having looked at the information, Im satisfied that NewDay wouldnt have known that the 
increases it offered mightve adversely affected Mr Rs financial situation. So it seems to 
have made the offers in line with the guidance.
The guidelines say that NewDay should give Mr R the opportunity to reject the increase and 
the terms and conditions of the account reflect this. Ive seen the letters it sent before each 
increase giving Mr R 30 days to reject its offer. The letters also advise Mr R that he can ask 
NewDay not to send any further offers. Mr R doesnt dispute receiving the letters or being 
aware of the option to reject but he says its too easy to accept the offers. I can understand 
this, but it was still open to him to ask NewDay to stop sending offers so there wouldnt be 
any temptation. Mr R didnt reject the offers or ask it to stop sending them, so it was 
reasonable for NewDay to assume he could afford to pay. I dont think it did anything wrong 
here.
There are rules about when a business shouldnt offer a credit limit increase but, having 
looked at the information NewDay provided, Im satisfied that Mr R didnt meet the criteria. 
For example, his account was not in arrears, or over the credit limit. While Mr R says it 
shouldve been clear that he was in financial difficulty, I dont think his account indicates that. 
Ive seen that he paid more than the minimum payment on a regular basis, at times he paid 
the balance in full, and there was just one late payment fee. At no point leading up to his 
complaint did he exceed his limit. I dont think NewDay acted unreasonably by sending the 
offers.
Mr R thinks that NewDay shouldve seen that he:
always used the card up to the limit;
took cash advances, and
had lots of other credit cards, store cards and loans.
And he thinks NewDay didnt take account of his spending habits or offer support when he 
went over the limit or missed payments.
NewDay has a record of Mr Rs financial commitments. But it actively promotes its product to 
people who wish to improve their credit file, so the presence of negative records in his credit 
file wouldnt necessarily have been reason for it not to offer a credit limit increase. That said, 
there was no evidence of default, payment plans or court action on Mr Rs file anyway. 
Looking at the way Mr R used his credit card, I havent seen anything which mightve caused 
concern before NewDay offered the credit limit increases - his spending didnt appear to be 
unusual. In the week immediately before NewDays final offer of a credit limit increase, Mr R 
incurred cash advance fees. But the fees were for online transactions rather than cash 
withdrawals so, again, in context of the overall circumstances here, I can see why NewDay 
may not have viewed these as a reason not to offer a limit increase.
Ive looked at the information on Mr Rs credit file around the times that NewDay offered the 
credit limit increases. The credit history doesnt look unusual  a couple of five-year loans paid up to date and some credit cards. There are very few late payments evident and only a 
small number of cash advances on the credit card history.
Im aware that Mr R thinks NewDay shouldnt have offered the credit limit increases knowing 
he had loans, store cards and credit cards. But his credit file indicates that he was managing 
his credit, and it was always open to Mr R to reject the offers.
Mr R has gone into some detail about how he was conducting his account at the relevant 
times here. Hes also told us (and NewDay) more about his financial position at this time too. 
But I must be fair to both sides and I dont think the evidence Ive seen reflects Mr Rs view 
of his account. So, I dont think theres any clear evidence that NewDay shouldve been 
aware of to indicate Mr R was in any financial difficulty.
Mr R says NewDay didnt offer him any support and it took longer than eight weeks to reply 
to him. Ive seen its response to Mr R in which NewDay gives contact details for various 
organisations providing debt advice. It also offered its own customer support team details. 
But theres no record that Mr R ever contacted NewDay about needing support before that. 
NewDay offered the support details as soon as it became aware that Mr R felt he was in 
financial difficulty. Up to that point it wasnt aware of any problems, so I cant say that it acted 
unfairly by not providing the details sooner.
NewDay acknowledged that it didnt respond as quickly as it shouldve done, and it 
apologised to Mr R. Im satisfied that this is a reasonable outcome and I dont think NewDay 
needs to do any more.
To resolve his complaint, Mr R would like NewDay to acknowledge that it acted 
irresponsibly, made his credit file worse, and failed to respond to his complaint promptly. He 
would also like NewDay to offer support to reduce his debt and refund all interest payments 
and fees since the first credit limit increase onto his card to reduce his debt. As Ive 
explained above, I dont think NewDay has done anything wrong. It has stopped any further 
increases being offered on the account, which I think is a positive outcome. It also declined 
Mr Rs application for a further credit limit increase which he made after he raised his 
complaint. I think that was a fair thing to do in the circumstances.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, my final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 October 2020.
