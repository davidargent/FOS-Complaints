K821x#15complaint
Mr R says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him. He says 
he was in a debt spiral  and couldnt afford the loans.
background
This complaint is about 13 payday  loans  QuickQuid provided to Mr R between  
February 2009 and February 2011. Some of the loan information  is detailed in an appendix 
at the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Rs complaint and thought  loan 2 onwards shouldnt have been 
given. QuickQuid disagreed and made an offer on some of the loans recommended by the 
adjudicator. As Mr R didnt accept  QuickQuids offer, the complaint was passed to me.
Since the adjudication, there  have  been  no further  disputes about loan 1 by Mr R and so my 
decision has focused on loans 2 onwards.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN73729172I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading (OFT) guidance defined sustainable as 
being without  undue  difficulties  in particular without incurring or increasing problem 
indebtedness, over the life of the credit agreement, out of income and/or savings and without 
having to realise  security  or assets.  And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought 
fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments 
sustainably if they cant do so without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, he didnt think QuickQuid was wrong to give Mr R loan 1, Ive 
looked at the circumstances  around  this loan and I agree. I also agree with our adjudicator 
that loan 2 represented a significant portion of Mr Rs income and so it was highly likely he 
wasnt in a position to afford the repayment  of this and subsequent loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr R, to see if there 
was a point at which QuickQuid should  reasonably  have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by
loan 6. I say this because by loan 6, Mr R had been borrowing consistently for more  than 
seven months without any significant  breaks, the loan amounts were also generally 
increasing. And from loan 6 onwards  Mr R was provided with a new loan within  days of 
settling a previous  one. So QuickQuid  ought to have  realised it was more  likely than not 
Mr R was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Rs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Also, Mr R wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid. Loan 13 was 
taken out more than 24 months after loan 1, and it was for a larger  amount  about double 
the amount of loan 1. Effectively, Mr R had paid large amounts  of interest to, in effect, 
service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended  period - more  than two years.
I think Mr R has lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards and these  loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
Also, the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Rs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 13 and QuickQuid should put things 
right.
Ref: DRN73729173putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 2 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
If Mr R still owes  QuickQuid any of the principal balance he borrowed on his final 
loan QuickQuid should remove all the interest and charges applied  to the outstanding 
balance. QuickQuid should then re-work the account as if all payments made by 
Mr R went to towards the principal. But importantly, QuickQuid needs to make sure 
that Mr R doesnt  repay more than the principal  amount borrowed.  
If after doing this Mr R hasnt repaid  the principal he borrowed, QuickQuid can deduct 
this from the remainder of the compensation. If, Mr R has already paid enough to 
repay the principal  then any overpayment should  be refunded  to him with 8% simple  
interest from the date of payment  to the date of settlement.
And if QuickQuid no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to 
the amount owed,  then it should buy it back. If it doesnt then it isnt entitled to make  
any deductions for it from the amount  it needs  to pay Mr R,
remove any negative information  about loans 2 to 5 from Mr Rs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 13 should be removed from 
Mr Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should pay Mr R compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 July 2019.
