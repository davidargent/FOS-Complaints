The complaint
Mr R complains that Nationwide Building Society wont refund to him the money that he paid 
for some flooring.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr R used his Nationwide credit card in October 2018 to pay £455 to a flooring 
supplier which included £275 for some vinyl flooring for his kitchen;
he complained to the supplier in December 2018, and then to Nationwide, because 
the vinyl flooring in his kitchen was bubbling  Nationwide says that the suppliers 
inspection of the flooring found that the bubbling was caused by water damage 
because the floor was damp;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Rs complaint about Nationwide, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the flooring 
and that Nationwides response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or 
reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Rs claim under section 75 
as only a court would be able to do that;
Nationwide said that it was unable to see that a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation had taken place and it asked Mr R to provide an independent 
report about the damage  it discussed that with him during phone calls and said that 
hed be reimbursed for the cost of the report if his claim was successful;
Mr R has described the difficulties that hes had in finding someone to inspect the 
flooring but Ive seen no evidence to support his claim that he was told by Nationwide 
that it wouldnt be reimbursing him for the flooring whatever the report said;
Mr R has provided photos showing the flooring, which has been removed, and some 
receipts for additional costs that hes incurred  but Im not persuaded that hes 
provided enough evidence to show that the flooring was damaged as a result of a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
I consider that Nationwides response to his claim  including its request for an 
independent report about the damage - has been fair and reasonable in these 
circumstances and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it 
has acted incorrectly; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Nationwide to reimburse 
Mr R for the cost of the flooring, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 December 2020.
