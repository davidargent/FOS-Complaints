The complaint
Miss D complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money lent to her when it 
shouldnt have.
What happened
118 118 Money lent Miss D two loans between January 2020 and April 2021, the details of 
the loans are as follows:
Loan 
number Start dateLoan 
amount 
(£) TermRepayment

Miss D complained to 118 118 Money, but it didnt uphold her complaint, it said its lending 
decision was based on Miss D being able to afford the loan. Unhappy with that response, 
Miss D referred the complaint to this service where it was looked at by one of our 
adjudicators.
Our adjudicator thought 118 118 Money did enough before lending loan but thought 118 118 
Money should have taken its checks further before lending loan 2. However, he said he 
hadnt seen enough evidence that further checks by 118 118 Money would have meant it 
shouldnt have lent to Miss D. So, he didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld.
Miss D asked for an ombudsman to review her complaint. She said at the time of loan 1, she 
was on maternity leave and a low income. She said she had credit with other lenders and 
was struggling with a gambling problem.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before lending money to a consumer, a lender should take proportionate steps to 
understand whether the consumer could repay without borrowing further or suffering 
significant adverse consequences.
A lender should gather enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance and rules themselves didnt set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account before agreeing to lend. The 
key thing was that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different things, including things such as how much was being lent and when what 
was being borrowed was due to be repaid. A business should also take into account and 
react appropriately to what it knew about the consumer at the time it made its lending 
decision.
Did 118 118 Money carry out sufficient checks?
118 118 Money has provided details of the checks it carried out and from what I can see, it 
asked Miss D about her income and expenses and searched her credit file before both 
loans. I think given the loan amount and term of loan 1, the checks 118 118 Money did went 
far enough. The results of its checks also didnt reveal anything particularly concerning that 
should have prompted it to take its checks further, so I think it did enough before lending 
loan 1.
Looking at loan 2,I think given the increase in the loan amount within a short time and the 
length of the loan term, it would have been reasonable for 118 118 Money to take its checks 
further to get a better understanding of Miss Ds financial circumstances before lending.
What would proportionate checks have shown?
Miss D has provided a copy of her bank statements from around the time and Ive used this 
to build a picture of Miss Ds circumstances at the time. From what I can see, Miss D credit 
commitments were similar to what the search into her credit file revealed. I can also see that 
in the two months prior to the lending, Miss D has some gambling transactions which on 
average was around £184. In my opinion these gambling transactions on their own werent 
significant enough to cause 118 118 Money concern about Miss Ds ability to repay the loan.
This is because the transactions were small compared to Miss Ds income and they dont 
suggest Miss D was in an unsustainable financial position. The overall picture of Miss Ds 
finances the time of loan 2 suggests she could afford the loan repayment over the term and I 
dont think 118 118 Money was wrong to lend.
I appreciate my finding will disappoint Miss D, but I hope my explanation goes some way to 
help her understand why Ive reached these conclusions.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold this compliant or make any award against 
Madison CF UK Limited. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 February 2023.
