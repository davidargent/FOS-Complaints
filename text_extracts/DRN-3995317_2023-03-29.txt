The complaint
Mrs P complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that shes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Shes being represented in her complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs P and her husband say that they purchased a six week holiday ownership product in 
December 2008 for £25,000. They each entered into a credit card agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance in December 2008 and each used £12,500 of credit to pay for the product. 
The credit was on buy now pay later terms so wasnt charged to their accounts until six 
months from the purchase date. 
Mrs P and her husband each entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance in May 2009 for a loan of £12,500 which they each used to repay the credit that had 
been provided to them under the credit card agreements. Mrs P agreed to make 120 
monthly repayments of £180.70 to Barclays Partner Finance. The loan was repaid in June 
2011.
Mrs P and her husband say that they exchanged the six week holiday ownership product in 
November 2009 for a four week product and also made a payment of £4,350. They say that 
they exchanged those weeks for another product with one fixed week and one floating week 
in November 2011 and paid a further £39,950. They say that the £39,950 was paid using two 
loans that were made to Mrs Ps husband  a loan of £18,702 from Barclays Partner Finance 
and a loan of £21,248 from another finance provider. I understand that Mrs P and her 
husband bought credits in a different holiday product in September 2015 for which they paid 
£8,800.
Mrs Ps and her husbands representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act in July 2021 about the credit agreements 
that it said that theyd entered into in May 2009 and they made a complaint to this service in 
August 2021. Barclays Partner Finance then issued a final response letter to each of Mrs P 
and her husband in which it said that the claims were time-barred under the Limitation Act 
1980.
Mrs P and her husbands complaint form says that in May 2009: Barclays Partner Finance 
paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mrs P and her husband; 
the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mrs P and her husbands 
ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured them into entering the agreements and used 
aggressive commercial practices to pressure them; the membership was misrepresented to 
them; and the holiday company went into liquidation in January 2020 so was in breach of 
contract; all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A  and it said that the 
claim should also be considered under section 75. 
Our investigator considered Mrs Ps and her husbands complaints separately and she didnt 
recommend that Mrs Ps complaint should be upheld. She thought that her section 140A 
claim was late under the Limitation Act and that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely 
on the timing of her misrepresentation claim to turn it down. She said that there wasnt the 
evidence to demonstrate that the holiday company had failed to fulfil the contracts terms so 
she didnt think that it had breached the contract. She also said that she hadnt seen 
anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mrs P.
Mrs Ps and her husbands representative says that Mrs P and her husband disagree with 
our investigators recommendations and have asked for their complaints to be considered by 
an ombudsman. Their representative has provided a detailed response and says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that:
although some of the loans were made to Mrs Ps husband, its clear that they were 
for their joint benefit;
the holiday ownership product was marketed as an investment but theres no 
functioning re-sale market for it;
the products were essentially perpetual long-term contracts;
no affordability assessment was carried out;
Mrs P and her husband were subjected to aggressive sales practices and pressured 
into the agreements;
the holiday company went into liquidation in January 2020 so is in breach of contract;
although Mrs Ps loan was discharged in June 2011, the unfairness in the 
relationship with Barclays Partner Finance continued;
Mrs P and her husband could only reasonably have been aware of their cause for 
complaint when they went to professional advisers and the nature of the 
representations were such that their falsity were only discovered much later;
under section 32 of the Limitation Act, the limitation period doesnt begin to run until 
the facts relating to that unfair relationship could have been discovered with 
reasonable diligence;
the product was misrepresented to Mrs P and her husband and there was an unfair 
relationship between them and Barclays Partner Finance; and
there were multiple breaches of accepted good practice, guidance and statutory duty. 
In this decision Im only considering Mrs Ps complaint about Barclays Partner Finances 
response to her claims under sections 75 and 140A concerning the holiday ownership 
product that she and her husband bought in December 2008. Her husbands complaint 
about Barclays Partner Finances response to his claims under sections 75 and 140A 
concerning that product will be considered separately. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ps complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Ps complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that she 
and her husband had made to it and I accept that they referred their complaint to this 
service within six years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the 
Limitation Act applies to Mrs Ps claims;
Mrs Ps claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs Ps claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the 
holiday company and that the holiday ownership product was misrepresented to her 
and her husband and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
Ive not been provided with copies of any of the purchase documents that would have 
been entered into by Mrs P and her husband in December 2008 for their purchase of 
the holiday ownership product but Barclays Partner Finance has provided copies of 
the credit agreements that they entered into in December 2008 and the loan 
agreements that they entered into in May 2009;
Mrs Ps representative says that the holiday company went into liquidation in January 
2020 and that theres been a breach of contract  but Mrs P and her husband say 
that they exchanged the six week holiday ownership product that theyd bought in 
December 2008 for a four week product and that they then exchanged those weeks 
for another product with one fixed week and one floating week and theyve also 
bought credits in a different holiday product;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the contract under which they bought the 
holiday ownership product in December 2008 would have been replaced by a new 
contract for their exchange of that product for another product in November 2009  
and, as Barclays Partner Finance didnt provide them with any credit for that 
purchase, I dont consider that it would be liable under section 75 for any subsequent 
breach of contract and I dont consider that it has any liability to Mrs P in these 
circumstances arising from the liquidation of the holiday company in January 2020;
even if Im wrong about that, Barclays Partner Finance says that the management 
company for the resorts has confirmed that customers are able to book holidays and 
are able to list their property for resale in accordance with their agreements so Im 
not persuaded that there would have been a breach of contract;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any other 
breach of contract by the holiday company for which Barclays Partner Finance would 
be liable to Mrs P under section 75;the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs P could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her and her 
husband into buying the holiday ownership product in December 2008 as that was 
the latest time that any misrepresentations would have been made to them and any 
loss would have been incurred as that was when Mrs P also entered into the credit 
card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made under section 75 
until July 2021, more than twelve years later which was outside of the time limits set 
out in the Limitation Act so I consider that her misrepresentation claim is now time-
barred;
Mrs Ps representative says that the limitation period doesnt begin to run until the 
facts relating to the unfair relationship could have been discovered with reasonable 
diligence  but I dont consider that the time when Mrs P became aware that she 
could bring a claim assists her for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits 
for a claim under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt 
have knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider 
that those sections are applicable to Mrs Ps claims;
Mrs Ps representative says that section 32 of the Limitation Act postpones the 
limitation period - section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right 
of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt 
begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable 
diligence have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate 
commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time 
amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Im not persuaded that Mrs P has provided enough evidence to show that theres 
been a deliberate concealment of any facts from her and I dont consider that section 
32 is applicable in these circumstances;
Mrs Ps representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs P and 
Barclays Partner Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that the credit under the 
credit agreement was repaid in June 2009 after Mrs P had entered into a loan 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in May 2009 to repay the credit  it has 
also provided evidence to show that the loan was repaid, and the loan agreement 
ended, in June 2011;
I consider that Mrs P would have had six years from then to bring a claim against 
Barclays Partner Finance but a claim under section 140A wasnt made until her and 
her husbands representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance in July 2021, more 
than ten years after the loan had been repaid, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that her claim under section 140A is now also 
time-barred; 
our investigator also considered Mrs Ps complaint that the holiday company failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan but she said that she 
hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for 
Mrs P;
the credit was made available to Mrs P in December 2008 and she had the benefit of 
a buy now pay later offer so the credit wasnt charged to her account until six months 
later  Mrs P then entered into a loan agreement which she used to repay the credit 
and that loan was repaid in June 2011;
Mrs Ps husband entered into similar arrangements and his loan was also repaid in 
June 2011 and Mrs P and her husband have described further purchases that they 
made between November 2009 and September 2015 totalling £53,100;
Mrs P and her husband say that they had to extend their mortgage, delay early 
retirement and continue working past retirement age, which has impacted their health 
and stress levels but Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs P asked Barclays 
Partner Finance for any information about the affordability assessment that it 
conducted before her and her husbands representatives letter to Barclays Partner 
Finance in July 2021  more than ten years after her loan had been repaid;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mrs P to have raised any concerns 
about the affordability of the loan or the affordability assessment that was conducted 
before then and Ive seen no evidence to show that the credit and the loan werent 
affordable for Mrs P when they were made to her;
Barclays Partner Finance issued a response to Mrs Ps claims in which it said that 
her claims were time-barred under the Limitation Act  I consider that its response 
was fair and reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mrs P for the issues that she and her husband have described, but 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance to refund to her any of the money that she paid under the 
credit card agreement or loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ps complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2023.
