The complaint
Mr S complains that a hire purchase agreement with Hyundai Capital UK Limited, trading as 
Hyundai Finance, under which a car was supplied to him, was misrepresented to him.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mr S under a hire purchase agreement with Hyundai Finance that 
he electronically signed in May 2021. He says that he contacted Hyundai Finance to ask for 
the certificate required for him to take the car overseas as he was planning a summer 
overseas trip to see family but he was told that he wouldnt be allowed to take the car out of 
the country for more than 28 days and was unlikely to get permission to take it to one of the 
countries that he wanted to visit. 
He complained to Hyundai Finance but it referred to him section 4.2 of the terms and 
conditions of his hire purchase agreement which says: You will not move the goods from 
the United Kingdom without our prior written consent, but goods can be taken from the 
United Kingdom to Western Europe for up to 28 days at any one time, without our consent. 
He wasnt satisfied with its response so he complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that she 
couldnt fairly conclude that the sole reason that Mr S was induced to buy the car was 
because he thought he could take it to the country that he wanted to visit and she didnt 
agree that a false statement was provided. She said that the terms state that written consent 
is required and Hyundai Finance couldnt provide that. 
Mr S has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He has responded to 
our investigators recommendation in detail and, in summary and amongst other things: 
he has described the discussions with the dealer and provided details of his multiple 
trips to the country that he wanted to visit over many years; 
he says that the dealer told him that it shouldnt be a problem for him to take the car 
there; 
he says that the single purpose of signing the agreement for the car with an annual 
mileage limit of 9,000 miles was an annual trip to stay the summer in the country that 
he wanted to visit and, had it been clear that that might not be possible, he wouldnt 
have acquired such a large car and paid extra for all those miles; and
he says that the contract does not stipulate what constitutes Western Europe.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr S provided a detailed letter to this service with his complaint form in which he 
described the circumstances of his complaint;
in that letter he said that the dealer failed to inform him that there could be a potential 
conflict between the contractual arrangement and his desire to take the car to the 
country that he wanted to visit  but there was no mention in that letter of the dealer 
having told him that it shouldnt be a problem and hes only referred to that after our 
investigator had recommended that his complaint should be upheld;
if the dealer had said that I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mr S to 
have referred to that in his letter;
in that letter he also says: I am aware that I have read and signed the contract and 
that it stipulates the car cannot be taken abroad for more than 28 days. However, as 
the contract stipulated discretion on the part of the Hyundai Finance company on 
taking the car abroad, then I also thought there could possibly also be discretion 
regarding the 28-day limit;
Mr S electronically signed the hire purchase agreement but he says that hed read 
the terms and conditions which said: You will not move the goods from the United 
Kingdom without our prior written consent, but goods can be taken from the United 
Kingdom to Western Europe for up to 28 days at any one time, without our consent;
Mr S had read that term so I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to 
have checked with Hyundai Finance whether it considered the country that he 
wanted to visit to be in Western Europe before he signed the agreement;
I dont consider that that term is as clear as it ought to be as there is no set definition 
of the countries that are in Western Europe - but Im not persuaded that the country 
that Mr S wanted to visit would reasonably be considered to be in Western Europe;
it seems likely to me that there was discussion between Mr S and the dealer about 
him taking the car to the country that he wanted to visit but Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the dealer said that hed be able to take the car 
to the country that he wanted to visit, that it said anything that wasnt true, or that 
Mr S was induced into entering into the agreement by a misrepresentation made by 
the dealer;
I sympathise with Mr S for the position in which he now finds himself and I 
understand the frustration that he clearly feels that hes bound by the agreement and 
cant take the car to the country that he wants to visit  but Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that Hyundai Finance has acted incorrectly in these 
circumstances and I consider that it acted in accordance with the terms of the 
agreement when it said that Mr S couldnt take the car to the country that he wanted 
to visit and couldnt take the car from the UK for more than 28 days at a time; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Hyundai Finance to end the hire purchase agreement, to pay any compensation to 
Mr S or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2022.
