The complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has declined his claim for a refund.
What happened
Mr C purchased goods using both a bank account and funds held in his PayPal account. In 
May 2020, he raised a dispute with PayPal under its buyer protection policy and claimed that 
the goods hed purchased were significantly not as described. He purchased goods for 
medical purposes only to find that the goods were damaged, caused skin irritation and 
violated certain regulations which meant they werent suitable for sale in the UK.
PayPal declined the claim, because it said that the goods purchased werent materially 
different to the sellers description of the goods. Mr C wasnt happy with this and brought his 
complaint to this service, where one of our investigators considered it. They said that 
PayPals protection is discretionary and that its decision here was in line with the relevant 
terms of the protection scheme it provides. So they didnt think PayPal had done anything 
wrong.
Mr C didnt agree. He said, in summary, that the goods were clearly sold in violation of 
relevant regulations and that, while PayPal may have declined the claim because the items 
werent significantly not as described  PayPal should refund him because he has statutory 
rights to a refund because he purchased unlawful goods.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It may help to start by explaining that PayPal isnt responsible for the sale of the goods here. 
Instead, it facilitated Mr Cs purchase of the goods in dispute. But PayPal offers a Buyer 
Protection scheme that applies when customers dont receive items or receive them, but the 
item isnt what was ordered. PayPals agreement then explains what it will consider as 
eligible and ineligible under the scheme, along with explaining how it will consider a claim 
like this.
Here, Mr C raised a claim and provided evidence to support this  but PayPal didnt feel that 
the goods were significantly different to the sellers description. So it declined Mr Cs claim  
thats a decision its entitled to make, so Ive considered whether its made that decision 
fairly.
In doing so, its not clear exactly how the goods were advertised when Mr C purchased 
them. All PayPal knew about how the item was described is what the product was, along 
with the relevant quantities of the goods. Mr C seems to have been provided with the goods 
and the appropriate quantities  his dispute is about the quality and legality of them.
Given what PayPals buyer protection policy says, it wouldnt be fair to say that PayPal 
should refund a purchase for goods if they were described and represented accurately and 
Mr C then purchased them on this basis. The absence of any information from the time that 
the goods were advertised makes it difficult for me to know for certain what Mr C saw before 
purchasing them. That means I have to decide this matter on the balance of probabilities  
that is, whats more likely than not to have happened based on the evidence I have.
While I havent seen exactly what Mr C would have been shown before purchasing the 
goods, I have seen how the website currently advertises the same product in different 
quantities. The product doesnt display any UK writing and only displays text on the bottle in 
European languages. While I accept that this isnt exactly what Mr C would have seen  it 
nonetheless shows that the UK website Mr C bought the goods from is selling similar bottles 
of the goods Mr C bought, showing a label not written in English. So I think its more likely 
than not that what Mr C would have seen prior to buying the goods was European languages 
on the bottles he bought. So I think Mr C was most likely provided with goods that were as 
described, which is a reason for PayPal to decline the claim he made under its terms.
I realise that Mr C views this reason to decline his claim as irrelevant when compared to his 
wider concerns - but this is a valid reason for PayPal to decline it. So while I dont doubt the 
issues hes had with the goods and Ive considered all his points about them not being in line 
with UK regulations  neither of those are reasons that PayPal states it will accept a claim 
under its policy here. There are no other criteria in PayPals user agreement that are clearly 
relevant to Mr Cs dispute either. 
Mr C has made several points, and conducted detailed research into, the legality of the 
goods. Ive considered all hes said around this  but I dont think that means that PayPal 
has unfairly declined his claim here, or should refund him. PayPals position doesnt 
prejudice Mr C from being able to pursue his claim against the retailer further and some of 
the legal points he made may be better served by other avenues. This service is set up to be 
quick and informal and looks at individual complaints against financial firms. Here PayPals 
decision just means he cant pursue the dispute through it any further. All of this means that I 
think PayPals decision to decline Mr Cs claim is a fair one. 
I realise this will likely seem contradictory to Mr C based on what weve said on the 
complaint he raised against his bank. But I think its important to echo what our investigator 
has already said  which is that we decide each complaint individually and on its own merits. 
PayPal has its own scheme, with its own criteria, which it uses to help customers try to 
resolve disputes, which is different to other financial businesses. It looked at Mr Cs claim 
and decided that it didnt meet the criteria to qualify for a refund. Im satisfied that its done 
so fairly and reasonably for the reasons Ive given above.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2023.
