Mr B says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr B had three loans  with QuickQuid. The first was an open-ended  credit  facility (known as 
FlexCredit) which allowed him to make drawdowns up to a specified  limit. Loans  2 and 3 
were payday  loans, repayable in three payments. Ive set out some of the information 
QuickQuid provided  about  the loans in the table below.

3 £750 13/09/2016 outstanding £930
An adjudicator considered  the complaint and recommended it be upheld in part  he didnt 
think QuickQuid shouldve  provided Mr B with loans 2 and 3. QuickQuid didnt agree with the 
adjudicator, so the complaint was passed  to me to decide. Mr B accepted the adjudicators  
opinion not to uphold loan 1, so Im not looking at that loan.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
did QuickQuid carry out proportionate checks?
Before proving loans  2 and 3, QuickQuid recorded  various pieces of information about Mr B. 
It recorded his income as around £1,350 for both loans  and that he was in employment  and 
living in rented accommodation. It also recorded  information about his expenses; his total 
monthly living expenses  were recorded  as £425  which included monthly credit 
commitments of £50.
This would leave Mr B with disposable income  in the region of £925  a month  although 
QuickQuid says its actual  estimate was disposable income of £299 for loan 2 and £612 for 
loan 3. Its my understanding that adjustments  would  have been made  to Mr Bs declared 
expenditure based on factors  such as credit checks and national average  expenditure data.
Our adjudicator thought that QuickQuid shouldve done more before deciding  whether to 
approve the loans.  He thought that the repayments  were large relative  to Mr Bs income  and 
that for loan 2, QuickQuid ought  to have obtained  more information from Mr B about his 
other short-term commitments  (if any).  He also though that for loan 3  where the largest 
repayment was almost 70% of Mr Bs income   that QuickQuid  ought to have obtained some 
form of proof of Mr Bs income and expenditure.
Having said this, I think its reasonably clear   on the basis of QuickQuids figures   that the 
loans were unlikely  to be sustainably affordable.
Ref: DRN51831232QuickQuids own estimate  of Mr Bs disposable for loan 2 was £299. I dont know exactly 
how it arrived at this figure. But I know it wouldve taken other credit commitments  it saw on 
Mr Bs credit  report into account. The disposable income  figure of £299 is less than the 
largest payment  of about £506.  So loan 2 would only be affordable if Mr B was able to save 
income across the three month period  of the loan to put towards the largest  repayment.
I dont think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid to accept Mr B was likely to be able to do that, 
bearing in mind his borrowing history. Hed kept his FlexCredit account (loan 1) for about  15 
months and during that time made  14 drawdowns totalling more  than £4,000.  He continued  
to make new drawdowns until the point QuickQuid closed the account. Although Mr B repaid 
the drawdowns on time, he borrowed again  soon after. Mr Bs FlexCredit  account  ran for a 
long time,  bearing  in mind the high-cost nature of the product. That Mr B didnt really  reduce 
his indebtedness  during  the time he had the account (until QuickQuid decided  to close  it) 
suggests he wasnt managing to repay the drawdowns sustainably - without undue difficulty.
There was then only a three month gap until loan 2. Bearing in mind  the pattern  of borrowing 
during loan 1 and taking  into account the relatively  short gap between the loans, I dont think  
QuickQuid could reasonably think Mr B was now in a position  to save money  to make the 
largest payment.  So it was likely  hed have to borrow  again  from QuickQuid or another 
lender  to make up the difference. I dont  therefore think loan 2 was lent responsibly and Im 
upholding the complaint  about it.
The largest repayment for loan 3 (£930) was also higher than QuickQuids estimate  of Mr Bs 
monthly disposable income (£612). But the loan was approved  more  than a year after loan 2. 
With such a large gap, I dont think it wouldve been inherently unreasonable for QuickQuid 
to assume Mr B could  save  money to put towards the largest  payment.
But even taking this into account, as the final repayment was so large, Ive considered what  
a proportionate check of evidence of Mr Bs income  and expenditure wouldve revealed. Our 
adjudicator set out in detail what hed seen of Mr Bs income and expenditure. What 
QuickQuid had recorded about  Mr Bs income was essentially correct.  But Mr Bs 
expenditure was higher  his normal living  costs (rent, transport, food) were around £500; 
his regular financial commitments (two debt management  plans  and car related  expenses) 
around £390 and his short-term loans commitments  about £300.
The total repayment for loan 3 was £1,218  or the equivalent of £406  a month. So I dont 
think its likely proportionate checks wouldve suggested Mr B had enough disposable  
income to sustainably repay loan 3. Im therefore  upholding Mr Bs complaint about  it.
putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr B paid on loans  2 and 3
pay interest of 8% simple  per year on the above,  from when Mr B paid the interest  
and charges (if he did) until the date of settlement
remove any negative information  about loans 2 and 3 from Mr Bs credit  history
QuickQuid may offset the redress against  the balance of loan 3  but only if it still owns  the 
debt.
Ref: DRN51831233HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr B a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 June  2019.
