The complaint
Mrs S complains that Tandem Personal Loans Limited wont refund to her the money that 
she paid for some holiday club membership credits. Her husband is also involved in her 
complaint and shes being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs S and her husband entered into a membership application agreement to buy 5,000 
holiday club membership credits from a holiday company in June 2018. The purchase price 
was £15,500 and Mrs S also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a finance 
provider for a loan of that amount. She agreed to make 179 monthly repayments of £158.23 
and a final payment of £156.46 to the finance provider.
Mrs S and her husband exchanged emails with the holiday company about some issues with 
their membership and the holiday company agreed to pay compensation to them. Mrs Ss 
representative then made claims, on behalf of Mrs S, to the finance provider under sections 
75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in September 2020. It said that the product 
was misrepresented to Mrs S and her husband; the contract was breached; commission was 
paid between the finance provider and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mrs S 
which created a breach of fiduciary duty and caused an unfair relationship; and the loan was 
unaffordable.
The finance provider didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so a complaint 
was made to this service. Mrs Ss complaint form says that the holiday company and the 
finance provider failed to conduct a proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan; the 
finance provider paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to her 
and the holiday company unduly pressured her and her husband into entering into the 
membership application agreement and her into entering into the loan agreement; all 
rendering the loan agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A.
The finance provider then provided a detailed response to Mrs Ss claims. It apologised for 
not responding within a reasonable time or within the regulatory timeframe and said that it 
would review its processes to ensure that it improves. It said that: it had found no evidence 
that the credits or loan account were mis-sold to her; the management company was in 
liquidation but a new management company had been appointed and was able to fully 
service Mrs S and her husbands membership in accordance with the terms and conditions 
of the contract; and there was no commission arrangement between it and the holiday 
company. Mrs S then provided a summary of the selling experience and the service received 
from the holiday company.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ss complaint should be upheld. He wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and he didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract. He said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest 
that the relationship between Mrs S and the finance provider was unfair and he wasnt 
persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He also 
said that Mrs S had completed a loan application and provided details of her income and 
expenditure, the finance provider had assessed the application based on the information 
provided and he couldnt see anything to suggest that the loan wasnt correctly set-up or that 
affordability wasnt assessed prior to the loan being granted.
Mrs Ss representative, on behalf of Mrs S, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It has provided a generic submission from a legal counsel about the holiday 
company and the unfair terms that it uses and it says that non-payment of maintenance fees 
results in the cancellation of the membership but not the finance agreement and there are 
significant hidden charges and liabilities found within the documents which makes the 
relationship unfair. It has also raised concerns about the way that the finance was sold to 
Mrs S and says that the holiday company didnt broker proper credit and failed to meet the 
standard of a regulated firm.
Mrs Ss loan was transferred to another finance provider in August 2022 and since then it 
has been transferred to Tandem Personal Loans.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ss complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mrs S and her husband entered into a membership application agreement in June 
2018 to buy 5,000 holiday club membership credits and the terms and conditions that 
they signed say that the credits granted them the right of occupation or use of a unit 
in each use year until the termination date  and they acknowledged receipt of the 
standard information document, the rules of membership, the reservation rules and 
the deed of trust;
the standard information form, which they also signed, says: You are purchasing 
Credits which can be exchanged for rights of occupation and use in a unit of 
accommodation or a yacht or use of other lifestyle products such as luxury cars at 
various locations each Use Year  until the Termination Date in accordance with the 
Rules of Membership, the Reservation Rules and the Deed of Trust;
Mrs S and her husband also signed other documents including an exchange 
contract, an initial disclosure document and a separate standard form of the 
withdrawal notice that could be given, and Mrs S electronically signed the loan 
agreement and confirmed that shed seen and read the pre-contract credit 
information and the loan explanation document;
Mrs Ss representative made claims to the finance provider in September 2020 and 
Mrs S then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter refers to claims under 
sections 75 and 140A, including that the credits were misrepresented to Mrs S and 
her husband, but her complaint form only refers to claims under section 140A and 
doesnt refer to a misrepresentation made by the holiday company;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Ss claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not the finance 
providers response to her claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mrs Ss representatives September 2020 letter says that: Mrs S and her husband 
were advised that the package would enable them to use exclusive accommodation 
and have cheaper holidays and that, over the length of the contract, they would save 
an amount in excess of the sum paid; and the credits were misrepresented to them 
because they were advised that the product was of some substance and that the 
purchase would be an investment as the product would increase in value and, after a 
period of a few years, they would be able to sell it at a considerable profit  but it 
says that the product is worthless and has no merit;
the credits can be exchanged for rights of occupation and use in a unit of 
accommodation or a yacht or use of other lifestyle products so I dont consider that 
theyre worthless and, although Mrs S had provided a summary of the selling 
experience, I dont consider that shes provided enough information about the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place at that time or the information that was provided to her 
and her husband to show that the holiday company misrepresented the credits to 
them;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
represented to Mrs S and her husband that the credits would enable them to use 
exclusive accommodation or to have cheaper holidays or that they were an 
investment  and nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
credits were misrepresented to them by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the membership application agreement by any such 
misrepresentations;
the September 2020 letter also says that the holiday company has ceased to trade 
and has committed a repudiatory breach of contract - the finance provider says that a 
new management company had been appointed and is able to fully service Mrs S 
and her husbands membership in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
contract and at no time had their rights of use and occupation been affected by the 
liquidation of the previous management company and appointment of the new 
management company.so there had been no breach of contract;
I consider that the liquidation of the holiday company could be a breach of contract 
for which Tandem Personal Loans might be liable under section 75 - but I also 
consider the appointment of the new management company to have been a suitable 
remedy for any breach of contract, and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs S and 
her husbands use of their credits has been adversely impacted by the liquidation of 
the holiday company and Im not persuaded that they would be entitled to terminate 
the membership application agreement in these circumstances;
the finance provider has also referred to the difficulties experienced by Mrs S and her 
husband in booking accommodation but it says that those difficulties were with an 
exchange affiliate that their membership allowed them to utilise  although I 
sympathise with Mrs S and her husband for those difficulties, the holiday company 
paid them some compensation and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company for which 
Tandem Personal Loans would now be liable under section 75;the September 2020 letter says that commission was paid between the finance 
provider and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mrs S which created a 
breach of fiduciary duty and caused an unfair relationship and Mrs Ss complaint form 
says that the finance provider paid a commission to the holiday company which 
wasnt declared to her;
the finance provider says that there was no commission arrangement between it and 
the holiday company and Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that any 
commission was paid by the finance provider to the holiday company;
the September 2020 letter also says that the loan was unaffordable for Mrs S and her 
complaint form says that the holiday company and the finance provider failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan;
the finance provider has described the affordability assessment that it conducted and 
has provided its loan application summary which shows that Mrs S had stated that 
her annual income was £25,000 and that shed given information about her monthly 
expenditure and other credit commitments;
it says that it calculated that after payment of household and other expenses, 
mortgage, credit commitments and the loan she would be left with monthly 
disposable income of £233.25 which passed its affordability checks and that Mrs S 
and her husband confirmed in the compliance meeting when the contracts were 
signed that the loan was affordable for them;
Mrs S has provided information about her financial situation which she says shows 
that the loan wasnt affordable for her but shed signed a document which said that 
she agreed to apply for a loan from the finance provider where payment needed to 
be covered in 180 months and she electronically signed the loan agreement in June 
2018 and confirmed that shed seen and read the pre-contract credit information and 
the loan explanation document;
the loan explanation document says: It is important that you only enter into this 
agreement if you can comfortably afford the payments, and are not aware of any 
potential changes in your circumstances that could affect your ability to make the 
payments in the future;
I dont consider that Mrs S has provided enough evidence about her financial 
situation in June 2018 to show that a loan with monthly repayments of £158.23 
wasnt affordable for her at that time and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the finance provider should have done more to assess the 
affordability of the loan for her, that the loan was mis-sold to her or that the finance 
provider has acted incorrectly in connection with the loan;
Mrs Ss loan has now been transferred to Tandem Personal Loans and its required 
to respond to any financial difficulties that Mrs S is experiencing positively and 
sympathetically  so if Mrs S is having difficulties with her monthly loan repayments, I 
suggest that she contacts Tandem Personal Loans and explains those difficulties to 
it;
Mrs Ss complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured her and her 
husband into entering into the membership application agreement and her into 
entering into the loan agreement and she has described the selling experience;
the standard information form that Mrs S and her husband had signed says: The 
consumer has the right to withdraw from this contract without giving any reason 
within 14 days from the conclusion of the contract or receipt of the contract if that 
takes place later; and they had also signed the separate standard form of the 
withdrawal notice that could be given;if theyd been unduly pressured into entering into the membership application 
agreement and didnt want to buy the credits, I consider that it would be reasonable 
to expect them to have contacted either the holiday company or the finance provider 
within the applicable withdrawal period to withdraw from the agreement but Ive seen 
no evidence to show that they did so;
the loan agreement also clearly set out Mrs Ss right to withdraw from the loan 
agreement within 14 days without giving any reason but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that she contacted the finance provider within the withdrawal period to withdraw 
from the loan agreement;
the finance provider says that Mrs S and her husband confirmed in the compliance 
meeting when the contracts were signed that theyd had sufficient time to read and 
understand the product and supporting literature and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that they were unduly pressurised into entering into the 
membership application agreement or that Mrs S was unduly pressurised into 
entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptable 
sales practices against them;
Mrs Ss representative has provided a generic submission from a legal counsel about 
the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses and it says that non-payment of 
maintenance fees results in the cancellation of the membership but not the finance 
agreement and there are significant hidden charges and liabilities found within the 
documents which makes the relationship unfair  but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in the agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mrs S and her husband 
and I consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances 
that the terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mrs S and 
the finance provider;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs Ss relationship 
with the finance provider was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs S and the finance 
provider in these circumstances;
the finance provider didnt respond to Mrs Ss claims until after shed complained to 
this service but it apologised for not responding within a reasonable time or within the 
regulatory timeframe, and I consider that the reasons that it then gave for not 
upholding her claims were fair and reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mrs S for the issues that she and her husband have had with their 
membership credits, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require 
Tandem Personal Loans to refund to Mrs S any of the money that shes paid under 
the loan agreement, to cancel the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to her complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 November 2023.
