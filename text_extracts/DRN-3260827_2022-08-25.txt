The complaint
Miss K complains about National Westminster Bank Plcs (NatWest) decision to review and 
block her account. 
What happened
Miss K held an account with NatWest. In August 2021, Miss K wasnt able to use her 
account after noticing her debit card was declined in store. Miss K attempted to find out what 
was happening  she made numerous phone calls and branch visits  and said the staff 
branch were rude and unhelpful. Miss K said this caused her significant stress and she 
wasnt able to feed her children.
In September 2021, Miss K raised a complaint. NatWest responded and apologised for the 
way she felt the branch staff had treated her but wasnt able to give any further information in 
relation to the block. NatWest paid Miss K £226.62 for reimbursement of the call costs, and 
£75 compensation for the trouble and upset the overall situation had caused.
Our investigator reviewed things and didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly. He explained 
that they were allowed to review the account at any time and thought theyd fairly 
compensated Miss K by reimbursing her costs and paying £75 compensation.
Miss K disagreed  she asked for £200 compensation in total. Our investigator got in touch 
with NatWest to ask if theyd be willing to increase their offer, but they refused. And as our 
investigator didnt think theyd acted unfairly; he didnt recommend the offer be increased.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Miss K feels strongly about her complaint. But NatWest are entitled to review 
the account under the account terms and conditions. And a bank isnt generally obliged to 
provide an explanation as to why transactions cant be carried out at the moment an account 
holder is seeking to make them, or as to why funds are generally not accessible. Having 
looked at the evidence, like the investigator, Im satisfied that NatWest acted in line with their 
legal and regulatory obligations when it blocked and reviewed Miss Ks account. 
I recognise it caused her significant distress as she couldnt access her money, but I cant 
fairly conclude that NatWest did anything wrong. And therefore, I cant reasonably uphold 
the complaint for this reason.
I can also see NatWest carried out their review and then gave Miss K full access. So I dont 
consider they caused any unnecessary delays either. Im also pleased to see NatWest 
reimbursed Miss K for the costs she lost due to call costs and paid her £75 compensation. I 
appreciate Miss K wants £200 compensation for the distress NatWest caused. But as Ive 
found theyve acted in line with their terms and conditions, Im not going to ask NatWest to 
further compensate Miss K.
In summary, I know my decision will come as a great frustration and disappointment to 
Miss K. But having looked at whats happened here I dont think NatWest acted 
unreasonably or outside the terms and conditions of the accounts. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 September 2022.
