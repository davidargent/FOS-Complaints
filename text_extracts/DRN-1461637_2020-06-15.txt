The complaint
Miss B says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly 
lent to her. Miss B says Sunny should have known the lending was unaffordable for her. She 
had to borrow further to make her loan repayments and as a consequence, got into a spiral 
of debt.        
What happened
This complaint is about 12 short-term loans Sunny provided to Miss B between April 2015 
and November 2016. Miss Bs borrowing history is as follows:

DRN-1461637Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Bs complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been given as the pattern of Miss Bs borrowing suggested she was 
becoming persistently reliant upon this type of lending. 
Sunny disagreed but did make an offer to uphold the complaint from loan nine onwards. We 
put the offer to Miss B, but she didnt want to accept it.
As the complaint remains unresolved, its been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss B could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Miss B didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Miss B had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss B, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Bs case, and like the adjudicator I think that this 
point was reached by loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss B was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss B had taken out six loans within six months. So Sunny ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Miss B was having to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and Miss Bs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
I note Miss B was repaying her loans before the end of the loan term agreed at the 
outset, and sometimes within weeks of taking them out. While I accept that this would 
have saved Miss B interest charges, it can equally be the behaviour of someone 
have to juggle their finances to make ends meet. And I also note that Miss B 
sometimes took out a further loan very shortly after repaying an earlier one  as an 
example loans seven and either were paid off on 29 May 2016 and loan nine was 
taken out three days later on 1 June. Again this was an indication the borrowing was 
unsustainable for her. 
 
Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 12 was 
taken out 19 months after Miss Bs first. And the amounts borrowed werent 
consistently reducing. Miss B had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service 
a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Miss B lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Miss B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Miss Bs ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.So, Im upholding the complaint about six to 12 and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss B paid on loans six to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to 12 should be removed from
Miss Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Bs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 July 2020.
