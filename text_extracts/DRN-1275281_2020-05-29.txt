The complaint
Mr F says MYJAR Limited, (MYJAR), irresponsibly lent to him. He says his circumstances 
at the time of the lending led him into a cycle of debt. 
What happened
This complaint is about seven short-term loans MYJAR provided to Mr F between May 2014 
and June 2018. The borrowing was split into two chains with a break in lending between 
loans one and two. Mr Fs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Repayment
1 30/05/2014 10/02/2015 1    £100.00 £120.00
Break
2 16/07/2017 19/07/2017 3    £300.00 £160.26
3 22/07/2017 17/08/2017 3    £400.00 £211.84
4 19/08/2017 22/08/2017 6 £1,450.00 £465.15
5 23/08/2017 12/04/2018 12 £1,625.00 £252.10
6 14/04/2018 29/06/2018 3    £150.00   £80.14
7 29/06/2018 31/08/2018 3    £175.00   £87.94
 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Fs complaint and thought the loans from loan five 
onwards shouldnt have been given. 
MYJAR disagreed and asked the adjudicator to reconsider the reason for upholding loans 
six and seven as the amounts borrowed by Mr F had reduced.
The adjudicator didnt change his opinion so as the complaint remains unresolved it has 
been passed to me for decision in my role as ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr F 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MYJAR should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr F could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr F didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to four shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr F had with MYJAR. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint. And after doing so, Ive decided to 
uphold the complaint in part. Ill explain why. I note that by loan five Mr Fs borrowing pattern was that he would repay a loan well before 
the term agreed at the outset but then quickly return for further borrowing and for a higher 
amount. While I appreciate that early repayment may have saved Mr F interest charges, 
given the nature of short-term credit I would question why someone would repay one loan 
only to take out further borrowing.
And the amounts Mr F was borrowing was increasing each time (up until loan six when the 
amount reduced again). This is particularly noticeable when Mr F took loan four. It was by far 
the largest amount and to be repaid over six months compared to three months for the 
previous two loans. 
But Mr F repaid that loan three days later and then returned for loan five the next day. Loan 
five was for a higher amount again and the repayment term had doubled in length to twelve 
months. So, taking all of this into account, I think that when loan five was applied for there 
was an established pattern of borrowing which should have been of a concern to MYJAR as 
it suggested that Mr F wasnt managing his money and was struggling financially. It should 
have reconsidered whether it was fair to keep lending to Mr F.
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans five to seven as I dont 
think the lending should have been given, and MYJAR should put things right.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr F paid on loans five to seven;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 
remove any negative information about loans five to seven from Mr Fs credit file;
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Fs complaint. MYJAR Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 June 2020.
