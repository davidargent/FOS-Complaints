K821x#15complaint
Mr D says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about five payday loans QuickQuid provided to Mr D between  September  
2014 and November 2015.  Mr Ds lending history  with QuickQuid is as follows:
Loan  
numberLoan 
startedAmount borrowed Repaid
1 17/09/2014 £150.00 30/09/2014
2 20/11/2014 £100.00 31/12/2014
3 25/01/2015 £100.00 5/05/2015
4 13/05/2015 £400.00 31/07/2015
5 29/11/2015 £150.00
5a 29/12/2015 £200.00 19/01/2018
Our adjudicator upheld  some of Mr Ds complaint and thought the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was passed to 
me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr D 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN12519342There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.
The repayments on Mr Ds first thee loans were relatively modest  compared  to the income  
that he declared to QuickQuid. So, given  Mr Ds repayment amounts, what was apparent 
about his circumstances at the time,  and his history with the lender, I dont  think  it would 
have been proportionate  for QuickQuid to ask him for the amount of information that would 
be needed to show the lending was unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr D provided or the information  QuickQuid 
should have been aware of, which meant it would have  been  proportionate to start verifying 
what he was saying.  So I dont think QuickQuid was wrong to give these three loans to Mr D.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history  with Mr D, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ds case, I think  that this point was reached when 
he asked for loan four. Mr D had taken three loans with only short  gaps between  the end of 
one loan and the beginning of the next. And during the third loan he incurred late fees and 
extra interest charges  twice. Also the fourth loan was for a higher amount. Overall  it should 
have been clear to QuickQuid that Mr D was struggling and shouldnt have been offered that 
fourth loan.  The fifth loan was only four months  after the fourth  loan ended  and it was 
unlikely Mr Ds situation would have improved by then.   
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans four and five, and QuickQuid should put things 
right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans four and five;
Ref: DRN12519343pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from four onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  four and five should be removed from 
Mr Ds credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ds complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should pay Mr D compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 July 2019.
