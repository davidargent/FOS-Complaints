The complaint
Miss B complains about the way NewDay Ltd (NewDay) handled a chargeback request she 
made for an online purchase.   
What happened
In May 2020 Miss B bought a pair of air pods online for £149.99 using her NewDay 
MasterCard credit card. In July 2020 she contacted NewDay to raise a dispute and request a 
refund, as she believed the air pods were counterfeit. NewDay sent Miss B a declaration 
form to complete, sign and return so that it could process the chargeback request, which it 
received back from Miss B in August 2020. It then began to review the request. In the 
meantime, in September 2020, NewDay refunded the full amount for the purchase back into 
Miss Bs account, while its investigations were ongoing.
NewDays review involved contacting the merchant for its response. The merchant 
challenged the dispute and provided evidence to support its position. In light of this 
information from the merchant, NewDay reversed the refund and told Miss B about this on 
8 December 2020. On the same day, the full amount for the air pods was once again debited 
from Miss Bs account. 
Miss B was unhappy about this, as she said the situation had caused her to go over her 
account limit. She was then charged a fee for going over, despite paying in money to bring 
her account back up to within her limit. She complained to NewDay, but it said it had 
administered her account correctly. Miss B remained unhappy with NewDays response, so 
she referred her complaint to this service.
Our investigator considered the issues and thought the complaint should be upheld. She 
said NewDay shouldnt have to refund the over limit fee but that it should compensate 
Miss B for the trouble and upset it caused by not communicating effectively with Miss B at 
key stages during the chargeback process. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
When Miss B first raised the chargeback request, NewDay says she wouldve been played a 
recording which said: the merchant has up to 45 days to challenge your claim against them, 
if this does happen the credit we have added to your account could be reversed. We will of 
course let you know before this happens.
NewDays letter to Miss B dated 2 September 2020 also says However, if the retailer comes 
back to us with more details, we may need to look at things again. This could mean the 
purchase will be debited back on your account. If this happens, we will of course let you 
know.  
I think its reasonable to think from the information provided in the recording and the letter 
that NewDay would give a customer notice of a chargeback reversal, by informing them that 
a merchant had challenged a dispute  and then by letting a customer know in good time 
that the funds would be debited. I cant see that NewDay did this.
Ive also considered whether NewDay has followed its usual process. It says that customers 
can be emailed by the disputes team on the same day as the debit is made to their account 
by the offshore team, if the case is worked the same day by both departments. While I 
accept this may be NewDays standard process, in this case it is clear that only being told 
about the debit on the same day it left her account has caused Miss B some financial 
detriment and some distress.
Had NewDay given Miss B adequate notice of the debit leaving her account, then I consider 
it likely that Miss B wouldve been able to plan ahead for this, by either reducing her 
spending on the account leading up to the chargeback reversal or by paying in more money 
to compensate for the debit.
I say this because, Miss B spent £9.95 on her credit card on 5 December 2020. This took 
her £4.24 over her credit card limit. I accept that it wasnt NewDays fault that Miss B went 
over her limit initially. However, had she been aware on this date that the chargeback was 
due to be reversed and that £149.99 would once again be debited from her account, I 
consider it possible that she would not have made the purchase of £9.95 which took her over 
her credit limit. 
On 19 December 2020, Miss B made a payment of £166.23 towards her account. This was 
significantly higher than the minimum payment required under the account. And I can see 
from her other statements she often made more than the minimum payment required. So I 
think its likely Miss B intended to pay in enough to bring her balance within her credit limit. 
Her account ended up being £12.89 over her limit by the end of the statement period  and 
this is the exact amount of the interest which was applied to her account. I think if NewDay 
had better managed Miss Bs expectations by providing adequate notice of the chargeback 
reversal, Miss B wouldve had more time to manage her finances in such a way as to avoid 
the situation she then found herself in, with her account suspended, and her credit file 
affected.
In the circumstances, I agree with our investigator and I think that although the over limit fee 
and the interest charged on the account were both applied fairly, it wasnt reasonable for 
NewDay to give only same-day notice that the debit would be taken from Miss Bs account. I 
dont consider this to be in line with the recording that was played to Miss B, or in line with 
the correspondence sent to her, both of which suggest that sufficient notice would be given 
in the event that a merchant challenges a dispute. 
Putting things right
To put things right for Miss B, NewDay should pay Miss B £50 in recognition of the trouble 
and upset caused to her by its failure to properly notify her of the chargeback reversal.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I require NewDay Ltd to put things right 
for Miss B as Ive set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept or reject my decision before 25 July 2021.
