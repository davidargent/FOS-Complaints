The complaint
Mrs C complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly blocked her account 
for an entire week without any explanation. To put things right, Mrs C wants NatWest to 
compensate her for the distress caused. 
What happened
Mrs Cs bank account was blocked by NatWest in August 2019. 
Mrs C says she went into a NatWest branch and its staff could not explain why it had 
restricted her account. Mrs C says she had to borrow money from her friends and family as 
she had planned a weekend away. 
NatWest say it lifted the restrictions on the account a week later. Mrs C says she only 
discovered the account had been unblocked when attempting to login online. 
Mrs C complained to NatWest. In its final response NatWest said it had done nothing wrong 
and it wasnt obliged to enter any discussion or give a reason for the actions it took. 
Unhappy with this, Mrs C referred her complaint to this service. 
   
In September 2019, NatWest wrote to Mrs C and explained it was giving her sixty-days 
notice of her account being closed. The account was subsequently closed sixty days later. 
One of our investigators looked into the matter and did not uphold Mrs Cs complaint. In 
summary they said: 
NatWest reviewed Mrs Cs account in line with its legal and regulatory obligations - 
and it isnt obligated to provide an explanation. 
NatWest didnt cause any unnecessary delay during the review
NatWest decision to close Mrs Cs account was in line with the terms and conditions 
of the account 
In response, Mrs C added the account restriction lasted much longer than a week. She also 
gave more details about how the matter caused her trouble and upset. 
Our investigator explained that based on what Mrs C had originally said, and the information 
hed seen from NatWest, he was satisfied the account restriction only lasted a week. 
As Mrs C remains unhappy this matter has now been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Ive decided to not uphold Mrs C complaint. I know this will disappoint her 
- Ill explain why. 
I appreciate the stress and worry NatWests review has caused Mrs C, and I think this is 
understandable. But Banks have very important legal and regulatory obligations. And 
sometimes they might need to take an action on an account to ensure they are complying 
with their responsibilities. They are also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of an 
existing business relationship. 
That sometimes means banks and building societies need to restrict customers accounts. 
In the individual circumstances of this complaint, Im satisfied based on all the information I 
have seen, and the basis for NatWests review and subsequent decision, that its actions 
were reasonable. 
Ive next considered if NatWest caused Mrs C any unfair delay whilst it carried out its review 
and the account remained blocked.
In her initial submissions to this service Mrs C said her account was blocked for a week. 
NatWest has also explained the block was placed on the account for seven days. I note 
Mrs C later said  in response to our investigators view - the block lasted for longer than a 
week.
But based on what Mrs C initially told us, and what NatWest says its records show, I think its 
more likely the account was restricted for a week. Mrs C brought her complaint to this 
service a couple of weeks after the account was blocked, so Im putting more weight on what 
she said and remembered at that time as opposed to what she recollects several months 
later.
It follows, Im not persuaded NatWest caused any unfair delay in carrying out its review of 
Mrs Cs account. 
Its unfortunate Mrs C was travelling over the period her account was restricted, and that she 
had to borrow money from her friends and family likely causing her some embarrassment. 
But NatWests actions have been in line with what its obligated to do. 
Finally, a bank is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with 
it. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the 
terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account, which NatWest and Mrs C had to comply with, say 
that it could close the account. The terms go onto explain what those circumstances are and 
in some circumstances what the notice period to do so are. 
Having looked at the information given to me by NatWest, Im satisfied it was entitled to 
close the account in the way that it has done. 
So, in summary, I wont be upholding Mrs Cs complaint. So Im not going to ask NatWest to 
compensate her for any trouble and upset this matter, in its entirety, may have caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Cs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or reject my decision before 1 June 2021.
