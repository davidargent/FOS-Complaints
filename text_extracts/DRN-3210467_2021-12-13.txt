The complaint
Mr B complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua, irresponsibly increased his credit limit.
  
What happened
I issued my provisional decision on this case on 25 November 2021. I wanted to give both 
parties the chance to respond before I came to my final decision.
I have copied my provisional decision below, which also forms part of this final decision.
Mr B initially applied for a credit card account with NewDay in 2014  at the time he was
accepted for the account, Mr B was given a £450 credit limit. NewDay then increased Mr Bs
credit limit on the following occasions:
April 2015  from £450 to £550
July 2018  from £550 to £1250
December 2018 - from £1250 to £2150
September 2019  from £2150 to £3150
February 2020  from £3150 to £4900
Mr B complains about the credit limit increases NewDay applied to his account from 2018
onwards. He says that he entered into a repayment plan with NewDay in 2016, and this is
when he also started gambling. Mr B says that his gambling addiction continued to a point
where he was solely using the card for gambling and cash transactions. Mr B says that
NewDay ought to have been aware of what he was using the card for  and it shouldnt have
increased his credit limit the numerous times it did, as this only made his gambling addiction
worse and got him into more debt. On top of this, Mr B says that he had also defaulted on a
number of different accounts during the time he had this card, and so NewDay ought to have
known this and not increased his limit.
NewDay responded to Mr Bs complaint and upheld it. It agreed that it shouldnt have
increased Mr Bs credit limit when it did in 2018 and onwards. To put things right for Mr B,
NewDay agreed to refund the following:
Interest charges - £347.92
Over limit fees - £24
Cash Advance fees  £237.90
Mr B brought his complaint to our service as he didnt feel that NewDay had done enough to
put things right for him. Mr B says that hed like NewDay to write off the balance of the
account, freeze any further interest charges, and compensate him for the mental distress
that this situation has caused him.
Our investigator looked into things for Mr B. He felt that the refund calculations NewDay had
provided him with so far looked correct. But he also said that NewDay should freeze any
further interest on the account, not send the account to a debt collector, pay Mr B £250 for
the distress caused and remove any late payment markers from Mr Bs credit file from July
2018 onwards.
NewDay didnt agree with our investigator. It said that by it removing proportionate interest
and charges, it feels that it has put Mr B back in the position he would have been had it not
increased his limit. NewDay said that it didnt feel that Mr B had been held accountable in
anyway and so it isnt fair to also ask it to remove adverse information from his credit file and
pay him £250 in addition to the refund it had already offered.
Because NewDay didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me to make a decision on
the matter.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr B has told this service that he is only complaining about the increases that happened on
his account from 2018 onwards. And NewDay has agreed that it shouldnt have increased
his limit from 2018. So there doesnt appear to be a dispute on this particular point anymore.
So, its now left for me to decide if NewDay has done enough to put things right for Mr B and
I dont think it has.
Where credit has been provided when it shouldnt have been, it would be fair and reasonable
for the lender to refund any interest and charges paid by the borrower (if there were any).
And in a lot of cases, the borrower would be expected to repay any remaining amount of the
funds they were given. So, in this case, Id expect Mr B to pay back the funds he was lent 
when he used his card  but not the interest.
I appreciate that NewDay has already refunded some interest and charges to Mr B, but
these are now outdated, and they dont include any refund of interest for anything that has
happened since the final response letter. In any event, while NewDay has provided this
service with information about how it calculated the refund, the information it has sent isnt
clear, so I cant be certain it has done this correctly. So for clarity and completeness, below
Im telling NewDay how it needs to calculate the total redress I currently think is due to Mr B.
NewDay should rework Mr Bs account to remove the effect of any interest and charges
accrued on the account as a result of the unfair credit limit increases which took place from
July 2018 onwards. NewDay can only add any interest due on the first £550 of the balance 
any late payment and over limit fees after July 2018 also need to be refunded irrespective of
what any reconstructed final balance may show.
The payments Mr B made from July 2018 onwards - should then be applied to the reworked
balance. I dont think in this case it is likely that Mr B would have repaid more than the
reconstructed balance, but if he has, then any extra that was paid should be treated as
overpayments and returned to Mr B. NewDay should also add interest, at 8% simple per
year, from the date any overpayment was made to the date of settlement.
NewDay should also remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Bs credit file as a
result of this account from July 2018. And I currently think NewDay should pay Mr B £400 for
the distress and inconvenience it caused Mr B, for reasons I will go on to explain below.
NewDay feels that by doing these things leaves Mr B with little accountability, but I dont
currently agree. NewDay had a duty to lend to Mr B responsibly and so it is NewDay who
ought to be accountable for the impact caused to Mr B when it didnt do this. Had NewDay
lent responsibly to Mr B, then its likely that Mr B wouldnt have found himself in the situation
he is now. I think the impact of NewDays actions resulted in increased harm to Mr B; givingsomeone who was experiencing compulsive uncontrolled spending access to credit. And I
think this was foreseeable  had New Day done the correct checks at the time it wouldve
seen how Mr B was using his card and realised that providing him access to additional credit
was likely to cause him harm. As a result of NewDay increasing Mr Bs credit limit when it
shouldnt have, and in turn increasing the amount of debt he has, has understandably led to
very difficult times for Mr B  both financially and mentally.
The investigator recommended that NewDay shouldnt send Mr Bs account to a debt
collection agency. But I dont currently agree with this point. NewDay can send Mr Bs
account to a debt collection agency if thats what it decides to do, however it needs to ensure
that this doesnt negatively impact Mr B, or the repayment terms that are agreed.
Mr B responded to my provisional decision to say he had nothing further to add, and that he 
agreed with the recommendations. 
NewDay didnt respond, and so Ive assumed it has nothing further for me to consider.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered everything again, it is still my decision to uphold this complaint.
Neither party has given me any additional information for me to consider, and so I see no 
reason to depart from the findings in my provisional decision.   
Putting things right
NewDay has already refunded some of the interest and charges to Mr Bs account. NewDay
needs to ensure that it has calculated the total refund as per my direction below, and it can
deduct any amount it has already refunded from the reconstructed balance. To put things
right for Mr B, I order NewDay to:
rework the account to ensure that from July 2018 interest is only charged on the first 
£550 outstanding to reflect the fact that no further credit limit increases should have 
been provided. All late payment and over limit fees (that were applied after July 
2018) should also be removed; and
if an outstanding balance remains on Mr Bs account once all adjustments have been 
made NewDay should contact Mr B to arrange a suitable repayment plan for this.
No interest should be charged on any outstanding balance over £550, until it is 
repaid.
if the effect of all adjustments results in there no longer being an outstanding 
balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments and returned to Mr B 
along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from the date they were made 
until the date of settlement.
Pay Mr B £400 in compensation to reflect the impact this situation has had on him.
Remove any adverse information from Mr Bs credit file that happened after July 
2018.
HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest. NewDay must give Mr B a certificate
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
  
My final decisionFor the reasons set out above, I uphold Mr Bs complaint. NewDay Ltd  trading as Aqua 
should put things right for Mr B by doing what Ive said above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 January 2022.
