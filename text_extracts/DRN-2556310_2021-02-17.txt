The complaint
Mrs R is unhappy MoneyGram International Limited (MoneyGram) wont reimburse her for 
money shes said was taken fraudulently by a third party.
What happened
The details of the complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont go into too much detail 
here. A scammer led Mrs R to believe she would be renting a property from them. In order to 
prove she had the required deposit available they convinced her to arrange for £700 to be 
sent to her via MoneyGram and send them the receipt which contained details of the 
transaction proving this had been done.
The scammer told Mrs R they would collect the money from MoneyGram together after shed 
viewed the property and signed the tenancy agreement. On the day theyd agreed to view 
the property the scammer stopped communicating with Mrs R and she discovered the £700 
had been collected from a MoneyGram agent without her knowledge.
Mrs R made a complaint to MoneyGram, but it said the correct details and documentation 
had been presented when the money was collected. Because the correct procedure had 
been followed it wasnt liable for the loss and there was nothing it could do. 
Mrs R brought the complaint to our service to consider, but our investigator didnt uphold it. 
They felt MoneyGram had followed its procedures and obtained the correct information 
before releasing the funds. 
Mrs R didnt accept this. MoneyGramn had said it had seen photo ID from her but the only 
photo ID she had was her passport and this was with her at all times so she didnt see how 
this couldve been provided. She also said she didnt disclose the eight-digit reference to the 
scammer so didnt think MoneyGram couldve had this information either. As she didnt 
accept the investigators findings the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs R has said she didnt collect the money from MoneyGram. And having reviewed the 
evidence available, including the correspondence between her and the suspected scammer, 
Im satisfied its more likely than not that Mrs R didnt collect the money herself and shes 
been the victim of a scam. But, it doesnt follow MoneyGram becomes liable for her loss if I 
think it had all the information required to release the money. And, in this particular case, I 
dont think it reasonably ought to have known the person who made the collection was acting 
fraudulently.
Did MoneyGram have all the information required?
MoneyGrams website sets out that in order to collect funds you will need the eight-digit 
payment reference number, photo ID and may be asked to complete a Receive form. 
MoneyGrams terms and conditions state it may ask for more information in addition to this 
including the payees name, address, phone number, date of birth and the full name of the 
payer. In this case, the person collecting the money completed the receive form mentioned 
on the website where they provided all of this information.
Mrs R said she didnt provide the eight-digit reference to the scammers, so she doesnt feel 
MoneyGram did have all the information it needed. Shes said she has experience in using 
payment services like this one and knows never to share this kind of information. But the 
reference number was included on the form the scammer filled in when collecting the 
money. MoneyGram has also shown me its system records which show the reference was 
used to search for the transaction when it was collected and has said this is the only way to 
search for transactions. So overall I think its likely the scammer did have the reference 
number.
Mrs R provided the scammer with her address, date of birth, phone number and the name of 
the person sending the money. So Im satisfied she did trust the scammer with information 
its likely she doesnt usually share without caution. Overall, as Im satisfied the scammer did 
have the reference number, and as I havent been given any other plausible explanation as 
to how they got it, I think its likely Mrs R gave it to them. 
Mrs R has also questioned the photo ID MoneyGram was given. MoneyGrams records 
show a passport in Mrs Rs name was used as photo ID when the funds were collected. 
Mrs R has said this isnt possible as she hadnt provided the scammer with photo ID, and the 
only photo ID she had available at the time was with her. I havent seen anything in the 
correspondence between Mrs R and the scammer to suggest she had given them her ID. 
And the passport MoneyGram was given was a different nationality to Mrs Rs. So Im 
satisfied the scammer didnt likely use Mrs Rs genuine passport to collect funds.
But, I can see a passport was recorded as having been presented at the point of collection 
on MoneyGrams system and a nationality has been recorded. And given that photo ID is 
generally something thats required when collecting deposits, on balance, I think its likely the 
MoneyGram agent was given a passport in Mrs Rs name. And, as I dont think the passport 
provided was Mrs Rs, I think its likely the passport used was a forgery.
Should MoneyGram have recognised the collection was the result of a scam?
Whilst I think MoneyGram likely was provided with all the information it required in order to 
release the funds in question, I think some of the information was likely fraudulent. So Ive 
thought carefully about whether I think MoneyGram ought reasonably to have recognised 
this and refused the collection.
I think its reasonable for MoneyGram to expect the recipients personal details, along with 
the eight-digit reference number will only generally be known to the intended recipient of a 
transfer. And I dont think theres anything in this case that indicates MoneyGram couldve 
known this information had been obtained fraudulently. So the only thing that mightve 
alerted MoneyGram to a problem is the forged passport the scammer likely used.
MoneyGram wasnt required to take a copy of the passport it was given, so I havent seen 
what was used to collect Mrs Rs deposit and need to make a decision on what I think is 
more likely based on the evidence Ive seen.I would expect MoneyGram to take reasonable care in checking the ID presented to it. But I 
wouldnt expect it to be an expert in identifying forgeries. After all, photo ID isnt the only 
thing its relying on. 
I think its reasonable to expect the MoneyGram agent generally knows what a passport 
looks like, especially if theyve carried out this kind of transaction before. And in this case the 
agent didnt raise any concerns about the passport they were given. So overall, I think its 
more likely than not the passport appeared genuine and wasnt so obviously a forgery the 
agent shouldve refused the collection.
Overall Im satisfied MoneyGram did follow its procedures when handing over the money as 
I think the scammer was able to provide the information they needed in order to get access 
to it. And I havent seen sufficient evidence to persuade me it ought to have known the 
person collecting the funds was doing so fraudulently. 
Im very sorry for what Mrs R has been through. I can see the circumstances of the 
complaint have been difficult for her. But I dont think MoneyGram has acted unfairly in this 
case.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 March 2021.
