Miss G says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss G had five loans with QuickQuid.  The loans  were all payday loans repayable in two 
monthly payments.  Ive set out some of the information QuickQuid provided about the loans 
in the table below.
Loan  no. Amount Start date End date Largest repayment
1 £200 02/06/2010 30/07/2010 £259
2 £400 04/08/2010 31/08/2010 £500
3 £900 31/08/2010 02/12/2010 £1,103
4 £900 06/12/2010 01/06/2011 £1,080
5 £450 06/06/2011 11/07/2012 £563
Our adjudicator thought loans 3 and 4 should be upheld as the repayments  were  so 
substantial  more  than 80% of Miss Gs net monthly income  that there was a significant 
risk Miss G wouldnt  be able to meet them while also meeting her existing commitments and 
without having  to borrow again.  Our adjudicator also thought  that by loan 5, QuickQuid  
shouldve realised Miss G had become dependent on the loans, so it wasnt  responsible  to 
lend for that reason too.
In response, QuickQuid  noted the loans were repayable across two pay periods  so Miss G 
would have income of £2,600 during that time. It also didnt think it was fair that the 
adjudicator hadnt provided a breakdown of Miss Gs income and expenditure. So it didnt 
agree to uphold  the complaint about loans 3 to 5. The complaint  was therefore passed to me 
to decide.
Since the adjudication theres been  no ongoing  dispute about loan 1 or 2, so Ive not 
considered those loans in this decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Ive decided to uphold the complaint, for broadly the same reasons as the adjudicator.
Ref: DRN52389242I consider that the largest repayments for loans 3 and 4 were  very high when compared to 
Miss Gs income  85% and 83% respectively.  Ive taken  into account that the loans were 
repayable across two months, but I dont think this means the repayments were  not 
substantial and wouldnt be likely to cause Miss G to have to borrow again.
The loans were  structured  so that the first payment was interest  only,  so was a much smaller  
payment. The first payment was £203 for loan 3 and it was £180 for loan 4. The second 
payment was interest and principal (the figures are in the table  above).  So its likely 
QuickQuid expected Miss G to save money from the first month to make  the larger  payment 
in the second month.
I dont think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid to think Miss G was likely to be in a position to 
do this. Loan 3 commenced on the same day loan 2 was repaid and there was a gap of just 
four days  between loans 3 and 4. So Miss G was taking  out expensive  payday loans in rapid 
succession, suggesting repaying  them was leaving  a hole in her finances. So its not likely 
she was in a position to save. And its therefore not reasonable,  as QuickQuid has 
suggested, to take into account  two whole months  income when looking at the sustainability  
of the repayments.  Im therefore upholding her complaint about loans 3 and 4 because the 
repayments were so large that there was a significant risk Miss G wouldnt be able to meet  
them sustainably.
Loan 5 was a smaller loan, although the largest  repayment was still in excess of 40% of 
Miss Gs monthly income and thats still a substantial  amount. There  was again only a very 
short five day gap between loan 4 and 5, continuing to suggest  Miss G was unlikely to be 
settling her loans without needing to borrow again. Miss G had been borrowing for more  than 
a year at this point  and had demonstrated repayment problems with both loans 3 and 4. 
Loan 3 was due to end on 29 October 2010 but was repaid about  a month late. And loan 4 
was due to end on 31 January 2011 but was repaid about four months late. It seems, from 
the repayments she made, Miss G must have entered  into a repayment  plan for loan 4.
Looking back at the pattern of lending up to the point of loan 5, I think  QuickQuid shouldve  
realised loan 5 was unlikely to be sustainable for Miss G. QuickQuid ought to have  realised it 
was more likely than not Miss G was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her 
previous loan(s) was leaving in her finances and that her indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. That the pattern of lending indicated  loan 5 wasnt sustainably  affordable is 
borne out by what happened. Loan  5 was scheduled to end on 29 July 2011  but wasnt 
repaid until almost a year after that date, following another repayment  plan.
By continuing to provide loans after loan 4, QuickQuid unfairly prolonged Miss Gs 
indebtedness by allowing  her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an 
extended period  of time. So Im upholding  the complaint about loan 5 too.
putting things right
QuickQuid should:
refund  all interest and charges Miss G paid on loans 3-5;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 and 4 from Miss Gs credit  file;
remove all entries about  loan 5 from Miss Gs credit file.
Ref: DRN52389243 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Miss G a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Miss Gs complaint about loans 3 to 5. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC must  put things right by taking  the steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 July 2019.
