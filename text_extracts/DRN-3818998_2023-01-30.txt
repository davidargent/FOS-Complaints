The complaint
Ms S complains about PayrNet Limiteds actions when reviewing and subsequently closing 
her account. Ms S is particularly unhappy with how long it took to receive her funds back. 
She would like compensation.
Ms S held a Pockit branded account  who provided services on behalf of PayrNet  but I 
will refer to Pockit as PayrNet in this decision.
What happened
In January 2021, PayrNet blocked Ms Ss account following a transfer she made from her 
own external bank account. Ms S couldnt access the money in the account, and she said 
this caused her a lot of financial distress as she was unable to pay bills which resulted in 
bailiff visits and unnecessary use of her overdraft. Ms S was also going through a custody 
battle at the time and said this overall situation had a big impact on her.
Ms S proactively tried to contact Payrnet to find out what was happening  but they didnt 
keep her updated or tell her a timeframe on when she could expect her money back. Ms S 
brought the complaint to our service.
Our investigator looked into things. He asked PayrNet for information and evidence relating 
to their actions, but it wasnt forthcoming. So, while our investigator thought PayrNet were 
likely entitled to review the account, he hadnt seen enough to confirm Ms S was treated 
fairly. PayrNet also said the money had been returned to source (which would have been 
Ms Ss account) in December 2021, but our investigator also hadnt seen any evidence that 
was the case. So, he asked PayrNet to:
Return £255.63 (plus 8% statutory interest) to Ms S;
Pay Ms S £300 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
PayrNet responded with a counteroffer. They confirmed they had already returned the 
money to Ms S in January 2022 but agreed to pay 8% simple interest on the time it was 
blocked, plus £100 compensation.
Ms S didnt agree. She said PayrNet shouldnt have held on to her funds for over 12 months 
and feels they added to the confusion by initially telling our service the funds were returned 
in December 2021.
As an agreement couldnt be reached  the complaint was passed to me to decide.
I reached out to both Ms S and PayrNet to attempt to resolve things informally. Firstly, Ms S 
was able to confirm that she received the funds back from PayrNet on 25 January 2022. 
After considering the evidence and arguments, I felt the appropriate settlement would be for 
PayrNet to pay 8% on the funds held and pay Ms S £200 compensation so proposed the 
settlement to both parties.
PayrNet didnt respond. Ms S did. In summary, she said the compensation should amount to 
at least the amount which was being held. She said bailiffs alone cost in the region of £225, 
and she didnt have an alternative account to be able to comply with payment plans. Ms S 
said she is now spending time dealing with linked issues due to PayrNet holding her money 
for a long period of time. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint. And Ill explain why.
Firstly, Ive noted that Ms S has made a number of quite detailed submissions. I dont 
believe its necessary to address each and every point that Ms S has made in order to meet 
my statutory duty to determine her complaint. Im required to do that with minimum formality, 
and so Ill address the issues that I consider to be the most important. I do stress however 
that Ive considered everything that Ms S and PayrNet have said before reaching my 
decision.
The main issue to address is that PayrNet has provided us with very little evidence. We dont 
have evidence of:
What factors Payrnet considered when they reviewed Ms Ss account and the 
specific reasons on why they took the decision to close it.
Evidence to show what actions they took during their review and why they held 
Ms Ss money for around 12 months before returning it.
I respect that PayrNet has internal policies and processes to follow along with legal and 
regulatory obligations. But they are also aware of our rules. 
DISP 3.5.2 states, amongst other things, that an Ombudsman can reach a decision on the 
basis of what has been supplied and take account of the failure by a complainant or a firm to 
provide information that an Ombudsman has requested; and.
Therefore, my decision is based on the evidence and information I have received.
The review and closure
Ive considered the fact that PayrNet are strictly regulated and must take certain actions to 
meet its legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of new and existing relationships. That sometimes means they need to restrict 
customers accounts  either in full or partially while they carry out the review. I havent seen 
enough evidence to satisfy me that PayrNet was complying with their legal and regulatory 
obligations when they reviewed Ms Ss account and held her money from January 2021  
January 2022. So, I cant fairly say theyve acted appropriately. 
Withholding the money in the account
While PayrNet are usually entitled to carry out a review, wed expect them to do so in a 
timely manner and without undue delays. PayrNet have shared limited information with our 
service regarding the actions they took during the review. 
It would have been helpful if PayrNet communicated with Ms S more regularly and asked 
appropriate questions. When financial institutions carry out reviews, its common practice 
across the banking industry that the review will require additional information from the 
account holder. Ms S has confirmed PayrNet asked for some information, but I havent seen 
enough to show me that holding the money for around 12 months was reasonable.PayrNet made the decision to return the payment back to the original source. However, the 
original source was Ms Ss account  so I find PayrNets decision to withhold the money for 
this length of time surprising. And I consider it would have been useful if they notified Ms S 
on the day they returned the money. 
It therefore follows that I think PayrNet should have refunded Ms S the balance of the 
account sooner than they did, so I dont think its reasonable that Ms S was without her 
money for a long period of time. Therefore, like our investigator, I think 8% simple interest 
should be paid on this amount. We use 8% simple because this recognises the loss of use of 
the funds and it is the current statutory interest rate on judgment debts and therefore, I 
consider it to be the fairest in the circumstances.
The impact on Ms S
I dont doubt this overall situation had a big impact on Ms S. She was clearly going through a 
lot of things personally and has explained the financial difficulties she was in at the time and 
feels PayrNet withholding this money added to those troubles. Ms S has shared details 
around bailiff visits and the cost of those, alongside information about using her overdraft. 
While Ive carefully considered all of this and dont doubt Ms S had a really troublesome 
time, I havent seen enough to satisfy me that PayrNet holding around £255 of Ms Ss 
money solely resulted in these actions from external parties.  
Having said that, I think PayrNet could have handled things better. I consider they could 
have kept Ms S updated better at times, and likely returned the money to her sooner than 
they did. Therefore, I consider compensation of around £200 will fairly recognise the distress 
caused to Ms S by spending time chasing for updates and trying to locate the whereabouts 
of her money, as well as the impact this had on her finances overall. 
I appreciate Ms S wants more compensation  however, based on everything, I havent seen 
enough to say PayrNets actions alone caused all of Ms Ss financial worries  but I do 
consider their actions contributed to them in some part.
Putting things right
Overall, based on the evidence received, I dont think PayrNet were proactive when 
reviewing Ms Ss account and returning her money. I also consider they caused undue 
delays and didnt keep Ms S as updated as they could have done. I think adding interest to 
the amount they refunded Ms S fairly compensates her for the loss of use of her money for a 
significant period of time. 
I also consider £200 compensation to be appropriate in the circumstances to recognise the 
distress this situation caused Ms S overall. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Ss complaint. PayrNet Limited should do the following: 
Calculate interest at 8% simple per year on the amount they withheld from Ms S - 
£255.63. PayrNet should calculate this from the date they blocked the account up to 
the date they refunded Ms S. 
HM Revenue & Customs requires PayrNet Limited to withhold income tax from the 
above-mentioned interest. PayrNet should give Ms S a certificate showing how much 
is taken off if Ms S asks for one. 
Pay Ms S £200 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.Mr M needs to provide an up to date statement (dated in the last three months) to allow 
PayrNet to make the settlement. PayrNet must pay the compensation within 28 days of the 
date Ms S provides the up to date statement. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 February 2023.
