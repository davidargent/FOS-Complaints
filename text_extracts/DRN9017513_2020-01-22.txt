K820x#14complaint 
Mr H says Evergreen Finance London Limited, trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk (MoneyBoat),  
lent to him irresponsibly.  
background
Mr H had five loans  with MoneyBoat which are set out below. 
An adjudicator considered  the complaint and didnt think it should be upheld. Mr H didnt 
agree with the adjudicator   he thought  MoneyBoat shouldve carried  out further  checks  on 
him as he was borrowing from other pay day lenders. He also says the lending  was funding  
his gambling habit.  
MoneyBoat made an offer in its final response  letter to Mr H which he decided  to accept 
whilst his complaint was awaiting a final decision by an ombudsman. However, MoneyBoat 
informed this service that the offer was no longer available to Mr H. 
As there was no agreement between MoneyBoat and Mr H, the complaint  was passed to me 
to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also considered  the law, any relevant 
regulatory rules and good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
Having carefully thought  about all of this, I dont  think MoneyBoat  has treated Mr H unfairly  
or that it should  pay him compensation. I know this will come as a disappointment to Mr H 
and Id like to explain why I think this is the case.
Mr H was provided with high-interest loans, intended  for short-term use. So MoneyBoat  
needed to make sure that it didnt provide them irresponsibly. In practice, what  this means is 
that MoneyBoat  needed  to carry out proportionate  checks to be able to understand whether 
any lending  was sustainable for Mr H before providing it.Loan Date  Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Highest

Ref: DRN90175132Our website  sets out what we typically think about  when deciding  whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what  it does to verify that 
information  in the early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low, or the 
amount lent was high.  And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater  the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So, wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt  continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
In his complaint  Mr H says that MoneyBoat didnt lend to him responsibly because he was 
using funds from other pay day lenders to clear his balance. He also says that the lending 
funded his gambling addiction. This all resulted in his debt spiralling. On the other  hand  
MoneyBoat says that it carried  out adequate checks  by gathering details of Mr Hs 
disposable income and information  from credit reference agencies.  And based  on this 
MoneyBoat says it didnt see anything to alert it to any sustainability  or affordability issues  for 
the loans it gave Mr H. 
Its important to note that when Mr H took out his first loan with MoneyBoat it doesnt seem  
that he had an existing relationship with them. The first loan was repaid over 3 instalments  
and it seems Mr H repaid this loan without any issues. Loan 2 was taken out over a year and 
a half after the initial loan. So this would be considered a break in the lending chain which 
means Mr Hs circumstances could have changed. When  Mr H applied for loan 2 MoneyBoat  
carried out similar checks as it did for Loan 1. And I cant see anything to suggest that 
MoneyBoat had reason to question the information  it had about  Mr H. Loans 2, 3, 4 and 5 
were due to be repaid  over 6 instalments. As Mr H was required to make payments over a 
longer period, this helped manage the monthly  cost of the loans. Looking at the dates it also 
appears Mr H had repaid  a loan and had a gap of usually a month  before  another  loan was 
given. And the amounts borrowed were consistently at a similar level.  Mr H also repaid most 
of the loans early  and only defaulted  on the 5th and final loan. 
Looking at the monthly repayments in light of Mr Hs disposable income its difficult for me to 
say that the scheduled  payments were demonstrably  unsustainable  and that they then 
forced Mr H into taking  further loans. Of course, a borrower taking out instalment loans, and 
then repaying them  in this way can sometimes be an indication of an underlying problem. 
But I dont think there were adequate warning signs here for MoneyBoat and Ive not seen 
enough evidence  to persuade me that the lender acted irresponsibly. 
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above, I do not uphold this complaint against Evergreen Finance  
London Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 February  2020.
