The complaint
Mr G complains National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly cancelled a bounce back loan he 
had taken out for his business, withdrew loan funds from his business account, closed that 
account, and reneged on an agreement to repay the loan funds he had spent. He also says 
he was sent an unlawful default letter.
What happened
The facts of this complaint are well known to both parties and were set out by the 
investigator in their view. In summary:
Mr G took out a bounce back loan with NatWest. The funds credited his business 
account. NatWest paid Mr G compensation for taking too long to process the loan.
NatWest reviewed its decision to grant the loan and decided to terminate the loan 
agreement. It transferred the loan funds out of Mr Gs business account.
Mr G had already spent some of the loan when NatWest made its decision. NatWest 
sent him a letter saying he would need to repay what he had spent under the terms 
and conditions of the loan.
NatWest later reviewed its position regarding Mr Gs loan repayments. It issued a 
letter saying an event of default had occurred and under the terms of the loan it 
demanded he repay what he owed immediately.
Mr G complained to NatWest, who rejected his complaint. As a result, he brought his 
complaint to our service.
An investigator at our service considered his complaint and decided not to uphold it: They 
found:
NatWest could review its decision to grant the loan. Looking at the circumstances of 
Mr Gs complaint, NatWest acted in line with the loans terms and conditions, and it 
was able to recall the remaining loan funds and ask Mr G to repay what he spent.
NatWest didnt need to keep to what was said in in its first letter after a subsequent 
review. It hadnt acted unfairly by asking Mr G to contact its recoveries department to 
agree a suitable way forward to repay what it owed. And it hadnt recorded a default 
on his credit file.
NatWest was entitled to undertake a credit check, but this was not related to its 
decision to withdraw the loan. It didnt need to give its reason(s) for closing the 
account.
NatWest closed the account in line with its terms and conditions.
Mr G is unhappy with the outcome the investigator reached. He thinks the letter he received 
which mentioned the term default was unlawful. And he thinks it was unfair for NatWest to 
change how he needed to repay the loan. He has asked for a final decision from an 
ombudsman, so his complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have decided not to uphold Mr Gs complaint. Ill explain why:
It is not uncommon for banks to review lending decisions. So, I dont find NatWest 
were under an obligation to continue the loan simply because of its original lending 
decision. This doesnt, however, mean NatWest can terminate a loan agreement 
arbitrarily and without reason.
NatWest didnt tell Mr G why it terminated the loan. And while I understand Mr G 
would want to know its reason(s), I am not going to reveal them by virtue of him 
making this complaint. I have, however, considered NatWests basis for terminating 
the loan, and I find it was reasonable and complied with the terms Mr G agreed when 
he took the loan out. I dont find the credit search NatWest performed accounts for its 
decision to cancel the loan. And I find it was reasonable for NatWest to perform the 
search as part of its original decision to lend.
NatWest sent a letter which said an event of default occurred. I understand Mr G 
took this to mean NatWest were going to record or had recorded a default against 
him, but this is not what the term means. Instead, the term is defined in the terms and 
conditions of the loan agreement. It relates to specific circumstances which meant 
NatWest could terminate the loan. And in the event of a default, NatWest were 
entitled to recall the loan money from Mr Gs business account.
Mr G may believe no circumstances apply which qualify as an event of default. But 
having considered the circumstances of this complaint and the evidence NatWest 
relied on, Im satisfied NatWest were reasonable to conclude an event of default 
applied. 
NatWest initially agreed to allow Mr G to repay the money he owed under the terms 
of the loan agreement. So, I understand his disappointment when NatWest later 
changed its position. But ultimately, I dont find NatWest were bound to maintain 
those terms in the long term. And in view of the circumstances of this complaint, I 
understand why its position changed. So, I am not going to direct NatWest to revert 
to its previous position.
I am sorry to hear about the stress and upset Mr G went through as a result of 
NatWest withdrawing the loan. I am also sorry he may now need to return a vehicle 
he took out on finance with another provider. But as I dont find NatWest acted 
unfairly, I am not going to award compensation for those losses.
I find NatWest reasonably applied the correct terms to close Mr Gs business 
account.
My final decisionI have decided not to uphold Mr Gs complaint for the reasons I have given above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 November 2021.
