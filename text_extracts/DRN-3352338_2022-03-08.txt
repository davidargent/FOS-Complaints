The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA unfairly blocked and closed his 
accounts. He wants PayPal to provide an explanation for its actions. 
What happened
In March 2020, PayPal reviewed Mr Bs account. Following its review PayPal told Mr B that a 
permanent limitation had been applied to his account and any further account he tried to 
open due to a violation of its acceptable use policy.
 
Mr B complained to PayPal and said he needed an account to run his business. So, he 
opened another PayPal account using a different contact email address. But PayPal placed 
a permanent limitation on this account too. 
Mr B complained to our service. He said he needed his PayPal account for his online 
business and as a result of not being able to access his account he struggled to pay his rent, 
had to move home, and lend money from relatives. 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Bs complaint. She explained why she didnt think 
PayPal had done anything wrong. Mr B disagreed. He says he hasnt done anything wrong 
and he wants PayPal to explain why it wont allow him to have an account. 
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The user agreement which Mr B would have agreed to when he opened his account with 
PayPal sets out the terms under which PayPal operates the account. And these allow 
PayPal to limit or close an account if it wishes to do so.
PayPal reviewed the use of Mr Bs account and identified an issue with the use of it. And it 
decided to permanently limit the use of the account  including any other account that Mr B 
subsequently tried to open. 
I know Mr B is frustrated that he hasnt been given a detailed reason as to why PayPal has 
done this. But its not obliged to do so. So, I cant say it has done anything wrong in not 
giving him this information as much as hed like to know. Having said that I can see that 
when PayPal wrote to Mr B to let him know it had limited his accounts, it did provide Mr B 
with an explanation for its actions and referred him to its terms and conditions. So, I think its 
likely Mr B had some understanding of the reason behind PayPals decision.  
Mr B says not having a functioning PayPal account has caused him a good deal of trouble 
and upset.  And made running his business difficult. Ive no doubt that having his PayPal 
accounts limited was inconvenient but based on the information Ive seen I cant say PayPal 
has acted unreasonably and treated Mr B unfairly. And Im satisfied that PayPal has followed 
its processes and the terms of its user agreement. So, I dont think its done anything wrong 
by permanently limiting Mr Bs account. And I wont be asking PayPal to reactivate Mr Bs 
accounts.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 April 2022.
