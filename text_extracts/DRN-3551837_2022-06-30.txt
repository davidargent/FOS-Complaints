The complaint
Mr M complains that Hamsard 3225 Limited trading as CLC Finance, lent to him 
irresponsibly. He has said that the interest rates were high and he had to take out other 
loans to pay off these loans. He wants a refund of all interest and charges.  
Mr M appears to have changed his name at some point, but for the purposes of this 
complaint I will use Mr M. The agreements are in that name and his complaint form bears 
the name Mr M too.

One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that from loan 8 CLC Finance 
should put things right. 
CLC Finance disagreed and so the unresolved complaint was passed to me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term, high cost and home 
credit lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our 
website.
CLC Finance had to assess the lending to check if Mr M could afford to pay back the 
amounts hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. CLC Finances checks could have considered a number
of different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and Mr Ms 
income and expenditure.
I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been 
proportionate. But certain factors might suggest CLC Finance should have done more to 
establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr M. These factors include:
Mr M having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mr M having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr M coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr M. Our adjudicator considered this 
to be the case for Mr M.
CLC Finance was required to establish whether Mr M could sustainably repay the loans  
not just whether he technically had enough money to make his repayments. Having enough 
money to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mr M was able to repay 
his loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without 
having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, 
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it 
follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Ms complaint.
Mr M has sent to us some bank statements, most of which bear his new name. And they 
relate to the years after the January 2018 (loan 19) was approved for Mr M and so are 
irrelevant for this complaint as they post-date all the lending period with CLC Finance.  
Using the information CLC Finance has given us then I can see that it carried out a credit 
search in November 2015 and there was nothing in that search which likely would have 
given CLC Finance cause for concern. I note that it did not carry out a later credit search. 
CLC Finance has said that Mr M told it that he was employed full time and I can see from the 
loan application forms CLC Finance has sent to us that he did declare that. The fact that Mr T has mentioned he is unemployed and on benefits as part of his complaint 
may refer to the more recent years or the later lending years. I would have expected CLC 
Finance to have checked this out. As I have already pointed out, the bank statements I have 
for Mr M are not relevant as they post-date the lending. So, I cannot answer CLC Finances 
point about whether Mr T was employed or not during the lending. 
I think that by loan 8 CLC Finance ought to have realised that Mr M was developing a 
pattern. It was not the first time that he ahd taken two loans on one day (here loans 8 and 9) 
which had been used to repay two previous loans and then continued to do that going 
forward. 
The amounts Mr M was asking for were increasing. I note that loan 10 was a 16 week loan 
and it took him 7 months to repay it which was a sign that matters were not easy for Mr T.
I think that by loan 8 CLC Finance ought to have realised that each new loan taken likely 
was filling a hole left by the repayments for the earlier loans. And the repetitive nature of the 
lending was otherwise unsustainable. I say this because he had been indebted to CLC 
Finance for a year. This was a reasonably long time to be using high cost credit. But at loans 
8 and 9 Mr M was making a commitment to make repayments for a further 16 weeks.
I think that Mr M lost out because CLC Finance provided loans from loan 8 onwards:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit over an extended period.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loan 8 to 19 and CLC Finance should put things right.
Putting things right
I understand that some of Mr Ms loans remain outstanding.
In deciding what redress CLC Finance should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it stopped lending to Mr M at loan 8, as Im satisfied it ought to 
have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mr M may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between him and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Mr M in a compliant way at this time.Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Mr M would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce CLC Finance liability in this case for what Im satisfied it 
has done wrong and should put right.
CLC Finance shouldnt have given Mr M loans 8 to 19.
A) CLC Finance should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards 
interest, fees and charges on any upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything CLC Finance have already refunded.
B) CLC Finance should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Mr M which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date he originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) CLC Finance should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr M as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr M having made 
overpayments then CLC Finance should refund these overpayments with 8% simple 
interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have 
arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. CLC Finance should then refund the amounts 
calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should be 
used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus then 
the surplus should be paid to Mr M. However, if there is still an outstanding balance then 
CLC Finance should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr M. CLC Finance 
shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal CLC Finance already written-
off.
E) The overall pattern of Mr Ms borrowing by loan 8 means any information recorded is 
adverse, so CLC Finance should remove loans 8-19 entirely from his credit file. CLC 
Finance do not have to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Ms credit file until they have 
been repaid, but CLC Finance should still remove any adverse information recorded about 
them.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CLC Finance to deduct tax from this interest. CLC 
Finance should give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax CLC Finance deducted if he 
asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint in part. I direct that Hamsard 3225 Limited  
trading as CLC Finance does as I have directed in the putting things right section.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2022.
