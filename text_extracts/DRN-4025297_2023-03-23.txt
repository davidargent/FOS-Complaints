The complaint
Mrs M and the estate of Mr M complain that St. James's Place UK plc (SJP) took a 6% 
deduction from their pension transfer value. SJP acknowledged that it provided an incorrect 
pension transfer value which was around £7,000 higher than the actual transfer value. It 
offered Mrs M and the estate of Mr M £300 for its error. But Mrs M and the estate of Mr M 
would like to be paid the higher transfer value that SJP incorrectly quoted. 
What happened
Mr M had a pension with SJP. He sadly passed away in early 2021. Mrs Ms Independent 
Financial Adviser (IFA) wrote to SJP in August 2021 to inform it of Mr Ms death. 
SJP replied on 20 September 2021. It said that the pension value on the date of Mr Ms 
death was £110,110.27. And that Mr Ms investments had been moved into the Money 
Market Fund to protect their value. It said the money would remain invested in the Money 
Market Fund until the benefits were paid.
SJP also asked for a copy of Mr Ms will and whether there were any additional beneficiaries 
apart from Mrs M. 
I understand that Mrs Ms solicitor replied to SJP on 23 September 2021. It sent the 
Coroner's Certificate and will. And confirmed that Mrs M had chosen the Dependents Flexi 
Access Drawdown option. Mrs Ms solicitor asked SJP to send it the claim form. 
SJP wrote to Mrs Ms IFA again on 1 November 2021. It noted that Mrs M wanted to take the 
benefits as Dependents Flex-Access Drawdown. The letter included both internal and 
external Drawdown Claim forms. And said that SJP needed the relevant claim form to be 
completed and returned, along with two forms of identification. The forms were mostly blank, 
but the Plan Number and Value sections had been completed. Both forms stated that the 
current value of the plan was £116,476.61.
On 16 November 2021 SJP received a transfer request from Mrs Ms chosen drawdown 
provider  provider A. And the funds were transferred to provider A on 4 January 2022. The 
transfer value paid was £109,413.61. SJP said this was based on Money Market Fund prices 
as of 22 December 2021. 
On 11 January 2022, SJP said it received an email from Mrs Ms solicitor querying the 
difference between the settlement figure of £109,413.61 and the amount quoted on the claim 
forms. Mrs Ms solicitor felt that SJP had deducted a 6% charge from Mr Ms fund. And they 
wanted an explanation.
I understand SJP replied to Mrs Ms solicitor on 17 January 2022 to explain that the claim 
forms shouldve said that the current value of the plan was £109,657.38, not the 
£116,476.61 itd quoted, which was incorrect.
Mrs M complained to SJP about the transfer value paid in February 2022. And on 3 March 
2022, SJP issued its final response to the complaint. 
SJP upheld the complaint. It acknowledged that itd quoted an incorrect figure of 
£116,476.61 on the claims forms itd sent on 1 November 2021. It said this had been due to 
human error, and that itd taken steps to ensure it didnt happen again. It apologised and 
offered to pay Mrs M £300 for the errors and confusion they had caused.  
SJP said that the figure it shouldve quoted on the claims forms was £109,657.38. And 
explained that this figure was based on the number of Money Market Fund units held at the 
time (53,439.27) and the unit price at the time (205.2p).
SJP also said that it received the documents it needed to process Mrs Ms transfer request 
from provider A on 21 December 2021. And that it then processed the transfer with prices as 
of 22 December 2021. It said that using next day prices was standard practice. SJP 
explained that the settlement figure of £109,413.61 was based on the 53,372.493 Money 
Market Fund units held and the unit price at the time of 205.0p. 
Unhappy with SJPs response, Mrs M brought the complaint to this service in April 2022. 
Our investigator felt that SJP had taken reasonable steps to put things right. So he didnt 
think the complaint should be upheld. He acknowledged that the error had taken place at an 
extremely difficult time in Mrs Ms life. But said that he was satisfied that the correct transfer 
value had been paid. He felt that Mrs M had suffered a loss of expectation over the period 
shed expected to receive a higher transfer value, rather than any actual financial loss. And 
considered that the £300 SJP had offered as compensation for its error was reasonable 
under the circumstances.
Mrs M didnt agree with our investigator. She said she didnt know how he couldve 
concluded that shed had no financial loss. She felt shed agreed to transfer £116,476, not 
£109,413. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has come to me for a review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont uphold the complaint. I know my decision will be disappointing for 
Mrs M and the estate of Mr M. Ill explain my reasons for it. 
Before I start, Id like to say Im very sorry for Mrs Ms loss. 
SJP has acknowledged that it made a mistake when it included the wrong value on the claim 
forms it sent on 1 November 2021. Its apologised and offered £300 for the errors and the 
confusion they caused.
Mrs M doesnt consider this is sufficient compensation. She feels that shes suffered a 
financial loss of £7,063  the difference between the figure SJP quoted on the claim forms 
and the amount that was actually transferred to provider A. 
I first looked at the valuation information SJP has provided. It provided full unit reconciliation 
information to this service as at the date of Mr Ms death. This showed that the total value of 
Mr Ms pension was £110,110.27 at that time. This was the figure SJP quoted to Mrs Ms IFA 
on 20 September 2021.
The terms and conditions of Mr Ms pension required SJP to switch Mr Ms funds into the Money Market Fund, and to keep them there until the death benefit was paid out. SJP said it 
does this to protect the value of the pension as much as it can from market fluctuations until 
its paid out or transferred. 
SJP also provided full unit reconciliation information as of the date it switched Mr Ms funds 
into the Money Market Fund, in line with the terms and conditions, on 1 April 2021. This 
showed that once all of Mr Ms funds were switched into the Money Market fund, the value of 
his pension was £110,874.10.
SJP also provided information showing that the value of Mr Ms pension as of 29 October 
2021  the date that was used for the information provided in the claim forms  was 
£109,657.39.
SJP provided the correct valuation of £110,110.27 as of the date of Mr Ms death to Mrs Ms 
IFA. But it provided the incorrect figure of £116,476.61, rather than the correct figure of 
£109,657.39, as of 29 October 2021, within the claim forms it sent for Mrs M to complete.
From what Ive seen, the only incorrect figure SJP provided to Mrs M was the one included 
on the 1 November 2022 claim forms, one of which Mrs M completed and signed. So its 
clear that Mrs Ms expectations were that she would receive a transfer value of around 
£116,476.61. She had no reason to consider this might be incorrect. 
We now know this figure was incorrect. SJP has provided evidence which shows that the 
correct transfer value of £109,413.61 as of 22 December 2021 was paid to provider A. This 
was £7,063 lower than Mrs M had been expecting. So she felt SJP had levied a 6% charge. 
I can understand why it mustve seemed to Mrs M that SJP had levied a charge on the 
transfer value it paid to provider A. But it didnt. It simply included the wrong figure on the 
claim forms.   
Therefore, while I acknowledge that Mrs M feels that shes lost out financially, as shed 
agreed to transfer £116,476, not £109,413, I cant fairly agree. I say this because SJP has 
paid the correct transfer value, based on the actual value of the funds held within Mr Ms 
pension. Its followed its terms and conditions throughout. 
SJP did of course make an error. It issued an incorrect transfer value. Usually that sort of 
mistake can be corrected, as it was here. Such a mistake wouldnt generally give rise to any 
entitlement to the higher value stated in error. An entitlement would generally only arise 
where, for example, the consumer had relied on the incorrect information and had changed 
their financial position as a result. Ive seen no evidence that this was the situation here.
So, while I can understand Mrs Ms disappointment that her actual transfer value was lower 
than the one quoted on the claims form, I cant fairly say that she should benefit from SJPs 
mistake. However, I can see that her expectations wouldve been raised for a short time, and 
its also clear that the incorrect transfer value caused Mrs M some concern that SJP had 
charged her 6% of the pension value. And all of this happened at an incredibly difficult time 
in Mrs Ms life. So I think its fair that SJP make a payment for the distress and 
inconvenience Mrs M has suffered. SJP has offered £300 compensation. And I agree with 
our investigator that this is a fair offer under the circumstances. So I dont require SJP to 
amend its offer. And I dont uphold the complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M and the 
estate of Mr M to accept or reject my decision before 20 April 2023.
