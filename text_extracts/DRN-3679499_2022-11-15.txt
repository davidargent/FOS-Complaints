The complaint
Mrs W and Mr W complain about services from National Savings and Investments (NSI)
What happened
Mrs W and Mr W have premium savings bonds (PSB) and an investment account with NSI. 
In January 2022, Mrs W had PSBs valued at £1,036; and Mr W had PSBs valued at £760.  
In March 2022, the balance of Mr Ws investment account was £240,262.45.
Mrs W and Mr W complain that (1) theyd had a letter from NSI stating they didnt have any 
PSBs (2) the interest rate on the investment account cant be correct as it is only 0.01% (3) 
NSI took money out of the investment account - £21.22 was taken out of it on 11 February 
2022. 
NSI said that no such letter had been sent to Mrs W and Mr W about their PSBs. The 
interest rate was correct up to January 2022, and the interest paid for the year from January 
2021 to January 2022 was £23.61. 
Mrs W and Mr W brought their complaints to us. Our investigator said NSI had acted 
reasonably. But Mrs W and Mr W didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at their 
complaints further.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I want to assure Mrs W and Mr W that weve investigated their concerns and have got all the 
information needed from NSI.
On the three complaints:
Premium Savings Bonds (PSBs):
We asked NSI about whether a letter had been sent to Mrs W and Mr W saying that no 
PSBs were held. NSI told us no such letter had been sent  and we accept this. I checked 
Mrs Ws PSB statement and she had a balance of £1,036 in January 2022. I checked Mr Ws 
PSB statement and he had a balance of £760 in January 2022. 
Interest on Investment Account:
We checked the interest rates on the investment account in Mr Ws name and as at January 
2022 it was 0.01% per annum. The rate reduced to 0.01% on 24 November 2020. Before 
that it had been 0.8% since 1 October 2018. 
I checked the current interest rate on NSIs investment accounts and it increased to 0.40% 
on 25 October 2022.
Cheque deposit on 11 February 2022:
I looked at the statement for the investment account in the name of Mr W. A cheque for 
£21.22 was paid in on 11 February 2022; and it was cancelled and debited from the 
investment account on the same day. What this means is that Mr W must have cancelled it 
with his bank  so the money remained in his bank account and not in the investment 
account with NSI. So, he didnt lose the money  it stayed in his bank account.
I hope Mrs W and Mr W are reassured by our investigation. But NSI havent done anything 
wrong, and dont need to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W and Mr W 
to accept or reject my decision before 12 December 2022.
