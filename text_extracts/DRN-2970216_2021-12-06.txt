The complaint
Mr F complains that CarCashPoint Limited lent him a logbook loan when it shouldnt have.
  
What happened
CarCashPoint lent Mr F one loan in September 2019, the loan was for £2,500 over a term of 
36 months with a monthly repayment amount of £281.95.
Mr F complained to CarCashPoint but it didnt uphold his complaint and so he referred it to 
this service where it was looked at by one of our investigators. Our investigator thought that 
proportionate checks and reaction to the information CarCashPoint had would have made it 
aware that Mr F would struggle to repay the loan and so it shouldnt have lent to him.
CarCashPoint disagreed, it said its check went far enough and that its decision to lend was 
responsible. As the complaint hasnt been resolved, it has been passed to me for a decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions 
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Fs complaint. These two 
questions are:
1. Did CarCashPoint complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr F would be able to repay his loan without experiencing significant adverse 
consequences?
If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
If not, would those checks have shown that Mr F wouldve been able to do so?
2. Did CarCashPoint act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Did Carcashpoint complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr F 
would be able to repay his loan without experiencing significant adverse consequences?
The rules and regulations in place at the time of the loan required CarCashPoint to carry out 
a reasonable and proportionate assessment of Mr Fs ability to make the repayments under 
this agreement. This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment 
or affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower focused  so CarCashPoint had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would cause significant adverse consequences for Mr F. In practice this 
meant that CarCashPoint had to ensure that making the payments to the loan wouldnt 
cause Mr F undue difficulty or adverse consequences.
It wasnt enough for CarCashPoint to simply think about the likelihood of it getting its money 
back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr F. Checks also had to be 
proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking.
Even for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different 
applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint.
CarCashPoint has provided evidence to show that before lending this loan, it asked Mr F 
about his monthly income and expenses, it requested and saw bank statements of the 
previous three months, confirmed Mr Fs identity and checked that he wasnt in an individual 
voluntary arrangement (IVA). 
The results of the checks CarCashPoint carried out provided some concerns that I dont 
think it appropriately reacted to. Mr F said he was consolidating the borrowing on his credit 
card, he also said that he had a charge on his home which he was repaying. I think it should 
have been clear to CarCashPoint that Mr F had other credit elsewhere and it should have 
been looking to verify his level of indebtedness, it could have done this through a credit 
search. Im not suggesting that CarCashPoint was required to carry out a credit search 
before lending, but it needed to show that it took appropriate steps to assess the affordability 
and sustainability of the loan while reacting to the information it already had. I dont think it 
did this here.
Mr F has provided a copy of his credit file and I can see that around the time CarCashPoint 
lent to him, he had some historic defaults from 2015 showing on his credit file and Mr F was 
in arrangements to repay those creditors. Looking at the bank statements CarCashPoint 
obtained at the time, I think it also should have been aware that Mr F would struggle to repay 
the loan. Mr F told CarCashPoint that he was self-employed, and I can see that over the 
relevant period, his income varied. There was other credit scoming into his account, but Mr F 
has said those credit payments were for his partner and I can see that he was transferring 
roughly the same amounts on those specific credit payments out of his account. So I think it 
is likely that it wasnt his income.And so, in the three months before this loan, Mr Fs average income was around £1,173 and 
his living expenses on average over the period was around £1,014, this included things like 
his mobile phone, insurance, utilities and food. I think even without taking its checks further 
CarCashPoint should have known that Mr F would struggle to repay this loan as he didnt 
have sufficient funds. This was borne out by the fact Mr F started having difficulties repaying 
the loan shortly after borrowing it.
In the circumstances CarCashPoint shouldnt have lent to Mr F and it needs to put things 
right.
Did Carcashpoint act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive considered whether CarCashPoint acted unfairly in some other way towards Mr F. I can 
see that Mr F has had difficulties repaying his loan and CarCashPoint set up an interim 
repayment plan for two months, which came to an end in February 2020. Following the end 
of this arrangement, CarCashPoint issued a default notice. It seems to me that Mr F had 
kept up to date with the payments on his arrangement and even though the arrangement 
had come to an end, I dont think a default notice was the positive next step for 
CarCashPoint take.
So, Id remind CarCashPoint of his obligation under the rules that apply to it to show 
forbearance to Mr F in his financial difficulties.   
 
Putting things right  what CarCashPoint needs to do.
Remove all interest, fees and charges applied to the loan.
Treat any payments made by Mr F as payments towards the capital amount of the 
loan.
If Mr F has paid more than the capital then any overpayments should be refunded 
with 8%* simple interest from the date they were paid to the date of settlement,
But if theres still an outstanding balance, CarCashPoint should agree a reasonable 
repayment plan with Mr F.
Remove any adverse information about the loan from Mr Fs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to take off tax from this interest. CarCashPoint 
must give Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mr Fs complaint. CarCashPoint Limited should put 
things right for Mr F as set out above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2022.
