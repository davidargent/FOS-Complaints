The complaint
Mr B says American Express Services Europe Limited told him interest would be frozen on 
his balance as of January 2021, but it applied interest in January and February 2021.
What happened
Amex closed Mr Bs account in early December and sent him contact details of organisations 
who might be able to help him with his finances. Mr B contacted Amexs debt collections 
agency in response to a letter it sent on 21 January 2021.This was the second letter it had 
sent asking Mr B to get in touch about his debt. He was having financial difficulties and so 
completed an income and expenditure form. On 26 January 2021 the debt collections 
agency confirmed it was referring him to its specialist financial difficulties team who could 
help him and freeze interest on his account. Amex wrote to Mr B on 29 January 2021 
confirming it was freezing interest and this would take effect in seven days  so 5 February 
2021. Mr Bs statement from 3 February shows his balance at this point was £6,910.94.
Unfortunately Amex applied interest in error to his March and April statements, but it 
corrected this with a credit to his account on 18 March 2021. It was done on this date as 
Amex incorrectly refunded the February and March interest initially, when the February 
interest was valid as was charged on the 3rd, so prior to the freeze on the 5th.  It transferred 
the debt of £6,912.66 to the collections agency in April 2021. This was £1.72 higher than   
Mr Bs balance when the interest freeze was applied so it later credited Mr Bs account with 
this amount.
Mr B says his balance should be £6,795.04, as it was on his January statement
Our investigator did not uphold Mr Bs complaint. She said whilst it was unfortunate Amex 
had made errors in charging interest after 5 February 2021, it had refunded these amounts. 
And the correspondence she had seen made clear the interest freeze would start on 5 
February, not at the start of January 2021. So she found Amex need not refund any more 
interest charges to Mr Bs account.
Mr B disagreed with this assessment. He said the collections agency had confirmed the 
balance to him, as did Amex in January 2021. The agency only mentioned an increased 
balance in late 2021/early 2022. He asked for an ombudsmans review, so the case was 
passed to me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I am not upholding Mr Bs complaint. Ill explain why.
I have reviewed the correspondence from the debt collections agency that Mr B feels 
confirms his balance to be £6,794.04. I find it is clear they referring to his balance at that 
point in time and they can try to help him get interest frozen going forward subject to him 
doing certain things (agreeing an affordable payment plan, or completing an income and 
expenditure form). But not until Amexs letter of 29 January 2021 is this a formalised 
agreement. It is clear the effective date will be 5 February 2021. 
The letter reads The annual interest rate you are charged will be reduced to 0% per annum 
for all outstanding balances on your account(s). This means you will not be charged any 
interest on any of your outstanding balances. This reduction will take effect seven (7) days 
from the date of this letter. So the relevant final balance is the one that appeared on Mr Bs 
statement including charges up until 3 February 2021. This was £6,910.94.
Amexs errors in March and April meant a marginally higher debt was transferred to the debt 
collections agency in April 2021. But as this £1.72 discrepancy has been corrected I find 
Amex need take no further action.
Mr B has said he only found out about the higher balance in late 2021/early 2022, but as 
Amex issued a correct statement on 3 February 2021 prior to transferring the debt I cant find 
it made a communication error. If Mr B is dissatisfied with the communications from the debt 
collections agency he should raise a complaint with it first. He can then of course bring a 
new complaint to this service if he is unhappy with its response. It needs to be investigated 
separately as the debt collections agency is not party to this complaint and needs to have 
the chance to respond to Mr B. 
My final decision
I am not upholding Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2022.
