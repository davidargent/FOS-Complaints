K821x#15complaint
Ms K complains  that NewDay Ltd treated her unfairly by closing her credit card account and 
passing the associated debt to a collection agent  without telling her.
background
Ms K had a credit card with NewDay. She agreed  a repayment plan for a reduced amount in 
February 2018 as she was struggling  to meet her monthly payments, but she missed May 
2018s payment.  Ms K spoke to NewDay about  it and says she was told to call back  on  
7 June 2018 to set up a new arrangement. She says that when she called back, she was 
told her account had been closed and passed  to another business to collect  the balance.
Ms K wasnt happy her account  had been  closed, so she complained to NewDay.  It told 
Ms K it had passed  her account  to a collection agent in line with the terms and conditions of 
her account.  It also said it had written to Ms K in March 2018 warning her that her account  
could be passed  to a third party.  Ms K wasnt happy with that response, so she raised a 
complaint with this service. 
Our investigator accepted NewDay was allowed to pass Ms Ks account to a third party, but 
she thought it hadnt been clear with Ms K about  what was happening.  She said NewDay  
should pay Ms K £100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused. 
NewDay said it would pay Ms K £50, as it thought  £100 was too much.  Ms K remained 
unhappy that it hadnt told her that her account had been closed. She said she couldve 
borrowed money from friends or family  to make the payments and keep the account open. 
She asked  for her account  to be reactivated rather than to be given compensation.
The case  has been passed to me to review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusions as our investigator  for broadly the same  reasons. Ill explain why. 
Its understandable  that Ms K is frustrated her account was closed and passed to a collection 
agent. But like our investigator,  I accept that the terms and conditions of Ms Ks account 
allowed NewDay to do this. 
Having said this, I dont  agree  that it went about it in a reasonable way, or gave Ms K a level 
of service which could  be reasonably  expected.  
NewDays records show that Ms K had contacted  it about her difficulty in making payments 
in January 2018, and a payment arrangement was set up to run for six months  from 
February 2018. However, NewDay wrote to Ms K in March 2018 to say it would close her 
account if she didnt  pay the outstanding arrears immediately. I accept this was contradictory 
and would have  been confusing for Ms K.
Ref: DRN76612252Ive listened to the call Ms K subsequently had with NewDay when she missed  Mays 
payment. During  the call NewDay told Ms K that shed broken her payment arrangement,  but 
it also suggested shed  be able to either reinstate it, or set up a new one if she called back  at 
a later date. Given that NewDay  subsequently  chose to exercise  its right to pass the account  
on to a third party to collect the outstanding  balance, I think  this was misleading, and I can 
see why Ms K was shocked and displeased.
I dont, however, agree that that NewDay should  reopen Ms Ks account. Ms Ks account 
terms and conditions say that NewDay can close her account  immediately  if she misses 
payments. Ms K missed a payment at which point her account had been in arrears for a 
number of months. I dont  think  it was unfair,  or unusual in the circumstances, for NewDay to 
close Ms Ks account at this point. 
Additionally, and significantly, I also think that Ms K made it clear  in the call she had with 
NewDay that she wasnt in a position  to make the payment she was required to in May 2018. 
So I dont  accept that she wouldve made  payment to keep the account  open if shed known 
NewDays intentions.  
While I recognise that Ms K has said she doesnt want  to be compensated, I think  making  an 
award is appropriate given the trouble and upset NewDay  caused her. Ive considered  the 
impact NewDays failings  have had on Ms K and I think  £100  compensation is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances.
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above, my final decision is that NewDay  Ltd needs  to pay Ms K 
£100 compensation for the trouble and upset it caused her.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2019.
