K821x#15complaint
Mr L says Elevate Credit  International  Limited  trading as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
says that Sunny shouldve been aware  that he couldnt afford the loan repayments  and not 
lent to him. These loans  caused him financial problems and he needed to borrow  further to 
make the repayments.  
background
This complaint is about the lending  Sunny  approved to Mr L. There was one running  credit 
account followed by 43 instalment loans.  Sunny provided these to Mr L between September 
2014 and May 2017. Ive included a table  at the end of this decision that shows  some of the 
information Sunny has provided about  this lending. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that Sunny  shouldnt have 
approved loans 6 to 44. 
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It did initially offer to pay compensation  in 
line with the adjudicators recommendation - from loan 38 onwards.  And, at a later time, it 
made a new offer to pay compensation in respect of loans 24 to 44. 
Mr L didnt accept either of these  offers  so the complaint  has been passed to me to issue a 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr L could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN47247812There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.  Ive decided  to uphold Mr Ls complaint 
in part and have Ive explained why below.
Mr L didnt disagree  with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 5. Because  of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr L had with Sunny. So 
they are something  I will take into account  when considering the other loans  he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 44 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  
history with Mr L, with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which  Sunny  should  
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr L was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr L had been indebted  to Sunny  for over seven months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr L was having  to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loans were leaving in his finances and that 
Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
And Sunny ought to have known  that Mr L was not likely borrowing to meet  a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet a continuing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr L was provided with a new loan within  a very short time of 
settling a previous  one. And at times he could have more than one loan running at 
the same  time. 
Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Sunny. Loan 44 was 
taken out over two and a half years after Mr Ls first. This is a very long time to use 
short term, high cost credit. I cant see how Sunny considered it was reasonable to 
lend for this length of time. Mr L had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect,  
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
Sunny  has noted that Mr L had a reasonable income and the amounts borrowed 
were modest. Im not sure what Sunny is trying to say here.  It seems  to suggest that 
Mr Ls income would  lead to him being  in reasonable  financial shape and so could 
repay the loans  sustainably.  But the fact that he borrowed  around £11,000 from 
Sunny over a prolonged period demonstrates  a need for significant  amounts of high 
cost credit. Which  would indicate  that it was more likely than not that Mr L was having 
some financial  problems.  
Ref: DRN47247813I think that Mr L lost out because Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr L borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ls ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 44 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 6 to 44;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 44 should be removed from 
Mr Ls credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Sunny a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ls complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 May 2020.
