The complaint
Mr D complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money lent irresponsibly 
when it approved his credit card application and later increased the credit limit. 
What happened
Mr D made a credit card application to 118 118 Money in August 2019. In the application, Mr 
D said he was employed full time with a monthly income of around £2,021. Mr D also said he 
was a homeowner. 118 118 Money carried out a credit search and says it found mortgage 
commitments in Mr Ds name along with unsecured credit. 118 118 Moneys credit search 
found some defaults from 2017 and 2018 as well. 
118 118 Money says it applied its lending criteria to Mr Ds application and approved a credit 
card with a low limit of £250. 
Mr D went on to use his credit card and in September 2021 the limit was increased by 
118 118 Money to £800. 118 118 Money says it reviewed Mr Ds credit card history and 
credit file before taking the decision to increase Mr Ds credit limit.
Last year, Mr D complained that 118 118 Money had lent irresponsibly when it approved his 
credit card and later increased the credit limit. 118 118 Money issued a final response on 19 
April 2023 but didnt agree it had lent irresponsibly. 
Mr Ds representatives referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an 
investigator. They thought 118 118 Money had carried out reasonable and proportionate 
checks before approving Mr Ds credit card application and increasing the credit limit and 
didnt uphold his complaint. Mr Ds representatives asked to appeal, so his complaint has 
been passed to me to make a decision. The investigator recently contacted Mr Ds 
representatives to request a copy of his bank statements but we didnt receive them or a 
request for more time by the due date given. As Mr Ds representatives asked to appeal, his 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our general approach to complaints about unaffordable or irresponsible lending  including 
the key rules, guidance and good industry practice  is set out on our website.
In short, before agreeing to lend, 118 118 Money needed to complete proportionate checks 
to be able to understand whether the borrowing was sustainable for Mr D. Theres no 
specific list of checks a lender has to complete. While it is down to the lender to decide what 
specific checks to carry out, these should be reasonable and proportionate to the type and 
amount of credit being provided, the length of the term, the frequency and amount of the 
repayments, the total cost of the credit and what it knew about Mr D at the time of 
application.
In this case, Mr D provided information about his income and employment at the point he 
applied in August 2019. In addition, Mr D confirmed he was a homeowner and 118 118 
Money carried out a credit search. 118 118 Money found evidence of Mr Ds mortgage costs 
on his credit file. 
In addition, 118 118 Money found evidence of the unsecured borrowing Mr D had on his 
credit file along with his credit history in general. I can see Mr D had some defaults in 2017 
and 2018 and that 118 118 Money was aware of them. In addition, there is evidence of some 
short-term lending around the time Mr D applied to 118 118 Money for a credit card. But I 
have to balance that against the fact the credit card was approved with a reasonably modest 
credit limit of £250. Im satisfied that 118 118 Money obtained an accurate picture of what Mr 
D owed and the payments he was making each month. 
In my view, the checks 118 118 Money carried out were proportionate to the type of credit 
Mr D was applying for. Im sorry to disappoint Mr D, but I havent been persuaded 118 118 
Money lent irresponsibly when it approved his credit card application. 
Around August 2021 118 118 Money increased the credit limit to £800. Again, 118 118 
Money reviewed Mr Ds credit file. Ive reviewed the information it found and havent seen 
anything that wouldve highlighted Mr D was experiencing financial difficulties at the time. In 
addition, for around six months before the credit limit increase was approved Mr Ds balance 
was substantially below the existing limit of £250. Ive considered all the information 118 118 
Money had available and havent been persuaded it lent irresponsibly when it increased Mr 
Ds credit limit. In my view, 118 118 Money carried out reasonable and proportionate checks 
before increasing Mr Ds credit limit. I havent been persuaded it 118 118 Money lent 
irresponsibly when it increased Mr Ds credit limit to £800.
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr D but as Im satisfied 118 118 Money carried out 
proportionate checks before approving his credit card application and increasing its credit 
limits and havent been persuaded it lent irresponsibly, Im not upholding his complaint. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2023.
