K821x#15complaint
Miss C says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss C had 17 loans with QuickQuid. Ive included some of the information QuickQuid 
provided about these loans  in the appendix to this decision.
An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld.  She didnt think 
QuickQuid was right to approve loan 7a or any of the subsequent  loans.  This was because 
she thought QuickQuid ought  to have recognised at this point, from the pattern  of borrowing, 
that further borrowing would likely be unsustainable  or otherwise harmful for Miss C.
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.  
As theres  been  no further dispute,  I wont be considering loans 1-7 in my decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Miss Cs case.
Ive decided to uphold Miss Cs complaint about  loan 7a and the subsequent loans and have 
explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss C 
could repay  her loans  in a sustainable  manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Miss Cs income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Miss Cs complaint. These  questions  are:
Ref: DRN132966521.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Miss C would be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Miss C would have  been  able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Miss Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Miss Cs 
complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Miss C would  be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks 
have shown that Miss C would have been  able to do so?
I think this question is most relevant to the period of lending  covering  loans  1-7. As Ive said 
above, Im not looking at these loans in this decision. So I wont consider whether the checks 
for these  loans were  proportionate or not.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 7a onwards  
because I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next 
section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Miss Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise 
harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending.  Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which QuickQuid should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Miss Cs case, I think  that this 
point was reached by 7a. I say this because:
the amounts  Miss C was borrowing were generally increasing, and QuickQuid ought 
to have realised it was likely their indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
the top-up for loan 7 increased Miss Cs largest payment to more  than half her 
income and was her eleventh advance in about five months - so QuickQuid ought to 
have realised it wasnt likely  she was settling  her debts sustainably  and that her 
continuing need for extra funds  wasnt the result of a short-term cash  flow problem
Miss C wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed QuickQuid;  she was 
regularly topping-up her loans and borrowing again shortly after repaying them. So 
Miss C was in effect paying large  amounts of interest to service this debt over an 
extended period
I think that Miss C lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 7a 
onwards because:
Ref: DRN13296653these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time
the sheer number  of loans (loans  and deferrals) was likely to have had negative 
implications on Miss Cs ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding  Miss Cs complaint about  loans 7a onwards because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  her indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and she lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Miss C in some  
other way.
Id also like to make it clear I have considered all the points QuickQuid raised in response  to 
the adjudicator.  This includes the document about its approach to lending post March  2015,  
which isnt case-specific. This service has responded to QuickQuids submission of this 
document on many previous occasions  and so Ill say no more about it here  but I have 
taken its contents  into account.
QuickQuid also provided information about its estimation of Miss Cs disposable income (a 
figure it calls EDI). This information  hasnt  changed my mind about the pattern of lending. Im 
aware QuickQuid considers that each loan was affordable, based on the EDI figures. But Ive 
also taken into account the pattern of lending and the frequency  with which Miss C borrowed 
(and topped-up her loans).  Again,  QuickQuid  will be familiar, from previous decisions, of this 
Services approach  and the relevant rules  and guidance.
In short,  QuickQuid provided Miss C with 17 loans  35 advances  in the space of about a 
year and a half. On average, this equates to an advance approximately every 16 days.  I 
think its perfectly reasonable to suggest this pattern, at some point, would cause a 
responsible lender to be concerned about  the sustainability  of the lending. That the loans 
were repaid  does not mean  that they were repaid sustainably, or without causing Miss C 
undue difficulty.  For the reasons Ive explained above I think this point arose when Miss C 
asked to top-up loan 7.
Ref: DRN13296654putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Miss C paid on loan 7a and all subsequent loans
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Miss C paid them until 
the date of settlement
remove all entries for these loans from Miss Cs credit history
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Miss C a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Miss Cs complaint. CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps  
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 May 2019.

Ref: DRN13296655Appendix
Some of Miss Cs loans were topped-up. This means Miss C borrowed  extra funds during the 
course of the loan agreement. On some  occasions  the top-ups extended  the term of the loan, 
meaning the base loan was rolled into a new loan agreement.  Overall, there are 35 advances 
(loans and top-ups) which Miss C is complaining about.
