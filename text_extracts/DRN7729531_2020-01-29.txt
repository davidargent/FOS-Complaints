K821x#15complaint
Mr F says Elevate  Credit  International Limited  trading as Sunny - irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about one flex credit  account  (loan 1) and 21 instalment loans (loans  2 to 
22) Sunny provided  to Mr F between November  2014 and March 2016.  Mr Fs borrowing 
history is summarised at the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Fs complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the pattern of the borrowing suggested Mr F had 
become reliant  on short-term loans. 
Sunny disagreed and said it had done robust  checks on Mr Fs creditworthiness  and 
affordability checks. These checks indicated that Mr Fs disposable income  was sufficient to 
meet the repayments for the loans.  As an informal resolution couldnt be reached, the 
complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr F could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider a number of different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN77295312I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr F could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend upholding  Mr Fs complaint about loans 1, 2 and 3. Mr F 
didnt respond  to the adjudicators opinion. As these loans appear to no longer be in dispute,  
I wont make  any further findings  on them. So, Ive focused my decision on loans 4 to 22 and 
having done so Im partially upholding Mr Fs complaint. Ill explain why. 
Before Sunny lent Mr F any of the loans it checked  his income and normal living costs 
including regular credit  commitments. By the time Mr F applied for loan 4, I think Sunny 
should have been looking to build  a clear picture of his circumstances before lending. I say 
this because Mr F was now taking a fourth loan when he hadnt  fully repaid two of his 
previous loans with Sunny. It was also his fourth  loan in seven months  and loan 4 was taken 
out only three weeks after loan 3.  The combined repayments of loan 4 plus loans 2 and 3 
was a significant portion of Mr Fs monthly  income  and I think Sunny ought to have been  
aware that it was unlikely  Mr F would have been able to sustainably  meet  his repayments.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr F, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Fs case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr F was not managing his finances.  Mr F 
had taken out 6 loans  within 9 months  and most  of the loans  were  running 
concurrently with at least one other loan. So Sunny  ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr F was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Fs indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr F was provided with a new loan within weeks  of taking out 
the previous one. 
Mr F wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  22 was 
taken out 16 months after Mr Fs first. Mr F had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
Ref: DRN77295313I think that Mr F lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr F borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Fs ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 and 5 and loans 6 to 22 and Sunny 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid on loans  6 to 22;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Fs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 to 22 should be removed from 
Mr Fs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr F a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Fs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 February  2020.
