The complaint
Mr G complains about the administration and management of his running account credit 
agreement (agreement) by Clydesdale Financial services Limited (BPF).
What happened
In November 2022 Mr G entered into an agreement with BPF. The terms of this agreement 
state that all payments made in respect of it are allocated in the following order:
1. against any arrears (and against the highest APR bearing plan arrears first)
2. against any sums currently due (and against the highest APR bearing plan first)
3. against any sums currently not due (against the highest APR bearing plan first)
The agreement also states that any overpayments made are allocated in the same order as 
above and any direct debit set up will (everything else being equal) still be collected or 
attempted to be collected.
Mr G made a number of purchases (subject to 7 plans) under his agreement between 
27 November and 15 December 2022:
plan no date amount Monthly 
payment term (months) interest bearing
862 27/11/22 £533.97 £25.03 24 Yes
290 28/11/22 £114.86 £19.14 6 No
723 28/11/22 £153.10 £25.52 6 No
165 28/11/22 £106.51 £17.75 6 No
285 28/11/22 £131.24 £21.87 6 No
655 28/11/22 £445.66 £18.57 24 No
535 15/12/22 £119.51 £19.92 6 No
The first payment under the agreement was set by BPF to be collected on 28 January 2023.
On 6 January 2023 Mr G phoned BPF to enquire if he could pay off 2 of his purchase plans, 
285 of £65.25 (£131.24 less a refund of £65.99) and 655 of £69.88 (£445.66 less a 
refund of £375.78). BPF said Mr G could and took a card payment of £135.13 (£65.25 plus 
£69.88) from him. However, this payment wasnt allocated in line with what Mr G was 
advised.
On 18 January 2023, and after Mr G had complained to it, BPF issued Mr G with a final 
response letter (FRL). Under cover of this FRL BPF said it accepted it had misadvised 
Mr G (on 6 January 2023) about how the payment made by him of £135.13 would be 
allocated and for that it had credited his bank account with £150.00 compensation. It also 
said that how Mr Gs payment of £135.13 had been allocated was in line with the terms of 
his agreement and all further payments would be allocated in the same way.
On 19 January 2023 BPF agreed to move Mr Gs payment due date from 28 to 9 of the 
month with the next payment falling due on 9 March 2023. However, this wasnt actioned in 
time for 28 January 2023 payment not to be called for.
On 28 January 2023 BPF tried to collect a payment from Mr Gs bank account of £147.80 
(£25.03, £19.14, £25.52, £17.75, £21.87, £18.57, £19.92). This payment was returned 
unpaid on 1 February 2023 marked refer to payer.
On 29 January 2023 BPF moved Mr Gs payment due date from 28 to 9 of the month with 
the next payment falling due on 9 March 2023. However, this wasnt actioned in time for 
28 January 2023 payment not to be called for again.
On 6 February 2023 BPF tried to collect a payment from Mr Gs bank account of £147.80. 
This payment was returned unpaid on 8 February 2023 marked refer to payer.
On 2 March 2023 Mr G made a card payment of £160.47 (£295.60 being 2 instalments of 
£147.80) less £135.13 (paid by Mr G on 6 January 2023).
On 9 March 2023 BPF collected a payment from Mr Gs bank account of £147.44.
On 9 April 2023 BPF tried to collect a payment from Mr Gs bank account of £107.36. This 
payment was returned unpaid on 13 April 2023 marked instruction cancelled. 
On 13 April 2023, and after Mr G had complained to it, BPF issued Mr G with a (second) 
FRL. Under cover of this FRL BPF said it accepted that it had provided Mr G with a poor 
level of service during calls of 10 and 24 March 2023 and for this it had credited his bank 
account with £50.00 and £25.00 compensation respectively. It also said that although Mr Gs 
9 March 2023 payment of £147.44 was allocated correctly and in line with the terms of the 
agreement it had taken the decision to clear the balance of £21.51 (£65.25 less 2 allocated 
monthly payments of £21.87) and £32.74 (£69.88 less 2 allocated monthly payments of 
£18.57) on plans 285 and 655 respectively.
BPF also explained, under cover of this FRL, that it had taken the decision to reduce Mr Gs 
monthly payment to £108 (£107.36) on grounds of affordability (as allowed for under the 
agreement) and its refusal to allow him further plans under the agreement was as a result its 
lending criteria not being met.
On 25 April 2023, and after Mr G had complained to it, BPF issued Mr G with a letter. Under 
cover of this letter BPF said it was satisfied that it had handled Mr Gs complaints fairly and 
reasonably and in line with its regulatory obligations and it wouldnt be entering into any 
further correspondence with him in respect of his complaint(s).On receipt of the above letter Mr G referred his complaint to our service. In summary he said 
that he was looking for £10,000 in compensation and for his remaining debt balance to be 
written off by way of compensation.
Mr Gs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
having paid Mr G £225 in compensation (£150, £50 and £25) and having written off £54.25 
of Mr Gs agreement debt (£21.51 plus £32.74) BPF needed to do nothing further.
Mr G didnt agree with the investigators view and so his complaint has been passed to me 
for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that Mr G has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed 
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their 
entirety. However, I trust that Mr G will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I 
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as 
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The purpose 
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
 
I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear, or 
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities. And its for our service 
to decide what evidence to call for and what weight should be given to the evidence 
provided. 
payments made by Mr G
Having considered what both parties have said and submitted Im satisfied that all the 
payments made by Mr G to the end of March 2023 (of £135.13, £160.47 and £147.44) were 
allocated correctly to his agreement debt and in line with the agreement terms. 
Now as Mr G is aware his payment of £147.44 on 9 March 2023 was allocated by BPF to 
plan 862, something Mr G believes to be incorrect. 
Mr G was originally required to make payments under his agreement on 28 January, 
February and March 2023. However, his payments (at his request) were rescheduled to fall 
on 28 January, 9 March 2023 and 9 April 2023. 
When Mr Gs 9 March 2023 payment was called for from his bank account and paid he had 
already paid BPF £295.60 (£135.13 on 6 January 2023 plus £160.47 on 2 March 2023) 
against payments due of £295.60 (£147.80 on 28 January 2023 and £147.80 due on 
9 March 2023). 
Given the above, Im satisfied that BPF acted correctly and in line with the agreement terms 
in treating 9 March 2023 payment as an overpayment and in allocating it against plan 862 
 the highest interest bearing plan.6 January 2023
Its not in dispute that Mr G was incorrectly advised by BPF over the phone on this date that 
his payment (by card) of £135.13 would be allocated against plans 285 and 655. But Im 
not persuaded that Mr G was financially disadvantaged by being given this incorrect advice, 
or by having his payment of £135.13 treated by BPF in the way that it was.
10 March 2023
Although BPF references a call being made by Mr G to it on the above date under cover of 
its second FRL its my understanding, based on system notes provided by BPF, that the 
correct date for this call is 2 March 2023. However, this fact isnt material because its not in 
dispute that Mr G was incorrectly advised by BPF in this call. However, for the sake of 
completeness I would add that Im not persuaded that Mr G was financially disadvantaged 
by being given this incorrect advice.
call of 24 March 2023
Its not in dispute that Mr G received poor service from BPF in this call. But again, Im not 
persuaded that Mr G was financially disadvantaged as a result of this poor service.
BPFs handing of Mr Gs complaints
Im satisfied that BPF dealt with Mr Gs complaints in line with it regulatory obligations and in 
line with what I would expect.
reduction by BPF to Mr Gs contractual minimum monthly agreement payment amount
Im satisfied that this was an exercise of BPFs legitimate commercial judgement and one 
that it would be neither fair nor reasonable for me to interfere with. And for the sake of 
completeness, I would add that Im satisfied that this reduction isnt linked in anyway to 
payments made by Mr G under his agreement or how these payments were treated by BPF.
refusal by BPF to open further plans for Mr G under his agreement
Im satisfied that this was also an exercise of BPFs legitimate commercial judgement and 
one that it would be neither fair nor reasonable for me to interfere with. And for the sake of 
completeness, I would add that Im satisfied that this reduction isnt linked in anyway to 
payments made by Mr G under his agreement or how these payments were treated by BPF.
matters in the round
As I say above I cant see that Mr G has been financially disadvantaged by BPF allocating 
his payment of £135.13 in the manner that it did, rather than in the manner it said it would. 
But that doesnt mean Mr G shouldnt be compensated for being misadvised in this respect, 
or for being misadvised in a further call on 2 March 2023 and for the poor service he 
received in a call of 24 March 2023. But taking everything into account Im satisfied that 
having paid Mr G £225 and having written off £54.25 of his agreement debt BPF has 
compensated Mr G more than I would have directed it to had it offered and paid Mr G 
nothing.For the sake of completeness, I would also add that when making an awards for distress and 
inconvenience Ive to have regards not to the time a consumer says they spent in trying to 
resolve matters but what would have, in all the circumstances, constituted a fair and 
reasonable amount of time for them to have spent doing so. And despite it not being in 
dispute that things did go wrong in this case Ive had regards to how quickly (and in some 
detail) BPF responded to Mr Gs complaints (by both telephone and in writing) and its 
acceptance very early on there had been some shortcomings on its part.
My final decision
My final decision is that having paid Mr G £225 in compensation and having written off 
£54.25 of Mr Gs agreement debt Clydesdale Financial Services Limited need do nothing 
further in respect of this complaint. However, I would remind Clydesdale Financial Services 
Limited of its various obligations, going forward, to treat Mr G fairly and reasonably in light of 
what I understand might be both his personal and financial circumstances.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 September 2023.
