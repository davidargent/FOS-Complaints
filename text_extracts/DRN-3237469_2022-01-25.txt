One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that STFL should put things 
right for Mrs J from loan 6 onwards. STFL disagreed and the unresolved complaint was 
allocated to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
STFL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs J could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. 
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that STFL should 
fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer. 
These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
STFL was required to establish whether Mrs J could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being the 
ability to repay without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Js complaint.
The acknowledgements from Mrs Js representative demonstrates to me that Mrs J appears 
not to have taken issue with the adjudicators opinion. And so, I think that the outcome for 
loans 1 to 5 are undisputed and so I consider them resolved. They remain relevant when 
considering the lending relationship between the parties. 
Mrs J applied for loan 6 in October 2016 when she had been indebted to STFL for about 
sixteen months and had asked for and been approved loans sequentially. Often she had 
refinanced the last part of her previous loan into the new loans. 
I consider that sixteen months permanently in debt to STFL ought to have alerted STFL to 
the fact that she likely had a more serious underlying problem than simply a temporary cash-
flow issue. Mrs J did not have a job and had two young children and her income was made 
up of benefits. Her declared expenditure on food was, in my view, very modest for a family 
and so by the time she was asking for loan 6 then I think that STFL ought to have taken 
stock of the situation. I think that a pattern had developed by this point in the relationship where she was consistently taking loans sequentially with no breaks. And at loan 6, loan 5 
had not been repaid. I consider this to be an escalation int hat Mrs J was moving on to have 
overlapping loans. 
So, taking it all into account I think that STFL ought to have ceased lending to her at loan 6. 
I think that Mrs J lost out because STFL continued to provide borrowing from the loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Js indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mrs Js ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about  loans 6 to 19 and STFL should put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STFL should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Mrs J from loan 6 as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs J may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real 
and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mrs J in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Mrs J would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFLs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.
STFL ought to do as follows: 
refund all interest and charges Mrs J paid on loans 6 to 19; and 
pay interest of 8% simple a year* on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 6 to 19 should be removed from 
Mrs Js credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires STFL to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mrs J 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Js complaint in part and I direct that Short Term 
Finance Limited does as I have outlined above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 February 2022.
