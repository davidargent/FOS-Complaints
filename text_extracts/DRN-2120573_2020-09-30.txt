The complaint
Mrs R has complained about a number of loans she took from Evergreen Finance London 
Limited trading as Moneyboat. Mrs R says Moneyboat lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in July 2020 that I summarise below.
Mrs R was given 12 loans by Moneyboat between October 2016 and May 2019. The loans 
were all to be repaid in either two, three or four instalments. The principal sum borrowed 
varied from £200 to £500.
A summary of Mrs R's borrowing is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount
1 07/10/2016 24/11/2016 2 £250.00
2 28/11/2016 09/12/2016 4 £500.00
3 18/07/2017 14/09/2017 3 £250.00
4 14/09/2017 01/11/2017 2 £200.00
5 14/11/2017 28/12/2017 2 £400.00
6 02/01/2018 28/02/2018 2 £350.00

10 22/11/2018 28/12/2018 2 £400.00
11 08/01/2019 31/01/2019 2 £300.00
12 07/05/2019 28/06/2019 2 £300.00
When Mrs R first complained to Moneyboat, the lender didnt agree to uphold her complaint, 
but it did offer to refund the interest it had charged on the final five loans as a gesture of 
goodwill. Mrs R didnt accept this offer and brought her complaint to this service.
In my provisional decision I explained why I thought the complaint should be partly upheld. 
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, in particular the checks that 
Moneyboat needed to do such as the amount being lent, and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, I thought less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate in the early stages of the lending relationship.
Moneyboat was required to establish whether Mrs R could sustainably repay her loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might of course be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Moneyboat carried out some checks before lending to Mrs R. It asked her for details about 
her income and normal monthly expenditure. Moneyboat also gathered further information 
from credit reference agencies.
I thought the checks Moneyboat did before agreeing to the first two loans were reasonable 
and proportionate. I didnt think a summary of those checks showed anything that should 
have caused additional concerns for the lender in the initial stages of the lending 
relationship. I thought the amounts that Mrs R needed to repay in relation to the first two 
loans were relatively modest compared with the disposable income shed declared. Given 
the amount it was lending to Mrs R and what its checks had shown, I didnt think it wouldve 
been proportionate for Moneyboat to ask Mrs R for the amount of information that would be 
needed to show the lending was unsustainable before agreeing the first two loans.
There was then a gap of around seven months between Mrs R re-paying loan 2 and taking 
loan 3.
I thought about the length of this gap, when it occurred in the lending relationship and what 
else was happening at the time. In some circumstances, a gap of this length might 
reasonably lead a lender to conclude that any problems that had led the consumer to take 
the previous loans had been resolved. In those circumstances such a gap might reasonably 
constitute a clean break in lending. But I didnt think, in the particular circumstances of this 
case, that Moneyboat could reasonably have considered the gap between loans 2 and 3 to 
be a clean break in lending.
Moneyboat had provided a list of all the loan applications Mrs R made during its lending 
relationship with her. In between repaying loan 2 and being granted loan 3, Mrs R made 
several further applications for lending with Moneyboat before she was finally given her third 
loan. I dont think, in these circumstances, that Moneyboat could reasonably conclude that 
the problems that had led Mrs R to take her first two loans had been resolved, given her 
repeated and unsuccessful attempts to secure further borrowing during the intervening
period. So, I didnt think there was a clean break in the lending between loans 2 and 3. And 
I didnt think any of the shorter gaps between loans later in the lending relationship 
constituted a clean break either. Consequently I looked at Mrs Rs loans as one continuous 
chain of lending.
I thought the checks that Moneyboat carried out before it agreed to loan 3 suggested to it 
that Mrs R was having financial difficulties. The credit report that Moneyboat provided shows 
that Mrs R had a number of other short-term loans and open unsecured loans. I thought that 
the extent of Mrs Rs other borrowing should have alerted Moneyboat that she might be 
having difficulties managing her money. And knowing this information, I didnt think 
Moneyboat should reasonably have concluded that Mrs R could repay loan 3 in a 
sustainable way.
I thought that Moneyboat should also reasonably have been aware that Mrs Rs financial 
position wasnt substantially improving, when she applied for loans 4 and 5. 
It seems Mrs R applied for a loan of £350 with Moneyboat whilst she was still repaying loan 3. This application was declined but she then repaid loan 3 and her further application to 
borrow a lower amount (£250), loan 4, was agreed. The credit check Moneyboat carried out 
around this time also showed that Mrs R still had other short-term loans open. And she took 
her fourth loan immediately after repaying her previous loan. Mrs R then doubled her lending 
with loan 5, again taking the loan a fairly short time after repaying loan 4. Her credit report 
continued to show that she was also committed to repaying other short-term loans. I thought 
all of this should reasonably have caused some concerns for Moneyboat and indicated that 
Mrs R might be continuing to experience problems managing her money and needed to 
refinance her loans on a regular basis.
Taking everything into account - including Mrs Rs borrowing and repayment behaviour, and 
her repeated attempts to secure further borrowing - I thought ought reasonably to have 
suggested to the lender that it was likely that Mrs R was borrowing further to manage the 
gaps in her finances created when she repaid previous loans. And that her indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably. So I didnt think Moneyboat was right to provide Mrs R with 
loans 3, 4 or 5.
By the time Mrs R took loan 6, I thought Moneyboat should have reasonably foreseen that 
further lending was unsustainable or otherwise harmful. Setting aside the seven months gap 
between loans 2 and 3, Mrs R had still been indebted to Moneyboat for about 10 months. 
She had made around 15 loan applications to Moneyboat in that time, 6 of which had been 
funded. And the amount she was borrowing wasnt substantially decreasing.
I thought by then the overall pattern of lending suggested Mrs R had become persistently 
reliant on Moneyboats lending. I thought it should have been clear to the lender that at this 
point, Mrs R was no longer borrowing to meet a short-term, emergency need, but that she 
was most likely borrowing to keep up with her ongoing financial commitments. And as a 
responsible lender, Moneyboat should have reasonably questioned whether it should 
continue to offer further short-term loans to this consumer, whose repeated borrowing 
suggested that by then, she had become reliant on its short-term loans - which the rules and 
guidance made clear should only be for a short-term purpose. So I didnt think Moneyboat 
should have agreed to provide Mrs R with loan 6 or any further loans.
In summary, I said I wasnt intending to uphold Mrs Rs complaint about loans 1 and 2. But I 
didnt think Moneyboat should have provided loans 3 to 12 and so the lender needed to put 
things right. 
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. Ive not seen any 
response to my provisional decision from either Mrs R or Moneyboat. The deadline for any 
further responses has now passed. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Given that Ive not received any further evidence or comment that changes my mind about 
this complaint, I confirm the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.
I dont uphold Mrs Rs complaint about loans 1 and 2. But Moneyboat shouldnt have 
provided loans 3 to 12. So Moneyboat needs to put things right. 
Putting things right
Moneyboat should:
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mrs R on loans 3 to 12 (that haven't already 
been refunded);
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement. HM Revenue and Customs requires 
Moneyboat to take tax off this interest. Moneyboat must give Mrs R a certificate 
showing how much tax its deducted if she asks for one; 
remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs Rs credit file in relation loans 3, 4 
and 5. The number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 to 12 should be 
removed from Mrs Rs credit file.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Rs complaint in part and direct Evergreen Finance 
London Ltd trading as Moneyboat to put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2020.
