K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) acted 
irresponsibly when lending to him. 
He said the loan repayments were  such a burden that he struggled  to meet his normal 
household expenses like utility bills, food and rent. 
Mr M feels he should never have been  given these unaffordable loans. He wants  a refund of 
the interest and any extra  charges he paid  plus interest  on the amount hes owed. 
background
Between January 2015 and July 2016  Sunny provided Mr M with nine instalment loans. 
When they were arranged, all these loans were originally due to be repaid by six monthly 
repayments. Mr M took out loans that ranged between £100  and £750. 
All the loans  have been settled. 
Heres a table setting out details of those loans:
Loan Date  Taken Date Repaid Amount Repayment
1 24/01/2015 31/07/2015 £750.00 £250.12
2 19/10/2015 24/11/2015 £300.00 £100.08
3 02/12/2015 24/05/2016 £600.00 £188.93
4 13/01/2016 15/06/2016 £400.00 £115.82 
5 14/03/2016 16/05/2016 £250.00 £71.78 
6 18/05/2016 15/06/2016 £100.00 £33.36
7 23/06/2016 28/07/2017 £650.00 £198.98
8 15/06/2016 28/07/2017 £200.00 £57.37
9 10/07/2016 28/07/2017 £200.00 £59.52
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ms complaint and thought loans 5 through  to 9 shouldnt have 
been lent to Mr M. 
Sunny disagreed so the complaint comes  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it shouldve carried  out proportionate  checks to make sure Mr M could repay 
the loans in a sustainable manner. These  checks could take into account  a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN42580222But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties. And in particular, the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments - as well as without having to borrow  to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Taking all this into account, Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and 
information provided and thought about  what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Sunny has told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr M. It asked Mr M to provide  
details of his income  and to tell Sunny what he normally  spent  each month. And Sunny also 
carried out checks on Mr Ms credit file. 
I think that the checks Sunny did before agreeing  the first four loans were proportionate. Mr M 
paid loan 1 before taking  out loan 2, and he settled loan 2 before taking out loan 3. There wasnt 
anything to suggest that he was finding it difficult to repay  these loans. I can see that he took out 
loan 4 before hed finished paying loan 3. But even when considering the combined repayments 
Mr M had to make for both these loans, I think the amount was still relatively  affordable for him 
looking at what it appears hed told Sunny about his income and expenditure. 
Overall, given the repayment amounts,  what was apparent about Mr Ms circumstances at 
the time,  and his borrowing  history with the lender,  I dont  think it wouldve been 
proportionate for Sunny  to ask him for the amount  of information that would be needed to 
show the lending  was unsustainable  before agreeing the first four loans. 
Ref: DRN42580223But when he asked  for his fifth loan I think Sunny shouldve  been concerned that this wasnt  
affordable for Mr M. I say this because, when Mr M took out loan 5, he still had to make  the 
monthly repayments for loans 3 and 4 as well. It appears that the combined monthly 
repayments for all these loans together came  to around £376. Looking at the figures Sunny 
collected, this was a significant  proportion of Mr Ms monthly income   and more than half 
his declared disposable income. 
Ive taken into account that Sunny  says Mr M still wouldve had at least £300  monthly  
disposable income left. But I dont think its likely that, realistically,  this was sufficient for him 
to be able to sustainably pay for this borrowing. The income and expenditure figures  Sunny  
collected give a useful snapshot of his main costs  - but dont cover everything that Mr M 
wouldve likely needed to spend money  on. When looking at this loan application, I think  
Sunny needed  to bear in mind that Mr M was expecting  to be paying  loan 5 for six months. 
So I dont  think it was reasonable  for Sunny to provide loan 5 to Mr M. I think it shouldve 
realised that this loan,  and further  loans, werent sustainable for Mr M.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M to see if there was 
a point at which Sunny reasonably shouldve seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. Thats  when Sunny shouldve realised that it shouldnt  have  provided  any 
further loans.  
I think by loan 7 Sunny should reasonably have seen that further  lending  was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. I say this because:
by this point, except for a short gap after loan 1, Mr M had been borrowing almost  
continually for around 14 months.  So Sunny shouldve seen that it was likely Mr M had 
needed to keep taking new loans to cover the hole left by repaying  each earlier  loan 
this suggests that Mr M couldnt  sustainably afford to repay what he had borrowed 
without borrowing again  
Mr Ms first (and the biggest  single) loan was for £750. Loan 7 was £650  the second 
largest single amount  he borrowed in one go. So by now, Sunny ought to have known 
that Mr M probably  wasnt borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in income but to meet  
an ongoing  need. And that he was having  problems managing his money and wasnt  
using the loans for their intended  purpose  
by loan 7, Mr M had paid a considerable amount of interest to Sunny to effectively  
service debt over an extended  period. 
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 7 
onwards when:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time  
the number of loans  was likely  to have a negative impact on Mr Ms ability to access 
mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 through to 9 and Sunny should put things right.
Ref: DRN42580224putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do 
Refund any interest and charges applied to loans 5 through  to loan 9. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information on Mr Ms credit file in relation to loans 5 and 6.
The number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards  means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries  about loans  7 to 9 should be removed from Mr Ms credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should pay Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 December  2019.
