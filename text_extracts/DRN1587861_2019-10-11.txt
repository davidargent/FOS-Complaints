K822xcomplaint
Mr N complains that after hed arrange to switch  his current  account to a new account hed 
opened at National  Westminster Bank  Plc, it decided to close his account and didnt cancel 
the switching process.
background 
On 7 June 2018, Mr N opened  a NatWest current account. Mr Ns application was approved  
and NatWest issued  him with a debit card, PIN and online banking access. 
Mr N used NatWests Current Account Switch Guarantee  Service to move  his existing 
account with another  bank, which I will refer to as bank B to his newly opened  NatWest  
account on 7 June 2018. This meant NatWest contacted bank B and to arrange  the transfer 
of Mr Ns regular payments and outstanding balance to be transferred to his new account
On 8 June 2018, NatWest  received  the account  switch information from bank B and let Mr N 
know that it expected the account switch  to be completed by 15 June 2018.
Following receipt of his application, NatWest conducted credit  and security  checks. As a 
result of these checks, on 14 June  2018,  NatWest decided to close  Mr Ns accounts 
immediately. As the Switch process had already  been instigated, bank B were in the process 
of sending the balance of Mr Ns account across to NatWest. As this payment went to a 
closed account,  it was rejected and returned to bank B. 
On 15 June 2018, Mr N contacted NatWest  to try and locate his account balance.  NatWest 
made enquires with its switching team  to try and locate Mr Ns money and responded to 
requests from bank B who was also looking for Mr Ns funds. On 20 June 2018, bank B 
confirmed Mr Ns account balance had been  returned to them.  
Mr N says NatWest  should have told bank B that it had decided to close his account  and 
cancel the account switch. Mr N says he wasnt told where his money was and it was left 
hanging in the balance  between the two banks.  He says this meant he had no money to pay 
for everyday expenses. And he had to spend  several hours on the phone  trying to sort things  
out. Mr N says this all caused him a great  deal of stress which meant  he couldnt go to work. 
And he wants NatWest to pay him compensation.
Mr N complained to NatWest. It said it hadnt  done anything wrong and had acted in 
accordance with the terms  and conditions when it closed Mr Ns account.  NatWest said the 
switch process was correctly followed and at that time, it couldnt have been aware that his 
account would not be opened to allow the funds  to credit. It was only once the credit and 
security checks  were  completed,  that NatWest  decided it could not offer Mr N an account.  
NatWest also said that once a Current Account Switch has been initiated, the process 
cannot be cancelled  as any switching process  already completed cannot be reversed. 
NatWest said it hadnt  done anything wrong,  but it recognised Mr N had been  caused some 
inconvenience trying  to find out where his money was. So it offered to pay him £50 as a 
gesture of goodwill. Mr N didnt accept this offer. He says its not enough to reflect the 
distress and inconvenience hes suffered as a result  of not being  able to access  his money.  
So he brought his complaint to our service.
Ref: DRN15878612An investigator looked into Mr Ns complaint  and said NatWest hadnt done  anything wrong 
when it decided to close Mr Ns account. And said NatWest had acted  in accordance  with 
the terms and conditions when it stopped the switching process. She said NatWest never 
received Mr Ns money from bank B, and that due to the account closure the funds bounced  
back to bank B, via an intermediary bank. So it wouldnt be fair to hold NatWest responsible 
for any delays. 
Mr N disagreed. As no agreement could  be reached the matter has come to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr N feels very strongly about  his complaint. He is adamant that NatWest  should have let 
bank B know it had decided to close  his account.  And says if it had done  so, bank B wouldnt 
have tried to transfer  his account balance. Whilst I appreciate Mr Ns frustration,  its 
important to point  out that the only thing in question here is whether NatWest  has done what 
it should have  done. And I think it has. Ill explain why.
Ive looked at the terms and conditions of Mr Ns account, which sets out that when a 
customer makes  an application for an account, NatWest will complete identity verification 
and fraud  prevention checks, to decide  whether to offer a customer  banking  services. And if 
as a result  of these  checks, fraud is detected,  NatWest may refuse to provide financial 
services or stop providing existing services  to a customer.  
Businesses are required to record matters of fact and as a consequence NatWest  was 
entitled to take action  based on the information provided in response to its checks. NatWest 
is also entitled to decide who it wishes to do business with as a customer.  And can make 
commercial decisions about  who it offers banking services to. They  cannot  unfairly  
discriminate against  a customer.  But they can say they no longer wish to do business with 
individuals. Thats because theyve got the commercial freedom to decide  who they want to 
contract with.
The terms and conditions  of the account set out that under certain circumstances NatWest 
can close a customers account immediately. Having looked at the evidence,  Im satisfied  
NatWest exercised its commercial discretion legitimately when it decided to close Mr Ns 
account. And it acted  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the account.  So I cant 
say NatWest did anything  wrong by closing Mr Ns account as it did.
Ive taken carefully into account  everything that Mr N has told us  and I can appreciate his 
point of view.  But Ive also taken into account  that NatWests policy  is to open an account  on 
application and then complete further  checks. This is explained in its terms and conditions.  
And under section  3.4 of the switching terms and conditions NatWest can stop or suspend  
redirection activities in certain  circumstances. 
Ive looked at the information NatWest received in response to its checks  and I can 
understand NatWests  concerns. I can also see that NatWest spoke to Mr N on 14 June 
2018, and wrote to him to tell him that his account  had been closed. NatWest  also explained 
that this was as a result of security  and fraud  checks it had completed.  So I dont think  
NatWest has treated Mr N unfairly  or unreasonably  when it decided  to stop the switch 
process from completing.
Ref: DRN15878613Mr N says he didnt know where  his money  was during this process.  And says it was left 
hanging in the balance  between two banks. But I can see from looking at NatWests activity  
report that NatWest did all it could  to try and help locate Mr Ns funds by making enquiries 
with its switching department and responding to requests from bank B. And it kept Mr N 
updated with what it was doing.  So I think NatWest  did what Id expect it to do in this 
situation.  
I understand why Mr N feels that it would be better  if NatWest  completed its security checks  
before opening  new accounts.  And that he thinks NatWest should  have contacted  bank B to 
let it know it had closed  his account.  But we are not the regulator and I cant ask NatWest to 
change its systems or processes. That is a matter for the Financial Conduct Authority.
In summary,  NatWest were  entitled  to rely on the information it received from the checks it 
completed as part of its account opening  process. And Im satisfied that it acted in 
accordance with the terms  and conditions when it stopped the account  switching  process 
and closed Mr Ns account.  So I cant say NatWest has done anything  wrong.  And Im not 
going to ask NatWest  to do anything.
I note that NatWest has offered to pay £50 as a gesture of goodwill.  I leave it up to Mr N to 
decide whether  he wants  to accept this offer. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 November  2019.
