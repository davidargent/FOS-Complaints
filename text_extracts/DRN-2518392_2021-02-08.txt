The complaint
Mr B complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) unfairly placed limitations on his 
account and withheld his funds. 
  
What happened
Mr B had an account registered with PayPal. In October 2019, PayPal made the decision to 
place a limitation on the account without giving Mr B a reason. He complained, and PayPal 
said Mr B had violated its acceptable use policy and so it had placed the limitation on his 
account in line with the terms of its User Agreement. 
An investigator looked into Mr Bs complaint and upheld it. She said PayPal had acted fairly 
when placing limitations on the account, but said it had withheld the balance for longer than 
it shouldve. She recommended PayPal pay Mr B £50 compensation for the inconvenience 
caused, plus 8% simple interest on the balance until it was released.
Mr B agreed to the investigators findings. PayPal didnt respond and so the complaint has 
been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I uphold this complaint  Ill explain why.
PayPals User Agreement sets out the terms of the account. This says if PayPal has 
concerns about how its customer is using their account, it can make the decision to close or 
limit it  and it isnt required to provide its customer with a reason why. 
PayPal placed a limitation on the account. Im satisfied it took these steps in line with its 
terms. And ultimately PayPal is entitled to make business decisions about who it provides a 
service to.
Ive gone on to consider whether PayPal acted fairly when withholding funds. PayPals User 
Agreement says it can withhold any funds when it places a limitation on the account. 
However I would expect to see PayPal to fairly apply these terms in the circumstances of Mr 
Bs case. And I dont think it would be fair for PayPal to withhold these funds without good 
reason.
Our investigator asked PayPal for details about why it held the funds for the time that it did. 
She didnt think PayPal provided a persuasive reason for this and upheld the complaint. Ive 
considered this and I agree with the outcome she reached. Furthermore, PayPal didnt 
respond with anything further.
So, Im not satisfied PayPal acted fairly when withholding the funds from Mr B for as long as 
it did. Mr B didnt have use of the money in question for several months, during which time 
hes said he had a specific need for it. 
In the circumstances of this case, Im directing PayPal to pay Mr B £50 compensation for the 
inconvenience caused. PayPal will also need to pay 8% simple interest on the balance of the 
account from the time it applied the limitation, up until the funds were released to him. 
 
My final decision
 I uphold this complaint and require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay Mr B:
8% simple interest on the balance for the time the money was withheld; and
£50 for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2021.
