K820x#14complaint
Mrs R complains about how NewDay Ltd has managed a store branded  credit  card account 
which she holds.
background
Mrs R says that she has a store branded  credit  card. She said shed been  making  payments 
onto the card, but the money wasnt arriving where it was supposed to be. 
Mrs R said that she thought that the problem had been caused when NewDay  started to 
operate this card for the store. She said that when this change happened,  NewDay didnt tell 
her that she needed  to amend any payment details. The sort code and account number 
stayed the same. But she said that the payments  she was making werent credited to her 
account. And now she was being  asked to pay money she didnt owe.
Mrs R said that an amount of £955 that she paid was sent back  to her account, but NewDay  
had kept it for a month.  And the sum of £1,000 hadnt been returned. She thought that 
NewDay had cancelled  her previous  direct  debit for £50, and she didnt think that interest 
shouldve been  applied when shed tried to pay off her account in full. In frustration, she 
brought her complaint  to us.
NewDay said that Mrs R had made two payments onto her card,  of £955 at the end of May 
and £1,000 at the end of June.  It had rejected both of those payments. The payment  of £955 
was rejected on 23 May 2018 and the payment of £1,000 was rejected on 21 June 2018.
NewDay said that the problem was that Mrs R wasnt using the right reference number with 
her payments. She was supposed  to use her card account number as the payment 
reference. NewDay said that it tells its customers this on the back of their statements. But 
the reference Mrs R was using didnt mention any numbers, it just quoted  the name of the 
store. That meant NewDay  didnt  know who was paying it, and which  card account it should 
apply the payment to. NewDay said that Mrs R had done this a number of times before, and 
it sent us evidence of earlier payment reversals. 
NewDay said it had explained  to Mrs R that she would need to change  her payment 
reference. NewDay asked  Mrs R to contact her bank to see if the money shed sent had 
been paid back  to her. 
NewDay also said that it had correctly charged interest  on Mrs Rs account at the start of 
June, because she hadnt paid the full balance then, shed only paid the minimum payment. 
It said it had made refunds of interest in a similar situation before, but it wouldnt do that now.  
NewDay didnt think it had done anything wrong. 
NewDay also said that Mrs Rs direct debit  wasnt set to pay £50, as shed claimed, it was 
set to pay the minimum payment for her card. It showed us a screenshot  of the direct debit 
which was set up on her account.
Mrs R then wrote to us again to say NewDay was now saying her account was over £400 in 
credit. NewDay agreed to pay the credit on Mrs Rs card account back to Mrs R but Mrs R 
said she hadnt received that. 
Ref: DRN76763192Our investigator didnt  uphold this complaint. She said that the large payments that Mrs R 
had sent to NewDay had both been  returned, so she didnt think  that money was still 
missing. And NewDay had agreed  to put the credit amount on Mrs Rs card into her bank 
account very soon.  Our investigator  didnt think NewDay  needed  to do any more than that. 
Mrs R said that the payment of £1,000 hadnt been sent back  to her bank, it had actually 
been put into her NewDay  account.  And she said that neither NewDay  or the store  would 
pay her this money back. So her only choice was to spend it. She said that her spending had 
brought that £1,000 down  to the current level of around £250  credit.  She didnt think that our 
response had given her complaint the credibility it deserved. 
Our investigator said she now understood from Mrs R that the money wasnt  returned to her 
bank, as NewDay had said, but paid into her store card account. But either way, the money 
wasnt missing.  And our investigator said that the problem was that NewDay  wouldnt accept 
a payment which just used the store name as a reference. 
Mrs R said that we hadnt understood her complaint. She said that she was still paying the 
store. And she was using the details  on the back of the card.  She said that those were the 
only details she had. 
Mrs R also said she hadnt cancelled her direct debit. The only difference  when NewDay  
took over the card was that its name  was on the top of the statements. She said that the 
payments she had made had sat in her store account, and at the same time she was 
accruing interest  on her NewDay account.  Those payments shouldve  been paid to NewDay.  
Mrs R said that this had all gone  wrong,  because when  NewDay took over her store card, it 
didnt tell her that she had to change the payment  details she was using. Thats why the 
money was sitting in a different account,  which she couldnt touch, while  her card was being  
charged interest. She said that she wanted  compensation from NewDay for this, and she 
was angry  that we hadnt understood her explanations. 
Mrs R also said that her store card was no longer in credit, but that money wasnt  in her 
bank account.  She wanted to know where  it had gone. And she said that once she received 
it, she was just going to close  the store card account. Mrs R then wrote to us again, to say 
that she had now received  the money in her bank account.
Because Mrs R didnt agree with our investigator,  the case  was passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive reached the same overall conclusion  
on this complaint as our investigator, and for broadly  the same reasons.
Mrs R receives  a regular statement from NewDay. On the second-last  page of that 
statement (usually page 5 of 6) there is a section titled  How to make a payment . 
If Mrs R rings her bank,  and asks it to make  a payment, then the bank doesnt use the direct 
debit details that it holds for this card. She has to provide the right details to the bank. So 
that section of Mrs Rs statement explains that if Mrs R wants  to make a manual payment by 
transferring money  herself from her bank  then she will need to use the bank account and 
Ref: DRN76763193sort code  details provided. It also says Please ensure you quote your account reference  
shown above  as the payment reference. Thats a sixteen digit number. Mrs Rs account  
reference ends  with 5368. 
Mrs R has told us she has two accounts,  one with the name  of the store, and one for 
NewDay. She said that she was using the details on her card,  and this meant  money was 
paid into her store account. She said then it would just sit there, where  she couldnt touch it. 
It shouldve been  moved into her NewDay  account. But she said that NewDay and the store 
just werent joined up. 
I know that Mrs R has been very frustrated,  because she says we havent  understood what 
she is saying about the problems shes facing.  But my understanding  of how payments  to a 
credit or a store card would work  is different to Mrs R. Id like to set out my understanding  of 
how those payments work.
Mrs R referred  to money she has paid sitting in her store account. But the bank account  and 
sort code  provided  on Mrs Rs statements for payments are the same for all the store card 
accounts NewDay manages. The account she is sending money to isnt Mrs Rs store 
account. Its one shared  account, just for payments in. Everybody  who has this store card 
pays into that same bank account. 
Of course,  that means  an awful lot of payments are arriving into the same account.  NewDay  
relies on the payment reference attached to each of those payments, to tell which  store card 
account it needs to send  each payment to. 
Thats not just something which NewDay does. This is the usual approach  for payments to 
store cards and for credit cards.
NewDay has told us that Mrs R hasnt  been  quoting the right payment reference. So 
NewDay doesnt know, when a payment from her arrives, which card account to send the 
money to. 
If the right reference isnt used, NewDay can try to find out where the money has come from, 
and send it to the right store card.  But thats  a slow and time-consuming process. NewDay 
has done that in the past for Mrs R. But recently,  its also sent some of her payments back.  
NewDay said that it had explained to Mrs R a number of times that she would need  to 
change the payment reference she was using. Mrs R doesnt seem to have done that. 
I dont think NewDay has done  anything wrong. If it receives  a payment without a store card 
account number  as the reference, then it will try to find out whose  card it needs to pay, or 
send the money  back. If it doesnt  make  the payment  onto the card, then I dont think thats 
its fault. Its because of the missing reference. 
So if someone makes a payment like this, and the money doesnt  reach  their card,  I think 
that NewDay can then charge  interest  on the card. I dont think  thats  a mistake.  
I know that Mrs R says that NewDay has taken a long time to sort out her payments, and 
either put the money onto her card account  or pay it back to her. But I also think that its 
likely to take some time, in these circumstances, for the money either  to reach  the store card 
account, or to be paid back  to the customers bank  account. Again,  I think  this is because  of 
the missing reference.  I dont think that NewDay is primarily responsible for that.
Ref: DRN76763194Mrs R said that NewDay  had changed the payment arrangements when it took over from the 
previous operator  of this store card, and it hadnt  told her. NewDay started to operate this 
card in early  2014. So I dont think I can decide that its more likely than not that Mrs Rs 
recent problems are related to that change. But even if they were, I dont think  it would be 
right to say that NewDay hasnt told Mrs R how to make  a payment. Ive mentioned where on 
her statements Mrs R can find the payment details  for her card account. 
Mrs R also said that NewDay had changed  her direct debit. She said it was previously set up 
to take £50 per month. But Ive seen the internal screens from NewDays system, where the 
direct debit was set up. It has been  set to take the minimum payment since January 2017.  
Ive not seen anything to suggest to me that NewDay made this change without Mrs Rs 
agreement.  
Mrs R said that NewDay  hadnt  paid some of the money back  to her bank account, it had put 
it onto her card account instead. Shed spent some of that money, but she wanted  the rest to 
be paid back to her. I understand that this took longer than NewDay had suggested, but 
Mrs R has now confirmed that she has received that payment back. I think that NewDay is 
doing something that is outside of what it would normally do, as part of the day to day 
management of Mrs Rs card. So, although  its disappointing that it took NewDay  longer than 
it said to do that, I dont think that NewDay  has to pay compensation to Mrs R just because  
of this. 
I know that Mrs R will be disappointed, but I dont think  that her complaint against NewDay 
should be upheld.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 April 2019.
