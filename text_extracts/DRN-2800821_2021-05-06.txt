The complaint
Mrs D complains that Aviva Insurance Limited unfairly increased the price of her home 
insurance policy over an eight-year period.
Mrs D is represented by her son, Mr D.
  
What happened
Mrs D took out her policy in 2010, through her bank. The policy was underwritten by Aviva 
and it set the price from inception. The bank administered the policy until 2014, but Aviva 
then took over the policys administration.
In 2019, Mr D complained about the premiums Mrs D had been paying after he was able to 
get a much cheaper quote for her elsewhere. 
Whilst investigating the complaint, Aviva discovered that when it took over the administration 
of the policy, it incorrectly included a 2006 claim. As a result, Mrs D had been overcharged 
since 2014. Aviva refunded the overcharged amount (£906), with interest  which came to 
£1,161. 
After the deduction of the £906 already refunded, Mrs Ds premium had the following 
journey:
- The policy cost £362 when it was first taken out in 2010. When the policy renewed in 
2011, the premium increased by about 6%
- Between 2012 and 2015, the policy increased each year by about: 73%, 71%, 56%, 
and 47%. In 2015, the premium had risen to £2,616.
- In 2016, the premium fell by about 51% to £1,290. 
- The premium then increased again in 2017 and 2018 by about: 1% and 0.5%. In 
2018, at the last renewal, the premium was £1,309.
When responding to the complaint, Aviva explained that since mid-2012, it had been rating 
the property as a high flood risk. Aviva named the source of the risk and explained it didnt 
have any information to suggest the property was benefitting from flood defences. Aviva 
explained that between 2012 and 2016, the premiums charged were appropriate for the 
overall risk (once the recent refund had been deducted). 
Aviva explained that since the 2016 renewal, Aviva has been able to cede the flood risk for 
Mrs Ds property to the Flood Re scheme (which was launched earlier that year to enable 
accessible and affordable flood cover). Aviva says this is why her renewal premium then 
reduced.
Aviva acknowledged that Mr D had been able to find alternative quotes for Mrs Ds property, 
for about £400 a year. However, Aviva said it would have been extremely unlikely that such 
quotes would have been available before the launch of the Flood Re scheme.
Mr D remained unhappy, so he contacted our service. One of our investigators considered 
the complaint, but she didnt think Aviva needed to refund anything further. Because Mr D 
disagreed, Mrs Ds complaint was passed to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision, explaining I intended to uphold the complaint in part. In my 
provisional decision I said:
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
I dont have the power to tell an insurer how to price risk and what an insurance policy 
should have cost. I would be, in effect, determining or telling a business how it should 
operate  and thats not my role. But I can decide whether Aviva treated Mrs D fairly 
throughout the period she held her insurance policy.
In my view, there are three periods to consider. These are: 2010 to 2011; 2012 to 2015; and 
2016 to 2018. I will address these three periods in turn.
2010 to 2011
To attract new business, its common for a new policy to include a new customer discount. 
The insurer will usually recoup the discount over the years, by retaining the customer and 
increasing their premium to bring it in line with its standard pricing model.
Aviva says, due to the passage of time, it cant confirm if a discount was applied to Mrs Ds 
policy when it was first taken out. However, given what this service knows about the pricing 
of new policies, and that Mrs Ds policy increased by less than £20 on the first renewal, Im 
not persuaded I can reasonably decide Aviva unfairly increased her premium in 2011.
2012 to 2015
Aviva says the reason the premium increased so significantly during this period, was due to 
it rating Mrs Ds property a high flood risk. Mr D disputes the property was at risk of flooding. 
However, its not for me to decide what level of flood risk the property posed, or how Aviva 
should have determined the risk. 
Insurers assess and treat risk differently, and an insurer will base its premiums on its own 
assessment of risk. An insurer may decide its taking a significant risk insuring a particular 
property, whereas another insurer might not  and there will generally be different factors 
and reasons for each insurers decision. I dont have the power to tell an insurer what its 
assessment of risk should be.
Aviva has told us that since 2012, its flood mapping model has rated Mrs Ds property as 
being at a significant risk of flood, and had she approached Aviva as a new customer, it 
wouldnt have offered her cover.
Aviva says, as per the Association of British Insurers (ABI) agreed Statement of Principles, 
which was published in 2008 after significant floods, Aviva continued to offer cover to Mrs D 
with premiums that reflected the increased risk.Aviva has also explained that, it recognised its policyholders who were now considered to be 
at significant risk, wouldnt be able to shop around, as other insurers would likely decline to 
offer cover. So, to treat them fairly, Aviva didnt increase their premiums in one go. Instead, 
Aviva steadily increased their premiums over time. This is why Mrs Ds premium continued 
increasing between 2012 and 2015. Aviva says, as a result, her premiums during this time 
were significantly below the full cost of insuring the risk.
An insurers view of risk, and how it assesses and prices risk, evolves over time. Aviva was 
entitled to change the way it assesses flood risk, and based on the information this service 
has seen, I consider it more likely than not, the premiums it charged Mrs D between 2012 
and 2015 were fair. 
2016 to 2018
Although Mrs Ds premium reduced significantly in 2016 after Aviva ceded the flood risk for 
her property to the Flood Re scheme, it was still 234% higher than the last premium before 
Aviva rated the property to be at significant risk of flooding. So, given Aviva had ceded the 
flood risk for Mrs Ds property (i.e. the cause of the premium increase between 2012 and 
2015), and home insurance prices had remained relatively stable since 2011, I would 
reasonably expect Mrs Ds premium to have returned to that previous level, plus an 
additional amount for the cost of ceding the flood risk. 
Based on my exchanges with Aviva, even once the Flood Re charges and higher insurance 
premium tax in 2016, 2017 and 2018 have been accounted for, theres still a significant 
difference between the 2011 and the 2016, 2017 and 2018 premiums.
As Aviva will be aware, where an insurer knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that its 
policyholder wasnt engaging with the renewals process, it should have taken care to make 
sure it treated them fairly  and that it didnt take advantage of the policyholders behaviour 
by increasing their premiums just because they didnt engage with the cost. We generally 
consider an insurer ought reasonably to have known its policyholder wasnt engaging by 
their fifth renewal, which for Mrs D was in 2015. Theres no indication that Mrs D had 
engaged with the cost of her policy before 2019.
To put matters right, I intend to decide Aviva should recalculate the 2016, 2017 and 2018 
premiums by following the below method, for each year:
-(A + B) + C
-A = the 2011 premium, less the insurance premium tax for that year and the amount 
charged for flood risk
-B = the cost of ceding the flood risk to the Flood Re scheme (which for Mrs Ds 
property was £330 in 2016 and 2017, and £335 in 2018)
-C = insurance premium tax, at the applicable rate for that year
Aviva will need to refund Mrs D the difference between the three recalculated premiums and 
the premiums she actually paid, plus 8% simple interest per year (less tax if applicable) from 
the date of each instalment until the date the settlement is made.
Aviva accepted my provisional decision. However, it explained it doesnt have a breakdown 
of the premiums before it took over the administration of the policy in 2014. So, it couldnt 
determine what proportion of the 2011 premium was to provide flood cover (which was 
required for part A of my proposed redress calculation). Mr D also responded. He again questioned whether the property was at risk of flooding and 
asked for the evidence Aviva had relied on. Mr D also asked why he was recently able to 
obtain a quote from Aviva, for Mrs Ds property, for £432. He also noted Mrs D hasnt yet 
cashed the cheque for the previous £906 refund.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I acknowledge Mr D remains unhappy that, since 2012, Aviva has been rating the property to 
be at a significant risk of flooding. However, Aviva has named the source of the risk and its 
explained there was a change to its flood mapping model. As explained in my provisional 
decision, Aviva was entitled to change its assessment of risk. I dont consider that Aviva 
needs to provide anything further in respect of the 2012 to 2015 premium. 
Mr D points towards a recent quote from Aviva, for £432, for Mrs Ds property. However, as 
explained in my provisional decision, I would reasonably expect the cost of her cover after 
2016, to be much lower than the premiums she was charged. This is because, since that 
time, Aviva has been able to cede the flood risk to the Flood Re scheme. The redress 
calculation I set out in my provisional decision seeks to put that matter right. 
I appreciate the £432 quote will be lower than the recalculated premiums for 2016 to 2018. 
However, I consider it likely that Mr Ds recent quote was benefitting from a new customer 
discount. In any event, I remain of the view that the proposed method for recalculating 
Mrs Ds premiums for 2016 to 2018, is fair and reasonable.
That said, in view of Avivas comments about not having a breakdown of the policy premium 
before it took over the policys administration in 2014, Ive adjusted the calculation. Aviva 
doesnt know the amount charged for flood risk in 2011. However, I consider it fair for an 
amount to still be deducted from part A of the calculation, to acknowledge some of the 
premium would have been for flood risk. In the absence of the true figure, and in the 
interests of fairness, I consider that Aviva should simply deduct 10%. 
So, to put matters right, Aviva should recalculate the 2016, 2017 and 2018 premiums by 
following the below method, for each year:
- (A + B) + C
- A = the 2011 premium, less the insurance premium tax for that year and 10% of the 
2011 premium
- B = the cost of ceding the flood risk to the Flood Re scheme (which for Mrs Ds 
property was £330 in 2016 and 2017, and £335 in 2018)
- C = insurance premium tax, at the applicable rate for that year
Aviva will need to refund Mrs D the difference between the three recalculated premiums and 
the premiums she actually paid, plus 8% simple interest per year (less tax if applicable) from 
the date of each instalment until the date the settlement is made.Finally, Mr D says the cheque for the initial refund (£906, plus interest) hasnt been cashed 
yet. Based on Avivas complaint response letter, it sent two cheques. A further amount was 
sent due to an error with the interest calculation. It follows that if these cheques havent yet 
been cashed, and they are no longer valid, then Mr D should discuss the matter with Aviva 
so it can cancel the cheques it sent and reissue the refund.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive set out above, and in my provisional decision, I uphold this complaint in 
part. My final decision is Aviva Insurance Limited should:
- recalculate the 2016, 2017 and 2018 premiums based on the updated method Ive 
outlined above; and
- pay Mrs D the difference between the recalculated premiums and the premiums paid 
in 2016, 2017, and 2018; plus 8% simple interest1 per year from the date of each 
instalment until the date the settlement is made
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 June 2021.

1If Aviva Insurance Limited considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income 
tax from any interest paid, it should tell Mrs D how much its taken off. If requested, it should also 
provide Mrs D with a certificate showing the amount deducted, so she can reclaim it from 
HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
