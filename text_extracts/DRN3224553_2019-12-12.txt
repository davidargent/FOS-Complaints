K820x#14complaint
Mr L complains  that Northern Bank Limited (trading as Danske Bank) didnt  send information  
about his account to credit reference agencies (CFAs)
background
Mr L said he opened an account with Danske Bank some years ago to improve his credit  
rating but hes now noticed that it didnt send any information about this account to the 
CRAs. Hes also concerned about  the way Danske  Bank has treated him.
Danske Bank said the account Mr L held was a standard account which didnt have credit 
facilities such as an overdraft. So it didnt  have any information to report.
Our investigator didnt  think Danske  Bank  had done  anything wrong. She said that credit 
reports only show credit  facilities and so Danske Bank wouldnt report the bank  account  Mr L 
held because it didnt  have an overdraft or a chequebook.
Mr L didnt agree with this and said all banks  report standard accounts.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
conclusion as our investigator  and theres very little I can add.
The account  Mr L held was a basic bank account without any credit facilities.  So Danske 
Bank isnt obliged to send  any information  about it to the CRAs. So I cant make it do that. 
And I cant comment on the practices  of other banks.   
Mr L said he wanted the way Danske Bank had treated him to be considered. But having 
looked at all the evidence from both parties  I cant see that its treatment of Mr L gives  any 
cause for concern.   
I know this is not the answer Mr L wants but I cant fairly find that Danske Bank has done  
anything wrong. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 January 2020.
