The complaint
Mr H complains about a fee he was charged by Santander UK Plc after he used his credit 
card to withdraw cash. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The credit card terms and conditions say Santander will apply a cash transaction fee 
when a card holder uses their credit card to purchase foreign currency. The terms 
also say Santander will charge interest. 
Santander has correctly applied the cash transaction fee and interest to Mr H's credit 
card account. I haven't seen any evidence that Santander has charged Mr H 
incorrectly. 
Details of the cash transaction fee and how interest is applied to cash transactions 
are set out in Santander's terms and conditions as well as on each monthly 
statement it sends card holders. I've reviewed Mr H's monthly statements and I'm 
satisfied they clearly explain what Santander will charge. 
Santander agreed to refund Â£50 of the cash handling fee as a gesture of goodwill. As 
I haven't found anything to show Santander made an error or treated Mr H unfairly, 
I'm not telling it to take any further action. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2020.
