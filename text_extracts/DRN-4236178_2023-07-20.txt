The complaint
Mr P complains that GE Money Consumer Lending Limited wont refund to him the money 
that he paid for some holiday club membership points. Hes being represented in his 
complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in May 2023 in which I described what had 
happened as follows:
Mr P and his partner had entered into an agreement for a trial membership of a 
holiday club and they entered into an acquisition agreement in May 2008 to buy 
some holiday club membership points. The total price of the membership points 
(including membership dues) was £18,487 and they traded in their trial membership 
which was given a value of £5,595 so the amount due from them was £12,892. Mr P 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with GE Money for a loan of that amount, to 
which £1,318.71 was added for a payment protection plan. Mr P agreed to make 120 
monthly payments of £220.24 to GE Money.
Mr P and his partner entered into another acquisition agreement in September 2008 
to buy some more holiday club membership points. The total price of those 
membership points was £11,499. The outstanding amount due from Mr P under the 
May 2008 loan was £13,639.12 and Mr P entered into another fixed sum loan 
agreement with GE Money for a loan of £25,138.12 to refinance the May 2008 loan 
and to pay the £11,499 to the holiday company. He agreed to make 120 monthly 
payments of £429.91 to GE Money. GE Money sold Mr Ps loan account to a third 
party debt collection company in September 2009 because of issues with the 
payments from Mr P.
Mr Ps representative made claims to GE Money in August 2017 under sections 75 
and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that Mr P had a claim for 
misrepresentation and that the misrepresentations and practices used in the sales 
presentation made the loan agreement unfair. GE Money didnt issue a substantive 
response to those claims so Mr P complained to this service. GE Money issued its 
final response to those claims in February 2022. It apologised for the delay in its 
response, which it said was due to an admin error, and it offered Mr P £50 by way of 
apology. It said that it was rejecting Mr Ps complaint without considering its merits 
because the events complained about had occurred more than six years ago and it 
also said that his section 140A was statute barred.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ps complaint should be upheld. He said 
that the September 2008 loan was transferred to the third party in September 2009 
and he thought that any claims in relation to that loan would first need to be made to 
the third party as it was the current owner of the loan. He said that GE Money would 
be responsible for Mr Ps claims about the May 2008 but that it looked to have ended 
in September 2008. He didnt think that GE Money acted unfairly by declining his 
misrepresentation claim and he thought that it was entitled to rely on the timing of his 
section 140A claim to turn it down.
Mr Ps representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It has provided information about Mr Ps financial difficulties and 
says that the third party hasnt responded to its correspondence so it wishes for GE 
Money to remain as the respondent. It has also provided a generic submission from 
counsel about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it used.
I said in my provisional decision: I agree with our investigator that Mr Ps complaint 
shouldnt be upheld but for these reasons:
Mr P didnt use credit provided by GE Money to pay for the trial membership so GE 
Money would have no liability to him under section 75 or 140A relating to that 
agreement;
Mr P used a loan from GE Money to pay for the membership points that he and his 
partner bought in May 2008  but that loan was refinanced in September 2008 when 
he and his partner bought some more membership points so I consider that the May 
2008 loan agreement ended in September 2008;
GE Money sold the account for Mr Ps September 2008 loan to the third party in 
September 2009 but it says that it remains responsible for any claims or complaints 
raised about the loan, so in this decision Im considering Mr Ps complaint about GE 
Moneys response to his section 75 and 140A claims about both the May and 
September 2008 purchases;
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ps complaint is that GE Money turned down the claims that hed made to it and I 
accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years of that happening 
- but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to his claims;
Mr Ps claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not GE Moneys response to those claims was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ps claim under section 75 is that the membership points were misrepresented to 
him and his partner and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, GE 
Money would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be 
entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr P could have made a claim to the holiday company or GE Money about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his partner into buying 
the membership points in September 2008 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made to them and any loss would have been 
incurred as that was when he also entered into the second loan agreement with GE 
Money;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or GE Money  but a claim wasnt made under section 75 until August 
2017, nearly nine years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act so I consider that GE Money has a defence to his section 75 claim and 
I find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have rejected that claim;
Mr Ps representative says that the misrepresentations and practices used in the 
sales presentation made the loan agreements unfair - section 140A gives a court the 
power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the 
debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship 
between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
GE Money says that the May 2008 loan ended in September 2008 as it was 
refinanced when Mr P entered into another loan but the evidence shows that the third 
party was communicating with Mr P about the outstanding balance of the September 
2008 loan last year so I dont consider that a court would conclude that his claim 
under section 140A was made too late and I consider that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for GE Money to have responded to that claim;
Mr Ps representative described in its August 2017 letter the misrepresentations that 
it said had been made by the holiday company, including that:
Mr P and his partner easily could divest themselves of the points membership 
by selling it, or renting out the rights purchased under it;
they could always recoup the cost of purchasing their points membership by 
selling it; and
they would be able to holiday at any resort they wished any time they wanted, 
with accommodation of the same standard as they had previously enjoyed;
Ive not been provided with all of the documents that Mr P and his partner would have 
signed in May and September 2008 but the documents that have been provided 
include the acquisition agreement, the terms and conditions and a members 
declaration for both the May and September 2008 purchases;
the members declaration that Mr P and his partner signed in May 2008 says: We 
understand that [the holiday company] does not and will not run any resale, rental or 
Re-purchase programmes; and: We understand that the purchase of our 
membership in vacation club is for the primary purpose of holidays and is not an 
investment in real estate and [the holiday company] makes no representation as to 
the future price or value of the Vacation Club Holiday product;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr P and his partner 
were told that they easily could divest themselves of the points membership by 
selling it or renting out the rights purchased under it or that they could recoup the 
cost of purchasing their membership points by selling them  and if that had been 
said to them I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them not to have signed the members declaration and to have asked the holiday company for more 
information about those issues;
the acquisition agreement that Mr P and his partner signed in May 2008 under which 
they purchased 1,500 point rights says: This is the number of points that will be 
credited to us on 1st January each Use Year ; and the members declaration also 
says: We understand that [the holiday company Travel] aims to provide personal 
service to our members and its prices will be comparable to but not necessarily 
cheaper than other providers of the same services;
Mr P and his partner used their membership points for seven holidays between 
September 2008 and September 2012 but Ive seen no evidence to show that they 
complained to the holiday company about those issues until August 2017 and, if 
there had been issues with the availability and quality of the accommodation, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted the holiday 
company about those issues sooner than they did;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr P and his partner 
were told that they would be able to holiday at any resort they wished any time they 
wanted, with accommodation of the same standard as they had previously enjoyed;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership was 
misrepresented to Mr P and his partner or that they were induced into entering into 
the acquisition agreements by misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
Mr Ps representative says that the practices used in the sales presentation made the 
loan agreement unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr P and his partner 
were unduly pressurised into buying the membership points in May and September 
2008, that Mr P was unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreements or that 
the holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices against them  Ive 
seen no evidence to show that Mr P complained to GE Money about those issues 
until August 2017 (more than nine years after the first loan had been made to him) 
and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained to GE 
Money about any such issues before then;
Mr P and his partner had bought a trial membership which they traded in towards the 
cost of some membership points in May 2008 and they then bought more 
membership points in September 2008  if they were concerned about the sales 
practices that had been used by the holiday company when selling them the trial 
membership or the membership points in May 2008, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them not to have then bought more membership points from 
the holiday company in September 2008;
Mr Ps representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company and the unfair terms that it used but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in the agreements that were signed by 
Mr P and his partner were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr P and his partner and I 
consider it be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr P and GE Money;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Ps relationship with 
GE Money was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude 
that there was an unfair relationship between Mr P and GE Money in these 
circumstances;
Mr Ps representative has provided evidence of Mr Ps financial difficulties and Mr P 
says that when he bought the trial membership he and his partner both had their own 
businesses, bringing in good income, and they were in good health but, after falling 
into arrears, his partners health took a turn for the worse through stress, they split up 
for two years, she left her business and sold her house so they went into rented 
accommodation;
I sympathise with Mr P and his partner for their financial difficulties and the other 
issues that theyve experienced but it appears from the account statements that Mr P 
has received from the third party that its accepting reduced monthly repayments of 
£200 from him;
the third party is required to respond to Mr Ps financial difficulties positively and 
sympathetically so, if he hasnt already done so I suggest that he explains his 
financial difficulties to the third party  but I dont consider that GE Money is now 
required to take any action in response to his financial difficulties;
there was a significant delay in GE Money issuing a substantive response to Mr Ps 
claims and I dont consider that its response fully and properly responded to the 
claims that had been made so I cant say that its response was fair and reasonable  
but if it had fully and properly responded to his claims I consider that it would have 
been appropriate for it not to have upheld Mr Ps claims;
GE Money offered to pay £50 to Mr P because of its delay in responding to his claims 
and his representative described that offer as insulting  but if Mr P now wants to 
accept that offer I suggest that he contacts GE Money to see if it remains available to 
him; and
I sympathise with Mr P for the issues that hes had with his holiday club membership, 
but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require GE Money to refund to him any of the money that hes paid under the loan 
agreements, to end the September 2008 loan agreement, to write-off the outstanding 
amount due from him, to pay him any further compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
Subject to any further comments or evidence that I received from any of Mr P, his 
representative and GE Money, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to uphold this 
complaint. Both Mr Ps representative and GE Money have acknowledged receipt of my 
provisional decision but neither of them has provided any further comments or evidence in 
response to it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As none of Mr P, his representative and GE Money has provided any further comments or 
evidence in response to my provisional decision, I see no reason to change the findings that 
I set out in my provisional decision.My final decision
For the reasons set out in my provisional decision, and as set out above, my decision is that 
I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 August 2023.
