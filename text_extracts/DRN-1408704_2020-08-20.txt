The complaint
Mr M complains about the delay in the delivery of a car that was being supplied to him under 
a hire purchase agreement with FCE Bank plc, trading as Ford Credit.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr M had ordered a new car, that was to be supplied to him under a hire purchase 
agreement with Ford Credit, in February 2019 and he was going to part-exchange his 
existing car  he paid the dealer a deposit of £296.25;
the dealer told him that the car would be delivered in April 2019 - but it then said that 
the car wouldn't be delivered until May 2019;
the car wasn't delivered in May 2019 and the dealer said that it wouldn't be delivered 
until June 2019 - but Mr M didn't receive the car until the end of July 2019;
Mr M hadn't signed a hire purchase agreement with Ford Credit in February 2019 but 
it's clear from the order form that he had signed that £16,018.87 of the cost of the car 
was to be provided by a finance company;
the investigator said that, because of the delays and the lack of clear communication 
around the timescales, £100 compensation should be given to Mr M  and Ford 
Credit has now agreed to pay him £100 compensation;
Mr M has described in detail his experience and says that he was assured by the 
salesman and his manager that the car would be delivered in April 2019 - so that 
wasn't an estimated delivery date, he was worried about the impact of the delay on 
his credit rating and he says that £100 is insulting and woefully inadequate for the 
experience that he endured;
there were clearly some delays in the car being delivered to Mr M and I can 
understand the frustration and disappointment that that will have caused him  but he 
entered into the hire purchase agreement with Ford Credit in July 2019 and agreed 
that the first payment for the car would be due in September 2019;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the delay has had an 
adverse impact on Mr Ms credit rating or that Mr M has been caused a financial loss 
by the delay; and
I consider that the £100 compensation that was recommended by the investigator 
and which Ford Credit has now agreed to pay to Mr M is fair and reasonable 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused in these 
circumstances  Im not persuaded that a higher award of compensation is justified 
or that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Ford Credit to take any other 
action in response to Mr Ms complaint.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Ford Credit to pay £100 
to Mr M to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr M's complaint in part and I order FCE Bank plc, trading as 
Ford Credit, to pay £100 compensation to Mr M.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 September 2020.
