The complaint
Miss R complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) have decided her 
transaction isnt eligible for a refund under their Seller Protection Policy (SPP). 
What happened
Miss R received £300 into her PayPal account from a buyer. The owner of the card used to 
fund the transaction then filed an external chargeback claim through their card issuer, 
claiming the payment was unauthorised. The chargeback was upheld and PayPal debited 
the £300 from Miss Rs account but, as Miss R had already transferred the funds out of her 
PayPal account, it left her account in a negative balance. PayPal then explained Miss Rs 
transaction wasnt eligible for a refund under their SPP. Miss R complained but PayPal didnt 
uphold her complaint. 
Our investigator looked into things for Miss R. He thought PayPal had acted unfairly in 
deciding Miss Rs transaction isnt eligible for a refund under their SPP. He recommended 
they refund the £300 to Miss R. Miss R agreed but PayPal disagreed so the matter has 
come to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold the complaint. And, I think the investigators 
recommendation here is a fair way to resolve matters. 
I think its important to firstly clarify, the refund which has been made to the buyer is as a 
result of a successful chargeback claim theyve made. While PayPal did dispute the 
chargeback, the decision is ultimately made by the card issuer, and not PayPal. However, 
disputes will often arise in online platforms designed for buying and selling goods. Its 
therefore important for PayPal, being a payment platform, to have policies in place to help 
resolve those disputes. PayPal does have such policies, but what Ive considered here is 
whether PayPal have applied their policy fairly.  
PayPal say, if a reversal occurs because of a chargeback having been filed against a seller, 
they will attempt to reimburse the seller through their SPP which is designed to mitigate 
against the threat of reversals due to claims for unauthorised transactions. They say this 
transaction wasnt eligible for a refund under their SPP as it didnt meet their eligibility 
criteria. 
Ive looked at PayPals SPP and note this says, for unauthorised transactions, a seller must 
provide valid proof of shipment or proof of delivery that shows the item was shipped or 
provided to the buyer. PayPal say Miss R received payment for services and no shipping 
address was provided to her so no tracking information can be accepted. PayPal say 
payments for services are strictly for intangible goods and dont include any required 
shipping address for the buyer. PayPal say, although the buyer entered a shipping address 
in the transaction notes, this doesnt qualify as a PayPal confirmed shipping address. The 
SPP also says the item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped PayPal 
say this transaction involved a payment for a service and not a tangible item. 
Taking this all into account, I dont think PayPal have acted fairly in deciding Miss Rs 
transaction wasnt eligible for their SPP. I say this because the information provided by 
PayPal shows the buyer provided a delivery address and Miss R then sent the item through 
a recognised postal service and provided a tracking number. Ive checked the tracking 
number using the postal services track and trace service and this shows the item was 
delivered and signed for. So, in line with the SPP, I think this demonstrates Miss R has 
provided valid proof of shipment and delivery. I note the SPP goes further to say the proof of 
shipment must indicate the item was shipped to the buyer no later than two days after 
PayPal notifies the customer of an unauthorised transaction claim. In this case, PayPal 
notified Miss R of the unauthorised transaction claim on 26 October, but the tracking 
information shows the item was shipped on 12 November. I acknowledge this is outside the 
two days, but Miss R says she initially tried to deliver the items to the buyer but found the 
address wasnt correct. Miss R says she then continued to communicate with the buyer over 
a period of time and managed to get a delivery address. 
Miss R has provided screenshots of her conversations with the buyer which show she 
queries why theyve raised a chargeback and the buyer says theyre unaware of any dispute. 
The buyer also says, if the funds have been taken back, then theyll pay again. The buyer 
asks for further information about the dispute and Miss R forwards the details sent to her by 
PayPal. Its clear Miss R was in communication with the buyer to find out what was 
happening and to get details for the item to be delivered. So, I dont think it would be fair for 
PayPal to use this as a reason to treat Miss Rs transaction as being ineligible for their SPP.    
The transaction information provided by PayPal shows the transaction type has been 
described as Payment received (service). PayPal say, as the payment was made for a 
service and not a tangible item, it doesnt qualify for SPP. However, from the information Ive 
seen, Im not persuaded the payment was for a service. I say this for two reasons. Firstly, 
the transaction notes describe the item, and this suggests its a pair of trainers. Secondly, 
given that Im satisfied the postal service delivered an item, I believe this wouldve been a 
tangible item and not a service. And, in their response to our investigators view, I can see 
PayPal believe the payment was for a tangible item. 
I can see PayPal disagree with our investigators view and point out Miss R hasnt complied 
with the obligations set out in the User Agreement, and specifically, the SPP. But, in the 
circumstances of this case, I dont think its fair and reasonable to apply the narrow lens of 
the User Agreement alone. And, its important to look at whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances. 
PayPal say they cant use the transaction notes as the basis to determine if the sale was for 
tangible goods. They say this is determined by the type of payment received into Miss Rs 
account, and in this case, it was for a service and no shipping address associated with the 
transaction. PayPal refer to their SPP which says a seller must ship the item to the shipping 
address on the transaction details page in a sellers PayPal account for the transaction. 
PayPal say the shipping address was communicated between Miss R and the buyer outside 
of PayPals platform  so they believe the postal services tracking information shouldnt be 
taken into consideration as they dont have a shipping address on their record to verify the 
address. I acknowledge what has happened here doesnt strictly follow the terms set out in 
the SPP, but as mentioned above, Im satisfied the item has been delivered so it would be 
unfair for this to be used as a reason for Miss Rs transaction being ineligible for SPP. PayPal say Miss R had the option to refund the payment to the buyer and then ask for the 
payment type to be changed to a payment for goods  this would then have generated an 
email to Miss R asking her to ship the item to the specified address. I acknowledge Miss R 
had this option but PayPal say if this payment wouldve been sent as a payment for goods, 
then PayPal wouldve had the ability to cover this transaction under the SPP if she provided 
proof of delivery to the confirmed shipping address. But, from the information Ive seen, I 
believe its more likely than not, that criteria has been met in any event. As mentioned 
above, Im satisfied the payment was for a tangible item and the postal service tracking 
information shows this was delivered. So, I think its fair and reasonable in the circumstances 
for PayPal to refund the £300 to Miss R.      
Putting things right
Ive taken the view that PayPal have acted unfairly in deciding Miss Rs transaction wasnt 
eligible for a refund under their SPP. So, PayPal should refund the £300 payment to Miss R  
for this transaction. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must 
refund £300 to Miss R.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 August 2022.
