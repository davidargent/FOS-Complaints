K820x#14complaint
Mr L is unhappy with the interest  Hitachi Capital (UK) Plc (Hitachi) charged him on a loan 
he repaid in early  December 2018.
background
Mr L entered into a loan agreement with Hitachi on 27 November  2017.  He did so in order  to 
facilitate the purchase  of goods through a third party supplier. The loan was for £12,750 and 
there was a promotional  offer attached. The terms of the offer were  that if the loan balance 
was repaid in full within 12 months  the deferral period  Mr L wouldnt be charged any 
interest. After that date interest would be charged (from 27 November 2017) and monthly 
payments would have  to be made  until the balance was settled.
On 1 December  2017 Mr L received his annual loan statement (dated 27 November 2017). 
On receipt of this statement Mr L realised  his loan had been running for more than 
12 months.
Mr L, having paid one monthly instalment  against his loan on 27 November 2018  (by direct 
debit) of £274.12,  settled  it in full on 3 December  2018,  paying  Hitachi the sum of 
£15,290.95.
Mr L complained to Hitachi about what he had to pay to settle his loan. He said that he 
expected to have to pay £12,750 (the original sum advanced) plus interest of about  £5 
(approximately 1 weeks  worth), when what he ended up paying  was £12,750 (the original 
sum advanced) plus interest of about  £2,270  (over 12 months worth). Mr L also complained  
that he didnt receive  from Hitachi, in October  2018,  a reminder that his deferral period would 
come to an end on 27 November 2018.
Mr Ls complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that Hitachi  had 
done nothing wrong in charging the interest  that it had. She also said that she was satisfied 
that Hitachi had sent Mr L a reminder (by email)  in October 2018  confirming that his deferral 
period would come to an end on 27 November 2018.
Mr L didnt agree and so his complaint has been  passed to me for review  and decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I can confirm that Ive 
come to the same conclusion as the investigator  and for the same  reasons.
I empathise with the position Mr L found himself  in. But in order  for me to say Hitachi  should 
have done something differently I must first be satisfied that it did something wrong. But I 
cant see that it did.
Ref: DRN58084392The loan agreement  entered  into by Mr L states:
Duration of the agreement 132 months. Under  this agreement you will pay 120 consecutive  
monthly payments  of £274.12 commencing 12 months after the date of supply (and if 
applicable installation) of the goods/services. We will tell you in writing the date on which the 
first monthly payment will become due. If by the Deferred First Payment date you have paid 
to us the amount of credit in full, you will not have to pay any interest but you will have to pay 
an administration fee of £29.00. We will send you a reminder before the Deferred First 
Payment Date.
A letter sent to Mr L dated 27 November 2017, a letter which  Mr L doesnt dispute  he 
received, says:
Your first payment date is deferred  until 27 November 2018.  If you pay the full amount of 
credit of £12750.00 on or before this date you will not pay any interest. However, you may 
have to pay a £29 charge depending on the terms of your agreement.
The full interest  is payable if you do not pay £12750.00 on or before the end of your Deferral 
Period which  includes all interest  accrued during the Deferral Period.
We will send you an email reminder before the end of the Deferral  Period.
In my view it should have been  clear to Mr L from the above exactly what it was he was 
required to do, and when, if he wanted  to avoid paying any interest  on the loan sum of 
£12,750.
Hitachi says it sent Mr L an email reminder before  the deferral period ended, to remind  him 
that it was coming  to an end. Mr L says he didnt receive this reminder and I accept this 
might be the case.  I also accept Mr L had every intention of settling the loan balance  before 
the end of the deferral period. But that doesnt mean  Hitachi  must  waive  some  or all of the 
interest it charged Mr L.
Based on documents provided  by Hitachi Im satisfied that a reminder was sent to Mr L using 
the correct email address. Where a business  is able to demonstrate  as much,  Im satisfied 
its done all it needs to get the reminder to the customer and it isnt responsible for the 
non-receipt  of it. I know Mr L feels strongly  about  this point, but I cant  see that Hitachi has 
done anything  wrong here.
Mr L seems to suggest that the interest he was charged of about £2,270  is extortionate . 
But its my understanding  that in coming  to this conclusion Mr L is viewing the charge  as 
representing approximately 1 weeks interest on the sum of £12,780.  But this isnt the case. 
This charge is for over 12 months interest  on the sum of £12,750, not one week.
So in the particular circumstances of this case, Im satisfied  Hitachi took reasonable steps to 
make Mr L aware when the deferral period on his loan ended  and the consequences  of not 
settling the loan (in full) before this date.
Ref: DRN58084393my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.
