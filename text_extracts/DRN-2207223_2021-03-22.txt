The complaint
Ms M complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has unfairly restricted her account.  She 
would like these restrictions lifted.
What happened
In April 2020 PayPal wrote to Ms M to advise that she could no longer use her account.  It 
said she had consistently opened a number of complaints as a buyer and that this was not 
consistent with its User Agreement.  PayPal had sent a warning letter to Ms M advising her 
of its concerns and had advised her account would be restricted and closed if she continued 
to make these complaints.  It gave her advice in only dealing with reputable businesses. 
PayPal say Ms M continued raising these disputes, so it decided to end its relationship with 
her.
Ms M complained to this service.  She said she was unable to sell items on Ebay without a 
PayPal account and she asked us to direct PayPal to remove the restrictions.
Our investigator didnt think she could ask PayPal to do anymore and explained this to Ms 
M. Ms M didnt agree  she didnt say why.
The matter was then passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The investigator is right.  There is nothing more this service can ask PayPal to do.
PayPal is entitled to end its business relationship with individuals if it deems that persons 
use of its service to be incompatible with its user agreement.  This is clear in the terms and 
conditions of the account which Ms M signed up to.
We wouldnt normally interfere with decisions such as this.  What we can look at is whether 
PayPal acted in accordance with those terms and conditions.  In Ms Ms case, I think it did.
So, in the circumstances, I wont be asking PayPal to do anymore.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 April 2021.
