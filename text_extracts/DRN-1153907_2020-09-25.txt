The complaint
Mr G is unhappy with how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) dealt with his financial 
difficulties.
What happened
After NatWest closed Mr Gs accounts, he contacted it to try and agree a repayment plan to 
avoid his account being passed to debt collection agents. Mr G didnt think it was fair to 
close his accounts or to pass his accounts to these agents. NatWest issued a response to 
this complaint and this was considered by another ombudsman at this service who said that 
NatWest had acted fairly in taking these actions.
Mr G still had further concerns about how NatWest had dealt with him after it responded to 
the complaint mentioned above, which was dealt with separately. He remained unhappy with 
NatWests decision to close his accounts and to continue to apply interest and charges to 
them. In particular he said NatWest hadnt been willing to work with him to agree a payment 
arrangement, or taken into account his financial position.
Our investigator explained that he felt that NatWest had acted fairly. He listened to the calls 
Mr G had with NatWest and felt that it had tried to take into account his financial position  
but Mr G wasnt willing to provide it with enough information for it to help him. Mr G didnt 
agree so this complaint was passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There is some overlap between this complaint and other complaints Mr G has made in 
similar circumstances. NatWest has treated these complaints separately, issuing different 
final response letters for each. Its entitled to do that and so this service has treated these 
matters separately too. So to be clear  I am considering Mr Gs complaint about matters 
that were covered in NatWests final response of 20 August 2019, which this service hasnt 
already considered.
I hope Mr G will understand that this means that the scope of what I can consider is fairly 
narrow here  as another ombudsman has already reached a final decision on a number of 
Mr Gs concerns, so I cant investigate these again. But I will explain my decision on the 
issues we havent considered to date.
Like our investigator, Ive listened to the relevant calls Mr G had with NatWest. The calls Ive 
heard from May 2019 and June 2019 all show that NatWest was trying to help Mr G. I realise 
that this may not have been in the way Mr G wanted. But in these calls NatWest did what Id 
expect a business to do when trying to treat a customer fairly, positively and sympathetically. 
For example, in May 2019 it contacted him and asked for information about his income and 
expenditure. Mr G didnt provide this and asked not to be contacted until the end of June 
2019.
Then in June 2019  NatWest contacted him again and asked for this information. But Mr G 
declined to provide this. NatWest is entitled to ask for this information in order to work out 
what it can do to help a customer in a proportionate way. I realise how unhappy Mr G was 
with NatWest by this point, but the fact he declined to do this meant NatWest didnt have 
enough information to be able to help him in the way wed expect. 
During this time, NatWest continued to apply interest and charges while the accounts 
remained open. These were in line with the terms and conditions of the account and, given 
that Mr G wasnt fully engaging with NatWest to help it understand the impact these were 
having on him  I think its fair it continued to apply them here. There was an issue with 
paper statements not being switched on  and NatWest refunded some interest and charges 
separately as a result of this, but that isnt something Mr G has complained about to this 
service.
But in any event  as a part of its response to his complaint in August 2019, NatWest 
refunded the charges applied to the current account since April 2019, when Mr G last used 
it. Thats not a step NatWest had to take, but doing so is a good example of the fact it has 
been willing to try and help Mr G, even when he hasnt been willing to always give it the 
information it needed to help him. It follows that theres nothing further I can ask NatWest to 
do here.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 October 2020.
