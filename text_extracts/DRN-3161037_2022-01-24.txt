The complaint
Mr M complains that he has been unable to access his TransUnion International UK Limited 
credit report online. Hes unhappy with the lack of response from TransUnion. 
Mr M doesnt accept TransUnions proposed resolution and would like it to give him an 
apology and pay compensation.
 
What happened
In 2020, Mr M tried to view his TransUnion credit report online but couldnt gain access. He 
says he answered all of TransUnions questions to validate his identity accurately. 
Mr M complained to TransUnion in August 2020.  It responded in late September 2020. 
TransUnion told Mr M that it has procedures in place to prevent personal information being 
shared with the wrong person. TransUnion told Mr M that due to these processes, it couldnt 
manually override the system.
Mr M continued to contact TransUnion as he wasnt happy with its response. At the end of 
October 2020, TransUnion told Mr M that it wasnt possible to tell him why the online system 
couldnt verify his identity. It offered to send Mr M a hard copy of his credit report if he gave 
some further information including his name, date of birth and address history.
Mr M was unwilling to receive his credit report in the post as he was concerned that it might 
end up in the wrong hands. Mr M was unhappy that TransUnion didnt reply to his repeated 
attempts to make contact. 
The investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ms complaint be upheld. She understood his 
frustration with the situation but didnt think that TransUnion had done anything wrong.
Mr M disagreed with the investigators recommendation but didnt give further reasons why.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise that Ive summarised Mr Ms complaint in my own words and concentrated on what I 
think are the key issues here. The rules that govern this service allow me to do this. I should 
also say that this service doesnt supervise, regulate, or discipline the businesses we cover  
thats the role of the regulator. 
I appreciate Mr Ms frustration as he wanted to view his credit report online and is certain he 
gave the right answers to verify his identity. But TransUnion has its own automated 
verification processes that its entitled to use. If TransUnion cant verify a consumer, it wont 
allow online access to their report. I think its fair to say that if TransUnion had to explain why 
a consumer hadnt passed security, it would impact on the very processes it uses to keep 
the data secure. As Mr M didnt pass the verification process, I dont think TransUnion acted 
unreasonably when it wouldnt allow him to view his credit report online. And I dont think its 
for this service to say what security or verification processes should be used - thats a matter 
of commercial judgment for TransUnion.
TransUnion offered to send Mr Ms credit report by post, and I think this was a reasonable 
compromise. Although Mr M didnt want to receive it in the post, I wouldnt have expected 
TransUnion to do anything more as it had offered Mr M a way of accessing his report.
Mr M is unhappy with the service he received from TransUnion after he complained. A 
businesss complaint handling process isnt a regulated activity which our service can usually 
consider. But I think TransUnion responded reasonably when it sent a final response 
followed by an offer to send the report to Mr M by post. 
As Im satisfied that TransUnion offered a reasonable solution to allow Mr M to see his credit 
report, I dont uphold this complaint. I leave it with Mr M to decide whether he wants to take 
up TransUnions offer to send his report to him by recorded delivery. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 February 2022.
