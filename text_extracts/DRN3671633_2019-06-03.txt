K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund a payment he made for 
goods he bought using  his PayPal account. 
background
In December 2018 Mr B purchased two items for £125 through  his PayPal account. He says 
that when the courier  delivered the parcel  one of the items he ordered  was missing and the 
other was damaged. Mr B says he refused the delivery and the courier returned the parcel to 
the sender. 
Mr B raised a dispute with PayPal through its Buyer Protection.  He said the items he 
received werent  what he was promised and he no longer had them as hed refused the 
delivery. 
PayPal said the seller had provided  proof  that the items had been delivered to Mr B so it 
didnt agree to a refund.  Mr B provided further  evidence from the courier  company to show 
the item had been returned  to the seller but PayPal still declined  the refund. 
Our investigator didnt  think PayPal  had made  a fair decision. This was because Mr B had 
provided evidence  to show the item had been  returned to the seller. He said this  along with 
the rest of the evidence  supported what Mr B had said about the items not being as 
described by the seller.  As Mr B didnt have the items he paid for he thought it was fair for 
PayPal refund Mr B £125. 
PayPal didnt agree. In summary it said:
The outcome  was determined in accordance with the Buyer  Protection terms set out 
in their user agreement.  
Refusal of a delivery does not entitle Mr B to a refund  or any cover under  the Buyer  
Protection. 
Mr B could  only have cover if the items  didnt  arrive or they were  significantly not as 
described. As Mr B refused the delivery  PayPal cant consider the claim under the 
reason they were  significantly  not as described.  This is because the item(s) is not 
available to be inspected. 
Refusing delivery of goods might entitle a consumer to a refund under separate 
consumer regulations, but not under the PayPal  user agreement which Mr B has 
agreed to be bound by. 
The complaint has been passed  to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The PayPal Buyer Protection terms are set out in section 13 of the PayPal user agreement.  
In order to qualify  for the protection the purchase  needed to meet  a number  of eligibility  
conditions. Ive not seen anything to make me think (and PayPal doesnt appear to dispute) 
that Mr Bs purchase wasnt  eligible for a claim under the Buyer Protection. 
Ref: DRN36716332The most relevant  clause  for eligibility  in this particular case is that the problem Mr B had 
with his purchase had to be one of two things.  Either:
1.He didnt receive the purchase; or
2.The goods were  significantly not as described.  
Clearly Mr B did receive the purchase   at least initially  as its not in dispute it was 
delivered to him. So his claim  wouldnt be eligible  under  the first clause. But it appears  this is 
how PayPal reviewed his claim. For this reason  I dont think  PayPal considered  Mr Bs claim 
fairly. 
Mr B says he refused  the delivery (and returned it back  to the seller) because the items 
werent what he was promised. In other words, they were significantly  not as described. This 
was because one of the two items  wasnt in the parcel and the other was damaged. Both of 
these are listed as examples (in the user agreement) of what  might be considered 
significantly not as described. 
PayPal found  in favour of the seller  because the seller gave evidence that the items had 
been correctly  delivered to Mr B. But this is only relevant for claims involving goods not 
being received.  This as Ive explained above,  didnt  apply here. So I dont think PayPals 
reason to decline Mr Bs claim  was fair  or in line with the user agreement terms. 
In any event the evidence the seller provided actually supported what Mr B was saying  that 
the item was returned back to the seller. So PayPal didnt review the evidence thoroughly 
enough  or fairly - as the seller hadnt demonstrated the item was correctly  delivered  and 
received. This is another reason why I think PayPals  decision to decline the refund was 
unfair. 
While I agree with PayPal the user agreement doesnt say that refusal of a delivery  will be 
covered by the Buyer Protection, I dont agree this is a fair reason to decline his claim for a 
refund. As Ive explained,  Mr Bs claim is that the goods were significantly not as described.  
I accept PayPals investigation into this type of claim would have been  limited given that 
Mr B didnt accept the delivery, but that doesnt mean  it couldnt  have considered  it. 
I find it unlikely that Mr B would have  refused  delivery for goods he wanted  unless they 
werent as described.  Mr Bs actions are consistent  with someone who received something 
different to what they were promised. Had Mr B accepted the delivery  after inspecting the 
goods, it might have been reasonable to conclude he was happy  with what was sent to him. 
So I dont  think its fair for PayPal to hold Mr Bs actions against him in this situation  
particularly when his actions werent unreasonable. 
Mr B has been consistent and credible with what he says happened. His actions and the 
wider evidence also support what he says.  So I believe  the items were  significantly not as 
described. It appears the seller has also received the goods  back which means  Mr B has lost 
£125 and hasnt got what he paid for. For all these reasons I think  it would be fair for PayPal 
to refund him £125.  
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold this complaint  and direct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA to:
Ref: DRN36716333Pay Mr B £125.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 July 2019.
