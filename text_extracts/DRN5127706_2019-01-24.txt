K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that when  he unsuccessfully  tried to withdraw £300 from a cash  machine, 
Bank of Scotland plc debited his account and wouldnt refund the money.  
background
Mr S tried to withdraw money at a cash machine. Hed used it before without any problems. 
Although he says he went through the normal process, this time the machine didnt give him 
his money. Bank of Scotland  debited his account  and when  he complained it told him it 
hadnt done anything wrong.  It said itd checked with the cash  machine owner who confirmed 
the machine had balanced so the money  had been  dispensed.
The adjudicator didnt think the bank  should  do anything more.  She looked  at the cash 
machine records and those showed  a successful withdrawal of £300 at the time and on the 
date Mr S said it hadnt given him his money.  So she didnt agree the bank should  pay him 
£300.
Mr S wasnt  happy with her opinion  as he said he was £300 out of pocket. 
  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  In doing so Ive come  to the same 
conclusion as the adjudicator for very similar reasons.
Bank of Scotland has sent us a number of documents that are relevant to the workings of the 
cash machine Mr S used.  None of them point to any error during the course of this 
transaction. So I cant fairly find that Bank of Scotland did anything wrong when it told Mr S it 
wouldnt pay him £300.
I know Mr S will be disappointed with my decision but I dont think  Bank of Scotland  has 
done anything  wrong.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2019.
