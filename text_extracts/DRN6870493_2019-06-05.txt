K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr M took out a total of nine loans  with QuickQuid between September 2014  and January  
2017.

Mr M believes QuickQuid was irresponsible to lend to him. He says he couldnt  afford  the 
loans, which  he says trapped him into a debt spiral, so that he had to borrow  again  to cover 
his next months  expenses.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. In summary,  he 
thought QuickQuid had carried out proportionate checks  before making the first three  loans, 
and he didnt think it had been unreasonable to make them, based on the information it had. 
But he didnt  think the checks  QuickQuid carried out before making the remaining loans went 
far enough. And he thought that if it had carried out proportionate checks  for loans 4 to 9, it 
would have realised  that loans 6 to 9 were  unaffordable for Mr M. 
So the adjudicator said that QuickQuid should  refund  all interest  and charges that Mr M paid 
on loans 6 to 9, with interest on the refund. And he said it should remove any negative 
information about those loans from Mr Ms credit file. QuickQuid didnt agree with the 
adjudicators view, so the complaints been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
QuickQuid was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make checks  to see whether Mr M 
could afford  to pay back each loan before it lent to him. Those checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr M was borrowing, and his lending  history,  but 
there was no set list of checks QuickQuid  had to do.
Ref: DRN68704932QuickQuids told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr M. Before each loan it asked 
him for details of his income  and normal expenditure. It then validated this information 
against his credit file and other data sources.
When he applied for the first three  loans, Mr M told QuickQuid  his monthly take-home pay 
was between £1,300 and £,1400. And he told it his total monthly  living expenses were  £275. 
QuickQuid was entitled to rely on that information,  in the absence of anything  to suggest that 
it might  be unreliable. On the basis of the information provided,  Im satisfied that it would 
have looked to QuickQuid as if Mr M would be able to afford the first three loans relatively  
comfortably. And I dont think it was irresponsible of QuickQuid to go ahead and make  the 
loans without carrying out more detailed affordability checks.
But even though the repayments on loan 3 were  a relatively small proportion  of Mr Ms 
stated disposable  income, he had to extend  the loan more than once, eventually  repaying it 
in full more than two months late. So I think it should have been apparent to QuickQuid, 
even at this early stage  of Mr Ms borrowing, that his financial position might not be as 
healthy as the figures hed provided might suggest. Whats more,  Mr M applied for loan 4 
little more than a fortnight after hed eventually finished repaying loan 3. And he applied for 
loan 5 a few days after repaying  loan 4, on which hed also incurred late payment fees and 
additional interest charges So taking everything into account, I think QuickQuid should  have 
taken steps to independently  verify  the information that Mr M had provided. 
Ive looked at Mr Ms bank  statements to see what I think its likely that QuickQuid would 
have discovered  if it had carried out what I consider to be proportionate checks  when Mr M 
applied for loans 4 and 5. Having done  so, I think that it would have been reasonable of 
QuickQuid to conclude  that although Mr Ms monthly  income was less than the figure hed 
provided, hed still be able to afford to repay the loans, after his regular monthly expenditure 
was taken into account. So I dont think it was irresponsible to make loan 4 or 5.
There was a break of around five months  between Mr M repaying  loan 5 and applying for 
loan 6. Mr M told QuickQuid his monthly take-home  pay had increased to around  £1,460.  
But his stated regular  monthly expenditure had also increased. And given the previous 
problems that Mr M had had repaying some of his loans, I think  that as a responsible lender, 
QuickQuid should  have independently  verified  the information he provided.
Again, Ive looked at Mr Ms bank statements to see what its likely that QuickQuid had 
discovered if it had looked  into Mr Ms financial situation in as much  detail as I think it should  
have done. I can see that Mr Ms income in the previous month had been significantly less 
than hed stated,  at around £1,000.  And he had short-term loans outstanding with other  
providers which, when  added to his regular monthly expenditure, would only just have left 
him with enough  money to repay loan 6. So he wouldnt have had money left over to meet 
any unexpected  or one-off expenses. Whats more, QuickQuid would have seen that Mr M 
was gambling frequently.
Ive borne in mind that QuickQuids said about  the loans it made from 2015 onwards having  
been based on affordability  reviews  that were  consistent with the FCA Handbook. But our 
job is to look not only into the rules  and regulations set by the regulator at the time of 
borrowing but also the law, good  industry  practice and all the available  evidence  and 
arguments to help us decide whether we think what the business  has done is right or not. 
Ref: DRN68704933In this case, taking  everything into account,  I think that if QuickQuid  had carried  out what 
I consider to be proportionate checks when Mr M applied for loan 6, it would have realised  
that it was unlikely that hed be able to afford to repay the loan sustainably  in other words 
without having  to borrow further. And his position didnt improve significantly during the rest 
of the time he was borrowing  from QuickQuid. So I think QuickQuid was wrong to make  
loans 6 to 9. 
putting things right
To put things right, QuickQuid should:
refund any interest and charges Mr M paid on loans 6 to 9 inclusive;
add interest to those  refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to the 
date of settlement*;
remove any adverse information about loan 4 from Mr Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs require QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part, and require CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading 
as QuickQuid) to put things right by doing as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 July 2019.
