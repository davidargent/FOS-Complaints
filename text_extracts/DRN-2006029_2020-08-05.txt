The complaint
Miss S is unhappy with how Calpe Insurance Company Limited have a settled a claim under 
her motor insurance policy.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
My role is to look at what Calpe did to see if I think they acted fairly and reasonably 
when coming to a liability decision about the car accident. Any decision about liability 
is a matter for the courts.
After reviewing the evidence it was the opinion of Calpe that there was no reasonable 
prospect of success if the matter went to court. So, they decided to settle the claim 
without accepting liability. Calpe are allowed to make this decision under the policy 
terms.
Having carefully looked at what happened I'm satisfied that Calpe fairly considered 
all the evidence when coming to the liability decision. This includes everything 
submitted by Miss S such as her testimony and photographs.
Calpe made a decision as they were entitled to do so under the policy, even if Miss A 
disagrees. Im happy that Calpe did this in a fair and reasonable way.
 
I understand the liability decision means Miss A has to pay an excess. However I'm 
satisfied Calpe considered all the information in a fair and reasonable way when coming to 
that decision. 
My final decision
For the reasons I've explained above, my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 September 2020.
