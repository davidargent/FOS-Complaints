The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly closed his account without 
providing a proper explanation. 
What happened
Mr A had a personal account with NatWest.
In January 2021, NatWest reviewed Mr As account. Following this, the bank decided to 
close Mr As account and sent him a letter on 19 January 2021 giving him 60 days notice to 
make alternative banking arrangements.
Mr A was away overseas at the time so didnt receive the letter. It wasnt until he started 
receiving text messages about his direct debits being cancelled that he became aware of the 
account closure. At that point he called NatWest to try and find out what was happening with 
his account. But NatWest wouldnt give him much information and wouldnt explain why it no 
longer wanted him as customer. The bank told Mr A that the decision to close his account 
was final.
Mr A says the closure of his account is unfair. Hes said that he has always maintained his 
account properly and cant think of any reason for why the bank would close his account. He 
says the closure of his account caused him a good deal of trouble and upset as he had to 
rearrange all his direct debits whilst abroad. Hes said the whole situation was very stressful 
and impacted his mental health negatively. He wants to know the reason NatWest closed his 
account and cant understand why the bank wont give him a proper explanation. 
Mr A complained to the bank. In response, NatWest said it ws a a commercial decision to 
close Mr As account and was done in line with the terms and conditons. And it isnt obliged 
to provide Mr A with an explanation for why it closed his account. Unhappy with this 
response Mr A brought his complaint to our sevice where one of our adjudicators 
considered it.
The adjudicator said NatWest hadnt treated Mr A unfairly when it had closed his account 
and had done so in line with the terms and conditions. She also explained that NatWest 
didnt have to provide Mr A with an explanation for closing his account. 
Mr A disagreed and asked for his complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman. He said he 
hadnt done anything wrong, that he was a long standing customer of the bank and cant 
think of a legitmate reason for why the bank would close his account. 
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate that Mr A is upset that NatWest closed his account. Thats clear from whats 
hes told this service and the bank. The timing of NatWests actions was unfortunate. Mr A 
was abroad at the time and only discovered his account had closed when his direct debits 
started to be unpaid. And when he called the bank, he wasnt given the information he 
wanted. So, I can understand why he found this whole experience with NatWest frustrating.
I can also understand that this was no doubt stressful for him especially as the banks 
actions made it difficult for him to manage his finances. But for me to uphold this complaint, I 
must be satisfied that the bank has done something wrong. And in this case, I dont think it 
has. Ill explain why.
As the adjudicator has already explained, a bank can make its own decisions about who its 
prepared to offer banking services to. NatWest have said it made the commercial decision to 
close Mr As account. And this service wont usually interfere with a banks commercial 
discretion. Its generally for banks to decide whether or not they want to provide, or to 
continue to provide, banking facilities to any particular customer. Unless theres a very good 
reason to do so, this service wont usually say that a bank must keep customer or require it 
to compensate a customer who has had their account closed.
Banks should, however, give reasonable notice before closing an account. Usually, that 
means 60 days notice, but it can be less  depending on the circumstances. In this case 
NatWests gave Mr A 60 days notice. Ive reviewed the terms and conditions of Mr As 
account, and the information provided to us by both NatWest and Mr A. Having done so, Im 
satisfied NatWest acted in line with the terms and conditions, so, it was entitled to close the 
account as it has already done. 
Mr A has told us that he tried to find out why NatWest closed his account. But NatWest 
wouldnt give him much information. I understand why Mr A wants to know the reasons 
behind the banks decision  it cant be pleasant being told youre no longer wanted as a 
customer. But NatWest is under no obligation to tell Mr A the reasons behind the account 
closure, as much as hed like to know. So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not giving 
Mr A this information. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it to do so or for me to 
disclose the reasons. 
I know Mr A suspects that NatWest closed his account because he made a complaint 
against a member of NatWest staff regarding a mortgage application. But Ive not seen any 
evidence that this was the case. I want to reassure Mr A that Ive looked at all the 
information provided by him and NatWest, and there is nothing that would lead me to 
conclude he has been treated unfairly. Ive also not seen anything to suggest NatWest didnt 
exercise its commercial discretion legitimately.
In summary, I understand that Mr A has been upset and inconvenienced by NatWests 
actions. And I appreciate my decision will come as a disappointment to him. But for the 
reasons Ive set out, I dont think NatWest has treated Mr A unfairly when it closed his 
account. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 May 2023.
