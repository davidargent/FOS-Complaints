K821x#15complaint
Mr J has complained about short-term loans granted  to him by CashEuroNet  UK LLC trading 
either as Quick Quid or Pounds  to Pocket.
background
CashEuroNet agreed almost 30 loans for Mr J from August 2013 to August 2017. Most were  
agreed by Quick Quid and were  usually to be repaid over three months.  Some were agreed 
by Pounds to Pocket  and were instalment loans to be repaid over 12 months. I have  
included a summary table of these as an appendix to this document.
Mr J says he borrowed from several  short  term lenders during the time he borrowed from 
CashEuroNet. He told us I spent significant  amounts of my income on gambling which 
meant I got into a spiral  of paying  loans  and immediately taking them  out again. And Mr J 
says that had CashEuroNet carried out correct checks before lending it would have realised 
that lending to him was irresponsible. Hes asked that the lender refunds the interest he paid 
on his loans and that it deletes  any negative information about them from his credit file.
Our adjudicator found that Mr Js complaint should be upheld  in part and recommended that 
CashEuroNet refund the interest and charges he paid on loans 4 and 5 and from, and 
including, loan 7 to loan 29 (as shown in the summary table).
Mr J agreed with this adjudication but CashEuroNet  didnt.  In response it said it had 
reviewed your recommendations to resolve  Mr [J]s case, however, we are unable  to agree 
that he should not have  been provided  with loans 10 - 29 based on the enhanced checks  
performed prior to approving each of these loans. CashEuroNet  did agree to refund interest 
and charges1 for loans  4, 5, 7 and 9 as a full resolution of his complaint but Mr J declined  
this offer.
Following our adjudication and CashEuroNets offer, it seems loans 1 to 9 are no longer in 
dispute. Our adjudicator either  didnt uphold Mr Js complaint about these, or did and the 
lender agreed  to refund him2. So I wont revisit  these  loans in my decision but will focus on 
loans 10 to 29.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have also taken into account the law, 
any relevant regulatory  rules and good  industry practice at the time. 
Loans 10 to 29 were all payday loans, agreed  by Quick Quid. All were  to be repaid over 
three months except  loan 10, which was to be repaid over two months. These loans were 
agreed in 2015  and later, the previous nine loans were agreed in 2013 and 2014. 
Quick Quid didnt comment  on our adjudicators  findings about the proportionality of its 
checks or the affordability of the loans,  nor did it provide any new information for me to 
consider. The lender  said that it carried out enhanced checks from March 2015  and, in 
essence, says that its lending  from this point onwards cant  have been irresponsible.
1 Plus 8% simple interest per annum and to remove  any associated negative  credit file entries. 
2 Mr J didnt pay any interest on loans 1 or 8, and our adjudicator didnt uphold his complaint about  
loans 2, 3 or 6.
Ref: DRN98990262This Service has responded to Quick Quid on this generic  argument  directly and through  
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to expand on this point any further here, though  I 
have considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. 
I would remind Quick  Quid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  and communicating it to the individuals dealing  with 
complaints in the respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Js complaint and what both parties  have said 
about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr J borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in mind  
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect Quick Quid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer the lending  relationship.
Turning to the specifics of Mr Js complaint, our adjudicator upheld his complaint about  loans 
10 to 29 because Quick  Quid  ought to have  seen that he would not be able to afford  the loan 
repayments based on the information it had. I appreciate that this will be disappointing for 
Quick Quid but I agree  with this finding  and will explain why.
By the time Mr J applied  for his tenth loan hed been  borrowing from CashEuroNet  for over a 
year. There  had been gaps between loans of several  months and Mr J repaid some of his 
loans early, on two occasions  on the same day hed borrowed. This suggests to me that 
Mr Js financial  situation was somewhat volatile. 
Ref: DRN98990263At the time of loan 10, Mr J told Quick Quid that he had a monthly  disposable income of 
£840. Given the highest repayment for this loan was over £1,000 and bearing in mind  the 
length of time Mr J had been borrowing from CashEuroNet and the way hed been managing 
his repayments,  I agree  with our adjudicator that the lender  ought to have gathered a clearer  
picture of his finances before agreeing further credit for him. And that it should  have 
continued to do this from then onwards as his situation doesnt appear to have changed.
As our adjudicator explained, the maximum repayment for loans 10 to 29 was always higher 
than Mr Js stated disposable income. So they upheld  Mr Js complaint about  these  loans 
saying that Quick Quid ought to have recognised that they were not going to be affordable 
for him based  on the information it had gathered. 
I agree  with this outcome. I have thought  about  the fact that these were  all deferred payment 
loans to be repaid  over a number of months.  But given the length of time Mr J had been 
borrowing and the number of loans hed taken out, I dont think that it was reasonable for 
Quick Quid to have  agreed to lend these amounts on the basis that Mr J could carry a 
surplus from month to month and so spread  his repayments across  the loan term. 
Furthermore, had Quick Quid enquired further into Mr Js financial affairs I think its likely it 
would have learnt of the extent of his regular spending on gambling.  I can see from his bank 
statements that over this period (mid-2015 to 2017) Mr J generally  used his full £5,000 
overdraft each month spending  several thousands of pounds  on gambling, sometimes  tens 
of thousands.
In summary,  the information Quick Quid had about  Mr Js circumstances and his borrowing 
history should have led it to do more before  agreeing to lend to him. Had it done  so, it would 
likely have understood that he couldnt  sustainably meet any further credit repayments and, 
armed with this knowledge, wouldnt have agreed to lend to him. So it didnt  lend responsibly  
here and ought  to put this right for Mr J.
what Quick Quid should  do to put things right
Ive concluded  that Quick  Quid was irresponsible to agree to lend to Mr J from August 2015  
onwards, namely  loans  10 to 29 in the summary  table. In order to put Mr J back in the 
position he would have been in, had it not agreed these, Quick Quid should: 
-refund all interest  and charges Mr J paid for loans 10 to 29;
-refund all interest  and charges he paid for loans 4, 5, 7 and 9 as it offered;
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to the 
dates of settlement;
-remove any adverse information about these loans from Mr Js credit  file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. Quick Quid  must give 
Mr J a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN98990264my final decision
I uphold Mr Js complaint and direct CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as I have set 
out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2019.
