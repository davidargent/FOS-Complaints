The complaint
Mr L complains NewDay Ltd added a default to his credit file unfairly.
What happened
Mr L held a credit card with NewDay, and the card fell into arrears on three separate 
occasions. NewDay sent default notices the first two times the card fell into arrears and Mr L 
was able to clear the arrears and avoid the default.
The third time the card fell into arrears NewDay didnt send a default notice. A default was 
added to Mr Ls credit file and the outstanding debt was sold to a third party debt collector.
Mr L paid off the balance, and complained to NewDay as he felt the default was unfair. Mr L 
said he was never sent default notices so he couldnt avoid the default. NewDay responded 
to say it had followed its processes correctly and Mr L was in arrears on his card.
Unhappy with that response Mr L brought his complaint to this service and an investigator 
looked into things. The investigator thought Mr Ls complaint should be upheld as he hadnt 
been warned about the default.
The investigator also thought Mr Ls previous ability to clear the arrears, following a default 
notice, meant it would have been fairer for NewDay to send Mr L a third default notice.
The investigator thought NewDay should remove the default and pay Mr L £50. NewDay 
disagreed and said it recorded a default because of the credit card was in arrears. NewDay 
said it would only remove the default if it made an error as it was obliged to record it.
Unable to resolve things Mr Ls complaint was referred to an ombudsman to decide things.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The circumstances of this complaint arent in dispute. NewDay has told this service it didnt 
send a default notice the third time Mr L fell into significant arrears. And because the arrears 
werent paid off NewDay defaulted Mr Ls credit card.
The agreement between Mr L and NewDay is regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974 
(CCA). In this act theres sections, 87, 88 and 89, which specifically explain what NewDay 
has to do if it wants to default Mr Ls credit card and why it needs to do this.
The CCA says consumers should be warned about an impending default and given the 
opportunity to avoid it. And, if a consumer remedies the breach  in Mr Ls circumstances 
paying the arrears on his credit card  it should be like the breach never happened.
NewDay didnt warn Mr L of the default or give him the opportunity to fix things. Mr L had 
previously avoided a default by remedying things  paying off his arrears. If NewDay had 
sent Mr L a default notice the third time Im persuaded Mr L would have paid them off again.
NewDay says Mr L was in arrears and by reporting the credit card in default its abiding by its 
obligation to report the accounts true position. But I dont think NewDays followed the 
correct process for defaulting Mr Ls credit card, so I dont think its fair to report the default.
NewDay sold Mr Ls outstanding balance to a debt collector, who contacted Mr L for 
payment. Mr Ls since paid the amount off in full. And this is important, theres no longer an 
outstanding balance owed so NewDay cant restart the default process.
But the sale of Mr Ls debt, and the default itself, did cause Mr L some inconvenience. I have 
to balance this with the support NewDay gave Mr L when it knew about his difficulties in 
repaying his debt.
NewDay hadnt charged interest on Mr Ls credit card for some time, and this is a very 
positive step for NewDay to take. Overall, I think the £50 payment for distress and 
inconvenience is a fair amount.
My final decision
My final decision is NewDay Ltd must:
ensure the default registered for the NewDay credit card is removed
pay Mr L £50
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 November 2021.
