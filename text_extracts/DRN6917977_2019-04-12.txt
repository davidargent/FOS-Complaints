K822xcomplaint
Mr R complains through his representative that MYJAR Limited approved  loans for him that 
were unaffordable and so the lending was irresponsible. 
background 
MYJAR lent to Mr R 30 times between October  2010 and September 2011. The last loan 
remains outstanding.  
One of our adjudicators considered the complaint and he thought  that MYJAR should  put 
things right for Mr R in relation to Loans from 8 December 2010  to the last loan approved on 
15 September 2011. 
Our adjudicators reasons were  that MYJAR ought  to have realised  that Mr R had become 
reliant on this form of high-cost short term lending. Our adjudicator said that at one point 
Mr R took 6 loans  in two months  October and November 2010 (loans 1 to 6). And he went 
on to point out that Mr R took so many loans  in just under a year that this averaged  out to be 
about two a month. So his view was that this was irresponsible lending by MYJAR. 
Our adjudicator recommended  that MYJAR  put things right as follows:
 
refund  all interest and charges that Mr R paid on loans 7 to 24 ;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
remove any entries about loans 7 to 24 from Mr Rs credit file. 
There followed a short line about  tax deduction  which I do not repeat here. 
Since writing his opinion,  our adjudicator  has realised that he referred to Loans  7 to 24 
when in fact he meant  Loans 7 to 30. He wrote to MYJAR to correct this recently.   
MYJAR agreed with the adjudicators opinion and sent to us its calculation of the refund  of 
interest and charges, plus 8% simple interest,  less the tax and included an offset for the 
outstanding last loan. MYJAR  did its calculations on the full 30 loans approved  for Mr R and 
so the redress  calculations covered all the loans from Loan 7 approved  on 8 December 2010 
to Loan 30 approved on 15 September  2011.  
Mr R received these calculations and offer through his third party  representative. 
Mr R rejected the offer and our adjudicator  asked  for his reasons and whether he had some 
new information to provide.  
Mr R confirmed that he was not able to send any additional copy  bank statements and had 
nothing further  to add in relation to the complaint. 
Mr Rs reasons for rejecting the offer were  that he wanted to query the amount of the refund 
and interest due to him. Mr R says that the interest on each of the loans was a minimum of 
£100 and he does not think that the MYJAR  calculations reflect  that. And Mr R also raised a 
query in that he thinks he ought to receive  the 8% statutory  interest.  
Ref: DRN69179772So Mr R is questioning the amounts he was charged  at the time the loans were  approved  
and the redress  calculations. He does not seem to be challenging our own adjudicators  
opinion about  the complaint. So I do not plan to review the merits of the complaint. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In view of the confusion over the details surrounding the loan numbers and dates I have set 
out a loan table based on the information  provided by MYJAR. It appears  at the end of this 
decision. Sometimes Mr R had two loans in the same day. The loans taken on the same day 
have different loan reference numbers in MYJARs  records. MYJAR has explained to us that 
when Mr R had two loans  for the same amount on the same  day we viewed this as one 
loan because its system was set up that way. I have  treated these as two separate  loans in 
the table below.
As both parties have  agreed with our adjudicators opinion  in principle which  is that the 24 
loans from 8 December  2010 to 15 September 2011 (Loans 7 to 30) ought to be upheld,  
then I do not plan to address the merits element  of the complaint. The unresolved part of the 
complaint seems to relate to the redress calculations.  I would have expected Mr Rs 
representative to be able to clarify these points as part of its professional representation of 
its client. 
On the point raised by Mr R in relation to the interest on each of the loans was a minimum of 
£100 the records from MYJAR  show that on most loans  the interest ranged from £10 to £51 
as the loan terms often  were short  on relatively small principal amounts. 
Two loans  were different  Loan 25 did attract a large amount of interest on the £300 
approved as Mr R was a month late paying it down.  The position  was similar with Loan 29. 
And as these two are part of the batch  of loans being upheld in Mr Rs complaint than this 
interest and the late fees on those loans will form part of the redress  sums due to him from 
MYJAR.
MYJAR has responded to our recent query  to explain that it has calculated  the redress as 
we would expect  it to be calculated:
 
A remove interest and charges from the unpaid loan (Loan 30) and put to the reduction  
of that balance any monies  Mr R has paid towards  that loan  if anything; 
B refund interest and charges on Loans  7 to 29 from the date of payment to the date
of settlement*;
C add 8% simple interest  and then deduct  tax 
D then do the offset  for the outstanding balance for Loan 30.
MYJAR has confirmed it will remove all reference  to Loans 7 to 30 from Mr Rs credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must
give Mr R a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
So apart from the fact that the figures  calculated by MYJAR  and presented to Mr R may 
need to be recalculated to comply with the requirement that they need  to be accurate up to 
Ref: DRN69179773the date of settlement and not its last offer letter, then I have nothing further to add. The 
redress offered to Mr R is in line with our adjudicators opinion and is fair. 
my final decision
My final decision is that the offer to Mr R is fair. So MYJAR Limited should put things right in 
the way proposed and with up-to-date calculations.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 May 2019.
