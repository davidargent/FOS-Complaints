The complaint
Ms E and Mr G complain that GE Money Consumer Lending Limited has rejected the claims 
that theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Ms E and Mr G had bought a trial membership of a holiday club for £3,795 in September 
2008. They paid a deposit of £380 and entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with GE 
Money Consumer Lending for a loan of £3,415. They upgraded their trial membership and 
entered into a membership agreement in November 2008. The cost of the membership was 
£12,807 from which the trial membership cost of £3,795 was deducted so the balance due 
from them was £9,012. They also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with GE Money 
Consumer Lending for a loan of £12,436.47 (the £9,012 and £3,424 to refinance the credit 
from their September 2008 loan). They agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £231.83 
to GE Money Consumer Lending. It says that the loan was repaid in October 2013. 
Ms E and Mr G asked GE Money Consumer Lending for details of the credit intermediary in 
June 2020 and it responded to them in August 2020. Ms E and Mr Gs representative then 
made a complaint to this service in January 2022. It said that the credit intermediary wasnt 
authorised to arrange the loan, the membership had been misrepresented to Ms E and 
Mr G, they were pressurised into entering into the contract, there was no evidence that a 
credit check was conducted on them prior to granting the loan and the high interest rate was 
an indication of an unfair relationship between Ms E and Mrs G and GE Money Consumer 
Lending. Their representative also referred to a decision from an overseas court which it said 
had found that the corporate structure of the group of companies that included the holiday 
company was a fraud  and it says that the credit intermediary has gone into administration. 
This service forwarded those claims to GE Money Consumer Lending and it considered the 
claims under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It issued a final 
response letter to Ms E and Mr G in April 2022 in which it set out the reasons that it rejected 
the claims. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
they were outside of the time limit to make a misrepresentation claim under section 75 so it 
was fair for GE Money Consumer Lending to turn down that claim and he thought that their 
section 140A claim was raised too late. He said that he hadnt seen any persuasive evidence 
to support that the loan was unaffordable for them. He also said that the credit intermediary 
held the appropriate Office of Fair Trading authorisations to broker loans.
Ms E and Mr Gs representative has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, 
that:
its hugely onerous and overly technical to find that their section 140A claim is time-
barred when it was only eight months too late and Ms E and Mr G didnt know of the 
issues being raised until they brought their complaint;
section 9 of the Limitation Act applies and Ms E and Mr G are entitled to seek a 
declaration that the arrangements complained of were unlawful;
GE Money Consumer Lending hasnt provided the details of the intermediary who 
brokered the loan;
Ms E and Mr G have been pursued each year by the holiday company for payment of 
the maintenance fees  which they paid until their complaint  and each enforcement 
of the agreement creates a new limitation period; and
the holiday company has deliberately concealed facts relevant to Ms E and Mr Gs 
right of action so the period of limitation is extended until they discovered the 
concealment or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it under section 32 
of the Limitation Act.
I have issued a separate decision in which I described why this service doesnt have the 
legal power to consider Ms E and Mr Gs complaint about GE Money Consumer Lendings 
response to their section 75 claim. In this decision Ive set out my findings on its response to 
their section 140A claim.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Ms E and Mr Gs complaint about GE 
Money Consumer Lendings response to their section 140A claim shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Ms E and Mr Gs section 140A claim in this 
decision as only a court would be able to do that, but Im considering whether or not 
GE Money Consumer Lendings response to the claim that had been made was fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances;
Ms E and Mr Gs complaint is that GE Money Consumer Lending turned down the 
section 140A claim that theyd made to it and I accept that they referred their 
complaint to this service within six years of that happening - but I need to consider 
whether the Limitation Act applies to their claim;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
GE Money Consumer Lending has provided evidence to show that the loan was 
repaid in October 2013 - so Ms E and Mr G would have had six years from then to 
bring a claim against GE Money Consumer Lending about an unfair relationship with 
them  but they didnt contact GE Money Consumer Lending about their concerns 
until June 2020 and no claim about an unfair relationship was made until their 
representative complained to this service in January 2022;Ms E and Mr Gs June 2020 letter to GE Money Consumer Lending was more than 
six years after the loan agreement ended so was outside of the time limits set out in 
the Limitation Act and I consider that their claim under section 140A is now time-
barred;
Im not persuaded that the holiday companys enforcement of the membership 
agreement each year for the payment of the maintenance creates a new limitation 
period for their section 140A claim that there was an unfair relationship between 
Ms E and Mr G and GE Money Consumer Lending;
Ms E and Mr Gs representative says that section 9 of the Limitation Act applies  
that section says: An action to recover any sum recoverable by virtue of any 
enactment shall not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on 
which the cause of action accrued  Im not persuaded that section 9 extends the 
period in which they could make a claim against GE Money Consumer Lending under 
section 140A beyond the six year period from when the loan was repaid that is 
referred to above;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
deliberate concealment of any relevant information in these circumstances or that the 
holiday company has acted fraudulently and Im not persuaded that section 32 is 
applicable in these circumstances;
GE Money Consumer Lending said in response to Ms E and Mr Gs June 2020 letter 
that it understood that the credit broker had the requisite authorities in place initially 
under its Office of Fair Trading licence, which subsequently transferred to an interim 
permission, and then it was granted full permission to carry out regulated activities by 
the Financial Conduct Authority  it said that any further questions regarding its 
permissions or licences should be directed to the credit broker at the address that it 
provided;
a name was included on the loan agreement for the credit broker and I accept that 
the full name of the entity that provided the credit broking wasnt included but the 
credit broking took place in November 2008 and Ms E and Mr G didnt contact GE 
Money Consumer Lending about any issues with the credit broker until June 2020  
more than eleven years later;
I can understand Ms E and Mr Gs frustration that they dont know the full name of 
the credit broker but Ive seen no evidence to show that they contacted the credit 
broker using the information provided by GE Money Consumer Lending and Im not 
persuaded that theyve provided enough evidence to show that the credit broker for 
the loan wasnt authorised at that time to arrange the loan;
Ms E and Mr Gs representative says that proper credit checks werent carried out 
before the loan was made to Ms E and Mr G  but the application for the loan that 
was made to them in September 2008  and which they signed  showed that they 
were both employed, owned a property and had a joint annual income of £74,000  
so I consider that it would have been reasonable for GE Money Consumer Lending to 
have concluded that a monthly repayment of £231.81 was affordable for them;
the loan was repaid in October 2013 and Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan 
wasnt affordable for Ms E and Mr G when it was made to them or that theyve 
experienced any financial difficulties since then;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms E or Mr G asked GE Money Consumer 
Lending for any information about its credit checks before their representative sent 
their complaint to this service in January 2022  as the loan was made to them in 
November 2008 I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have raised 
any concerns about the credit checks before then and I consider it to be more likely than not that any complaint about the credit checks or the affordability of the loan 
would now be time-barred;
Ms E and Mr Gs representative says that the high rate of interest for the loan 
indicates an unfair relationship between Ms E and Mr G and GE Money Consumer 
Lending but they signed the loan agreement in November 2008 which clearly set out 
the annual rate of interest (and the APR), the amount of credit, the total charge for 
credit and the number and amount of the monthly repayments  if the rate of interest 
wasnt acceptable to them, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them not 
to have signed the loan agreement;
immediately above their signature on the loan agreement it says: This is a Credit 
Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be 
legally bound by its terms;
I understand that a company in the same group of companies as the holiday 
company has gone into administration but Ive seen no evidence to show that the 
holiday company hasnt provided the services under the membership agreement to 
which Ms E and Mr G were entitled  but they have stopped paying the management 
fees;
I consider that GE Money Consumer Lendings responses to Ms E and Mr Gs claims 
have been fair and reasonable and that it was fair and reasonable in these 
circumstances for it not to have upheld their section 140A claim; and
I sympathise with Ms E and Mr G for the issues that theyve had with their holiday 
club membership but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require GE 
Money Consumer Lending to refund to them any of the money that theyve paid 
under the loan agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action 
in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms E and Mr Gs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms E and Mr G to 
accept or reject my decision before 27 February 2023.
