The complaint
Mr M complains about (adverse) information recorded by Volkswagen Financial Services 
(UK) Limited (VWFS) with one or more third party credit reference agencies in respect of 
his car hire agreement (agreement).
What happened
In March 2023 VWFS agreed to remove any adverse information recorded with credit 
reference agencies in respect of Mr Ms agreement for the period November 2022 to 
March 2023 and to pay him £75.00 in compensation.
On 21 April 2023 VWFS paid Mr M £75.00.
On 24 April 2023 VWFS removed adverse information that was recorded with credit 
reference agencies for March 2023.
In May 2023, and after Mr M had returned the car on hire to him, VWFS invoiced him 
£402.30 for excess mileage and £110.00 for damage.
On 26 May 2023 VWFS paid Mr M £50.00.
On 10 May 2023 VWFS removed adverse information that was recorded with credit 
reference agencies for April 2023.
On 26 May 2023 a repayment plan was agreed with Mr M for the clearance of the excess 
mileage charge (£402.30), the damage charge (£110.00) and an outstanding monthly 
repayment (£182.39).
On 13 June 2023 VWFS removed adverse information that was recorded with credit 
reference agencies for May 2023.
On 10 July 2023 VWFS reduced the sum it was seeking the recovery of from Mr M by 
£100.00.
On 12 July 2023 Mr M complained to our service.
On 14 July 2023 VWFS removed adverse information that was recorded with credit 
reference agencies for May and June 2023.
On 26 July 2023 VWFS agreed to waive the outstanding balance due under Mr Ms 
agreement of £499.69 (£402.30 excess mileage charge plus £110.00 damage charge plus 
£182.39 outstanding payment less £100.00 compensation less payments made by Mr M of 
£45.00 and £50.00).
On 22 August 2023 VWFS removed adverse information that was recorded with credit 
reference agencies for June and July 2023 and marked the agreement as settled with a nil 
balance outstanding - backdated to April 2023.
Mr Ms complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that VWFS had 
done enough to fairly and reasonably compensate him.
Mr M didnt agree and so his complaint has been passed to me for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The sequence of events outlined above and the fact that Mr M had to contact VWFS on 
several occasions to have (incorrect) adverse information recorded with credit reference 
agencies removed isnt in dispute. So, in this decision, Ive simply concentrated on what 
VWFS should have to do to fairly and reasonably compensate Mr M for its poor service in 
this respect.
Ignoring the payments made by VWFS to Mr M of £75.00 and £50.00 and ignoring the 
monthly payment of £182.39 that VWFS says was due and owing from Mr M (in addition to 
the £402.30 excess mileage and £110.00 damage charge) VWFS has, in essence, 
compensated Mr M  £417.30 (£402.30 excess mileage charge plus £110.00 damage charge 
less payments made by Mr M of £45.00 and £50.00). Furthermore, whilst Mr Ms complaint 
has been under investigation by me VWFS has advised that its prepared to pay him a 
further £100.00.
Now I appreciate that Mr M may not agree. But given that he hasnt provided any 
documentary evidence in support of his submission that he was refused credit as a result of 
information recorded by VWFS with credit reference agencies and no documentary evidence 
to demonstrate that his agreement is now showing (with credit reference agencies) as 
anything other than settled with a nil outstanding balance, I can confirm that Im satisfied that 
VWFS, other than having to pay Mr M a further £100.00, need do nothing further. Put 
another way, I can confirm that Im satisfied that £517.30 represents a fair and reasonable 
sum to fairly and reasonably compensate Mr M for the distress and inconvenience this whole 
matter has caused him.
However, I would add that Mr M is free to raise a new complaint if it later transpires that 
credit reference agencies are recording, in respect of his agreement, adverse information 
that he disagrees with. 
My final decision
My final decision is that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited must pay Mr M 
£100.00, but it need do nothing further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2023.
