The complaint
T, a company, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc prevented it from making 
international payments and cancelled its card.
What happened
T had an account with NatWest. In 2021, its director, who Ill call D, travelled abroad on 
business. D wanted to make a payment of €4,000 to a supplier  and tried to do this using 
the NatWest app. But this didnt work. D then contacted NatWest to see if he could arrange 
the payment over the phone. D says this wasnt possible either. As a result, D says it had to 
make the payment using cash hed taken with him for travel expenses  and needed to 
withdraw further cash at an ATM.
A couple of months later, D was travelling again. He wanted to make a further payment. But, 
again, the app didnt work. D tried to activate the app  but says NatWest wanted to send a 
verification code by post. D asked again if he could arrange the payment by phone, but was 
told he couldnt. 
A few days later, Ts debit card was declined by a hotel D was staying at. D contacted 
NatWest and was told it couldnt reactivate the card. D says he was stuck abroad with no 
access to Ts account  and wasnt able to transfer funds from T to Ds account either. D 
says he had to borrow money to survive.
On his return to the UK, D went to the branch and ordered a new debit card. After this didnt 
arrive, D returned to the branch a second time and ordered a new card again. This didnt 
arrive either. D then called NatWest who sent him application forms for a new card. 
Dissatisfied, T complained to NatWest.
NatWest looked at this. It said it had in fact decided to close Ts accounts with NatWest  
and that it cancelled the card as part of this process. It said it was sorry that it hadnt 
explained this properly  and offered to pay T £250. T then referred the complaint to us.
Our investigator looked at the complaint. She thought that what NatWest had offered was 
fair.
T didnt agree. T reckons that it has lost in the region of €10,000 in deposits and expenses  
and had also lost projected income from contracts.
As the investigator couldnt resolve matters informally, the complaint has been referred to 
me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Based on what Ive seen, I think the compensation NatWest has offered is fair. Ill explain 
why.
Where I decide, or a business agrees, that a complaint should be upheld, any award Id 
make is intended to put the complainant as far as possible in the position theyd be in if 
things had happened as they should have done. And although I can award compensation for 
distress or inconvenience the businesss actions caused, this isnt to punish the business but 
to reflect the impact of its actions.
In this case the complainant is T. T is a limited company  and so is a separate legal entity 
from its director. And so while I dont doubt that D has had a difficult time personally, this 
isnt something I can compensate D for. I can, however, consider the impact NatWests 
actions had on T.
Ive first considered the difficulty T had transferring funds when D travelled abroad in June 
and August 2021. NatWest has said this was because T wasnt registered for online or 
telephone banking. This meant T couldnt sent payments using the app or over the phone  
and meant T would instead need to arrange these transfers in branch. Based on what Ive 
seen, it appears T began the process to sign up for online banking  requesting an online 
activation code  in May 2021. But T doesnt appear to have completed the process. T 
ordered a further code in August 2021, but this had to be delivered to Ts UK address. So T 
wasnt able to complete the process at this time either.
With all this in mind, while I accept that being unable to make these payments was 
inconvenient, I cant say NatWest has done anything wrong here. I note that T was able to 
make the first set of payments by withdrawing cash from an ATM. Im mindful that at the time 
T tried to make the second set of payments, D was already aware that he needed to register 
for online or telephone banking to make payments from abroad. T had some responsibility to 
check the account was set up to make payments remotely before D travelled on business for 
a second time. This isnt something I can fairly hold NatWest responsible for. So Im not 
going to tell NatWest to repay the additional travel costs T has mentioned or pay 
compensation for the contracts T says it lost.
Ive next turned to the cancellation of Ts debit card. NatWest says this followed its decision 
to close Ts accounts  at that point, NatWest cancelled Ts card. NatWest accepts that the 
card was cancelled sooner than it should have been. NatWest then tried to let T order new 
debit cards three times. It was only after T complained that NatWest explained that it wasnt 
in fact able to issue a new card  and I note NatWest didnt in fact give T formal notice that it 
was closing its accounts until November 2021. And so I accept that NatWest did something 
wrong here  and that caused T inconvenience. NatWest has offered to pay T £250. T thinks 
it should get more.
Ive thought about this. Given what NatWest has said, Im satisfied that it had decided to 
close Ts account at the point it cancelled the card, even if it didnt explain this to T until 
much later. So if things had happened as they should have done much of the inconvenience 
that followed  such as needing to open new accounts and rearrange Ts finances  would 
have happened anyway. Its also not clear why NatWest closed Ts account  weve asked 
NatWest for details of this, but NatWest hasnt provided it. The terms and conditions said 
that to close an account NatWest would normally need to give 60 days notice. Here, though, 
Ts account remained open for some time  even if, because of the cancellation of the card, 
T had difficulties making some payments from the account.
Ive therefore considered what NatWest needs to do to put things right. 
As Ive said, I can only compensate T for the impact NatWests actions had on it. I cannot 
compensate D. And though I accept D might have experienced distress because of what 
happened, T, as a limited company, cant experience distress.Weve asked T for information about the impact losing access to the card had on its 
business. In particular, weve asked to see details of contracts and payment terms. T says 
these contracts were arranged informally, through instance messaging, and so aside from 
some chat messages T hasnt been able to provide much further detail of the lost contracts.
I further note that T had access to a business credit card, which allowed it to pay some 
business expenses during the period it lacked access to the debit card  and that the direct 
debits for the credit card continued to be taken from Ts business account. This would have 
allowed T to mitigate the impact NatWests actions had on it.
I note Ts comments about the additional spending it had to make while D was abroad. Im 
not persuaded T wouldnt have occurred much of this additional expense in any event, given 
what Ive said above.
With all this in mind, while I accept that what NatWest did caused T some inconvenience, Im 
not persuaded to award more than the £250 it has already offered.
My final decision
For the reasons above, my final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc has offered 
fair compensation for the impact of its actions. It should now pay £250 to T if it hasnt 
already. I make no further award.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 August 2023.
