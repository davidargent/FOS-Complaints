The complaint
Miss B complains that NewDay Ltd lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Miss Bs complaint is about two credit cards with NewDay.
In July 2019 Miss B applied for a Fluid card. NewDay approved the application and gave 
Miss B a card with an initial credit limit of £600, The credit limit was increased to £1600 in 
March 2021 and to £2350 in May 2022.
In April 2021 Miss B applied for an Aqua card. NewDay approved the application and gave 
Miss B a card with an initial credit limit of £1200. The credit limit was increased to £2700 in 
May 2022.
Miss B complained that NewDay had lent to her irresponsibly. NewDay didnt uphold the 
complaint. It said it had carried out proper checks before lending to Miss B.
Miss B wasnt happy with the response and brought her complaint to this service.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. They said that NewDay had acted unfairly when it 
increased the credit limit on the Fluid account to £2350, and that NewDay had acted unfairly 
when it increased the credit limit on the Aqua card to £2700.
NewDay didnt reply to the investigators view so Ive been asked to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable lending is set out on our 
website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering Miss Bs complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say that NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure that Miss B could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable 
way. The nature of whats reasonable and proportionate will vary but could include things 
like the amount of credit, the total sum repayable, the amount of repayments, the cost of 
credit and the consumers individual circumstances.
Theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required to consider 
the factors Ive mentioned above when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate.
Fluid Account
Miss B declared annual income of £17000 when she applied for the account. She declared 
unsecured debt of £1000, NewDay carried out a credit search and found that Miss B had a 
historic default, no county court judgments and no accounts in arrears. The application was 
approved with an initial credit limit of £600.
Based on what Ive seen, and taking into account the low credit limit, I think NewDay carried 
out reasonable and proportionate checks and made a fair lending decision when  it approved 
the card.
Ive gone on to consider the credit limit increases in March 2021 and May 2022. In March 
2021 the credit limit was increased to £1600. A credit check carried out by NewDay showed 
that Miss B had unsecured debt of around £6500. NewDay has said that it looked at how 
Miss B had been handling the account. This shows that she had exceeded the credit limit 
and incurred a late payment fee in the last 6 months, but that this had been remedied the 
following month. Miss B had cleared the account one month before the credit limit increase. 
On balance, Im satisfied that NewDay made a fair lending decision when it increased the 
credit limit to £1600.
In May 2022 the credit limit was increased to £2350. NewDay has said that it looked at how 
Miss B had been manging her account. Ive reviewed this. This shows that Miss B had 
exceeded the credit limit and incurred a late payment fee in the last 6 months. The credit 
search showed that Miss B had exceeded her credit limits across all accounts in the months 
leading up to the increase. Looking at this information, I think there was a risk that Miss B 
was reliant on credit and wasnt likely to be able to repay the landing sustainably. In the 
circumstances, I dont think NewDay shouldve increased the credit limit to £2350. 
Aqua account
Miss B declared annual income of £24000 when she applied for the account. She also 
declared unsecured debt of £5400. NewDay carried out a credit search and found that Miss 
B had one historic default, no county court judgments and no accounts in arrears. The 
application was approved with an initial credit limit of £1200.
Based on what Ive seen, and taking into account the relatively low credit limit, I think the 
checks were reasonable and proportionate and I think the lending decision was fair.
Ive gone on to consider the credit limit increase to £2700. This took place at around the 
same time as the credit limit increase on the Fluid account. The same observations Ive 
made in relation to the Fluid account apply here. I dont think it was likely, based on the 
information available that Miss B was likely to be able to sustainably repay the credit. I dont 
think the credit limit increase to £2700 was a fair lending decision.
Putting things right
Fluid Account
NewDay should:
Rework the account removing all interest fees and charges applied to balances over £1600
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Miss B along with 8% 
simple interest per year calculated from the date of each overpayment to the date of 
settlement. *NewDay should remove all adverse information recorded after 12 May 2022 
regarding the account from Miss Bs credit file.
If, after the rework, the outstanding balance still exceeds £1600, NewDay should arrange an 
affordable repayment plan with Miss B for the remaining amount. Once Miss B has cleared 
the outstanding balance, any adverse information recorded after 12 May 2022 should be removed from her credit file
Aqua account
NewDay should:
Rework the account removing all interest fees and charges applied to balances over £1200
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Miss B along with 8% 
simple interest per year calculated from the date of each overpayment to the date of 
settlement. * NewDay should also remove all adverse information recorded after 3 May 2022 
regarding this account from Miss Bs credit file.
If, after the rework, the outstanding balance still exceeds £1200, NewDay should arrange an 
affordable repayment plan with Miss B for the remaining amount. Once Miss B has cleared 
the outstanding balance any adverse information recorded after 3 May 2022 should be 
removed from her credit file. 
*HMRC requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. NewDay must give Miss 
B a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. NewDay Ltd must take the steps Ive set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 June 2023.
