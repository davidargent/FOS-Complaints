The complaint
Mr M complains about delays and inconvenience caused when National Westminster Bank 
Plc (NatWest) replaced his debit card. 
What happened
NatWest has explained it changed its debit cards from Visa to Mastercard in November 
2022. In advance of the change, NatWest issued a Mastercard debit card to Mr M in October 
2022 but it wasnt received. 
When Mr Ms existing debit card stopped working he contacted NatWest and ordered a new 
one to his local branch. Mr M also raised a complaint. 
NatWest issued a final response to Mr M and apologised for the issues raised. NatWest also 
apologised for the way calls from Mr M had been handled and paid him a total of £125 for 
the trouble and upset caused. NatWest also said it would order a replacement debit card to 
be sent to Mr Ms local branch for collection. 
After Mr M experienced some problems using NatWests Get Cash code at a cash machine 
it paid him a further £60 as a gesture of goodwill. 
There were some delays in receiving the debit card and it had to be reordered several times. 
But Mr M was able to collect and activate a new debit card from the branch and in February 
2023 NatWest issued a follow up response awarding a further £125. 
Mr M referred his complaint to this service and explained he didnt feel the compensation 
awarded was fair. An investigator looked at Mr Ms case. Whilst they agreed Mr M had been 
inconvenienced, they felt the existing awards totalling £310 were a fair way to settle his 
complaint and didnt ask NatWest to take further action. Mr M asked to appeal and said he 
remained of the view that NatWest had failed to deal with his card replacement adequately 
and that the compensation awarded didnt reflect his experience. As Mr M asked to appeal, 
his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Mr M was frustrated when his Visa debit card stopped working last 
year. But NatWest has explained it had sent Mr M a replacement around a month before his 
existing card stopped working. I appreciate Mr M didnt receive the new Mastercard debit 
card, but Ive seen NatWests system records which confirm it was produced and sent as 
claimed. I note that Mr M updated his address with NatWest on 5 December 2022 so its 
possible the original replacement sent went to his previous address. I also think its more 
likely that Mr M wouldve received NatWests replacement debit card if his address had been 
up to date at the time it was sent. 
Shortly after Mr Ms card stopped working he contacted NatWest and it ordered a 
replacement to be sent to his local branch. Mr Ms suggested that cards were issued to the 
wrong branch and I can see some replacement cards were cancelled by NatWest. But the 
card Mr M is currently using was issued at the end of December 2022 and sent to the branch 
requested. I can see that once it was collected and activated Mr M was able to use it from 23 
January 2023. 
Mr Ms told us about difficulties accessing cash in branch and using NatWests Get Cash 
codes at cash machines. I appreciate this was less convenient than using a debit card to 
access Mr Ms account. But Mr Ms statements shows he was able to regularly access cash 
from his account during the period he was without a debit card. Ive factored what Mr Ms 
told us about the inconvenience caused when deciding how to fairly resolve his complaint. 
I agree with Mr M that there were delays and inconvenience caused to him when NatWest 
replaced his debit card last year. Mr Ms explained he was without access to his card for 
around 42 days and I dont doubt how frustrating that was for him. But NatWest took steps to 
try and resolve the problem and at the end of December 2022 was able to issue the 
replacement debit card to Mr Ms branch that he went on to activate and use. Mr M has 
recently given us further comments on the way the situation has impacted him and his 
mental health. Id like to assure Mr M Ive read and considered everything hes told us.
Whilst I accept the issues raise did cause Mr M distress and inconvenience, I think the total 
settlement of £310 NatWest has paid to date recognises that and is a fair and reasonable 
way to resolve his complaint. To put it another way, the settlement is very much in line with 
what I wouldve told NatWest to pay having taken Mr Ms circumstances and complaint into 
account had no offer been made. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr M but as Im satisfied NatWest has now resolved the debit card 
issues he experienced and has paid a settlement that is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances Im not telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc has already agreed a settlement that is 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 September 2023.
