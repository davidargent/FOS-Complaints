K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that Aviva Insurance Limited set up a home emergency policy and took 
payment from his bank  account without his permission. 
background
Mr Bs complaint is about a HomeServe policy and so Ill refer to HomeServe throughout this 
decision. But the policy is underwritten by Aviva  and theyre the responsible  business for the 
complaint. 
In May 2018, HomeServe set up a home  emergency policy for Mr B, and a direct debit to 
pay the premiums. A premium of £9.67  was taken from Mr Bs bank account in June 2018. 
Mr B complained to HomeServe that he hadnt  asked for the policy to be set up. 
HomeServe explained that theyd taken over responsibility for the home emergency policies 
previously administered by another business.  Mr Bs policy transferred to HomeServe when 
it was due for renewal. 
HomeServe said theyd set up the new policy because  the previous business  had told them 
Mr Bs account was still active and should be renewed. But when they investigated they 
found out that Mr B had told the previous  business in February 2018 that he wouldnt be 
renewing the policy. HomeServe said this information hadnt been passed  to them  and so 
theyd gone ahead and renewed  the policy. 
  
HomeServe apologised to Mr B for what had happened. They refunded  the premium  that 
hed paid, plus £1 in interest. They also offered £100  in compensation for the distress 
caused to Mr B. 
Mr B was unhappy with HomeServes response  and so he brought his complaint to the 
ombudsman service. He thought  compensation of £5,000 would be more  appropriate  in the 
circumstances.
Our investigator looked into Mr Bs complaint. She thought  HomeServe had acted in good 
faith, but unfortunately the previous  business  had provided them  with incorrect information. 
As a result, a policy was set up and funds were taken from Mr B when they shouldnt have 
been. She accepted that this had caused distress  and inconvenience to Mr B. But in her 
most recent assessment, she thought the compensation offered by HomeServe was 
reasonable.    
Mr B disagrees and has asked for an ombudsman to make a final decision. He says there 
are broader  principles at stake because HomeServe have unlawfully held his data and taken 
money from him.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
HomeServe have accepted that they got things  wrong. Mr Bs policy shouldnt have been set 
up and they shouldnt have taken payment from him. So the key point I need to look at is 
what HomeServe should  do to put things right.
Ref: DRN41918812Ive taken account of what  HomeServe have said about the cause of the problem. Theyve  
said the previous  business failed to record that Mr B didnt want to renew  his policy, and 
therefore passed HomeServe incorrect information.  I note that Mr B has also complained  to 
the previous business about  this.
Although HomeServe werent responsible for the initial  mistake, they set up Mr Bs policy 
and took a premium  without his authorisation.  
 
HomeServe refunded promptly the premium that had been taken from Mr Bs account. 
They also added a payment for interest once  theyd investigated his complaint. 
As well as refunding  the payment, its right that HomeServe should  also compensate Mr B 
for the distress and inconvenience hes been caused. Mr B says whats  happened has 
caused him a great deal of stress and had a significant impact  on his health and wellbeing. 
He says its taken  him about 20 hours  to resolve  things, which took him away from his 
business. And Mr B has said HomeServe infringed his privacy  by taking a payment  from his 
account without  permission.
Id like to reassure Mr B that Ive considered  carefully everything hes said. I understand why 
he feels strongly about whats happened. And I appreciate that its caused him distress  and 
inconvenience. 
But were  not the regulator, and its not our role to punish businesses. Where something  has 
gone wrong, we look at the impact its had and whether what the business  has done to put 
things right is fair and reasonable.  And overall,  I think HomeServes offer to pay Mr B £100  in 
compensation is fair and reasonable. 
I realise this wont be the decision Mr B was hoping for, but I wont  be asking HomeServe to 
do anything more. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I consider Aviva Insurance  Limiteds 
offer of £100 in compensation to be fair and reasonable. Its now up to Mr B to decide 
whether or not to accept  that offer. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 February  2019.
