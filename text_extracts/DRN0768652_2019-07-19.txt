K821x#15complaint
M, a limited company, complains about  the closure of its account with Advanced Payment 
Solutions Limited (trading  as CashPlus), and about a delay in paying out the remaining 
funds. Ms complaint  is brought by a director, Mr B.
background
CashPlus closed Ms account with it. It says it gave  M 60 days notice in a letter dated 4 
September 2018, and it was intending to close his account on 3 November 2018. But Mr B 
said M didnt receive the letter  about  that, and no one told him about it either, in a number of 
calls he had with CashPlus after the intended date of closure. 
Mr B said he didnt  find out about the closure  until 27 November, well after the intended 
closure date, when Ms card stopped  working. And that meant he didnt have a chance to 
take the money out of Ms account  before the account was closed.
Mr B didnt actually believe this letter had been  sent.  He thought  that CashPlus made that 
up, and had actually decided to close his account  in the days following that date, when M 
took a complaint to our service  about  CashPlus.
Mr B was unhappy that CashPlus had delayed the account closure past 3 November, the 
time when  it had apparently intended  the account  would close, because that delayed the 
time it took to get back the money that was left in Ms account. Once the account  was 
closed, Mr B wanted CashPlus to send the remaining money by bank transfer, but it would 
only send it by cheque. And that wasnt issued  until Mr B specifically  rang to ask for it, on 12 
December. The cheque  was then issued on 21 December 2018. 
Mr B said that M had received a letter  responding  to his complaint,  but it was full of mistakes. 
And he said M still hadnt received the cheque that CashPlus had told him it had sent. 
Mr B pointed out a number of errors  that had been  made by CashPlus when it was talking to 
him and writing to him. He said that these had made him deeply  suspicious of what  
CashPlus had done. He thought it was lying to him. 
CashPlus showed  us the letter it said was sent to Mr B, giving notice that Ms account would 
be closed in 60 days, dated  4 September 2018.  The letter  said Ms card would stop working  
on 3 November. 
The letter CashPlus subsequently sent to Mr B about  Ms complaint did contain a mistake.  It 
said that the account was going to close  on 2 April 2018, but that date was wrong.  (It was 
before the letter was sent, or the account  had even been opened.)  CashPlus says the 
account was actually due to be closed  on 3 November. It wasnt actually closed until 19 
November, and payments  were  made  into and out of the account after 3 but before 19 
November.
CashPluss policy is only to pay a closing balance by cheque,  and not to pay that balance 
until the cheque  is specifically requested by the customer. So it didnt  think it had done 
anything wrong, by following that policy in this case.
Ref: DRN07686522Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that the letter  about  
Ms account  closure  had been sent by tracked  post,  but he said it didnt have to be. He 
thought it had been sent, and didnt think it was CashPluss fault if it hadnt arrived. 
But our investigator said that Mr B was given a lot of conflicting information about why his 
account had been closed.  He said this wouldve been very confusing for Mr B. 
Our investigator said that CashPlus  would only pay Ms account  balance by cheque.  But it 
transferred some other  money it owed  M directly to Ms bank. So our investigator thought 
that CashPlus  couldve transferred Ms outstanding balance too. Especially as Mr B had told 
CashPlus that not having this money would mean M couldnt  pay its bills, and might cause 
the business to fold. 
Our investigator said that M still hadnt  got the cheque, so if M hadnt received and cashed  
the cheque, then CashPlus should  send the money by bank transfer. 
Our investigator said that this delay in receiving  money had an impact  on M. He thought 
CashPlus should  pay M £250 to make  up for that. 
CashPlus didnt agree with that. It didnt explain why. It told us some  time ago that it would 
send further information, but that information  hasnt been received at our service, and we 
havent heard from it in some months.  This case is now with me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive reached the same overall conclusion  
on this complaint as our investigator, and for broadly  the same reasons.
CashPlus doesnt  have  to provide M with an account  if it doesnt want  to. And it isnt 
necessarily obliged to explain  to M why it wants  to stop offering it an account.  CashPlus 
decided to stop offering M an account, and wrote to it on 4 September  to say that. 
Ive not just seen  that letter, Ive also seen internal notes that confirm it was issued on 4 
September. I know that Mr B doesnt  accept that CashPlus  issued the letter on this date, but 
I think its more likely than not that it did. 
I do understand though why Mr B is so suspicious of what hes been told by CashPlus. Its 
provided Mr B with confusing and contradictory accounts of what  has happened on Ms 
account. I think that M received quite poor service from CashPlus.
I also know that Mr B has taken issue with the date of closure of Ms account, because if 
CashPlus had closed Ms account when it said it would, then its money wouldve been 
returned sooner.  I understand  that argument,  but M would also have lost the benefit of being 
able to use this account for an extra couple of weeks. Ive not seen anything to suggest to 
me that the advantage of having a cheque  issued sooner wouldve outweighed that 
inconvenience in this case. And I think we do have to bear in mind  that it may not have made 
any difference to when  M received the remaining funds anyway, because Ms cheque didnt 
actually arrive. So I dont  think that M has been  particularly disadvantaged by the fact that 
CashPlus didnt close its account until later in November, and I dont think  CashPlus has to 
do anything to make up for that.
Ref: DRN07686523But I agree  with our investigator that CashPlus delayed unreasonably in refunding Ms 
money. Mr B told it what the impact on M would be of delay. I expect  that CashPlus couldnt  
actually have made a money transfer  to M on the same day as it closed Ms account, as 
there wouldnt yet be another business  account  in place, and CashPlus would be concerned 
about putting this money  into a personal  account. But I think  that when Mr B told CashPlus 
about the impact  a 30-day  wait for funds  would have on his business, it was reasonable to 
expect CashPlus either to issue a cheque as a matter of some urgency, or to offer a transfer  
once another  account was open. It didnt do either  of those things.  I think that was a mistake.  
I dont think I can hold CashPlus responsible for additional delay caused  by its cheque not 
arriving. But I do think the cheque shouldve been issued more promptly than it was. And I 
think its reasonable to assume that a delay in getting this money  to M caused  it significant 
problems. Mr B initially rang CashPlus to say he was trying to pay a bill, before he knew the 
account was closed, so M clearly had bills to pay. I agree with our investigator that CashPlus 
should pay £250 for the problems the delay in issuing a cheque  to M have caused it.
I will also require  that, if CashPlus cant show that M has received and cashed its cheque, M 
must cancel  that cheque  and pay M the balance owing by bank transfer.  
my final decision
My final decision is that Advanced Payment Solutions Limited (trading  as CashPlus) must 
pay M £250 in compensation. And if Advanced Payment Solutions Limited (trading as 
CashPlus) cant show that M has cashed  a cheque for the balance in Ms account when it 
closed, then Advanced  Payment Solutions  Limited (trading as CashPlus) must  cancel  that 
cheque and pay M the outstanding balance by bank  transfer.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 August 2019.
