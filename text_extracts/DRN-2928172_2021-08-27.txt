The complaint
Miss G complains about the way PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) handled Direct 
Debit payments to her credit account.
  
What happened
Miss G has a credit account with PayPal which was opened in May 2020. She set up a 
Direct Debit to make monthly payments to the account from her bank account. But Miss G 
says that PayPal doesnt always take the Direct Debit payment on the agreed date. She 
says she puts money into her bank account in time for the Direct Debit to be taken, but 
PayPal sometimes takes the payment later than the agreed date. She says this means the 
funds arent always in her account when it does try to take payment. Miss G says this has 
had a negative impact on her account and credit file. 
Miss G wants PayPal to take the Direct Debit on the scheduled date and remove the 
adverse entries from her credit file. She asked this service to look at her complaint. Our 
investigator didnt think PayPal needed to do anything here. But Miss G didnt agree and 
asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman.
PayPal has since clarified that it cancelled the Direct Debit in November 2020 following two 
unsuccessful payments. There hasnt been a Direct Debit in place to pay the credit account 
since that time. PayPal says it contacted Miss G in November 2020 to tell her that the Direct 
Debit had been cancelled. But its offered to credit her account with £75 as a goodwill 
gesture to acknowledge any confusion that may have been caused. Miss G remains very 
unhappy about the situation and isnt satisfied that she wont experience the same issues 
again if she sets up a new Direct Debit. As the situation remains unresolved, Im now making 
a final decision about the complaint.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the terms and conditions of Miss Gs credit account and I think its helpful to 
start by summarising the relevant provisions here: 
The due date of Miss Gs monthly minimum payment is shown on her statement each 
month. 
The first payment was due on the date set out in Miss Gs first statement.
Payment can be made by various methods, including Direct Debit. Miss Gs 
statements confirm that Direct Debit payments will be taken on the due date. 
PayPal can charge a failed payment fee if the Direct Debit fails. 
The terms and conditions set out the consequences of Miss G missing a payment. 
These include incurring interest and a late payment fee as well as Miss Gs credit 
record being affected in a way that makes it more difficult or expensive for her to 
obtain further credit.
Miss G says there were problems with the Direct Debit right from the start as no payment 
was taken in the first month as she was expecting. She says the Direct Debit wasnt taken 
until five days after the scheduled payment date. Ive looked at Miss Gs statements. The 
first statement for the credit account was issued on 25 June 2020. It confirms that the first 
payment was due on 20 July 2020. Im satisfied that the first Direct Debit payment was 
collected successfully on 20 July 2020. So I dont think PayPal made any mistakes in 
relation to that.
Im also satisfied that the August and September 2020 payments were collected successfully 
by Direct Debit on the due dates shown on Miss Gs PayPal credit statements. Im aware 
that Miss Gs bank statements show these payments going out a few days later. But I dont 
find that to be a mistake by PayPal as Im satisfied that the payments are reflected on her 
PayPal credit account on the due dates. If Miss G is concerned about the dates of the debits 
on her current account statements, she should raise that with her bank.
Moving on to the October payment, this was due on 20 October 2020 and the minimum 
payment was £37.75. PayPal says it tried to take payment on this date but there were 
insufficient funds in Miss Gs account, so the Direct Debit failed. It says the same thing 
happened the following month. Payment of £35.78 was due on 19 November 2020. On both 
occasions, Im satisfied that PayPal tried to take payment on the due date. 
Miss Gs PayPal statements show credits being made to her account on both the October 
and November due dates. But these had to be reversed later, as both these Direct Debits 
failed. Ive seen Miss Gs bank statements and Im satisfied that, on both these occasions, 
there wasnt enough money in her account to cover the Direct Debits to PayPal. So I dont 
find it to be PayPals fault that these Direct Debit payments failed.
PayPal says that, following these two unsuccessful payments, the Direct Debit was 
cancelled by its system. I dont think that was unreasonable. Im satisfied that PayPal sent 
an email to Miss G on 26 November 2020 saying that the Direct Debit had been cancelled. It 
sent her another email the next day saying that her Direct Debit payment had been 
unsuccessful. Im satisfied that these messages were sent to Miss Gs correct email address 
and Ive no reason to doubt that she received them. So Im satisfied that Miss G was told 
that the Direct Debit had been cancelled.
For these reasons, I dont think PayPal acted unreasonably or unfairly in relation to the 
Direct Debit. It collected the payments when it said it would between July and September 
2020. It tried to collect payments on the correct dates in October and November 2020. 
These Direct Debits failed because there werent enough funds in Miss Gs bank account on 
those dates. So PayPal cancelled the Direct Debit in November 2020 and wrote to Miss G to 
tell her this. PayPal has a duty to report accurate information about Miss Gs account to the 
credit reference agencies and I dont think it acted unfairly by doing that here. So Im not 
going to ask PayPal to do anything about these issues.
But I think PayPals communications with Miss G about the cancelled Direct Debit could 
have been clearer. The first message said Youve successfully cancelled your PayPal 
Credit Direct Debit. But it wasnt Miss G who had cancelled it  it was PayPal. So this 
message may have been confusing. The next message (sent the following day) said Your 
PayPal Credit Direct Debit payment was unsuccessful. This likely added to any confusion 
as it casts doubt on whether the Direct Debit had been cancelled or not. It stands to reason 
that the payment would have failed if the Direct Debit had been cancelled (as per the first 
email). So, a subsequent email saying that payment has been unsuccessful implies that the 
Direct Debit should still have been working.It seems that Miss G wasnt aware until now that the Direct Debit had been cancelled. She 
was unhappy that payments hadnt been taken on the dates she was expecting. PayPal 
recently confirmed that there isnt currently a Direct Debit in place and that there hasnt been 
since November 2020. But it didnt make this clear in its response to the complaint. So I think 
PayPal should pay some compensation to Miss G to recognise this mistake and the impact it 
had. PayPal has already offered to pay £75 and I think thats a fair amount in the 
circumstances here. If PayPal chooses to pay this by making a credit to Miss Gs account, I 
think that would be fair.
I realise Miss G isnt happy with PayPals response and she is concerned that, if she sets up 
a new Direct Debit, PayPal wont take the payment on the day the statements say its due. 
She says she needs this resolving so that PayPal will collect Direct Debit payments on the 
date they say they will. But, for the reasons Ive set out above, I find that PayPal did take 
payments on the due dates while the Direct Debit was active. So Im not going to ask them 
to do anything differently going forward. And I cant make an award in relation to any 
problems which might arise in the future but havent yet happened.
PayPal has confirmed that the only way for future payments to be taken automatically is for 
Miss G to set up a new Direct Debit. Alternatively, PayPal has suggested that Miss G could 
process her payments manually. I think thats reasonable. Its for Miss G to choose how she 
wants to make payments to her PayPal credit account going forward. But Im not going to 
ask PayPal to do any more here.
  
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint in part. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
should pay compensation of £75.00 to Miss G.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 September 2021.
