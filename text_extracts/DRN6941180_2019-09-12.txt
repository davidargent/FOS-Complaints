K820x#14complaint
Mr L complains  that Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) hasnt refunded all the arrears  he was owed. 
background
Mr L previously  had a mortgage  account  with Lloyds before this was transferred to another  
bank that Ill refer to as B. 
In 2017 Lloyds contacted  Mr L informing him it had decided  to refund arrears management 
charges paid by its customers between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2015.  So this 
meant Mr L was entitled to a refund of any of these  charges applied  to his account  before 
the mortgage was transferred to B in 2013.
In May 2018  Mr L was contacted again by Lloyds saying he was owed £368.14. Mr L says 
he didnt receive  this money so he complained. Lloyds  reviewed  Mr Ls complaint  and upheld  
it in part. It said that Mr L had been  refunded the correct amount of fees of £368.14  in 
October 2018. And a cheque to Mr L of £89.85  was cashed in August 2017. However, it did 
think Mr L was entitled to some compensation. Mr L remained unhappy with this offer so he 
brought his complaint to this service. 
Our investigator reviewed  the complaint but felt the offer from Lloyds was fair overall. She 
said Lloyds had paid the £368.14  Mr L was owed more than once and had offered him a fair 
amount of compensation. Mr L disagreed. He said he feels Lloyds still owes  him £98.86  in 
fees because  he received  a letter from B in October 2018 saying he had received  charges 
and fees on his mortgage of £467.  He also says he is entitled to more compensation for the 
inconvenience this has caused him.  
So this complaint has now been  passed  to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not going to uphold 
this complaint. I know Mr L will be disappointed by this so Ill explain why below.  
Its worth  noting that Mr L had a similar complaint with B about his arrears. This has already 
been considered and a final decision has been  issued. So my role here is to see if Mr L has 
been refunded  the correct amount of arrears  by Lloyds and whether he has been treated 
fairly. 
I can understand why Mr L feels he hasnt been refunded the correct  amount of arrears. But 
from the information Ive seen  I think  Lloyds  has paid Mr L more than a fair amount of the 
arrears and compensation to cover his time and costs. 
  
Mr L has received a letter from B which says the total amount of fees and charges on his 
mortgage were £467. From the evidence Ive seen Im satisfied Lloyds has paid Mr L a fair 
amount of the charges  on this mortgage.  I can see Mr L was sent two cheques which totalled 
£368.14 in 2017. Both these cheques were  cashed. He was then sent a further  £368.14 in 
October 2018. So Im satisfied Mr L has received  from Lloyds more than the charges that 
were applied to his mortgage. 
Ref: DRN69411802I can see that Mr L has made numerous calls to Lloyds  in order  to resolve this issue. And Im 
satisfied this would have caused  him inconvenience. But I dont believe the offer from Lloyds  
is unfair in the circumstances.  Mr L has been  given £186.50 in compensation for this 
complaint. I think this is a fair amount when considering what has happened here. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 October  2019.
