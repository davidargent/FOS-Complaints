The complaint
Mr N complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) refused to allow the sale of part of 
his property, based on a flawed property valuation report. 
What happened
Mr N says he approached NatWest in October 2020 to discuss both the sale of a parcel of 
land on his property and to negotiate a new interest rate on his mortgage account, relating to 
that property. Mr N says NatWest informed him a valuation report would be required given 
he was selling part of the land. When the valuation report was received by NatWest, from its 
appointed valuer, Mr N was told NatWest wouldnt consent to  the sale of the land, as the 
report had highlighted various issues. Mr N is unhappy that NatWest have relied upon a 
valuation report that is incorrect and will not allow him to discuss this with the valuer directly. 
Mr N wants the valuation report to be properly completed so he can progress with the sale of 
the land and for NatWest to refund the valuation fee. 
NatWest says although it accepts it provided poor service at times during the valuation 
process, and it could have been clearer communicating the valuers findings, it had 
apologised for that and paid compensation to Mr N. That said, NatWest feel it hadnt acted 
unfairly by accepting the valuation report from an accredited professional firm, as the reason 
behind why it declined Mr Ns request to release the parcel of land he wished to sell.  
Mr N wasnt happy with NatWests response and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator pointed out it wasnt the role of this service to comment on the accuracy of the 
valuation report itself, only if NatWest were entitled to rely on it when considering a change 
to its security for Mr Ns mortgage account. The investigator felt NatWest were entitled to 
rely on the valuation it had instructed, and this had been carried out by a professionally 
accredited firm. The investigator accepted NatWest had provided poor service on occasions 
during the valuation process, but it had adequately compensated Mr N for that.  
Mr N didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding this complaint and I will explain how I have come to my 
decision. 
I can understand it would have been upsetting for Mr N to be told NatWest werent agreeable 
to release a parcel of land on his property mortgaged to them, as a result of the valuers 
opinion contained in a valuation report it had instructed. 
When looking at this complaint, I will consider if NatWest acted fairly when it relied on the 
valuation report it had instructed, to decide if it was willing to release a parcel of land on Mr 
Ns property that was mortgaged to it. 
The first thing to say is it has been accepted by NatWest, that it could have provided a better 
service during the course of the valuation process, including incorrectly charging the wrong 
valuation fees, poorly communicating the valuers comments and some of the time it took to 
do this. But Im satisfied these points have been addressed directly to Mr N, apologised for 
and adequate compensation paid by NatWest. 
That said, Mr Ns complaint centres around NatWest accepting, what he believed was an 
incompetently carried out valuation report. Mr N feels NatWest shouldnt be able to base its 
lending decisions, on a valuation report he believes is fundamentally incorrect.  
The first thing to say here is I can only comment on whether NatWest acted fairly on relying 
on the valuation report provided to them by their appointed valuers, and not whether the 
surveyor has correctly reported on the property - that is not within the jurisdiction of this 
service. What I can say is, I have seen the valuation report and the valuers instructed are 
NatWest panel members with Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) membership, 
and the surveyor carrying out the valuation was fully qualified, working independently of 
NatWest.
Here, the valuer informed NatWest there was shared access issues and Mr Ns proposals 
impacted on the future saleability of the remaining property. I can see that Mr N disagrees 
with that and has commented why, but here its not for me to decide if either party is correct 
or not. What is important here, is NatWest have relied upon the comments of an 
independently appointed professional valuer and I cant say that was unreasonable of them 
to do so.
Its worth saying NatWest did submit a post valuation query to the valuer but this didnt alter 
the valuers view. I can also see NatWest informed Mr N that hed need to involve his 
solicitor to deal with the issues raised in the valuation report, to see if that may alter the 
valuers opinion  but I cant see that has taken place. In addition, NatWest have also 
confirmed the valuation report it received wouldnt affect the mortgage Mr N already held 
with them. 
Its fair to say NatWest are entitled to decide, having received professional advice, if it 
wishes to release any land mortgaged to it, especially if it felt that may negatively affect the 
value of the security it holds. I understand that Mr N feels strongly about the content of the 
valuation report and is unhappy he cant discuss this directly with the valuer  but here the 
valuer was employed by NatWest to act on its behalf for its mortgage purposes. 
With that in mind I cant say NatWest should refund the valuation fee here, as instructing the 
valuation doesnt guarantee agreement to any proposals put to it. NatWest have already 
informed Mr N, if he wishes to pursue the refund of his valuation fee, he can directly 
approach the appropriate professional body, RICS - that is for Mr N to decide here.
While Mr N will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of NatWest.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2022.
