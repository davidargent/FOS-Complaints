The complaint
Miss H complains that NewDay Ltd increased her credit limit from £500 to £1,250. She said
this level of debt wasnt affordable for her, she couldnt pay back the lending, and she ended
up in financial difficulties.
What happened
Miss H told us that NewDay contacted her in February 2020 to increase the limit on her card
from £500 to £1,250. She said she had only made minimum payments on the credit card
before then, and she was using a very high level of her available credit.
Miss H told us that at that time her take-home pay was averaging £1,600 a month, she was
paying about £1,000 in rent and household bills, and about £200 in food and clothes costs.
She said she then had over £12,000 of debt and her monthly debt repayments were over
£400. The minimum payment on the card was over £100 a month. She said she just couldnt
afford this.
Miss H said NewDay shouldve realised that she could not repay her balance within a
reasonable length of time, so it should not have let her borrow more.
Miss H said she wanted to be refunded all the interest she had paid and late payment
charges. She wanted like any markers to be removed from her credit file. And she wanted
her account to be cleared.
NewDay didnt think it had done anything wrong. It said that when the card account was
opened, Miss H told it she was living with parents and employed with an annual income of
£17,460. Her credit file showed no accounts in arrears and no active debt management or
repayment plans. She did owe £258 on payday lending, but that had not been in arrears in
the last 6 months or defaulted in the last 12 months. NewDay said it knew that Miss H had
defaults in the past, and what it refers to as a public record (likely to be a county court
judgment) but those were over three years earlier. So it thought it could lend Miss H a
modest amount to start, then offer increased lending as time went on.
Miss H doesnt complain about this initial lending.
NewDay said that when the credit limit increase from £500 to £1,250 was offered, the card
had only been used for retail purchases. Miss H had been making her payments every
month as per the terms of the agreement, with only one late fee charged and no over limit
fees applied. NewDay said that Miss Hs credit file showed no arrears or financial difficulty or
affordability indicators and no active payday loans. So NewDay said that there were no clear
concerns which ought to have meant it shouldnt make this increase.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. She said that NewDay hadnt
provided any evidence that it had reviewed Miss Hs income and financial commitments
before offering this increase, and the previous information NewDay had received showed
that Miss H had got into financial difficulties before. Our investigator said that if NewDay had
carried out a full review, it should have realised that the increase was unaffordable.
NewDay disagreed. It wanted to know where our investigator had got additional information
from about Miss Hs financial position at the time. It said that it couldnt see Miss Hs bank
statements, and it didnt think that it should be judged against detailed information from
those statements.
Because NewDay didnt agree with our investigator, this case was passed to me for a final
decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did not propose to 
uphold it. This is what I said then: 
I know that Miss H has told us shes in a difficult financial situation, and she isnt able 
to pay her credit card bill now. And Im sorry to hear shes having difficulties. But 
what Ive got to consider isnt whether the credit limit increase NewDay made in 
February 2020 ended up being affordable for Miss H. What Ive got to think about is 
whether NewDay shouldve known, at the time this increase was made, that Miss H 
wasnt going to be able to afford this.
And that means Ive got to look at the information that was available to NewDay at 
the time. NewDay knew how Miss H had been managing her card. And it has sent us 
the statements to show this. It says that Miss H was usually only paying the 
minimum, but she had made all her payments, and all but one of these was on time. I 
can see the one payment Miss H made late, was late by only two days. And she had 
used all of her available credit, but her purchases werent essential spending. 
NewDay said Miss Hs card usage didnt make it think she was in financial difficulties.
Miss H said she was spending significant amounts on rent and living expenses. But 
she had told NewDay some months earlier that she was living at home. And there 
wasnt anything in Miss Hs usage of the card to suggest that her financial situation 
had changed, when NewDay decided to lend Miss H more money.
Importantly, NewDay has also sent us information on what Miss Hs credit file 
showed when it made the decision to lend her more money. At that time, her used 
credit (which covers this credit card, cards held elsewhere, as well as loans) only 
totalled just over £1,000, about half of which was the NewDay card itself.
I can see that Miss Hs used credit did then leap up to over £16,000. I cant tell what 
this was for. But whatever this lending was for, it only took effect after NewDay had 
made this credit limit increase.
If NewDay had been aware that Miss H had debts totalling over £16,000, on an 
annual income of not much more than that, then I would not have expected it to make 
this increase without asking for a considerable amount of further information on Miss 
Hs financial situation. But what NewDay has sent us shows that it didnt know that. 
This lending doesnt show on her credit file until the month after the increase 
NewDay made.
So, at the time that NewDay made this increase, I dont think it had any reason to 
think either that this increase definitely wouldnt be affordable for Miss H, or that it 
ought to doublecheck, and seek further information from her, before it made any 
lending decisions.And for that reason, although I know Miss H will be disappointed, I dont think this 
complaint should be upheld.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Neither side replied.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the decision I originally proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 September 2021.
