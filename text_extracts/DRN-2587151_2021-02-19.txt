The complaint
Mr L complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA refused to reimburse him for the cost of 
returning an item he had successfully rejected under its buyer protection policy.
What happened
In July 2020 Mr L bought an item of furniture from overseas and paid for it with his PayPal 
account. When the item arrived it had a missing part, and in November he raised a claim 
under PayPals buyer protection policy. This claim was upheld, and PayPal instructed him to 
return the item to the seller, at his own expense, and provide the tracking number to PayPal. 
When the item was received by the seller, PayPal would refund Mr L what he had paid for it, 
but not the cost of mailing the item back. Mr L protested against posting the item overseas at 
his own cost, and PayPal told him he could return it to the sellers UK branch instead.
Mr L refused to accept that outcome. He insisted that he was entitled to receive a refund of 
the cost of posting the item back. He complained, but PayPal said it had reached its decision 
in line with its buyer protection policy. Mr L brought this complaint to our Service.
Our investigator did not uphold this complaint. He quoted a passage from the policy which 
stated that PayPal was not obliged to refund, or require the seller to refund, the cost of 
returning an item.
Mr L did not accept that decision, and so he asked for an ombudsman to consider this 
complaint. While he was awaiting an ombudsmans decision, Mr L contacted the seller 
directly and asked the seller to collect the item for free. The seller did that, but then refused 
to refund him. So now Mr L is without the furniture, has no refund from the seller, and has no 
tracking number to give to PayPal to get a refund it had agreed to pay him. However, the 
events which happened since the investigators decision are not part of this complaint, and 
will be the subject of a separate complaint if necessary. I am dealing here only with the 
single issue of whether PayPal should have agreed to pay the cost of returning the item to 
the seller.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I do not uphold this complaint, for the same reason our investigator gave: PayPals buyer 
protection policy did not require it to refund the cost of returning the defective goods to the 
seller. I will explain why.
The policy contains this paragraph at the top of page 3:
PayPal is not obliged to reimburse you for any costs that you incur to comply with 
any of PayPals requests for cooperation for the purpose of resolving the problem 
(including, without limitation, costs that you incur to return [an] item to the payment 
recipient or another party as PayPal requests), although sometimes it may 
reimburse these costs.
I think that is clear.
PayPals user agreement (the version which became effective in September 2020 and which 
therefore applied when Mr L raised his claim in November) also says the same thing:
IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we 
specify as part of the settlement of your claim. PayPal Buyer Protection does not 
entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.
So I cannot say that PayPal breached its policy, or failed to act in good faith. It follows that 
I cannot uphold this complaint.
In this decision I am not dealing with any complaint Mr L might make about PayPal not 
refunding him the price of the returned item (if indeed that is what happens).
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 March 2021.
