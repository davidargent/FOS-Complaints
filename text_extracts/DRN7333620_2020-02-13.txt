K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent 
to him.
background
Mr S was given 20 instalment loans by Sunny between January 2015  and December 2016. 
All of Mr Ss loans have  been fully repaid and a summary of his borrowing is as follows:
Mr Ss complaint has been  looked at by two of our adjudicators. The first adjudicator  didnt 
think Sunny  had been wrong to give loans  1 to 5 and 19 and 20 to Mr S. But they didnt  think 
Sunny should  have  agreed to lend from loan 6 to 18 as it was apparent  from the pattern of 
Mr Ss borrowing  that he was reliant on the short-term loans and was unlikely to sustainably  
repay the amounts borrowed. 
Sunny disagreed and said the pattern indicated Mr S was borrowing  as and when he needed 
funds. It also explained  it carried  out checks on Mr S each time he applied for a loan. These  
checks included affordability checks and reviewing information from credit reports. Loan Date Taken

Ref: DRN73336202In our most recent assessment, an adjudicator  thought Sunny shouldnt  have agreed to lend 
to Mr S from loan 11 onwards for the same reasons. 
Sunny didnt respond to the second  view, but as the case was already being prepared for a 
final decision, it was passed to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and the customer  should be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ref: DRN73336203There were significant  breaks in Mr Ss borrowing from Sunny. There  was a gap of nearly  six 
months between loans 6 and 7. And there was a further  gap of around seven months 
between loans 18 and 19. I think it would be reasonable for Sunny to view these gaps as an 
indication that Mr Ss finances had stabilised after whatever the circumstances  were  that had 
caused him to take out the loans. So, I will look at Mr Ss borrowing in three separate lending  
chains. 
The first chain was made up of loans 1 to 6, the second chain was made up of loans 7 to 18 
and the third chain  was loans 19 and 20. 
Our first adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to do more before it lent Mr S loans 1 to 5. 
And our second adjudicator didnt uphold  Mr Ss complaint about loans 6 to 10. Mr S hasnt  
disagreed with either of the adjudicators findings,  so I wont  be making any further findings 
on these loans because  they no longer appear  to be in dispute. But Ive kept these loans in 
mind when thinking about the overall borrowing  relationship between Mr S and Sunny. 
Having carefully considered all the arguments,  evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint, Im partly  upholding the complaint. Ill 
explain why. 
Chain two  loans 11 to 18
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 11 to Mr S and the results of these 
checks didnt raise  any concerns. But as this was Mr Ss eleventh loan overall with Sunny 
and the fifth loan in under five months  in this chain of lending,  I think  Sunny should  have 
been looking  to build  a clearer picture about  Mr Ss finances  before lending to him again. 
Had Sunny  carried  out proportionate checks before lending loan 11, its likely to have found 
that Mr S was borrowing from other short-term lenders. And the repayments for these loans 
would have been increasing  his monthly  outgoings by nearly  £200.  This pattern continued 
for loans  12 to 19. For example, at loan 12 Mr S owed another  lender £450 (before interest)  
and at loan 17 the amount Mr S owed  to another lender was nearly £500 (before interest). 
Overall, I think this behaviour was most  likely an indication he was in a cycle of debt and was 
borrowing further to cover the hole that repaying his previous loans  was leaving in his 
finances. And it was likely that Mr S would have struggled to make  the repayments  
sustainably.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 11 to 18 and Sunny should put things right.
Chain three   loans  19 and 20
Although there was a significant  break in Mr Ss borrowing between  loan 18 and 19, overall  
Mr S had been a customer of Sunnys  for almost two years and in that time had received a 
total of 18 loans. So, when Mr S applied for loan 19, I think   again  Sunny  ought to have 
been looking  to understand  more about  Mr Ss finances before agreeing to lend to him. 
Especially when Mr S was requesting a larger amount of borrowing then he had previously.
As Ive explained above, a proportionate check before lending loan 19 is most likely to have 
found Mr Ss borrowing  from other  short-term  lender  had increased, so there  was no 
improvement in his overall financial position. In my view, this makes it likely Mr S was having  
longer term financial  problems and his indebtedness  was becoming unsustainable.  
Ref: DRN73336204So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 19 and 20.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 11 to 20;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 11 to 20 from Mr Ss credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr S a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 March  2020.
