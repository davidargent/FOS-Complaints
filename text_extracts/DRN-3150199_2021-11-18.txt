The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his bank account and 
recorded a default on his credit file after he was incarcerated. 
What happened
Mr A had a bank account and overdraft limit of £2,500. Mr A has explained he was 
incarcerated so contacted NatWest in early 2020 and asked it to freeze interest and charges 
being applied to his account with a view to repaying it on his release. 
NatWest says its policy where a customer advises theyll be in prison for more than six 
months is to transfer an overdrawn account to its Recoveries team and close it  applying a 
default. NatWest took the decision to close Mr As account and has recorded a default on his 
credit file. 
Mr A complained but NatWest didnt agree it had acted unfairly by closing his account. 
NatWest said there was a delay in taking the necessary steps to close the account and 
refunded interest and charges applied between February and July 2020. But NatWest didnt 
offer to remove the default from Mr As credit file. 
Mr A referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They thought 
NatWest had dealt with Mr As complaint fairly and didnt ask it to take any further action. Mr 
A asked to appeal and said his account was well managed and that it wasnt fair for NatWest 
to apply a default in his case. As Mr A asked to appeal, his complaint has been passed to 
me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive been reasonably brief in setting out the background to this complaint as all parties 
broadly agree about the overall timeline. Ive focused on what I think are the key issues in 
this case. 
I can see Mr A feels NatWests decision to close his account and record a default was unfair 
as he was only £39 over the agreed overdraft limit. But NatWest has explained it took the 
step of closing Mr As account because he notified it he would be incarcerated for more than 
six months, in line with its policy. NatWest says that where a customer cant afford to 
maintain an overdraft it can take action and close the account. 
In this case, Mr A told NatWest he would be incarcerated for an extended period and had no 
income. Mr A told NatWest he was unable to make any payments to cover interest and 
charges that became due on his overdrawn balance. Further, Mr A asked for interest and 
charges to be frozen. NatWest did take steps to freeze interest and charges and ensure the 
debt didnt increase but, in doing so, it closed his account and terminated the overdraft 
facility. 
I understand that NatWest went on to record a default on Mr As credit file, but I think that 
fairly reflects the circumstances under which his account was closed. Im sorry to disappoint 
Mr A, but I dont agree it was unfair for NatWest to record a default on his credit file.  
NatWest didnt close Mr As account until July 2020 and has confirmed that step shouldve 
been taken in February 2020. As a result, NatWest refunded interest and charges of £247.77 
that were added to the outstanding balance because of the delay. Im satisfied the refund 
returned Mr As account balance back to the correct position at the point NatWest says it 
shouldve been closed in February 2020. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr A, but I dont agree that NatWest treated him unfairly when it 
closed his current account and recorded a default. Im satisfied NatWests terms allowed it to 
request repayment after Mr A informed it he wasnt able to make any further payments to 
maintain the account. I understand NatWests default will remain on Mr As credit file for 
several years but Im satisfied that accurately reflects the circumstances under which it was 
closed. 
As Im satisfied NatWest dealt with Mr As complaint fairly, Im not telling it to do anything 
else. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 December 2021.
