The complaint
Mr O complains National Westminster Bank PLC keeps on asking him to do things the ways 
it wants them to be done even though it knows he cant do things the way it wants him to. He 
says that this puts him at a disadvantage given that he has a protected characteristic, means 
he cant manage his accounts independently and that this is, in turn, costing him money.
What happened
Mr O has a current account with NatWest and has been a customer of theirs for over ten 
years. He was able to manage his account without problems when he opened it.
In 2014 Mr O was assaulted and ended up with a severe head injury. He has, amongst other 
things, problems with short term memory loss as a result. This makes it difficult for Mr O to 
learn new skills and new routines. But he has retained over learnt behaviours such as 
driving. In short, his injury had and continues to have a significant impact on his daily life.
Mr O says he cant use phones independently  because he forgets conversations that he 
has  and letters dont work for him either  because he forgets about them after hes read 
them. Hes developed strategies to manage, some of which involve him doing things the way 
he used to do them ten years ago, some of which involve other people reminding him that he 
has something to do and some of which rely on him using emails to communicate.
In April 2021 Mr O phoned NatWest to ask why his card had stopped working. His account 
had, in fact, been restricted because NatWest was concerned it had been compromised. 
NatWest checked Mr O had made certain payments, and then removed the restriction.
Mr O complained about NatWest restricting his account and about the fact that it expected 
him to phone to unblock his account. He said he wanted NatWest to send him an email if his 
account was restricted again. NatWest said it could do that, but then apologised saying that 
this wasnt correct. NatWest paid Mr O £100 in compensation for the distress the incorrect 
information hed been given caused and accepted that hed received poor service when he 
used its chat service. Mr O remained unhappy and so complained to us.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Os complaint. He complained about other problems 
he had with NatWest too  including problems getting a new card sent to him  while we 
were doing our investigation. Our investigator didnt think NatWest had acted fairly and 
recommended £300 in compensation. Mr O was unhappy with our investigators 
recommendations saying that they hadnt understood the impact NatWests actions had on 
him. He asked for an ombudsman to look into his complaint. So, thats what Ive done.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Six months ago, I issued a provisional decision saying that I was minded to uphold this 
complaint, award Mr O an additional £600 in compensation on top of the £150 he had 
already paid and require NatWest to put arrangements in place that would allow Mr O to 
manage his account going forwards. I asked both parties to comment on what Id said.
Mr O told me that he wouldnt be able to reply to my provisional decision for three months as 
he was going to be abroad for some time. Hes since sent me comments, most of which 
dont relate to the solutions I suggested. NatWest also replied, after I had chased several 
times, suggesting the same solutions that had led Mr O to complain in the first place as ways 
that Mr O could manage his account going forwards. The responses Ive received have been 
disappointing  NatWest, in particular, hasnt in my opinion taken on board the observations 
I made in my provisional decision, nor has it helped to come up with solutions when I would 
have expected it to. Before getting onto the merits, given what Ive just said, I think its worth 
explaining what I said in my provisional decision.
In my provisional decision I said the following:
Our investigator asked Mr O to explain how he goes about his daily life as part of our 
investigation into his complaint. Mr O sent us a detailed reply explaining the strategies 
hes developed. Id like to thank Mr O for sending this email  it, along with medical 
evidence that hes also sent in, has been very helpful. Our investigator has forwarded 
a copy of Mr Os email to NatWest  with Mr Os permission  which I hope NatWest 
will find useful too.
Mr O has three strategies that he uses in order to manage day-to-day. He:
does things the way he used to do them ten years ago  for example, he goes to 
the same shops he used to go to ten years ago because he knows how to get to 
them;
relies on other people to remind him when he has something to do  for example, 
his mechanic reminds him when his MOT is due; or
marks emails that need him to do something as unread until hes completed them.
He avoids using phones  because he forgets conversations that he has  and avoids 
letters  because he forgets about them after hes read them.
If Mr O sees an unread email, he knows that means he has something to do because 
hell file the email away once hes completed the task that the email relates to. Given 
what Ive just said, I can understand why Mr O asked NatWest if it could email him 
rather than write to him in the future if it had to restrict his account. By emailing him, 
NatWest would, in effect, be reminding Mr O that he needed to unblock his card and 
until hed done that Mr O wouldnt file the email and would mark it as unread.
Our investigator told NatWest several times that Mr O cannot use a phone by himself, 
and about the problems he has when he receives letters. So, its disappointing that 
NatWest has suggested more than once during this complaint that Mr O can complete 
a particular process or processes by phoning it. I can also see why Mr O has told us 
that NatWest keeps on asking him to do things the way it wants them to be done. And I 
can see why this would be so frustrating. NatWest has, however, recently suggested 
that one of its Customer Protection Managers could speak to Mr O to see if they could 
support his needs.
I think NatWests suggestion might be quite helpful  particularly if one of its Customer 
Protection Managers can offer the type of support Mr O needs in order to manage his 
account by himself. That would mean NatWest coming up with a way that uses one of the three methods Ive mentioned above. NatWest has, as well as suggesting 
processes that involve phones, suggested processes that would be new to Mr O. For 
example, its suggested he use Relay UK, but thats not something Mr O has said hes 
able to do as he doesnt know how to use that service. Mr O has given a number of 
examples of new processes NatWest expects him to learn, which hell likely not be 
able to do based on what Ive said above. For example, that he needs to let NatWest 
know before he goes abroad that hes going abroad to reduce the chances of his card 
being blocked. Or that he needs to order change in advance if he needs to get change 
from a branch. The difficulties Mr O has learning new process is something any 
Customer Protection Manager who speaks to Mr O will need to consider too.
what next?
Our investigator asked NatWest whether or not one of its Customer Protection 
Managers would be able to email Mr O and help him manage his account that way. 
NatWest said that it couldnt confirm whether or not theyd be able to do that  theyd 
have to have a discussion with Mr O. So, Im going to ask NatWest to arrange for one 
of its Customer Protection Managers to speak to Mr O and to let me know what 
options hell have going forwards when NatWest replies to this provisional decision. Ill 
take that response into account when deciding what I think is fair and reasonable in 
this case. If one of NatWests Customer Protection Managers offers to support Mr O in 
a way that he agrees works for him, then my final decision will require NatWest to 
provide that support.
Having looked at all the evidence, I can see why NatWest has restricted Mr Os 
account three times  namely in December 2020, January 2021 and April 2021. I dont 
think it was unfair or unreasonable of NatWest to do so as it believed it was protecting 
Mr O when it did so. But I dont think the ways NatWest said it would let Mr O know 
about the restriction, and the ways he could get the restriction removed, were fair 
because NatWests options involved phones or letters neither of which work for Mr O. I 
can also see that Mr O didnt have a card for over a year  likely because NatWest 
didnt deal with Mr O using methods that work for him meaning he lost track of what 
was happening / what needed to be done.
And this is what I said in my provisional decision that NatWest should do to put things right:
Im satisfied that not having a card for over a year, along with everything else that has 
happened on this case, had a significant impact on Mr O. Hes told us in detail how it 
has done so. In the circumstances, I think an award of £300 is on the light side. 
Instead, Im minded to award Mr O £600 in compensation on top of the £150 hes 
already been paid  this means a total award of £750. Ill say what other steps 
NatWest should put in place so Mr O can manage his account going forwards once 
NatWest responds to this provisional decision saying what its Customer Protection 
Manager is able to do to help.
As should be obvious, I said to NatWest in my provisional decision that its offer to arrange 
for one of its Customer Protection Managers to speak to Mr O about ways he could manage 
his account going forwards was a helpful one. I asked NatWest to arrange for that to happen 
and to let me know what options came out of that discussion. I also said that NatWest should 
take account of what Id said about the three strategies Mr O uses in order to manage day-
to-day when coming up with solutions, and that if one of NatWests Customer Protection 
Managers offered to support Mr O in a way that he agrees works for him, then my final 
decision would require NatWest to provide that support.
NatWests responses  given what I said in my provisional decision and generally  have been both poor and disappointing. Our investigator had, for example, asked NatWest 
whether or not one of its Customer Protection Managers would be able to email Mr O and 
help him manage his account that way. NatWest said it couldnt confirm whether or not 
theyd be able to do that. In fact, NatWest eventually sent me a chain of emails that one of its 
Customer Protection Managers and Mr O had exchanged  after several times of asking  
showing that there had already been contact with Mr O by email. Having sent me those 
emails, NatWest went on to suggest the same option that had led to Mr O complaining, 
namely that Mr O appoint a power of attorney. NatWest suggested that the attorney would 
be notified in the event that Mr Os account was blocked  a letter would be sent to the 
attorney  and the attorney would be able to phone NatWest and get the block removed. In 
other words, Mr O wouldnt be involved at all. Putting to one side whether or not thats a 
good option  its an option I have a lot of reservations about  and the fact that its the same 
option that led to Mr O complaining, its an option that doesnt appear to have taken any of 
the observations I made in my provisional decision about the strategies Mr O used into 
account. Thats what I asked NatWest to do  to come up with options that took the 
strategies Mr O uses into account. In short, NatWest has done neither the thinking I asked it 
to do nor the thinking I would have expected it to do. In other responses, NatWest 
questioned, for example, how Mr O had managed to travel alone to a place that wasnt 
familiar to him, suggesting that some of his comments are contradictory. Thats despite my 
provisional decision being clear that Ive seen extensive medical evidence to corroborate 
what Mr O has told us and despite us sharing  with Mr Os consent  sensitive information 
with NatWest. Again, it was really disappointing to see this.
In the chain of emails that NatWest sent me, I can see a Customer Protection Manager 
offered to send Mr O a signature card  in other words a card that doesnt use a PIN  so 
that he wouldnt have to remember his PIN. And I can also see that they offered to email him 
 though they did add that they didnt work at weekends so wouldnt be available then. I want 
to say a bit more about Mr Os PIN before I say more about how I expect NatWest to resolve 
Mr Os complaint.
Mr O has told us that he hasnt had a working card since April 2021  in other words, almost 
30 months. In my provisional decision, I said that Mr O hadnt had a card for over a year  he 
said that was wrong. I dont agree that I was wrong  Im satisfied that NatWest sent Mr O a 
replacement card just over a year after his previous one stopped working. I am, however, 
satisfied that Mr O couldnt remember the PIN hed been using the year before, and he 
wanted NatWest to send him a reminder in case that helped jog his memory. Thats 
something NatWest didnt do, and its for that reason that Mr O says he hasnt had a working 
card since April 2021. He technically has a card, but he says it isnt a working one because 
he doesnt have the PIN / cant remember the PIN. Mr O has also told us that hes been 
unable to manage his account in the way hed like to  for example, using it online so he can 
take advantage of offers and buy items online  and has instead had to make long journeys 
to places he remembers in order to buy the same items. He says that this has cost him an 
additional £200 a month and that he wants compensation for this. He says NatWest paid him 
£200 for one of those months and hed like compensation for all the others. Mr O has also 
told us about the phycological impact of NatWests actions on him, as well as the physical 
impact and the amount of time hes has to spend getting his account to work in a way that he 
can manage. And hes mentioned how NatWests actions have had a greater impact on him 
 given his disabilities  and mentioned what are known as the Vento guidelines as well as 
talking about the size of the awards we can make. In short, he considers the additional £600 
Im minded to award to be an insult.
Putting things right
Mr O has told us that he wants NatWest to send him a reminder of the PIN that he was using 
at the time they stopped his card in April 2021. Hes told us that he cant remember the PIN, because he hasnt used it for so long, but getting sent a PIN reminder might prompt him to 
remember. Alternatively, hes told us that hell write any new PIN NatWest sends him on his 
card using black permanent marker  meaning his account wont be as safe as it should be. 
NatWest has told us that it has no record of what Mr Os PIN used to be, so I accept that it 
cannot send out a reminder.
Given everything Ive just said, it wouldnt make sense requiring NatWest to send Mr O a 
reminder of his PIN, nor would it make sense assuming Mr O is going to remember his old 
PIN unprompted. NatWest suggested a signature card which would potentially solve the 
issue, but Mr O has told us that would create another problem  as a signature card would 
be a new process for him he says he wouldnt remember he doesnt need a PIN. A 
possible solution to this would be for Mr O to write on the signature card in black permanent 
marker words to the effect no PIN needed. That would arguably be safer than Mr O writing 
the next new PIN hes sent on his card. Another option would be for NatWest to help Mr O 
change his PIN to one he can remember using an ATM machine. This would involve Mr O 
visiting a branch, or being assisted to do so, but this could be used as an opportunity to 
resolve any other outstanding issues he has. So thats an option I think both parties should 
consider first.
The issue that appears to most concern Mr O is the possibility that his card might be blocked 
again. Im satisfied that this has happened on three occasions in the past  and that 
NatWest didnt act unfairly when it blocked Mr Os card  so it could happen again. Im also 
satisfied that the process that NatWest insists on using  namely writing to Mr O rather than 
emailing him when a block is placed on his card  and expecting him to phone in order to get 
his card unblocked is a process that doesnt work for Mr O given his disabilities. I would, 
therefore, expect NatWest to make reasonable adjustments so that Mr O is alerted to the 
fact that his card has been blocked as soon as possible  I accept that this wont be 
something NatWest can do in advance of a block being placed as often blocks will be placed 
automatically  but given that NatWest has a team of Customer Protection Managers who 
have access to email and have been communicating with Mr O by email I dont think its 
unreasonable to expect NatWest to find a way of alerting Mr O by email to the fact that his 
card has been blocked. And to do so shortly after a block  if another one happens  has 
been put in place. Nor do I think its unreasonable to expect NatWest to find a way that will 
allow Mr O to unblock his card without having to phone NatWest. So, Im going to require 
NatWest to do those things.I can see that the problems Mr O has had with NatWest have had a big impact on him, but I 
dont agree it would be fair or appropriate to award Mr O £200 for every month that hes not 
had a working card. I havent seen evidence thats robust enough to support that, and I 
dont think in any event that it would be fair. I can see that Mr O believes I should make a 
much higher compensation award  hes talked about me awarding £5,000 or more in 
compensation. When making an award, we have to look at the impact of what the business 
has done wrong  our awards arent meant to be fines to punish a business. Mr O has 
provided some additional evidence based on which Im satisfied that the impact has been 
greater than I thought at the time I issued my provisional decision. So, Im going to increase 
the award from what was in effect an award of £750 in compensation to £1,000 in 
compensation. That means NatWest will have to pay Mr O an additional £850 in 
compensation  since Im satisfied it has already paid £150 in compensation in relation to 
this complaint  in full and final settlement of this complaint should Mr O accept my decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that Im upholding this complaint.
Im requiring National Westminster Bank plc to pay Mr O £850 in compensation on top of the 
£150 its already paid. In addition, Im requiring National Westminster Bank plc to put 
arrangements in place that will allow Mr O to manage his account going forwards, including:
alerting Mr O by email to the fact that his card has been blocked  if his card is blocked 
again  and to do so promptly;
finding a way that will allow Mr O to unblock his card without having to phone NatWest or 
rely on a Power of Attorney.
Im also requiring National Westminster Bank plc to provide Mr O with a signature card  on 
which he can write words to the effect no PIN needed in black permanent marker if that will 
help  or to help Mr O change his PIN to one he can remember using an ATM machine. This 
will involve NatWest helping to arrange for Mr O to visit one of its branches. Mr O will have to 
let NatWest know which option he prefers  a signature card or changing his PIN using an 
ATM machine. If neither of these options work for Mr O, then the parties can agree another 
way to resolve this issue provided they do so on the understanding that National 
Westminster Bank plc cant send Mr O a reminder of what his PIN used to be, and its 
unrealistic to assume that Mr O will remember unprompted after all of this time. And, finally, 
provided that the solution doesnt involve Mr O having to rely on a Power of Attorney.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 November 2023.
