The complaint
Mr P is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) continue to report a default 
to his credit file that they previously agreed to remove.
What happened
Mr P previously brought a complaint to this service which resulted in NatWest agreeing to 
remove a default from his credit file. But Mr P noticed that the default remained present on 
his credit file and hadnt been removed. So, he raised a complaint with NatWest.
NatWest responded to Mr P and confirmed they had instructed the credit reference agencies 
(CRAs) to remove the default from his credit file, as has been previously agreed. Mr P 
wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They noted that only one of the CRAs was 
still reporting the default, and they felt that NatWest had been able to show that they had 
instructed the removal of the default with all the CRAs as theyd said they had. So, they 
didnt uphold Mr Ps complaint against NatWest. Mr P remained dissatisfied, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My P has provided a copy of his credit file obtained directly from the CRA which continues to 
report the default on his account. And given that the resolution to Mr Ps previous complaint 
against NatWest included that NatWest agreed to remove this default, I can understand why 
he would be upset and frustrated that it remains present on his credit file. 
However, many credit providers such as NatWest update the CRAs via a computer system 
which they have direct access to and which the CRAs monitors for amendments and 
instructions provided by a credit provider which the CRAs then implement in their reporting. 
In this instance, NatWest have confirmed that they did instruct the removal of the default by 
the CRAs via this online system, and Im persuaded from the internal emails and other 
information that NatWest have provided to this service that this is most likely the case. 
Additionally, its notable that the other CRAs did remove the default from Mr Ps credit file 
following NatWests instruction for them to do so. And I feel this supports NatWests position 
that they did previously instruct all the CRAs to remove the default.
Accordingly, I dont feel that I can fairly or reasonably uphold this complaint against NatWest, 
because I dont feel that theres any compelling evidence which suggests that NatWest didnt 
do what they were supposed to here  which was to instruct the CRAs to remove the default 
from Mr Ps credit file.
Because this complaint is raised specifically against NatWest, I have only considered the 
actions of NatWest when arriving at this decision, and my outcome here shouldnt in any way 
be considered as regarding any company other than NatWest.
I realise this might not be the outcome Mr P was hoping for, and I sympathise with the 
position he finds himself in regarding the default remaining on his credit file. But I hope that 
he will understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 September 2023.
