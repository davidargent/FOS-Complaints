The complaint
Mr J complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Opus has stopped him using his credit card, 
although he stuck to an agreement to pay off his arrears.
What happened
Mr J entered into a payment plan with NewDay, to clear a balance on his card which was
over his credit limit. He said NewDay put a stop on his card, and that his account was
suspended. He told us hed understood that he would be able to use the card again once
hed brought the account back within its limit.
Mr J made the payments NewDay was asking for. But he said once hed paid the money off,
he was told his account had been closed and his card could no longer be used. Mr J said
NewDay hadnt told him this before. He complained and got no response from NewDay, so
he asked us to look into this.
Mr J sent us a statement he received, dated 17 November 2019, which says your account
has been suspended.
NewDay said that Mr J hadnt made the payment detailed on his May 2019 statement, which
was due by 3 June. He spoke to its collections team on 4 June, and said he couldnt
maintain his monthly payment. So NewDay sent him an income and expenditure form. It
discussed his circumstances with Mr J on 16 July, and he said that the income and
expenditure must be wrong, because he couldnt afford the payment it suggested. A new
form was issued then.
Mr J sent his revised form in, and NewDay got that on 1 August, but it was missing
information, so NewDay spoke to Mr J on 5 August. At this time, Mr J had missed three
payments.
Mr J agreed a reduced payment plan with NewDay on 5 August. NewDay said it told Mr J on
this call that his account may go over 60 days in arrears. And if it did so, then the account
would be closed. NewDay also said it wrote to Mr J to confirm that his account was closed
on 16 August. It now knows Mr J didnt get this letter, but NewDay said that wasnt its fault.
Mr J spoke to NewDay when he made his first payment of £26.00 on 23 August 2019.
NewDay says that it told Mr J on that call that his card agreement had been terminated, he
wouldnt be able to use the card again, and the account was only open for him to pay back
the debt.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that NewDay
had closed this account without warning. He said when Mr J spoke to NewDay on 5 August,
NewDay had explained that he wouldnt be able to use the card again. And later on the call,
Mr J was told the account would be closed. NewDay had also written to Mr J on 16 August
2020, to confirm that his card agreement with NewDay had been terminated. Our 
investigator knew that Mr J had told us he hadnt received this letter, but our investigator said
it was sent to his address.
Mr J said that his point was that the account was supposed to be suspended by NewDay,
not stopped, in the sense of being terminated and card no longer available for use. He
wanted his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman, so it was passed to me for a final
decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
NewDay has a policy of removing the use of a card, if someones more than 60 days 
in arrears. Thats reasonable. But if its going to do that, I think it should explain this 
clearly to its customers.
Ive listened carefully to the call that Mr J had with NewDay on 5 August, to set up his
payment plan. He was told that he was then at 48 days of arrears. And he was told 
that if he went to 60 days of arrears, then his account would be closed. But Mr J was 
also told that the arrangement he was entering into would stop that happening.
Towards the end of the call, the call handler seemed to shift from this position, and 
suggest that Mr J was going to lose the ability to use the card after all. The call 
handler said that you are going to go over the 60 day period, so you may limit your 
ability to use the card in future, is that a worry for you at the moment? Mr J was 
asked if that would be an issue, and if he would be disappointed with the loss of the 
facility on the card.
I think its likely that NewDay meant to tell Mr J that the arrangement he was setting 
up on this call would mean he was definitely going to go over 60 days of arrears, and 
it was going to withdraw the card. But if it meant that, then I think it shouldve been 
rather clearer than it was on this call.
I also think NewDay should have explored with Mr J whether a payment made 
sooner than this could have avoided the 60 day trigger point, so the card wouldnt be 
cancelled. NewDay asked Mr J when he could make the first payment under his plan, 
but it didnt explain to him what the impact of that would be, and ask him if he could 
pay sooner, to avoid losing the use of the card permanently. I think it shouldve done 
that.
NewDay ended the call by saying that the card would be declined while Mr J was on 
the arrangement, which again suggests the card would be available for use after this.
I think this call was unclear. Although NewDay did say Mr J would lose the card 
facility, Ive had to listen to this call repeatedly to pick out where that was said.
I think NewDay did make the position clear to Mr J later. It wrote to him on 16 August 
to say that his account had been terminated. Mr J says he didnt get that letter. Thats 
unfortunate, but its not NewDays fault. It sent this letter to his address.
Its also unfortunate that the correspondence NewDay sent to Mr J after this only said 
that he wouldnt be able to use his card while his account was overdue. I dont think 
thats helpful, when Mr Js card account had already been terminated. I think 
NewDay shouldve been clear with Mr J each time it wrote to him, that he wasnt 
going to be able to use this card again.NewDay also said it told Mr J that the card facility had been withdrawn in late August 
when he rang to make his payment. Unfortunately, NewDay says that it no longer 
has this call, so I cant listen to it, and be sure that the position was explained to Mr J. 
I note that Mr J continued to make his payment plan payments after this, and 
apparently hadnt realised he wouldnt be able to use the card again after this, so it 
seems unlikely that this was clearly explained on this call either.
I do think that NewDay has made mistakes here. But that doesnt mean it has to 
reopen Mr Js card for him. NewDay can make its own business decisions about who 
it will lend money to, and our service wont usually interfere with that. I cant see 
anything in this case to make me think we should deviate from that usual approach. 
So I wont ask NewDay to reinstate this card.
But I do think NewDay provided Mr J with poor service on the call I have listened to, 
when he set up his payment plan. Ive said that I think NewDay ought to have 
explained to Mr J clearly what was happening with his card. It ought either to have 
explored with him whether he could pay earlier, to avoid his card facility being 
removed, or explained to him that what he was doing wouldnt stop this card being 
closed. It didnt do that.
And I also think that the letters sent to Mr J after this shouldve been clear that his 
card was closed. If NewDay had done that, then the one letter which went astray (the 
letter that told Mr J his account had been terminated) wouldve been much less 
important.
For those reasons, I do think NewDay should pay Mr J some compensation. I think 
that a payment of £100 would provide a fair and reasonable outcome to this 
complaint.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
NewDay didnt reply. Mr J agreed, although he said that this would affect his credit rating, 
which he was trying to rebuild.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr J has agreed with my proposed resolution, but says that he had been trying to rebuild his 
credit rating. I dont think that his original complaint to NewDay, or to us, covered this point, 
so Im not able to provide a formal response on that point here. But I can pass on the 
information NewDay has given to our service. 
NewDay told us that Mr Js credit rating had been affected by the arrears that had built up by 
summer 2019. I would expect those to show as late or missed payments at the time. But it 
has also told us that the account isnt currently reporting as in arrears. Mr J might want to 
confirm this himself by checking his credit report. 
I still think that £100 is the right amount to provide a fair and reasonable outcome to this 
complaint, so thats what Ill now award.
 My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd trading as Opus must pay Mr J £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 February 2021.
