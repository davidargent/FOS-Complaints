The complaint
 Mr M complained because PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA refused to refund him for goods 
which he didnt receive.
 
What happened
On 26 December 2020, Mr M used PayPal to buy three items from a UK retailer. He paid 
£139.99 including delivery.
The next day, 27 December, Mr M received a message saying his parcel had been 
delivered. But he hadnt received it. He checked the delivery companys website. This 
pinpointed a different location on its GPS map, showing a property at the other end of his 
street and on the other side of the road. The photo of the door where the parcel had been 
delivered wasnt Mr Ms door. 
He contacted PayPal the same day. But PayPal didnt accept Mr Ms claim and refused to 
refund him. It said the retailer had provided a tracking number to show the parcel had been 
sent, and that the delivery companys website showed a delivery confirmation to Mr Ms 
address. 
Mr M supplied PayPal with the delivery companys tracking, which showed delivery to the 
wrong address, and a photo of the door where it was delivered. For comparison, Mr M also 
sent a copy of a notification for a different parcel, which the same delivery company had 
delivered to his correct address. This shows a different GPS location, and the photo of the 
door was also clearly different. Mr M also tried knocking at the door at the other end of his 
street where the tracking information showed his missing parcel had been delivered, but he 
didnt get an answer.
PayPal still refused to refund Mr M, so he contacted this service. 
Our investigator upheld Mr Ms complaint. She considered PayPal should refund Mr M with 
£139.99 for the missing parcel, as well as interest.
PayPal didnt agree. It said its User Agreement said that: 
Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not 
Received claim, if: 
-The seller has provided proof of delivery. 
If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in 
favour of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the 
goods.
PayPal said that if Mr M believed he didnt get the delivery because of the delivery firms 
mistake, he should complain to them. PayPal asked for an ombudsman decision.
Shortly afterwards, Mr M said hed received a credit of £139.99, and he didnt know whether 
it was from PayPal. The investigator checked with PayPal, who said it hadnt refunded Mr M.
My provisional findings 
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. Before doing so, I considered all the 
available evidence and arguments to decide what would be fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
What PayPals Buyer Protection scheme says
PayPals Buyer Protection scheme sets out what protection it provides, and the conditions 
for a refund. It says:
 When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a 
refund under PayPal Buyer Protection. When applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection 
entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original 
shipping costs you paid, if any. PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your 
claim is eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection. PayPal's original determination is 
considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you 
have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination 
or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.

PayPal Buyer Protection may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a 
transaction:
-You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an Item Not Received 
claim

Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not 
Received claim, if:
-The seller has provided proof of delivery.
If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in 
favour of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive 
the goods.
 
I went on to consider what this means for Mr Ms complaint.
Mr Ms parcel
I looked carefully at the tracking evidence which Mr M has provided. As Ive set out above, 
the tracking information for the disputed parcel pinpoints a GPS location at the other end of 
Mr Ms street and on the other side of the road from his address. The photo shows a white 
front door and a parcel left on brickwork in front of that door.
In contrast, Mr Ms example of a different parcel which was successfully delivered to his 
address shows a different pinpointed GPS location. This shows a grey door in a different 
style, a longer porch which includes a furniture unit and a mat. The two locations are clearly 
different.
I recognised that PayPal said that:
- refunds are at its sole discretion. But Id expect that discretion to be based on the 
evidence;
- the Buyer Protection says PayPal wont uphold a claim where the seller has provided 
proof of delivery. But, similarly, Id expect that proof of delivery to be accurate. Here, Mr Ms appeal clearly showed that the evidence alleged to be proof of delivery, wasnt 
proof of delivery to Mr Ms address. So I considered that PayPal cant reasonably rely on this 
clause. It wont always be fair in the individual circumstances of a dispute like this just to 
accept any proof of delivery when that document clearly shows the parcel was delivered 
somewhere else entirely.
So I provisionally found that PayPal should refund Mr M £139.99, with interest at 8% from 27 
December 2020.
Mr M suffered frustration and inconvenience with his failed claim against PayPal. He had to 
try to find out for himself where the missing parcel went, and he also supplied evidence of 
what a delivery to his address should have looked like. I could also see that Mr M went to the 
trouble of going to the property earmarked by the tracking information, but wasnt able to get 
an answer. The evidence of the two different deliveries was very clear, and it would have 
been very frustrating that PayPal simply wouldnt change its mind despite clear evidence. It 
also wasnt helpful that PayPal said Mr M should pursue the delivery firm instead, when 
PayPals Buyer Protection scheme specifically says it covers goods that dont arrive.
So I considered that PayPal should also pay Mr M £100 compensation for this distress and 
inconvenience.
Responses to my provisional decision
Mr M said he was very happy and satisfied with the provisional decision.
PayPal didnt accept the provisional decision. It said that the delivery met its standards of 
proof because:
- the delivery had occurred on 27 December 2020 and the delivered status was 
marked on the delivery firms website;
- the address on the website was an exact match with the shipping details Mr M had 
provided in the transactions details field.
So PayPal said the sellers proof of delivery was valid.
PayPal said that the situation described by Mr M was that the courier was most likely at fault. 
So it didnt think the seller should be penalised. It said Mr M could have seen the User 
Agreement at any point before his purchase.
PayPal also said that it had confirmed that it hadnt refunded Mr M with the £139.99 credit 
which he mentioned. But it said that if hed received a refund elsewhere and then attempted 
to try to get the money back through PayPals Buyer Protection was also excluded.
So PayPal didnt accept the provisional decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 In particular Ive considered PayPals objections to the provisional decision.
I recognise that PayPal has said the delivery met its standards of proof because it had been 
marked as delivered on the delivery firms website, and this said it went to Mr Ms address. 
But Mr M had provided to PayPal, and I have seen, clear photographic evidence, and evidence from the delivery firms GPS tracking, which showed that this information wasnt 
accurate. While I realise that PayPal may have felt that it had sufficient evidence to decline 
the claim, I dont think it was fair to ignore Mr Ms further evidence here  which proved that 
the delivery firms website was wrong in saying the parcel had been delivered to him.
Nor do I agree with PayPals belief that as it seemed the delivery firm was at fault, Mr M 
should be the party who suffered the financial loss, or take it up with the delivery firm. 
PayPals Buyer Protection Scheme, as Ive set out above, states that protection is available 
if an item isnt received. PayPal said the seller shouldnt be penalised, but its the seller who 
paid for and has the contract with the delivery firm  not the intended recipient.
But the main point is that Mr M provided clear evidence that he didnt receive the parcel.  
The delivery firms tracking information shows a GPS location at the other end of his street 
and on the other side of the road. And the delivery firms photo shows the parcel at a 
different front door from Mr Ms. So I accept that Mr M never received the parcel and that he 
should receive a refund under PayPals Buyer Protection scheme. This is only fair and 
reasonable.
Finally, PayPal also argued that although it hadnt refunded Mr M with the £139.99 credit 
which he mentioned, the fact that Mr M received such a credit meant he couldnt bring a 
claim for the missing parcel. I dont agree. Mr M was honest in reporting that hed received a 
credit which he didnt recognise. But theres nothing to indicate that that represented a 
refund for the missing parcel. And the liability here is with PayPal, which has confirmed it 
didnt refund Mr M. So I dont accept this argument.
So I see no reason to depart from my original conclusions. 
My final decision
  My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA 
to pay Mr M:
- £139.99 to refund the payment for the goods which Mr M didnt receive;
- Interest on that sum, calculated at 8% from 27 December 2020 to the date of 
payment; and
- £100 compensation for distress and inconvenience.  
I also order that if PayPal makes a deduction for income tax, it should tell Mr M how much it 
has taken off, and must provide a tax deduction certificate if Mr M asks for one. This will 
allow him to reclaim the tax from HMRC if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 September 2021.
