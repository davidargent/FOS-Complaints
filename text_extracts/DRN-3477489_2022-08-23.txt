The complaint
Mr and Mrs H complain about their mortgage with National Westminster Bank Plc. They 
decided to repay their mortgage as they no longer had faith in NatWest following how it had 
treated a fraud claim theyd made. They dont think its fair NatWest will charge them an 
early repayment charge (ERC).
What happened
Mr and Mrs H had a mortgage with NatWest, secured over their property. They had their 
current account facilities with another bank Ill call L.
In 2020, Mr and Mrs H had some work done on their property. They were dissatisfied with 
the quality of work done and subsequently came to realise they had been scammed by a 
rogue trader. The work was funded through additional borrowing taken on the NatWest 
mortgage.
They complained to L about the payment they had made to the trader for the work done from 
their current account. L initially said that the payment had been made to a NatWest account 
and could not be recovered. However, it seems L has since refunded Mr and Mrs H.
Mr and Mrs H were unhappy with that outcome. They said they felt NatWest had chosen to 
protect a fraudster rather than them, and in those circumstances they no longer wanted to be 
NatWest customers. They said they wanted to move their mortgage elsewhere and asked 
NatWest to waive the early repayment charge (ERC). They said NatWest was benefitting 
from the fraud through interest it was charging on their borrowing, and through receipt of the 
defrauded funds. 
NatWest refused to waive the ERC. Mr and Mrs H moved their mortgage anyway. They 
complained that they had to pay an ERC and want it refunded with interest.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. So Mr and Mrs H 
asked for it to be looked at by an ombudsman. They said NatWest promised to support 
customers who were victims of fraud. But NatWest had not supported them or given good 
customer service. It did not try and find a solution or help them. L had treated them 
appropriately, but NatWest had not and they no longer wanted to be NatWest customers.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear of what happened to Mr and Mrs H. Im sure it was very upsetting and 
frustrating to be the victim of a scam, and to be left with a damaged property having lost their 
money. Im pleased to hear that L managed to refund the money theyd lost to them.
That means I need to decide whether it was fair that NatWest charged the ERC when 
Mr and Mrs H repaid their mortgage.
I should say in the first place that I make no findings on whether or not NatWest dealt with 
the scam claim appropriately. I have no evidence about the fraud claim Mr and Mrs H made 
to L, or the response NatWest made to L, or how it was that L was able to refund 
Mr and Mrs H in the end. The actions of L and the wider situation with the scam are not part 
of this complaint.
This complaint is solely about whether it was fair that NatWest charged the ERC.
Mr and Mrs Hs mortgage was in three parts
The main mortgage, with a fixed interest rate until 2023;
A further advance agreed in February 2019, with a fixed interest rate until 2024; and 
A further advance agreed in September 2019, with a fixed interest rate until October 
2021.
The mortgage was redeemed in August 2021. Each fixed interest rate had its own early 
repayment charge, and the overall ERC charged across the mortgage reflected the ERCs on 
the three sub-accounts. 
The mortgage offers on all three parts of the mortgage make clear that, if the loan is repaid 
before the end of the fixed rate, then an ERC will be payable. For example, the February 
2019 offer says:
If you repay all or any part of your additional borrowing on or before the end of the 
fixed rate term, you will have to pay an Early Repayment Charge on the amount 
repaid
The offer then sets out that the ERC is set at a percentage (reducing over time) of the 
balance, with an illustration of what each percentage could be in cash terms.
The other offers contain similar terms.
Im therefore satisfied that Mr and Mrs Hs mortgage contains a valid ERC clause, which 
meets the regulators requirements.
And that therefore means that, as a matter of law and as a matter of the agreement between 
NatWest on the one hand and Mr and Mrs H on the other, the ERC was properly chargeable 
when the mortgage was repaid and NatWest was entitled to charge it to Mr and Mrs H.
NatWest told Mr and Mrs H there would be an ERC; it set it out in the contract; Mr and Mrs H 
agreed to that contract when they took the borrowing; when they repaid the mortgage, the 
ERC was payable. NatWest was entitled to charge it under the terms and conditions of the 
mortgage.
I therefore need to decide whether its fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this 
case to expect NatWest to refund the ERC even though it was entitled to charge it.
I do understand Mr and Mrs Hs frustrations here. Theyd been the victim of a scam, and it 
seems the scammer banked with NatWest. Mr and Mrs H were frustrated that their funds 
werent immediately recovered. Theyd borrowed the money to pay the trader from NatWest 
and felt it should have supported them better. And they lost faith in NatWest and felt that it 
had failed to protect them.However, I need to set against that the fact that Mr and Mrs H did recover their money from 
L  I dont know how, but they did. And I also need to bear in mind that theres no direct 
connection between the mortgage and the scam. While the funds to pay for the works were 
raised on the mortgage, NatWest had no role in how Mr and Mrs H spent those funds and no 
obligation to vet tradesmen they employed. 
And Mr and Mrs H havent complained about the mortgage itself  theyve no complaint 
about being lent the funds, or how NatWest has administered the mortgage. Their reasons 
for closing their mortgage account arent because theyre dissatisfied with the mortgage 
itself, but because of what they understood NatWests initial response to the approach from 
L to be.
Mr and Mrs H were entitled to decide that they no longer wanted to be NatWest customers, 
and to move their mortgage elsewhere. Although they were tied in to a fixed rate, they were 
still allowed to end their mortgage early  the whole purpose of an ERC is to allow a 
mortgage to be ended early. 
Ending the mortgage early, during a fixed rate, results in a cost to the lender which will no 
longer recover all the interest it budgeted for when setting the fixed rate  but it still allows 
exit in return for the ERC. The ERC is the price a borrower has to pay to exercise the right to 
end the mortgage early  as Mr and Mrs H chose to do.
Ive taken into account all the factors Ive set out above. And having done so, I dont uphold 
this complaint.
Even if I were to find that NatWest had mis-handled the fraud investigation  I havent found 
that  I still wouldnt think that it would be fair and reasonable to require NatWest to waive or 
refund the ERC on the mortgage as a result. The mortgage long pre-dated the fraud, and 
wasnt taken out because of it. Theres no direct connection between the mortgage and the 
fraud. NatWest is contractually entitled to the ERC, and charged it to recover the costs it 
incurred when Mr and Mrs H ended their mortgage early. Mr and Mrs H exercised the right to 
move their mortgage elsewhere  knowing the cost theyd have to pay to do so. 
Ultimately, NatWest was entitled to charge the ERC. And I dont think it would be fair and 
reasonable, in all the circumstances of this particular case, to say that it should refund the 
ERC even though it was entitled to it. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision before 20 September 2022.
