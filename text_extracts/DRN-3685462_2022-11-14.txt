The complaint
Ms K is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) took funds out of her 
account as the result of a fraud claim.
What happened
Ms K says that between October and December 2020 she loaned money to her partner  
who Ill refer to as G. In March 2021, G made two payments to Ms Ks account for £5,000 
and £1,740, followed by another payment in April 2021 for £120. 
In June 2021, NatWest received a fraud claim from Gs bank in relation to these payments. 
NatWest carried out an investigation which included them talking to Ms K about the reason 
for the payments into her account. Ms K told NatWest about the loans she made to G and 
provided background of her relationship to G including issues theyd had of a personal 
nature which she believed were the reason the fraud claim was raised. NatWest ultimately 
decided to return the funds to Gs bank, although the balance of Ms Ks account only allowed 
them to send £3,956.57 out of the £6,860 paid in.
Ms K raised a complaint with NatWest, saying the fraud claim wasnt genuine and asking 
them to return the money to her account. NatWest considered Ms Ks complaint but declined 
to return the funds, saying Ms K should consult a solicitor as it appeared to be a civil dispute 
between her and G.
Ms K wasnt happy with NatWests response, so she brought a complaint to our service.
An investigator looked into Ms Ks complaint and upheld it. They felt the information NatWest 
were given by Ms K suggested there was a civil dispute between Ms K and G, so they 
shouldnt have taken the money out of her account. The investigator recommended that 
NatWest return the £3,956.57 to Ms K and pay interest at 8% simple for the time she was 
without the money. They also recommended NatWest pay £200 in compensation for the 
distress caused.
NatWest accepted the investigators recommendation. However, Ms K didnt agree saying 
the compensation wasnt enough. Ms K highlighted that a family holiday they were due to 
take couldnt go ahead due to the money being taken from her account. Ms K suggested that 
£5,000 was a more appropriate compensation award.
As Ms K disagreed with the investigators opinion, the case was passed to me to review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Should NatWest have taken the money out of Ms Ks account?
From what Ive seen NatWest took appropriate steps on receiving the fraud claim from Gs 
bank, by investigating the allegation. They talked to Ms K to find out her side of the story with 
regards to the payments from G. However, based on what Ms K told them, Im not satisfied 
that NatWest acted fairly in removing the money from Ms Ks account and returning it to Gs 
bank.
I say this because Ms K provided a very clear and detailed explanation about her 
relationship with G and the purpose of the payments from G. Ms K also provided information 
about why she believed G had raised the fraud claim and why it wasnt genuine. What Ms K 
told NatWest clearly indicated that there appeared to be a civil dispute between Ms K and G 
regarding the funds and Im not satisfied that the evidence was sufficient for NatWest to 
reach the conclusion that Ms K wasnt entitled to the funds. 
NatWest have agreed to refund Ms K the £3,956.57 and pay 8% simple interest on that 
refund from the date the funds left Ms Ks account until the date they were returned to her. 
This is what I wouldve recommended in the circumstances. But I also have to consider the 
impact on Ms K of NatWests actions and what is appropriate compensation in the 
circumstances.
The impact NatWests actions have had on Ms K
Ms K has told us that this whole situation has been extremely distressing for her and her 
family. And, due to NatWest removing the funds from her account, her family werent able to 
take a planned holiday. Ms K wants £5,000 compensation in light of the distress shes 
experienced.
Ms K says the holiday plans had been made but hasnt provided evidence of any deposits 
shed paid and lost or any consequential losses that she had as a result of not proceeding 
with the holiday. And, while I appreciate that Ms K has been through a particularly trying 
situation, this has mainly been due to the actions of G. Both in him raising the fraud claim in 
the first place and how this has affected their relationship. Its also hard to differentiate what 
impact the relationship breakdown had on the planned holiday Ms K was going to take.
In deciding what is appropriate compensation, I cant hold NatWest liable for the distress 
caused by G, or by Gs bank in proceeding with his fraud claim. I also cant fine or punish 
NatWest for removing the money from Ms Ks account. 
I realise that Ms K is going to be very disappointed, but in the circumstances, I think the 
£200 compensation recommended by the investigator is fair. 
Putting things right
To put things right National Westminster Bank Plc should:
Refund Ms K the 3,956.57 (if they havent already);
Pay interest on that refund at 8% simple interest, from the date the funds were 
removed from Ms Ks account until the date of settlement;
Pay Ms K £200 compensation for the distress and inconvenience.My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc and 
direct them to compensate Ms K as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 December 2022.
