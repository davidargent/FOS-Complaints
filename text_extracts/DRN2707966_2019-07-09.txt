K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs M dont  think Lloyds Bank  PLC (Lloyds Bank) has paid them  fair compensation 
in response to a complaint about  the sale of a number  of business loan repayment insurance  
(BLRI) policies.
background
I issued a provisional decision on 5 March 2019. A copy  of my provisional decision is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional decision sets out the background to this complaint and explains why I think  
Lloyds Bank  has paid Mr and Mrs M fair compensation.
Lloyds Bank  has confirmed that its received  my provisional decision  but hasnt sent me 
any more comments or information.
Mr and Mrs M emailed  me on 15 March 2019,  unhappy with the way we, as a service, 
and I, as an ombudsman,  have handled their complaint. They said I hadnt  adequately 
addressed certain  complaint points, or fairly considered their submissions. I replied to 
Mr and Mrs M on 19 March 2019.  They subsequently requested, and received, copies of all 
the correspondence weve received from Lloyds Bank. And on 3 May 2019, Mr and Mrs M 
wrote to me to explain why they disagree  with my provisional decision. Mr and Mrs M also 
emailed me on 30 June 2019 to reiterate some of the points they made  in their earlier  
correspondence.
Below, Ive summarised  and addressed  the points theyve made.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs M say that if they hadnt had to pay for BLRI with Loans 1, 2 and 3, 
theyd have had approximately £17,000 in their current account in December 2010, 
so they wouldnt  have needed Loan 4. Mr and Mrs M refer to this as their second 
point in their letter  dated 3 May 2019. Their third point is that the BLRI payments 
from their current  account caused  them to incur  additional overdraft interest and 
charges  and that Lloyds Bank should hypothetically reconstruct their current 
account and other financial products on a month-by-month basis to work out how 
much extra  they paid in interest  and charges as a result  of the BLRI  payments. They 
stress the cumulative, compounding nature of all of this. Mr and Mrs M said much the 
same in the email  they sent me on 15 March 2019 and essentially reiterated this 
point when they emailed me on 30 June 2019.  Indeed, this is what  theyve said from 
the very start. And I addressed these  points in my provisional decision.
In my provisional decision,  I explained  why I dont  think Lloyds Bank needs to 
hypothetically reconstruct  Mr and Mrs Ms current account or any other financial 
product in the way they want. I explained that simple interest is paid,  at the rate it is, 
to compensate consumers for being  kept out of money they would  have otherwise 
had, reflecting the fact that, for consumers, there are costs and losses involved. I 
explained why I didnt think a speculative, open-ended inquiry into Mr and Mrs Ms 
Ref: DRN27079662financial position was appropriate. And I concluded that Mr and Mrs Ms 
consequential losses were far too speculative, relying entirely on the proposition that 
they would  have set aside  the amount they paid for BLRI each month and had it 
available at a later date,  which was, in my opinion, very unlikely. 
Mr and Mrs M havent explained why they think Im wrong  theyve  simply repeated 
that they would have  had more than £17,000 in their current account  in 
December 2010  without responding to the point I made about the likelihood  of them  
setting this money aside.  They havent  addressed  the points I made about simple 
interest. Nor have they have said, by reference  to my provisional finding that I dont 
think Lloyds Bank needs  to hypothetically  reconstruct any account, why they think it 
should. Instead, theyve focused  on how they think it should. In their email of 
15 March 2019,  Mr and Mrs M said I clearly hadnt looked at the calculations theyd 
provided, and that in order  to reach  a quantitative conclusion, I would need  to have 
done some  calculated analysis of the data theyd sent me. When I wrote  to them  on 
19 March 2019,  I explained that Id carefully  considered all the available  evidence 
and arguments,  including  the calculations  theyd provided. However, I said that as Id 
made a provisional  finding that Lloyds  Bank  doesnt need to hypothetically 
reconstruct their current account or any other,  I didnt need  to comment on 
calculations showing that kind of reconstruction or do similar calculations myself.  
I appreciate that Mr and Mrs M strongly disagree with my provisional  findings. But 
they havent said anything that changes my mind.  I remain  of the opinion that a 
speculative, open-ended inquiry  into Mr and Mrs Ms financial position isnt 
appropriate and that the simple interest theyve received is adequate compensation 
for being kept out of money they would have otherwise had. My reasons remain the 
same.
Mr and Mrs M dont  feel Ive given them enough time to analyse  the extra information 
theyve received. Mr and Mrs M refer to this as their first point  in their letter dated 
3 May 2019.
I initially asked both parties to send me their final submissions by 5 April 2019. When 
they emailed me on 15 March 2019,  Mr and Mrs M asked for more  time  so I said 
they could have until 19 April 2019 to send  me their final submissions. One of our 
adjudicators sent Mr and Mrs M all the information  weve received from Lloyds Bank 
on 22 March 2019. On 1 April 2019, Mr and Mrs M asked  for a three-month  extension 
and I refused. I said they could have until 3 May 2019 to let me know  their final 
points. In my letter to Mr and Mrs M, I explained  that the calculations  Id summarised 
in my provisional decision were sent to them on 18 September 2018  so theyd had 
the materially relevant  information for a long time. And I felt six weeks was enough 
time to review the extra  information theyd received. 
Mr M has explained that hes very busy professionally and works overseas each 
month. He says that, as a result, hes only had a few days  to review the information 
provided and reply to my provisional decision.
I appreciate that Mr M may be busy. But Mr and Mrs M have had a detailed 
breakdown showing  how Lloyds Bank  has calculated their BLRI compensation since 
September 2018. So Im satisfied that theyve had enough time to review this 
information, which is somewhat detailed and complex. Theyve also had two months 
to consider and respond to my provisional decision  and six weeks to review  the 
Ref: DRN27079663extra information they requested. My provisional findings on their consequential  
losses are relatively straightforward. For the reasons Ive explained above and in my 
provisional decision, I dont think it was necessary for Mr M to spend  time trying to 
hypothetically reconstruct  their accounts,  in whole or in part. And I think  theyve had 
enough time to tell me why they disagree with me.
Finally, Mr and Mrs M have asked me to furnish  evidence to show  that Lloyds Bank 
restructured Loans 2 and 3 so that the amount they owed, and the number and 
amounts of any future repayments, were  the same  as they would have been if 
Mr and Mrs M had taken  out the loans without BLRI. This is their fourth point.
In my provisional decision,  I explained  in some  detail how Lloyds  Bank had 
calculated Mr and Mrs Ms BLRI compensation. I explained how much  I thought  it 
needed to reduce their loan balances by to remove any unpaid sums caused by 
BLRI. And I explained why I think Lloyds Bank reduced their balances by the right 
amount. I dont know what evidence Mr and Mrs M would like me to furnish. But Im 
satisfied that Mr and Mrs M didnt have to pay for BLRI after the loan balances  were 
restructured.
In conclusion, I have  carefully considered what Mr and Mrs M have said in reply  to my 
provisional decision but my opinion remains the same.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above and in my provisional decision, I think 
Lloyds Bank  PLC has paid Mr and Mrs M fair compensation. So I dont think it needs  to do 
anything more.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs M to 
accept or reject my decision  before  9 August  2019.

complaint
Mr and Mrs M dont  think  Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds  Bank) has paid them  fair compensation in 
response to a complaint about the sale of a number of business  loan repayment insurance (BLRI) 
policies.
background
Mr and Mrs M have  had a number  of business loans with Lloyds Bank.
Below, Ive included some  basic  information  about these loans:
Loan ending 6822 (Loan  1): 8 October 2004-13 December 2006
Loan ending 8412 (Loan  2): 11 December  2006-12 December 2016
Loan ending 3228 (Loan  3): 23 June 2008-14 April 2016
Loan ending 0335 (Loan  4): 7 September 2010-14 April 2016
Lloyds Bank  has told us Loan 2 refinanced Loan  1, Loans 2, 3 and 4 ran concurrently  and Loan 3 was 
an interest-only  loan.
With Loans  1-3, Lloyds  Bank sold Mr and Mrs M a BLRI policy. BLRI is a type of payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy Lloyds  Bank  sold with business loans.
In 2013, Mr and Mrs M complained that the BLRI policies were mis-sold.
In November 2013, Lloyds  Bank  agreed that the policies  sold with Loans  2 and 3 were mis-sold.  It 
offered to refund  everything Mr and Mrs M paid for these policies and pay simple interest (at 8% per 
year) on the extra theyd paid for BLRI each month, from the date each payment was made until they 
received the refund. Mr and Mrs M called  Lloyds Bank on 29 November  2013 to accept this offer.
Initially, Lloyds Bank didnt agree that the BLRI policy  sold with Loan 1 was mis-sold.  However, in 
November 2015 it refunded  everything  Mr and Mrs M paid for this policy  with simple interest.
For the reasons  I explain and address below, Mr and Mrs M dont think  this is enough.
When they first referred their complaint  to our service, Mr and Mrs M mentioned a PPI policy they had 
with a credit  card. This matter appears to have been resolved and, in a letter to our service dated 13 
January 2017, clarified that this complaint is about  the financial impact of the three BLRI  policies only. 
So Ill say no more about the credit card PPI policy.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. When considering  what is, in my opinion,  fair and reasonable  in all 
the circumstances of the case, Im required by DISP 3.6.4  R of the Financial  Conduct Authority  (FCA) 
Handbook to take into account:
(1)relevant:
(a)law and regulations;
(b)regulators  rules, guidance and standards;
(c)codes  of practice; and
(2)(where appropriate) what [the ombudsman] considers  to have been good industry  practice 
at the relevant time.
Ref: DRN27079665Where the evidence  is incomplete,  inconclusive  or contradictory, Ive made my decision  on the 
balance of probabilities  that is, what I think is most likely  to have happened given the available 
evidence.
How much did Mr and Mrs M pay for PPI?
Loan 1
In October 2004, Mr and Mrs M borrowed £65,975 from Lloyds Bank. They borrowed an extra  
£6,106.32 to pay for the BLRI policy upfront  so they borrowed £72,081.32  in total.
The loan term was supposed to be 10 years but Mr and Mrs M refinanced the loan in December 2006 
(with Loan 2).
Lloyds Bank  has provided a month-by-month  breakdown showing how much Mr and Mrs M paid each 
month and how much they were charged in interest. Weve shared this with Mr and Mrs M.
Below, Ive included some  key information:
Their payments fluctuate, but Mr and Mrs M were paying approximately  £70 more  a month 
because of BLRI.
They  made 26 payments before  they refinanced the loan, so they paid £1,813.94 in total 
because of BLRI.
They  were charged £809.33 in interest on the extra theyd borrowed for BLRI.
So when they refinanced their loan, theyd repaid £1,004.61 of the extra they borrowed.
As they initially purchased BLRI cover for 10 years but cancelled it after 26 months, they 
received a refund  of £4,045.98. This was paid into their current account  (ending 3718)  on 22 
December 2006.
For reasons  that are unimportant here, they were charged an extra £4.90 in interest because  
of BLRI when  the loan was refinanced.
So of the extra £6,106.32 they borrowed for BLRI,  they still owed £1,060.63 after the 
payments (£1,004.61)  and refund (£4,045.98).
This means that when  they took out Loan 2, they borrowed £1,060.63 more than they would 
have done if they hadnt had BLRI with Loan  1.
Loan 2
In December 2006, Mr and Mrs M borrowed  £142,100 from Lloyds Bank. They  borrowed an extra 
£15,142.27 to pay for another  BLRI  policy  upfront  so they borrowed £157,242.27 in total.
Again, Lloyds  Bank has provided a month-by-month breakdown showing  payments and interest,  
which weve shared with Mr and Mrs M. And Ive included  the key information  below:
Mr and Mrs Ms payments fluctuate a little more  with this loan and they missed payments.
So the amount they paid each month because of the BLRI they bought with this loan varied 
between £148.82 and £183.79. In total,  theyd paid £12,724.30 by December  2013 (when  the 
offer was made).
They  were charged £3,274.12  in interest on the extra they borrowed for BLRI.
So by December 2013, theyd repaid  £9,450.18 of the extra  theyd borrowed and still owed 
£5,692.09.
To repay the extra £1,060.63 they borrowed (because of BLRI  with Loan 1), their monthly 
payments varied  between £10.42 and £12.87. In total, theyd  paid £891.30 by 
December 2013.
They  were charged £229.34 in interest on this amount.
So by December 2013, theyd repaid  £661.96 of this £1,060.63.
Ref: DRN27079666Loan 3
In June 2008,  Mr and Mrs M borrowed £54,810 from Lloyds Bank. They  borrowed an extra £5,823.95 
to pay for another  BLRI  policy upfront  so they borrowed  £60,633.95  in total.
As before, Lloyds Bank has provided a month-by-month breakdown and Ive included the key 
information below:
This loan was an interest-only loan.
Mr and Mrs Ms payments fluctuate with this loan too. And, again, they missed  payments.
There are a handful of months when they paid more, but they usually paid approximately £20 
a month because  of BLRI.
By December  2013, Mr and Mrs M had been charged and supposedly paid just over £1,455 in 
interest because of BLRI.
They  still owed the extra  £5,823.95 they borrowed to pay for BLRI.
What does Lloyds Bank need to do to put things right?
The FCA writes the rules for financial businesses and DISP App 3 of the FCA Handbook tells 
businesses how to put things right if they mis-sold  PPI.
The rules say a business should refund everything the consumer paid for PPI plus simple interest on 
that amount (DISP App 3.7.3 E). In this context, simple interest is a non-compound rate of 8% per 
annum (DISP  App 3.1.5 G). If the loan is open, the business  should  also restructure it to remove any 
unpaid sum caused by PPI. As a result, the number and amounts of any future repayments should  be 
the same as they would have been if the consumer had taken the loan without PPI 
(DISP App 3.7.4 E).
What has Lloyds Bank done  so far?
As Ive explained above, Lloyds Bank made Mr and Mrs M an offer for the policies sold with 
Loans 2 and 3 in November  2013. It paid the compensation  in December 2013. And in 
November 2015, it paid them compensation for the BRLI policy sold with Loan 1.
Loan 2
Rather confusingly, Lloyds  Bank reduced Mr and Mrs Ms Loan 2 balance by £3,292.02 and 
£15,142.27 on 16 December  2013 and then increased  it by £12,340.57  on the same day.
By doing this, it effectively  reduced their loan balance  by £6,093.72.
At the same time, it paid £12,340.57 into Mr and Mrs Ms current  account  (ending 3718).
Based on the month-by-month breakdown  Ive seen, Id have expected Lloyds Bank to have paid Mr 
and Mrs M £12,724.30 and reduced  their balance by £5,692.09. (It is important to remember that this 
is before Lloyds Bank had worked out and paid Mr and Mrs M any compensation for the mis-sold 
BLRI policy with Loan 1.)
The net effect of what Lloyds Bank did and what Id have  expected it to do is the same  so I dont 
think Mr and Mrs M have lost out as a result.
Separately, Lloyds Bank  paid Mr and Mrs M £2,893.21 in simple  interest (after tax) on the extra theyd 
paid. This money  was transferred into their current  account (ending  3718) on 16 December 2013. Ill 
explain the importance of this below.
Loan 3
Ref: DRN27079667As before, and, again, rather confusingly, on 16 December 2013, Lloyds Bank reduced Mr and Mrs 
Ms Loan 3 balance by £1,465 and £5,823.95 and then increased it by £1,400.65.
By doing this, it removed  the cost of the BLRI premium and reduced the loan balance by an additional 
£64.35.
At the same time, it paid £1,400.65  into Mr and Mrs Ms current account (ending  3718).
As before, theres a slight discrepancy between what Lloyds Bank did and the month-by-month 
breakdown it has sent us. Id have expected Lloyds Bank to have removed the cost of the BLRI  
premium, which it did, and paid Mr and Mrs M £1,455. Instead it paid them £1,400.65 and reduced the 
loan balance  by an additional £64.35. Again,  the net effect is the same so I dont think Mr and Mrs M 
have lost out as a result.
Lloyds Bank  also paid Mr and Mrs M an extra £262.51  in simple interest (after tax) on the extra  theyd 
paid.
Loan 1
On 20 November  2015,  Lloyds Bank paid £11,342.35 into Mr and Mrs Ms current  account  (ending 
3718).
Of this, Lloyds Bank told us £6,991.48 was compensation for the BLRI policy  sold with Loan 1. 
£3,273.77 was a refund  of monies  paid and £3,717.71 was simple interest (after tax).
As Ive explained above, Mr and Mrs M paid £1,813.94 for BLRI  when they were  repaying Loan 1. 
And £1,060.63 was rolled over into Loan 2  which  Mr and Mrs M had to repay  and on which they 
were charged interest.
Its not entirely clear  why Lloyds Bank paid Mr and Mrs M £11,342.35 in November  2015.  It told us 
more than £3,000 was compensation for consequential  loss, £500  was compensation  for distress 
and inconvenience  and just under £500 was compensatory interest  as a result  of a restructure of 
Loan 2. Lloyds Bank  now says it paid Mr and Mrs M £2,000 more than it should have done.
For the purpose of this decision, I dont think its necessary for me to fully understand why it did what 
it did  or to make  a finding on whether or not it paid Mr and Mrs M more than it should  have done. 
Lloyds Bank  told us £3,273.77 was a refund of the extra Mr and Mrs M paid for BLRI  with Loan 1  
and this seems to reflect the known and likely payments  based on the information  Ive seen. And it 
paid simple interest (after tax) in the way Id expect it to.
All things considered, I think Lloyds Bank has done exactly what  the rules say it should  do. The 
question is: should it do more?
Has Lloyds  Bank  paid Mr and Mrs M fair compensation?
Put simply, Mr and Mrs M think Lloyds Bank should reconstruct their current  account  on a month-by-
month basis to work  out how much  they would have had in that account  if the extra  theyd paid each 
month for BLRI between 2004 and 2013 hadnt been taken   and on the basis that those funds would  
not have been spent.
In other words, they want me to assume that theyd have had access to the cumulative value of the 
BLRI payments theyd made  at any given time.
Mr and Mrs M say that if theyd  had access to those funds, they wouldnt have missed any loan 
repayments (and therefore incurred  certain fees) and theyd have paid less interest.  They want the 
fees and interest refunded.  Mr and Mrs M also say they would have had sufficient funds to make 
capital payments for Loan 3  which would have had a significant impact on the amount of interest  
Ref: DRN27079668theyd have had to pay. They  also say they wouldnt have needed Loan 4 at all if they had access to 
the cumulative  value  of their BLRI payments  or they would have  needed to borrow  significantly less. 
And they want their loans to be adjusted and compensation  to be paid accordingly.  Mr and Mrs M also 
mention one or two other consequential losses.
I dont think Lloyds Bank  needs to pay Mr and Mrs M any more compensation and Ill explain why.
In total, Mr and Mrs M paid almost £17,500 for BLRI. Lloyds Bank has refunded this. And its paid 
them just under £6,900 in simple interest (after tax).
Simple interest is paid to compensate consumers for being kept out of money  they would have  had if 
they hadnt  been mis-sold  BLRI. And the rate used reflects the fact that, for consumers, there are 
costs and losses involved. A speculative, open-ended inquiry into the consumers financial position   
looking at what the consumers actually did or otherwise  would have done with the money or, in this 
case, whether or not there was an additional, indirect  cost of borrowing  may occasionally be 
necessary, but it will usually  be unrealistic  and unlikely to result in definitive  answers.  And it would  be 
instead of, not in addition to, simple interest.
In this case, I think Mr and Mrs Ms consequential losses are far too speculative   and depend 
entirely on the proposition that they would have set aside  the amount they paid for BLRI  each month 
and had it available at a later date. Based on what Ive seen of their financial circumstances at the 
time, I think this is very unlikely.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, I think Lloyds Bank PLC has paid Mr and Mrs M fair 
compensation.
So unless the comments and information I get by 5 April 2019 change  my mind, I wont tell it to pay 
more.
