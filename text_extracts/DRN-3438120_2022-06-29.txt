The complaint
Mr and Mrs G complain that they were mis-sold a Platinum Account (PA) in 2014 by Lloyds 
Bank PLC (Lloyds).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs G say that they previously had a Gold Account and they were told they couldnt 
keep it and had to take out a PA in 2014. Lloyds says that Mr and Mrs G decided to take out 
the PA based on the information it gave them.
Lloyds has provided records of its interactions with Mr and Mrs G, and I cant see any 
reference to Mr and Mrs G being told they could not keep their Gold account. Lloyds has 
also provided evidence that Mr and Mrs G took the PA out online. So, in following the online 
process, they would have received the relevant information about the PA and chosen to take 
it out after acknowledging this, with no interaction with Lloyds staff. 
So, although I dont doubt Mr and Mrs Gs honest recollections, I think its more likely than 
not that their memory is mistaken, and Lloyds didnt do anything wrong in this sale.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr and Mrs Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G and Mr G to 
accept or reject my decision before 27 July 2022.
