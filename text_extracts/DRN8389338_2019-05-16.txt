K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs J say HSBC UK Bank  Plc (HSBC) mis-sold a Plus packaged bank account to 
them in 2008.  Theyve used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to complain.  
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr and Mrs Js complaint and didnt  think  HSBC had mis-sold the 
packaged account. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr and Mrs Js complaint. Having done so, I dont think  HSBC  mis-sold the 
Plus account  to Mr and Mrs J. Id like to explain why I think thats the case. 
Fee free accounts  are widely  available in the United  Kingdom. And I think Mr and Mrs J 
wouldve known they couldve  had one with HSBC as Mr J already had one at the time of the 
upgrade. So I think that Mr and Mrs J chose to take the Plus account. 
It looks like Mr and Mrs J benefitted from some of the main benefits  - the fee free cash 
withdrawals and preferential savings rates. And I also think that they couldve used other  
benefits like the travel insurance  too. 
Mr and Mrs J may not have been told everything they needed  to know  about  all the benefits.  
But Ive not seen anything to suggest  they wouldve been affected by the main limitations or 
exclusions. So I dont  think clearer information wouldve made a difference  and I think  Mr 
and Mrs J were  given  enough to understand what they were agreeing to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr and Mrs Js complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr and Mrs J to 
accept or reject my decision  before  16 June  2019.
