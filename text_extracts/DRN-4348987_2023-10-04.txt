The complaint
Mr R complains through a third-party representative that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 
118 118 Money irresponsibly lent to him. Hed like the refund of interest and charges on his 
loan along with statutory 8% on refunded sums.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them all again
here. The facts are not in dispute but briefly, 118 118 Money lent Mr R a loan in May 2017 
which he has now fully repaid.
118 118 Money didnt uphold Mr Rs complaint when he complained to it and so he referred 
his complaint to this service where one of our adjudicators looked at it. Our adjudicator didnt 
recommend that the complaint should be upheld.
Mr R disagreed, he said proper checks would have shown he couldnt afford the loan and 
118 118 Money shouldnt have lent.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about high-cost lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
118 118 Money needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay the loan without detriment to his financial circumstances. These checks could 
take into account a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure.  
Having considered all the information provided by both parties, I wont be upholding this 
complaint and will explain why below.
This was Mr Rs first loan with 118 118 Money and the monthly repayments on the loan was 
around 10% of his declared monthly income of £1,520. Mr R declared at the time of the loan 
he lived with parents and that his monthly living costs and credit commitments were around 
£410.
118 118 Money says it searched Mr Rs credit file but hasnt provided the results of its 
search. The Financial Ombudsman Service has asked 118 118 Money for the results of its 
search more than once. Its disappointing this hasnt been provided or any response on the 
issue received from 118 118 Money. So, I dont know what 118 118 Money saw on Mr Rs 
credit file when it decided to lend.
Mr R has provided a copy of his bank statements for the months leading up to this loan and 
Ive used these statements to work out what 118 118 Money would likely have seen had it 
searched Mr Rs credit file. To be clear, Im not saying 118 118 Money should have 
requested Mr Rs bank statements, what Im saying is 118 118 Money has failed to provide 
the results of its search into Mr Rs credit file and on those grounds, Ive relied on the 
available evidence  Mr Rs bank statements to understand his credit commitments at the 
time and what 118 118 Money likely saw.
I think the most relevant statement here is the statement for April 2017 as I think its likely 
credit commitments at the time would have shown up on a search carried out around 22 May 
2017. Mr Rs April 2017 bank statement shows he was repaying a credit card, car finance 
loan and another high-cost credit loan. From what I can those payments were altogether 
around £510. So, I think 118 118 Money would likely have seen those credit commitments.
I can see that in the week before this loan was granted Mr R took further borrowing from at 
least two other lenders, but I think the closeness of those loans to the start of this 118 118 
Money loan makes it unlikely they would have shown up in the credit search.
Given what 118 118 Money knew and what I think it saw from its credit search, I think it did 
enough checks to satisfy itself that Mr R could afford the loan. Mr R had a relatively small 
amount of living costs which he declared, he also said he lived with his parents and his credit 
commitments at the time meant hed have disposable income to comfortably afford to repay 
the loan over its term.
Mr R has said he had a mortgage at the time, but I havent seen any evidence of this on the 
bank statements he provided. Im also mindful that Mr R said the mortgage started in 2018 
which would be after the loan was granted and wouldnt have been a consideration in 
assessing his ability to afford the loan. 
Overall, 118 118 Money likely did enough before it lent and I dont think it lent to Mr R when 
it shouldnt have.
My final decision
For these reasons, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 November 2023.
