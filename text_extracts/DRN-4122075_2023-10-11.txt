The complaint
Mr K and Mrs A complain National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly closed their joint current 
account and refused to tell them why.
What happened
Mr K and Mrs A held an account with NatWest. In late 2022 NatWest gave them 60 days 
notice that their account would close.
An investigator at our service upheld the complaint. They found:
NatWest can review accounts and can generally close accounts in line with their 
terms and conditions. They dont need to provide their reasons to Mr K and Mrs A.
NatWest failed to disclose their reasons for closing the account to our service, which 
they needed to do. As a result, they hadnt shown they closed the account fairly.
NatWest should pay Mr K and Mrs A £100 for the distress and inconvenience they 
experienced because their account was closed.
NatWest agreed to pay £100 redress, but Mr K and Mrs A have asked for a final decision 
from an ombudsman, so their complaint has been given to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided to uphold Mr K and Mrs As complaint. Ill explain why:
Banks can review the customer relationships they hold and can close accounts when they 
have a genuine commercial reason. They should act within their terms and conditions when 
taking a decision to close an account. And they dont currently have to provide their reasons 
to customers. So, I dont require NatWest to tell Mr K and Mrs A why their account was 
closed.
NatWest do have to provide their reasons to our service in order for us to be able to decide 
whether they have acted fairly. Without providing their reasons, its not possible to say the 
closure wasnt an error of fact, plainly irrational or potentially unlawful. 
Here, NatWest refused to provide their reasons to our service despite being asked for them 
several times. And, where a party fails to provide information, I can take account of their 
refusal when reaching my decision. This is an evidential power afforded to me under DISP 
3.5.9R (3). I have exercised this power in reaching my decision.
So, based on the limited information NatWest has provided, I cannot reasonably conclude 
they closed Mr K and Mrs As account fairly  I find that they didnt.
Mr K and Mrs A said they were caused a stress and worry when their account closed, and 
they were further inconvenienced  by having to set up manual payments on another account 
following NatWest declining an account switch. Without evidence to show NatWest acted 
fairly, Im left to conclude the upset and inconvenience caused to both Mr K and Mrs A was 
avoidable and warrants compensation.
Putting things right
Subject to Mr K and Mrs A accepting this final decision, NatWest need to pay them £100 for 
the distress and inconvenience caused by closing their joint account. While I understand 
they were offended and inconvenienced by NatWests decision, particularly as they were 
long standing customers, I havent seen evidence to show they were impacted in a way 
which would justify a larger sum.
My final decision
Ive decided to uphold Mr K and Mrs As complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc need to 
pay them redress according to my above direction.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A and Mr K to 
accept or reject my decision before 7 November 2023.
