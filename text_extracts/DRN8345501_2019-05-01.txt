compl aint
Mr E has complained about short-term loans granted to him by CashE uroNet UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid). Mr E says he couldnt afford these loans  and that QuickQuid didnt 
take appropriate steps to check whether he could afford them when he took them out.
background
QuickQuid agreed eleven short-term loans for Mr E between August 2016 and August 2018 . 
Each loan was repay able over between one and three months. Mr E took out top-ups on 
loans  4, 8 and 9. This is where he took out further borrowing under the same agreement, 
before paying back the initial amount borrowed. Ive set out a summary of the lending below.

One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Es complaint already and recommended  the 
complaint be uphel d in part. He felt the chec ks QuickQuid carried out on loans 1 to 4 were 
proportionate, but that the chec ks carried out on loans 4a to 11 werent. He thought that had 
QuickQuid carried out proportionate chec ks on loans 4a  11, it wouldve likely seen that 
these would not have been sustainably affordable for Mr E, and wouldve not agreed to them.
Mr E accep ted the adjudicators findings. QuickQuid however disagreed with the findings. So 
as no agreements been reached at this stage, the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, 
for a final decision.
As loans 1 - 4 no longer appear  in dispute, my decision will focus  on QuickQuids lending 
decisions from the top up on loan 4 (4a) onwards.

Ref: DRN8345501my findings
Ive consi dered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonab le in the circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory rules and good indus try practice at the time.
Our adjudicator, having looked at everything, found that QuickQuid didnt carry out 
proportionate checks when Mr E applied for loan 4a onwards. And based on his review, he 
thought that proportionate chec ks wouldve show n these loans to have been unaffordable for 
Mr E. So he thought QuickQuid shoul d refund the interest and charges Mr E paid on these 
loans.  These  findings were set out in some detail in a view letter to the lender.
QuickQuid initially said it carried out appropriate and proportionate affordability assess ments, 
including validation of Mr Es incom e and expens es before funding all these loans. Its said it 
started implementing changes to affordability assessm ents in June 2014 and all the chang es 
were completed by 28 February 2015.
It said that starting 1 March 2015,  before Mr E borrowed his first loan, it had implemented an 
affordability review that was consi stent with the FCA (Financi al Conduct Authority) Handbo ok 
and was in place at the time it received authorisation by the FCA. And that its assessment 
was conduc ted properly and individually for each of these applications.
QuickQuid raised this argument in both its initial subm issions, and in response to the 
adjudicators asses sment. However, I can see that the adjudicator has already consi dered 
this point in his asse ssment.
He said: I note what youve said about  the loans Mr E borrowed from 2015 onwards, 
however our job is to look not only into the rules and regulations set by the regulator at the 
time of borrowing but also the law, good  indust ry practice and all the available evidence  and 
arguments to help us decide whether we think what the business  has done is right or not.
In this case I dont think you were right to provide Mr E with some of the loans he borrowed 
from 2015  onwards.
I fully agree with this point. And this service has responded to QuickQuid on the abov e 
generic argument directly and through earlier final decisions. So Im not going to expand on 
this point any further here, though I have consi dered it alongsi de everything else in making 
my decision.
I would remind QuickQuid at this point of the FCA guidance in how complaints are to be 
dealt with prom ptly and fairly (my emphasi s) by businesses. In particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] 
which says that business es proced ures for complaint handl ing shoul d 
ensur e that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombuds man are effectively 
applied in future complaint handl ing, for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombuds man to the individuals in the respondent who 
handl ed the complaint and using it in their training and devel opment;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombuds man conce rning complaints 
received by the respond ent and using this in training and devel opment of the individuals 
dealing with complaints in the responden t; and
Ref: DRN8345501(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financi al 
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints in 
the respondent .
So my decision will focus on the specifics of Mr Es complaint and what both parties have 
said about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr E borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in mind 
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consum er Credit 
Sourceboo k (CONC), I would expect a lende rs affordability assessm ent to vary with 
circumstance . (I am not quoting the speci fic regulations here becaus e, as before, I would 
expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions, 
particularly recen t decisions, which set these out in detail.)
In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consum er of not being able to repay  the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assur ance by carrying out more detailed checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consu mers incom e; or
-the longer the lending relationsh ip
When Mr E topped up loan 4, around 11 days had passed since hed borrowed the initial 
advance on this loan. Loan 4 was originally for £300, but after the top-up, QuickQuid had 
increased Mr Es total borrowing under  this agreement to £700.  And this was due to be 
repaid over two months, with a highest monthly repayment of £874.
Given the substantial increase in the amount borrowed, I think at this stage QuickQuid, as 
well as looking into Mr Es regular monthly income and expendi ture (including regular credit 
commitments and living costs), shoul dve also looked into whether he owed any monies to 
any other short-term lenders at the time. To ensu re that he was in a position to meet the 
repay ments on this loan sustainably.
Had it done so, I think it wouldve seen  that at the time Mr E topped  up loan 4, he owed 
around  £770 to other short-term lender s. Which when deduct ed from his declared monthly 
income of £2,006, along with his regular declared monthly expendi ture of £850, left him with 
just under £400  from which to meet his repay ments. And given that the highest monthly 
repayment on loan 4a was £874,  I think proportionate checks wouldve shown QuickQuid 
that Mr E was in no position to be able to repay  this loan sustainably, and as a respons ible 
lende r, would not have agreed to this loan knowing this.
Mr E repaid loan 4 (including the top-up  4a) at the end of July 2017, and within two days 
returned to QuickQuid again, this time borrowing £600 which was due to be repaid in a 
single instalment of £758. Given the length of time Mr E had been taking loans from 
QuickQuid, and the increasing amounts he was borrowing, I think by now, and from this 
point on, QuickQuid shouldve built a full picture of Mr Es financ ial circumstances and 
verified the information it was given, to ensu re he could afford to meet the repayments on 
any future lending sustainably.
Mr Es provided bank  statements from around the time of the loans in question. So Ive 
looked at these , and all the other evidence provided by both parties, to work out what I think 
proportionate checks wouldve show n QuickQuid, had they been carried out at the time.
Ref: DRN8345501Having done  so, it would seem that at the time Mr E applied for loan 5, his regular monthly 
income and outgoings, were broadly at the level QuickQuid had recorded. But in addition to 
this, he also owed monies to many other short-term lender s at this time. I can also see that 
in the month leading up to taking out loan 5, Mr E had spent almost £7,000 on online 
gambling and gaming sites, which was over three times his monthly income at this point.
So I think had QuickQuid carried out proportionate chec ks, it wouldve seen the abov e, and 
realised that with this level of expend iture towards gambling, which seemed to be mainly 
funded by taking out additional short-term lending, that he was in no position to commit to 
any further credit commitments at this stage, and as respon sible lender would not have 
agreed to loan 5.
Loans 6  11 were taken out between August 2017 to August 2018, and throughout this 
period, Mr Es circumstances chan ged very little. His incom e remained at just over £2,000 a 
month, albeit in some months was as much as £3,000. However his monthly expend iture to 
online gambling and gaming sites, remained well in excess of this figure throughout this 
period, with him spendi ng as much as £18,230 in some months, and on some occasions, 
over £6,000 in a single day.
While the gambling figures fluctuated throughout this period, Mr E continued to spend  high 
levels of money in this regard on a near daily basis, as well as continuing to take out
short-term loans to fund this spend in. So I think QuickQuid wouldve seen this had it carried 
out proportionate chec ks, and wouldve realised that Mr E was in no position to sustainably 
repay any further credit commitments at the time loans  6 - 11 were agreed. And subse quently
would not have approved these applications.
In summary, I dont think the chec ks QuickQuid carried out from loan 4a onwards were 
proportionate. And I think had it carried out proportionate checks, it wouldve realised that 
loans  4a  11, including the top-ups on these loans wouldve been unaffordable for Mr E, 
and as a responsible lende r, would not have approved them.
what QuickQuid shou ld do to put things right
For the reasons outlined abov e, I think QuickQuid shou ld not have approved loans 4a  11 
for Mr E. So it needs to refund all of the interest and charges Mr E paid towards these loans .
Specifically, it shoul d:
refund the interest and charges paid on loans 4a  10 agreed on 27 July 2017 to
4 Januar y 2018
pay interest on these  refunds at 8% simple* from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement
remove any adverse information about  these loans from Mr Es credit file
*HM Revenue  & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr E a certificate show ing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
QuickQuid shoul d also:
Ref: DRN8345501remove all the interest and charges added to loan 11 agreed in August 2018 from the 
outset. I under stand this will leave an outstanding balance, so QuickQuid can deduct this 
balance from what it now needs to pay Mr E abov e, if it still owns the debt.
If, after all of the abov e has been  actioned,  a balance remains outstanding, a mutually 
agreeabl e repay ment plan shoul d be arranged
my final decision
For the reasons set out above I uphol d Mr Es complaint in part.
And I require CashE uroNet UK LLC to put things right as described above.
Under the rules of the Financ ial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 June 2019.
