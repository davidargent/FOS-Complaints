The complaint
Mr S complains that he lost access to his account with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
(PayPal) and that his account was limited.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute so I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
For me to say PayPal did something wrong, Id need to be satisfied that they failed to act 
within the terms of the accounts User Agreement. Or, if I feel like they did work within these, 
that it was unfair for it to limit the account in the circumstances of this complaint. And in this 
situation, I dont think thats the case. 
PayPal have supplied information to show they have attempted to send security 
verification messages to Mr Ss mobile phone. Although there does appear to be an 
issue with Mr S receiving these messages, Im satisfied the issue is not with PayPal 
sending them and more likely than not due to Mr S residing abroad. 
PayPal limited Mr Ss account. Our service wont generally get involved in a 
businesss decision to end a relationship with one of its customers, but we can look 
at whether its been done fairly. On this occasion I think it has been. 
When Mr S opened his PayPal account, he signed up to its User Agreement. In the 
User Agreement it says 
RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES
Access the PayPal services from a country that is not included on our permitted 
countries list.
Its clear Mr S is residing in one of the countries not on the permitted list. So, I 
dont find it unfair or against the User Agreement when PayPal have limited Mr 
Ss account. 
I understand Mr S has resided abroad for some time and has been able to use 
his account from that country. Although I understand Mr Ss frustration thats its 
only now, he has had his account limited, PayPal can do this at any time. 
Although Mr S may have been able to use his account for some time without 
PayPal reviewing or limiting it, Im satisfied that its not a reason to now ignore the 
fact Mr S has an account that is against the restricted activity section of the User 
Agreement. Its also common industry practice for firms to monitor accounts for 
activity which may fall outside their risk appetite.
PayPal have agreed to transfer Mr S his account balance once he provides 
identification documents. Ive seen the documents PayPal have asked for and 
they are reasonable given the limitation. 
In summary PayPal can limit and close an account at any point over the duration of its 
relationship with a user. It has done in the circumstances of this complaint, and I havent 
found it acted unfairly or outside of the terms of the account by doing so.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 August 2023.
