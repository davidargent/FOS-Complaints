The complaint
Mr B complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) irresponsibly granted him a Marbles credit card 
account that he couldnt afford to repay. 
What happened
Mr B entered into an agreement with NewDay to have access to credit with an account that 
was opened for him in October 2020. The account had an opening credit limit of £250. 
NewDay went on to give Mr B an increased credit limit of £1,250 in March 2021 and then a 
further increase to £2,250 in July 2021. 
Mr B says NewDay didnt complete adequate affordability checks when it opened his 
account and increased his credit limit. He says that had it done so, NewDay would have 
seen he had a history of bad debt. He has also requested that NewDay writes off most of the 
outstanding balance on his account. 
NewDay agreed to offer to refund Mr B all interest and charges added to Mr Bs account 
since March 2021. Our adjudicator said this offer was fair but Mr B is unhappy about it. 
The complaint has therefore come to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. So, I dont 
consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our approach to 
these complaints is set out on our website. 
Ill first look at the account opening to see if it was fair of NewDay to grant Mr B the initial 
account credit. Ill then consider the offer that NewDay has made. 
Account opening
Before granting the new account NewDay looked into Mr Bs financial situation. I think 
NewDay gathered a reasonable amount of evidence and information from Mr B about his 
ability to repay his account. This included completing a credit check with credit reference 
agencies. These checks showed he already had around £600 in unsecured borrowing and 
ongoing credit commitments. It also showed that he had a default from 29 months earlier 
and also an adverse public record. NewDay says that based on that Mr B had met its 
acceptance criteria. However, just because it looks as if NewDay carried out proportionate 
checks, it doesnt automatically mean it made a fair lending decision. So, Ive thought about 
what the evidence and information showed. 
Ive also looked at the other information and evidence NewDay gathered, including from 
Mr Bs initial application. Having done so, Im satisfied that the checks that were completed 
showed that the agreement was likely to be affordable to Mr B. I say this because Mr Bs 
card application details showed him as having an annual income of around £5,000. Overall, 
given what Ive seen about Mr Bs financial history and the income hed declared alongside 
the relatively low credit limit hed been given, I dont think NewDay acted unfairly when 
approving the finance application. 
It follows that, having looked carefully at all the available evidence and information, I dont 
think Ive seen evidence or information that shows NewDay was unfair in allowing Mr B to 
open the account and that regular, sustained payments on the account by him would be 
unaffordable. I cant reasonably conclude that at that point NewDay ought to have known he 
would struggle to make the repayments. 
Is NewDays offer fair?
Having looked at the terms of NewDays offer to refund the interest and charges arising from 
the two credit limit increases, Im satisfied that this is in accordance with the way wed expect 
businesses to compensate consumers in these cases. I know that Mr B has asked if 
NewDay would reduce his balance to £250 but that would require that NewDay writes off 
most of what he owes, which isnt something this service would usually expect to happen. 
Generally speaking, this service does not ask businesses to write off remaining balances on 
accounts. When upholding a complaint, it is also usual for us to recommend that any interest 
and charges are used to pay off in whole or part any remaining balances on the relevant 
account. This is fair and reasonable given that the consumer has already had the benefit of 
the money they spent. 
Ive kept in mind what Mr B has told us about his difficult personal situation and ill-health and 
how this has affected his income-earning capacity. Whilst Ive given this full consideration, 
and Im sorry to hear that Mr B is continuing to experience challenging circumstances, I dont 
think this is something that affects my finding that NewDay acted fairly in granting Mr B his 
account and that the offer it has made is fair. 
I would however expect NewDay to continue to act with appropriate forbearance in seeking 
to assist Mr B in his efforts to find a fair and manageable way to pay back the balance that is 
still owing on his account.
Putting things right  what NewDay needs to do
As NewDay shouldnt have increased Mr Bs credit limit to £1,250, I dont think its fair for it 
to charge any interest or charges on any balances which exceeded that limit. However, Mr B 
has had the benefit of the money he spent on the account so I think they should pay this 
back. Therefore, NewDay should:
Rework the account removing all interest and charges that have been applied to 
balances above £250, being the opening credit limit. 
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Mr B along with 
8% simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. NewDay should also remove all adverse information recorded 
after 30 March 2021 regarding this account from Mr Bs credit file. Or, if after the rework the outstanding balance still exceeds £250, New Day should 
arrange an affordable repayment plan with Mr B for the remaining amount. Once 
Mr B has cleared the outstanding balance, any adverse information recorded after 
30 March 2021 in relation to the account should be removed from his credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. It must 
give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if he intends to apply the 
refund to reduce an outstanding balance, it must do so after deducting the tax.
My final decision
Im upholding Mr Bs complaint in relation to the first and second credit limit increases and 
require NewDay Ltd to put things right in the way Ive set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 October 2022.
