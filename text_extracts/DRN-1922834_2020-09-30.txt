DRN-1922834
The complaint
Mrs N complains about the service she received from U K Insurance Limited (UKI) when 
making a car insurance claim.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
UKI arranged recovery as an emergency, which was appropriate. However, it wasnt 
aware that the recovery truck couldnt reach Mrs N, which meant she was stranded 
for longer than she should have been with no communication about this. It accepts it 
should have known this information, so that it couldve made other arrangements for 
Mrs Ns recovery. I think this caused Mrs N unnecessary worry and upset.
UKI agreed to provide Mrs N with a hire car, however she didnt receive it for nearly 
two weeks. I agree this wouldve caused her inconvenience. 
When Mrs Ns car was recovered, it was taken to a depot. UKI couldnt tell her where 
her car had been taken for seven days. As Mrs N needed to retrieve her childs 
wheelchair and medication from the car, I think this again caused unnecessary worry 
and upset to her. 
UKI has recognised that there were service issues and paid Mrs N £300 
compensation. Given the impact the problems had on Mrs N, I agree with our 
investigator that this amount should be increased to £500. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I require U K Insurance Limited to pay total 
compensation of £500 (it can deduct from this any amount it has already paid Mrs N in this 
respect). 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs N to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2020.
