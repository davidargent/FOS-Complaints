K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains about charges and interest  applied to his account with Lloyds Bank Plc from 
2009 to 2011. 
background
An investigator has already considered this case. He was satisfied that Lloyds had refunded 
all the interest and charges which shouldnt have been applied to Mr Hs account. And he 
was also satisfied Lloyds  had explained  why this error occurred in the first place. 
Unhappy with the investigators findings, this case has been  referred  to me to now consider. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed the papers I note that Lloyds has already acknowledged that the interest 
and charges in question  were applied to Mr Hs account in error. They were pending charges 
and were applied  to Mr Hs account after the parties had agreed a free repayment plan. 
Lloyds has described  these charges as system generated. I agree these charges shouldnt 
have been applied. I see Lloyds has cancelled them and refunded the sum in question  to 
Mr H by cheque.  I believe  the right amount  has been  refunded.
I appreciate Mr H is unhappy with the time it has taken Lloyds to refund this balance.  And he 
feels hes been passed around a lot during this complaint process. However  overall Im 
satisfied Lloyds has done enough  on this occasion.  Im therefore  not going  to ask them to do 
anything further.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules  of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or reject  my decision before 
20 December 2019.
