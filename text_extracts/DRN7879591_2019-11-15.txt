K820x#14complaint
Mr L complains  that AvantCredit of UK, LLC gave him a loan he couldnt afford.
background
In 2016 Mr L got a fixed sum loan for £3,000 with AvantCredit. It was repayable over 35 
months. Mr Ls monthly repayments  were £133.52.
Mr L says he couldnt  afford the loan, so AvantCredit shouldnt  have  given it to him. He says 
he hadnt borrowed from AvantCredit before, had used payday loans in the past, and was 
gambling when  he took out the loan. He also had a number of other loans with other 
providers. So this loan contributed to him being in a cycle of debt.
AvantCredit says it carried out a number  of checks before it gave Mr L the loan. It 
considered Mr Ls credit  file, along  with his declared  annual income of £30,754. It also took 
into account his other  debt, and his income  and expenditure. Having  considered all this, it 
thought that the monthly repayments were affordable to Mr L.
Our investigator considered all this information along with the June 2016 affordability  report 
AvantCredit produced.  She took the view that AvantCredit carried  out proportionate  checks 
before making  the decision to lend to Mr L. She appreciated that Mr L hadnt borrowed from 
AvantCredit before taking  out the loan. But she didnt  think  that meant  that it shouldnt  have 
lent the £3,000 to Mr L.
Our investigator said that Mr L made  all his repayments in line with the loan agreement. His 
bank statements didnt  show  he was frequently using  his overdraft or that he was struggling 
with his finances. And she couldnt  see that Mr L had told AvantCredit that he was struggling 
to repay  the loan.  In the circumstances,  she didnt think it wouldve been clear to AvantCredit 
that Mr L had difficulties repaying  the loan. So she didnt recommend that Mr Ls complaint 
against AvantCredit should be upheld.  
Mr L asked for his complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman.  Amongst  other things he 
said he was only able to repay the AvantCredit loan because he took out another loan with a 
credit union.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so I dont think Mr Ls 
complaint should  be upheld  either. Ill explain why.
AvantCredit should only have given Mr L the loan it if it had assessed  his ability to repay, 
and decided it was affordable. Theres no prescriptive list of what  lenders should do when 
assessing affordability. It was required to carry out proportionate affordability  checks,  taking 
into account things  such as the amount Mr L was borrowing,  his credit history  and financial 
position at the time.
Ref: DRN78795912AvantCredit has told us about the checks it carried out before giving Mr L the loan. Amongst 
other things  it considered  his credit file and information about  his income and expenditure. It 
has also provided us with a copy of an affordability report it compiled in June 2016. Having 
considered all this information myself, I think the checks  were  proportionate given the size of 
the loan, the monthly repayments,  and Mr Ls financial position  at the time. Im also satisfied 
that AvantCredit took into account Mr Ls debts when he got the loan.
Mr L has provided us with copies of his bank statements. He thinks  they show  the true 
picture of his finances when he got the loan. Ive looked at these even though AvantCredit 
wasnt required to look at these statements  when it decided whether to give Mr L the loan. 
The statements  dont show me that Mr L was in difficulties  or gambling excessively when he 
got the loan. Mr L was repaying other debts in June 2016, and Im conscious that he had 
previously taken out payday loans. I appreciate the effect he says these  payday  loans had 
on him. However, he wasnt overdrawn when he got the loan with AvantCredit, and had only 
been overdrawn sporadically in the months  beforehand.
Mr L has told us he was able to repay the AvantCredit loan because  he took out another  
loan with a credit union some months  later. However, AvantCredit have provided us with 
evidence to show that Mr L made seven repayments on time before paying more than 
£2,680 towards  the loan (presumably with the credit union loan).  That indicates to me that he 
could afford  to repay the AvantCredit  loan. Im pleased that after Mr L took out the 
AvantCredit loan he was able to get another loan to repay his debts more quickly.  But that 
doesnt indicate to me that his AvantCredit  loan was unaffordable.
Taking the matter  as a whole, I dont think AvantCredit made a mistake when it gave Mr L 
the loan. It follows  that I dont uphold this complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 December  2019.
