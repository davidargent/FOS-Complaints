K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains about his mortgage  lender, Bank Of Scotland  Plc (BoS). Hes unhappy that 
BoS didnt offer him a new interest rate product on his mortgage  in 2009, and on a number 
of separate occasions since then. 
Mr C complains that hes paid too much  interest  on his mortgage  as a result  of BoS choosing 
not to make  new interest rate products  available  to him.
background
In 2007 Mr C took out an interest only mortgage  with Bank of Scotland for around Â£193,000. 
The mortgage was on a two year tracker  of 0.39% above Bank of England  base rate that 
expired in June  2009. At that point the mortgage  reverted onto BoS Home Loan Rate, which 
was 4.84% in 2009.
In May 2009  BoS sent Mr C a letter saying  it had noticed he hadnt  yet sorted out a new 
interest rate product.  The letter said he should  get in touch with BoS about this. Mr C says 
he called  BoS to take out a new product. But, when he did, he was told there  werent any 
rates available to him. 
Mr C says he also asked BoS for new product switches on different  occasions since  2009  
but he wasnt offered  any new rate deals then either.  In 2016  Mr C repaid the mortgage.
In 2019 Mr C complained  to BoS about its decision  not to offer him an interest  rate in 2009, 
and on subsequent occasions. Mr C also complained to BoS about other issues  but he 
hasnt referred the other parts of his complaint to us. 
Mr C says BoS failure to give him a new deal has continued to bother him over the years. 
He feels hes paid too much interest on his mortgage as a result.
BoS gave its final response to Mr Cs complaint on 28 March  2019. Mr C was unhappy with 
BoS response and brought his complaint to us. Bank of Scotland  didnt give its consent for 
us to look at Mr Cs complaint about  it not making a new product available  to him in 2009.  It 
said this matter had been brought to us out of time.
I issued a jurisdiction  decision setting out why we couldnt look at Mr Cs request to take out 
a new product in 2009. This matter  had been  brought to us too late. But I said we could look 
at why BoS hadnt made new interest  rate products  available to Mr C when hed asked for 
them from 2013 to the date he repaid the mortgage  in 2016. 
BoS said it couldnt find a record that Mr C had ever asked for a new interest rate from 2013 
to when he repaid  the mortgage in 2016.  So it didnt uphold this part of his complaint. Our 
investigator also thought BoS hadnt  acted unreasonably as she couldnt  find evidence that 
Mr C had asked BoS for a new interest rate product during this period of time.  
Mr C asked that an ombudsman reach  a final decision on his complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN44529642Mr C complains that he asked BoS for a new interest rate a number of times but it didnt 
make a lower rate available to him. Mr Cs shared  copies of complaints that hes had with 
BoS in 2013 to show that he did ask for a new product at that time. 
Ive seen Mr Cs complaint letter dated 15 April 2013. Ive also seen  copies of the final 
response letters sent by BoS on 24 April 2013, 16 July 2013, 24 July 2013 and 10 
September 2013 responding  to a number of various  concerns  about  the running  of this 
mortgage. Im conscious that BoS has pointed  out that it gave Mr C six months  from the date 
of these final responses to bring these complaints to us if he was dissatisfied with the 
responses given  by BoS. However, while these letters are useful context for the overall 
handling of the mortgage account, I dont think these  complaint letters  directly  involve the 
issue brought to us now.
The issues  raised  by Mr C in 2013  are about problems with the payments made by the 
Department of Work  and Pensions to help with his mortgage interest payments. One of 
which for example  is around the fact a DWP payment  is returned  in error and this led to an 
adjustment of interest on Mr Cs mortgage. Mr Cs concerns and requests for help in 2013 
appear more to be asking BoS to sort out administrative issues around mortgage payments.  
I cant see that Mr C asks for a new interest  rate product during 2013.
In fact, having gone back over the correspondence history BoS has shared with us from 
2013 to 2016. I can see theres  a regular dialogue  between the parties about the running of 
the mortgage. However, from the evidence available to me, I havent been able to find a 
record that Mr C asked  for a new product between 2013 and 2016  or that BoS declined  such  
a request.
I dont doubt Mr Cs recollection that hes asked for new interest rate deals at times  in the 
past. However, I havent been able to find a record of such  a request over the period of time 
that I can consider  in this complaint. 
From 2018  its become  good industry practice for lenders to proactively  contact  mortgage  
customers and let them know about new interest  rate products. And recent  changes  to 
mortgage regulations require  lenders to do more than in previous years  to publicise and 
promote rates to their customers  who are paying more for their mortgage by staying on 
Standard Variable  Rates (SVRs). But this wasnt the case from 2013 to 2016.  At that point, it 
was the expectation at the time that Mr C would ask BoS for a new interest  rate deal. And, if 
asked, BoS would let him know what deals he was eligible for.
I know Mr C will be disappointed by my decision, but I havent found any evidence to support 
his complaint that BoS unfairly  refused to offer him a new interest  rate product on his 
mortgage from 2013 to 2016.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 April 2020.
