The complaint
Mr A complains NewDay Ltd trading as Fluid (NewDay) acted irresponsibly when it approved 
a credit card account for him. 
What happened
Mr A says he applied for a credit card with NewDay in August 2020, and he was provided 
with a credit card limit of £1,200. Mr A says if NewDay had carried out a more thorough 
investigation of his finances it would have shown he was under financial pressure elsewhere 
and the credit card shouldnt have been approved. Mr A wants NewDay to refund all interest 
and charges with 8% simple interest on that sum and remove any adverse markers from his 
credit file. 
NewDay says it carried out reasonable and proportionate checks when Mr A applied for the 
credit card account and no further increases were agreed thereafter. NewDay says their 
checks showed there was no adverse credit information at the time the credit limit was 
approved. NewDay says it acted fairly and previously supported Mr A with a payment holiday 
and suspended interest payments when he informed them hed lost his job. NewDay says it 
acted appropriately when marking his credit file when the due monthly payments were 
missed and has a responsibility to do so. 
Mr A wasnt happy with NewDays response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator felt NewDay had carried out reasonable and proportionate checks for the level of 
credit being provided at the time of application. The investigator says it appeared that it was 
the change in Mr As personal circumstances that caused the financial difficulties he faced, 
but he couldnt hold NewDay responsible for that. 
Mr A didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding this complaint and I will explain how I have come to my 
decision.
I can see that Mr A has gone through a difficult time both financially and with his health and 
that must have been a worrying time for him. When looking at this complaint I will consider if 
NewDay acted responsibly when it approved the credit card account for Mr A in August 
2020. Mr As complaint centres around the fact that NewDay could have done more to check 
his financial position before approving the £1,200 credit card facility in August 2020, and if it 
had it would have shown he couldnt have afforded it. 
While I understand the points Mr A makes here Im not fully persuaded by his argument. I 
say this because when considering issues surrounding irresponsible lending, its important to 
establish if the lender  here NewDay, carried out what is considered to be reasonable and 
proportionate checks and Im satisfied it did that here. Its worth saying there are no set rules 
as to what checks a business must undertake, but these checks should be proportionate to 
the amount lent, term and ability of the consumer to maintain future payments. 
From the information I have seen Mr A applied for a credit card in early August 2020 and 
based on the income he declared and his financial position at that time, a limit of £1,200 was 
approved. Given Mr A had declared an income of £65,000 and NewDays checks at that time 
showed no adverse credit issues on the borrowing he had outstanding elsewhere, I cant say 
an initial limit at that level was unreasonable. 
Its also worth mentioning NewDay declined future limit increase requests and once it 
became aware of Mr As health and related financial issues, it provided support by way of 
payment holidays and an interest freeze  as I would expect. I can also see NewDay as a 
gesture of good will refunded some charges which I am satisfied was fair of them here. 
While I have some sympathy with Mr A given the financial issues he faced, I cant say that 
was ever made known to them at the time Mr A applied for the credit card account nor would 
it have been clear from the checks it carried out back in August 2020. 
So, while Mr A may not agree I cant say NewDay have acted unfairly here, and it does have 
a responsibility to record accurate information to the relevant credit agencies as it explained 
to Mr A in the letters it sent to him in June 2022 and July 2022. With that in mind, I cant ask 
NewDay to remove the markers on Mr As credit file or to refund the interest and charges on 
the credit card account. Its important that Mr A now discusses with NewDay or its collection 
agents a suitable way forward if that hasnt already been arranged. 
While Mr A will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of NewDay 
here. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 May 2023.
