The complaint
Ms I complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland plc wont compensate her for the issues 
that she had with some hotel accommodation.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Ms I used her Royal Bank of Scotland credit card in May 2019 to pay £2,554.10 for 
an overseas holiday for her family and herself in August 2019 - and she received an 
accommodation voucher that showed that a deluxe room had been booked for two 
adults and two children;
she says that hotel wasnt expecting her to be accompanied by two children and that 
the room provided didnt have enough beds for her family  she paid £537 to upgrade 
to a larger room  but she says that she was told that there would be an additional 
charge for an extra bed (which she declined to pay for so one of her children slept on 
a sofa);
she complained to the hotel, the holiday company and then to Royal Bank of 
Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland initially considered her complaint under the 
chargeback rules but didnt consider that a chargeback claim would be successful;
it then considered her claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 but 
said that there hadnt been a breach of contract by the holiday company  but as a 
gesture of goodwill it offered to pay her £537 to reimburse her for the cost of the 
room upgrade;
Ms I didnt accept that offer and complained to this service  our investigator said that 
there had been a breach of contract but Royal Bank of Scotland had reimbursed her 
for the additional costs  and it had agreed to pay Ms I £200 for the poor customer 
service that shed received  and the investigator thought that that was reasonable;
Ms I has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman and has 
responded in detail to the investigators recommendations - she says, amongst other 
things, that she hasnt received any compensation from Royal Bank of Scotland and 
that it hasnt properly considered her claim under section 75;
Royal Bank of Scotland explained in a letter to Ms I why it had prioritised a 
chargeback claim over a claim under section 75  and I consider that the reasons 
that it gave were fair and reasonable  it was also clear from its letter to Ms I that it 
had considered her claim under section 75 but didnt consider that there had been a 
breach of contract;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Ms Is complaint about Royal Bank of Scotland, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday 
company and that Royal Bank of Scotlands response to her claim under section 75 
wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Ms Is claim under 
section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
I consider that the accommodation voucher shows that Ms I had booked a deluxe 
room for four people  so I consider that it was reasonable for her to expect that the 
room would have enough beds for four people;
it didnt and I consider that to have been a breach of contract by the holiday company 
 Ms I paid £537 to upgrade to a larger room and Royal Bank of Scotland has offered 
to pay her £537 to reimburse her for the cost of the room upgrade (which I consider 
to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances - but Ive seen no evidence to show 
that the payment has been made to Ms I);
Ms I declined to pay the additional charge for an for an extra bed in the room - that 
was her choice and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require Royal Bank of Scotland to pay her any other compensation as a result of the 
breach of contract when she declined to pay the additional charge for an extra bed;
Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed to pay £200 to Ms I to compensate her for the 
distress and inconvenience caused by the poor service that it provided to her  and I 
consider that to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
I sympathise with Ms I for the issues that shes experienced, the effect of them on her 
holiday and the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused by the poor 
service that she received from Royal Bank of Scotland  but I consider that its offer to 
pay her £537 to reimburse her for the cost of the room upgrade and to pay her £200 
for the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused by its poor customer 
service is fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Royal Bank of Scotland to pay any other compensation to Ms I relating to the breach 
of contract about the room and I dont consider that the distress and inconvenience 
that shes been caused by the poor service from Royal Bank of Scotland justifies an 
award of more than £200 compensation.
Putting things right
For the reasons set out above, I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Royal Bank of 
Scotland to pay to Ms I the £537 thats its offered to pay her to reimburse her for the cost of 
the room upgrade (if it hasnt already done so). I also find that it would be fair and 
reasonable for it to pay her £200 to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that 
shes been caused by its poor customer service.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Ms Is complaint in part and I order The Royal Bank of Scotland 
plc to:1. Pay to Ms I the £537 thats its offered to pay her to reimburse her for the cost of the 
room upgrade (if it hasnt already done so).
2. Pay her £200 to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that shes been 
caused by its poor customer service.
.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms I to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2021.
