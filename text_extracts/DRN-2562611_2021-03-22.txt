The complaint
Mrs R complains that she was entitled to an incentive voucher from American Express
Services Europe Limited (AESEL).
What happened
Mrs R had a credit card from AESEL. This gave companion vouchers (CV) which
depended on the amount of annual spend on the card. These could be used towards flights
provided by a partner airline. At the end of March 2019, she switched cards within AESEL.
Mrs R got one CV in April 2019. She then switched back to a card which needed an annual
spend of £20,000 to get a CV. In February 2020, her statement said she needed to spend
another £4,560 to get a CV. She spent £4,500 on 3 March 2020. On 5 March 2020 she
called AESEL to clarify that she was entitled to a CV and was told that she was not  the
scheme only allowed for one CV per billing year. Mrs Rs billing year was from 10 March
2019 to 10 March 2020.
Mrs R complained  she said shed called AESEL previously- in February 2020 and was told
that the statements were correct  and she needed to spend enough money to get to an
annual spend of £20,000 to get a CV voucher. On that advice, shed gone ahead and spent
£4,500. The service she bought wasnt refundable. She said shed been misled into
spending money she didnt need to. She only spent the money to get the CV voucher. She
told us that she had to buy a flight for £1,000 because she didnt get a CV.
AESEL agreed that their statements were misleading. But also, the statements said that only
one CV per billing year was allowed. They couldnt listen to the calls that Mrs R referred to
as theyd been deleted. They provided a summary of the call on 5 March 2020  and this
advised Mrs R that she could only have one CV per year. But - they accepted that because
of what appeared on the statements, Mrs R was misled. They apologised and paid £75
compensation for distress and inconvenience.
 
Mrs R didnt accept that AESELs offer was enough and brought her complaint to this
service. Our investigator said the eligibility rules of the scheme were that Mrs R was entitled 
to one CV within a 12-month period. But, AESEL did cause confusion by leading Mrs R to
believe she would get a CV if she spent enough money. AESEL had apologised and paid
compensation of £75 which she thought was fair.
Mrs R asked that her complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
Where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or contradictory (as some of it is here) I
must base my decision on the balance of probabilities. That is  whats more likely than not
to have happened in all of the circumstances here, based on the available evidence.
AESELs incentive scheme  for Mrs Rs account  ran for her billing year  from 10 March
2019 to 10 March 2020. On 28 March 2019, she transferred from a Classic card (which
needed a spend of £20,000 to get a CV) to a Premium Plus card (which needed a spend of
£10,000 to get a CV). On 30 March 2020, she spent £10,000  and she was issued with a
CV. On 11 April 2020, she transferred back to a Classic card. The incentive schemes were
not affected by the switches between cards  so the anniversary date remained the same.
Mrs R says that she called AESEL ahead of March 2020 and she was told that if she spent
£20,000 on her card, she would get a CV. Shed also seen her statements  which said that
shed get a CV if she spent £20,000. Her statement dated 5 February 2020 said by
spending £20000 on your Card before your Card anniversary date of 10-03-2020 you will
qualify for a reward flight for your companion, to be used when you redeem your Avios for a
flight.you have £15439.48 of qualifying spend, so spend just £4560.52 to receive your
voucher.
But  also, the statement said, One Companion Voucher per Card membership year.
Mrs R spent £4,500 on 3 March 2020, so she reached the annual spend needed to get a CV.
She called AESEL on 5 March 2020. AESEL dont have this call but summarised it when Mrs
R complained to them in March 2020. Ive seen the summary. On the call, Mrs R was
advised that she didnt quality for a CV because only one CV per year was allowed. Ive
seen the contact notes in AESELs records, and they also say that.
We dont know for sure what Mrs R was told when she called AESEL before March 2020  in
February 2020. These calls arent available as AESEL have deleted them in the normal
course of business  they delete them after six months. Mrs R says she was told she would
get a CV if she spent the money. And  her monthly statements also say so. Throughout the
12-month period between May 2019 and March 2020  each one says by spending
£20000 on your Card before your Card anniversary date of 10-03-2020 you will qualify for a
reward flight for your companion.
But, on the other hand, each statement also says, One Companion Voucher per Card
membership year  so, equally, Mrs R could also see that message each month. So, I think
it would be reasonable to think that she should have been aware of the rule  especially as
shed received a CV in April 2019. And at that time, shed made some rationale decisions to
switch between AESELs cards (and back again). She got a CV when she switched from the
Classic card to the Premium Plus card, and then switched back again to the Classic card.
So, at that time, she would have had the opportunity to look at the benefits and terms of
those cards when switching  and understand the rules about CVs.
So, this is a finely balanced decision. I dont think there is enough evidence to uphold Mrs
Rs complaint. But, its also the case that AESELs communications were confusing. So,
while I dont uphold this complaint, I do think that AESEL should compensate Mrs R for more
than £75 - I think that an additional £175 is right as compensation for what happened here.
This is in addition to the £75 already paid.
AESEL accepted my findings. Mrs R made the point that she thought she was entitled to a 
higher amount of compensation  but accepted my findings.
.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both AESEL and Mrs R accepted my findings. So - I wont be departing from what I said in 
my provisional decision for the reasons I gave in it. So - my final decision is that AESEL 
should do what Ive already suggested here. My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
American Express Services Europe Limited should pay Mrs R compensation of £175 
this is in addition to the £75 already paid.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 April 2021.
