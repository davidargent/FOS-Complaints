The complaint
Mr K complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) acted 
irresponsibly when lending to him. 
What happened 
Between June 2016 and March 2017 Sunny provided Mr K with 17 instalment loans ranging 
between £50 - £850. 
Heres a table setting out details of the first ten loans:

Mr K felt that Sunny failed to do proper affordability checks and that it shouldve realised that 
repeatedly taking out these short term loans indicated he wasnt using the loans for their 
intended purpose. Mr K told us he struggled financially for years due to being caught in the 
never ending circle with payday loans. Our adjudicator partly upheld Mr Ks complaint. She didnt think shed seen enough to say 
that loans 1 - 5 shouldnt have been lent. But she felt that by loan 6 Sunny shouldve seen 
that Mr K was likely having money problems. And by loan 8 his overall pattern of borrowing 
suggested hed become persistently reliant on short-term loans. So our adjudicator said 
Sunny shouldnt have lent to him from loan 6 onwards and she set out what she thought 
Sunny should do to put things right for Mr K. 
Sunny didnt agree with everything our adjudicator said but responded with an offer to say it 
was willing to uphold Mr Ks complaint from loan 14 onwards.
We sent this information on to Mr K but this offer was rejected. 
After this, Sunny sent a better offer and said it would uphold the complaint from loan 11 
onwards. But Mr K feels that as this offer still falls short of what our adjudicator 
recommended hed like an ombudsman review. 
So his complaint comes to me to make a final decision. 
What I've decided - and why 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr K could repay 
the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr K could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties. And, in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting other reasonable commitments - as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Taking all this into account, Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and 
information provided and thought about what this all means for Mr Ks complaint.
Sunny has told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr K. It asked him to provide 
details of his income and to tell Sunny what he normally spent each month. And Sunny also 
carried out checks on Mr Ks credit file. 
I agree with the adjudicator that looking at the information Mr K told Sunny about his income 
and outgoings and what Sunny had recorded about his financial situation, it wasnt wrong for 
Sunny to give him the first five loans. These all looked comfortably affordable for Mr K, 
based on what hed said to Sunny about his finances - even taking into account the 
combined monthly repayments when loans overlapped. It was early in the lending 
relationship and so I think the checks it did were enough for Sunny to agree to lend. As Mr K 
hasnt raised any objection to the adjudicators recommendation in relation to these loans, 
I dont think that I need to say more about them. 
Like our adjudicator, I dont agree it was reasonable for Sunny to provide loan 6. At this 
point, I think Sunny shouldve realised that it was clear from looking at Mr Ks borrowing 
history that he was likely having money problems. 
I say this because by the time he asked for loan 6, Sunny could see that Mr K already had 
three other outstanding short term loans with Sunny  and now he was asking for further 
borrowing  his fourth loan application in just 9 days. 
So although the loan mightve appeared affordable, I think that Sunny shouldve realised that 
Mr Ks borrowing record had the hallmarks of someone struggling with debt. And despite 
what hed told Sunny about his finances, it showed that Mr K was having serious problems 
managing his money. So Sunny shouldve seen that the indications were that loan 6  and 
any further lending, wasnt likely to be sustainably affordable for Mr K. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr K to see if there was 
a point at which Sunny reasonably shouldve seen that further lending was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful and so it shouldnt have provided further loans. 
I think Sunny should reasonably have seen that this point was reached by loan 8. I say this 
because:
this was Mr Ks sixth loan application that month, with all the loans due to be repaid 
by 6 monthly instalments (possibly to keep down the cost of the combined monthly 
repayments since it looked like Mr K usually repaid his loans within a few days - or at 
most within a few weeks of taking them out)  
 
following on from his earlier overlapping loans, Sunny could see that when Mr K 
asked for loan 8, hed only just taken out loan 7 three days earlier  and hed only 
just repaid loans 3, 4, 5 and 6 within the last week 
Sunny didnt necessarily do anything wrong when it loaned again to Mr K before hed 
paid all his earlier loans. But Sunny shouldve seen that he wasnt making any real 
inroads into his debt 
 
although the loan amounts were variable this record of borrowing doesnt suggest 
that Mr K was asking to borrow because of a new need for a short term loan. Rather, 
I think this indicated that overall his financial circumstances hadnt improved and he 
had ongoing money problems and wasnt using the loans for their intended purpose.
 
I think that Mr K lost out when Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ks indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time  
 
the number of loans was likely to have a negative impact on Mr Ks ability to access 
mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans. By loan 8 
any further borrowing was likely to be detrimental to Mr Ks credit rating. 
 
So Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 through to 17 and Sunny should put things 
right. 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do 
A) add together the total of the repayments made by Mr K towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 6 - 17, but not including anything already refunded
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr K which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr K originally made the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled
C) pay Mr K the amounts calculated in A and B 
D) remove all adverse entries from Mr Ks credit file for loans 6 and 7. The overall pattern of 
borrowing by loan 8 means any information recorded about loan 8 and all the loans that 
followed is adverse. So all entries about loans 8 - 17 should be removed from Mr Ks credit 
file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr K a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partly upholding Mr Ks complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should take the steps Ive set out to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 May 2020.Susan Webb
