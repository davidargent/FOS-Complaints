The complaint
Mrs H is unhappy that she is missing £20 worth of Premium Bonds taken out with National 
Savings and Investments (NSI). She says the total balance of her Premium Bonds should be 
£72 but shes been told its £52.  
What happened
Mrs H says that, in 1976 she was working for a company. She had a different surname at the 
time. The company started a scheme which involved deducting money from wages each 
week which then went towards a Premium Bond. Mrs H says that she bought a number of 
Premium Bonds around that time.
 
Mrs H says that when she went to buy more Premium Bonds she realised there was money 
missing. Mrs H wrote to NSI on 6 February 2019. She said that her account showed a total 
value of £52 but it shouldve been £72. There is a letter which provides an account summary 
of Mrs Hs Premium Bonds. This lists six Premium Bonds with a combined value of £52.   
Mrs H explained that Premium Bond numbers 9*****081  9*****100 werent showing on her 
records. She sent NSI a Premium Bond certificate showing these Bond numbers and a value 
of £20. 
    
NSI responded on 24 March. They said they had checked the bond numbers shed 
referenced and found that these were not in her name. They explained they have a duty to 
keep information confidential so they couldnt tell Mrs H who they belonged to. They 
confirmed to Mrs H that her complaint wasnt upheld. 
There was further communication between NSI and Mrs H about the Premium Bond which 
Mrs H feels was missing. NSI wrote to Mrs H on 13 May and explained the Premium Bond 
number which Mrs H had quoted to them wasnt in her name. They wrote again on 17 May 
and explained that they had carried out a detailed search of their records but the Premium 
Bond numbers which Mrs H had quoted werent recorded in her surname or maiden name. 
They also said that the forenames and addresses were different as well. They said they 
couldnt rule out the possibility that the Premium Bond numbers may belong to a family 
member. So, they asked Mrs H to confirm any names of family members the Premium 
Bonds may belong to and they would then carry out another check and write to her to 
confirm their findings.
 
Our investigator looked into things for Mrs H and contacted NSI for their response. They 
explained that the Premium Bond numbers Mrs H had mentioned didnt belong to Mrs H and 
sent us information showing these Premium Bonds belonged to someone else. They 
explained that it is possible the certificate for those Bond numbers was sent to Mrs H and 
asked that she should destroy it as it doesnt belong to her. 
     
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. Mrs H disagreed so the matter has come to me 
for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. I understand Mrs H will be 
disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have made this decision. 
The issue here relates to Premium Bond numbers 9*****081  9*****100. Mrs H says these 
belong to her and has provided a copy of a certificate showing these numbers which hold a 
value of £20. NSI says these dont belong to Mrs H and have provided us with information 
which shows these belong to someone else.
 
I have seen a copy of the six certificates which NSI say belong to Mrs H and I have also 
seen a copy of the certificate in dispute. The certificates dont record the holders name or 
their membership number. They contain the Premium Bond number, the value and a date 
stamp showing when it was issued.
 
I have reviewed the information sent to us by NSI and can see their electronic records show 
the Premium Bond numbers in question do belong to someone else. The certificate shows 
the Premium Bond numbers, a value of £20 and also the date stamp of November 1976. NSI 
have sent us a screenshot of an electronic record for these Premium Bond numbers and the 
data on this matches the information on the certificate. It is my view therefore that this 
certificate, which was perhaps sent to Mrs H in error, relates to the electronic record which 
NSI have provided to us. And, the electronic record for this isnt in Mrs Hs name.
 
I can see that Mrs H has provided us with details of her name change and what her name 
was at the time the certificate was issued. I have seen that this name also isnt an exact 
match with the details NSI have on their records.
 
The account summary which NSI sent to Mrs H lists six Premium Bonds. Mrs H has sent us 
a copy of these six certificates and I have seen that the information on these matches the 
electronic data held by NSI for the numbers and the value of the Premium Bonds. I am 
satisfied therefore that these six do belong to Mrs H. 
In light of the above, it is my view that the Premium Bond numbers 9*****081  9*****100 
dont belong to Mrs H. The information I have seen doesnt show that £20 worth of Premium 
Bonds have gone missing from Mrs Hs account. In addition to this, I dont think NSI have 
acted unfairly or unreasonably in refusing to provide any further information to Mrs H about 
the holder of those Premium Bonds. Having identified that they dont belong to Mrs H, I feel it 
was right and proper for NSI to keep information about the other holder confidential. 
 
I can see that Mrs H says that she paid for the Premium Bond numbers 9*****081  
9*****100. I havent seen any information which shows that Mrs H has paid for Premium 
Bonds beyond the six which are in her name. She feels there may have been an error by the 
wages staff at the company she worked for and this led to the Premium Bonds being mixed 
up between two holders. Mrs H wants us to ask NSI to check with the other holder but I dont 
think this is reasonable. NSI have relied on the information they have on their system and 
this shows the number of Premium Bonds held by the other holder and the value. The record 
for the Premium Bonds in dispute matches the information on the certificate, and the record 
is in the name of the other holder. If there was any doubt created by incorrect data, then I 
would have expected NSI to make some enquiries with the other holder. That, however, isnt 
the case here. I havent seen any information, and NSI havent been provided with any 
information, which shows that there had been a mix up and that someone else is now 
benefitting from Premium Bonds which Mrs H had originally paid for. 
I do understand that Mrs H will be disappointed by my decision. Apart from a certificate, 
which doesnt have a name on it, she hasnt provided any further information which would 
persuade me to take the view that the Premium Bonds in dispute belong to her. I do take on board that the Premium Bonds were arranged many years ago and there may not be much 
evidence around now that shows what took place at Mrs Hs company at the time. I have 
therefore looked at what information I do have and what is more likely to be the case than 
not. 
 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given, it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 September 2020.
