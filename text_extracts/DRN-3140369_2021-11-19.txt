The complaint
Company O complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) unfairly restricted its 
account preventing it from trading. 
Company O says it suffered financial loss and inconvenience as a result. For simplicity I will 
now refer to Company O as O. 
What happened
In August 2019, PayPal told O it was temporarily restricting its account. PayPal said it had 
identified products on Os website that violated its Acceptable Use Policy.  
Both parties are aware of what type of product PayPal say violates its policy, so I wont 
expressly set it out here. PayPals actions meant O couldnt trade on its platform until it had 
removed the listed products from trade. 
O removed the products the same day. PayPal then unrestricted Os account that day. O 
continued to trade its other products.
Unhappy with what PayPal did, O complained. O says its products dont contravene 
PayPals Acceptable Usage Policy. PayPal found it had done nothing wrong and had fairly 
applied its terms. O referred its complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators then looked into the matter and, in summary, they found:
- PayPals terms say it can limit a users account if it believes any restricted activities 
are taking place 
- Given the link to a prohibited substance, PayPal was applying its terms fairly by 
restricting Os account 
- PayPal review, limitation and subsequent lifting of any blocks was done in 
reasonable time
- PayPal had applied its Acceptable Use Policy terms fairly as there may be some 
groups of individuals to whom Os products could present a risk to their safety
- PayPal has commercial discretion to decide what products can be sold on its 
platform
Unhappy with what our investigator said, O added: 
- the products PayPal prohibited are not harmful nor do they pose a risk to its 
customers
- PayPal allows other businesses to trade the same prohibited products on its platform. 
So it has been treated unequally. 
- Os products met UK regulatory requirements and PayPals terms are unclear as to 
what is acceptable or not 
Our investigator responded that the products sold by other businesses may differ and they 
cant comment on how PayPal go about applying and reviewing what other companies are 
doing. Also, that O can choose other payment platforms to trade. 
The matter has now been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint. I know my decision will 
disappoint O, so Ill explain why. 
Its clear O doesnt think its breached the terms and conditions of PayPals account. Id like 
to assure O Ive very carefully reviewed the relevant terms of PayPals User Agreement and 
Acceptable Use Policy. Having done that, I can see they allow PayPal to limit or close an 
account if it wishes to do so. So I dont think PayPal did anything wrong when reviewing and 
then restricting Os account. 
PayPal has also explained which specific products O was selling  that led to it placing a 
temporary restriction on the account. This is the crux of Os complaint as it believes the 
products do not violate the Acceptable Use Policy. 
The key wording of the term that being applies here is You may not use the PayPal services 
for activities that:relate to transactions involving other products that present a risk to 
consumer safety . 
I am by no means an expert about this product, but some rudimentary research shows the 
safety of this product isnt as definitive as O says. Given there is some conjecture about the 
risks it can pose to certain groups of individuals, I can understand why PayPal do not want it 
sold on its platform. So I think PayPal is acting fairly by not permitting O to sell these 
products  and importantly, that it is applying its terms fairly. 
As a commercial entity PayPal also maintains discretion to decide what its customers are 
permitted to sell on its platform. 
Im satisfied PayPal carried out its review, and lifted the restrictions when O complied with 
what it was asked to do in a reasonable period of time.  I note O says it nonetheless suffered 
financial loss in lost trades. That may be the case, but I dont think PayPal has done 
anything wrong by applying the block for the day it did. That means I dont think PayPal 
needs to compensate O for any lost revenue or any inconvenience this matter has caused. 
I note O feels PayPals terms are not clear about what can and can be sold on its platform. 
The term its applied here can be open to interpretation given its broad scope. But I dont 
think this has led to an unfair outcome here. 
Lastly, and for the sake of completeness, O says that other businesses are selling the same 
product on PayPals platform which shows inequality. My role is to consider the individual 
merits of the complaint in front of me, which is what Ive done here. In any case, there could 
be a myriad of reasons that determine what PayPal thinks is a risk to consumer safety  and 
why certain products are in violation of it or not. I dont have that information here, nor is it likely in the scope of the individual complaint Ive decided here.  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask O to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 December 2021.
