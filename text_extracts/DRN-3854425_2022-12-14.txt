The complaint
Miss B complains that NewDay Ltd irresponsibly gave her a credit card account that she 
couldnt afford.
What happened
In December 2016, Miss Bs credit card was opened by NewDay Ltd with an initial credit 
limit of £300. This credit limit was never increased. 
In 2022, Miss B complained to NewDay Ltd to say that the account shouldnt have been 
opened because it wasnt affordable and that NewDay Ltd ought to have made a better 
effort to understand her financial circumstances before opening the credit card and 
agreeing to reopen the credit after she the debt management plan ended.
Our investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. Miss B didnt agree. So, the 
complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill confine my comments to what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to consider it 
but because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right 
outcome in the wider context. My remit is to take an overview and decide whats fair in 
the round.
NewDay Ltd will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we 
consider when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. 
So, I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our 
approach to these complaints is set out on our website.
Miss Bs complaint is that NewDay Ltd made credit available that was unaffordable. 
NewDay Ltd has explained that it relied in part on information that Miss B provided at the 
time of application to assess affordability. They said they carried out a credit search in Miss 
Bs name to assess Miss Bs level of debt at that time and to understand how she had been 
managing that debt. With that information and using their own scoring metric, NewDay Ltd 
decided to agree to the credit limit of £300. So, the checks for affordability seemed 
proportionate for such a very modest credit limit. 
The NewDay Ltd checks showed that Miss B had only a modest amount of other borrowings 
compared to her declared income. And I have noted that Miss Bs credit file was reasonably 
clean at the time of the application. When I say this, I mean that Miss Bs management of 
her existing credit showed no recent history of CCJs, defaults or any late payments. So, it 
seemed from the credit file that at the point that the lending decision was made, Miss B was 
affording her existing credit. And so, NewDay Ltd were not put on notice of any reason not 
to agree the lending from that. And so, I dont think that the information that NewDay Ltd 
had at the time of the lending decision, would have led them to feel they ought to make 
more searching enquiries of Miss Bs financial situation. 
I have to look at the information that was available to NewDay Ltd at the time it made its 
lending decisions and not to use hindsight. And I have seen insufficient evidence that the 
other information that NewDay Ltd acquired or had presented to it at the time of the lending 
decision, would have led them to think that the relatively modest credit they were offering 
was unreasonable. 
Latterly, NewDay Ltd arranged a debt repayment plan for Miss B when one was asked for. 
And when that plan was paid off and Miss B asked for use of the card again, NewDay Ltd 
allowed that with the same very modest credit limit. I have seen insufficient evidence of any 
wrongdoing in these activities by NewDay Ltd. Even so, NewDay Ltd has provided a 
goodwill gesture of the refunds of fees and interest since 12 January 2021. 
So, having considered all the submissions made in this case, I have seen insufficient 
evidence to uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 January 2023.
