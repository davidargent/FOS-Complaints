K820x#14complaint
Mr W complains about HSBC UK Bank Plc going back  on its promise, in a phone  call in April 
2017, to remove  the default on his credit record if he settled his outstanding debt.
 
background
In July 2018 Mr Ws solicitor wrote to HSBC  asking it to remove the default. It said itd 
previously given him the wrong information  and that it couldnt  remove the default. But it 
offered him £50 compensation. He wasnt happy  with that response.
HSBC thought Mr Ws complaint about  not removing  the default had already been dealt with 
by this Service. But our investigator  pointed out itd issued a new final response letter with 
referral rights after Mr Ws solicitor wrote  to it. She went  on to look into Mr Ws complaint but 
whilst acknowledging HSBC had made  a mistake  when it told him the default  would be 
removed she said this Service couldnt make it honour that as it wasnt  correct.  She thought 
the £50 compensation itd offered to pay him had been fair.
  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive come to the same 
conclusion as our investigator  for very similar reasons.
After Mr Ws solicitor wrote to it HSBC accepted it gave  Mr W the wrong information in the 
phone call in April 2017. It offered him £50 compensation.  As our investigator explained to 
him we cant make  HSBC  remove  the default.  We can only look at the compensation its 
offered him. And I agree with our investigator that £50 is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances.
If Mr W still wants to accept that offer, our investigator will help him to do so.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 November  2019.
