K820x#14Complaint
This complaint is about a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy  taken out in 1998 
alongside a store card.
Its been agreed in this case  that Financial Insurance Company Limited (FICL),  as the 
insurer, should accept  responsibility for the complaint. To keep things simple, Ill refer to 
FICL as the seller  in my decision.
Mrs M says FICL mis-sold  her the PPI. Our adjudicator didnt uphold  this complaint. Mrs M 
disagreed so the complaint has been  passed to me for a decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Ms case.
Ive decided the policy wasnt mis-sold because:
Mrs M says the PPI was added  to her account  without  her knowledge or consent. Ive 
thought about this but Ive also seen a copy of the store card application  form Mrs M saw 
and signed which  included a section for PPI. In this section Mrs M has signed  to agree to 
the cover. This signature is separate and additional to her signature to agree to the 
credit. And there is nothing here to indicate  that she had to sign in this section  so I 
think Mrs M wouldve known she couldve left this section blank if she didnt want the 
PPI.
So based  on what Ive seen I think FICL  made it clear that Mrs M didnt have to take out 
the PPI and that she chose to take it out  although I can understand why she cant 
remember this.
FICL  didnt recommend the PPI to Mrs M so it didnt have to check if the policy  was right 
for her. But it did have  to make sure Mrs M got the information  she needed to decide if 
the PPI was right for her.
Its possible the information FICL gave Mrs M about the PPI wasnt  as clear as it 
shouldve been. But she chose  to take out the PPI - so it looks like she wanted this type 
of cover.  Based on what Ive seen of her circumstances at the time it doesnt look like 
she was affected  by any of the exclusions to or limits  on the PPI cover - so it would have  
been useful for her if something went wrong. It also looks like the PPI was affordable.  So 
I dont think better  information  about  the PPI would  have put her off taking out the cover.
Mrs M says the PPI was of no use to her because she had sick pay and savings  at the 
time. However, for no more than £1.00 per £100  of the outstanding monthly balance the 
PPI wouldve paid out up to 15% of Mrs Ms outstanding monthly  balance  until she 
returned to work or the outstanding balance had been paid off - and in addition to 
Mrs Ms savings.  So these savings  wouldve remained  protected for other essential 
expenditure. And the PPI wouldve paid out in addition to and for longer than Mrs Ms 
Ref: DRN54585872sick pay wouldve lasted her. So overall  I still think the PPI wouldve been useful for 
Mrs M.
My final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above I dont think the PPI was mis-sold.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs M to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 August 2019.
