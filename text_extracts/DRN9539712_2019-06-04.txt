Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Hs complaint in part and thought the loans from 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. QuickQuid disagreed so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN95397122the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Ms H could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Hs complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
QuickQuid needed  to do more when it approved loans 1 and 2. And whilst it should have 
carried out more  checks for loans  3 and 4, it doesnt seem that better information would have 
made a difference to the lending decision.  So I dont  think QuickQuid was wrong  to give 
loans 1 to 4 to Ms H.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of QuickQuids  lending history with Ms H, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid  should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Hs case, I think that this point  was reached by 
loan five. I say this because:
From  loan 5 Ms H onwards was provided  with a new loan within  days  of settling the 
previous one. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not 
Ms H was having to borrow  further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances, and that Ms Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
And although there were some gaps,  at one point of over four months, between Ms H 
repaying a loan and asking to borrow again,  I dont  think its reasonable for Quick 
Ref: DRN95397123Quid to argue it could  conclude  from this that her financial circumstances had 
changed or improved.
Loans 5, 6 and 8 were extended  beyond their original repayment dates suggesting 
the borrowing  wasnt sustainably affordable.
Ms H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed QuickQuid.  Loan  9 
was taken out 37 months after Ms Hs first loan. And it was for a much larger amount. 
Ms H had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to QuickQuid 
over an extended period.
I think that Ms H lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan five 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Hs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Ms Hs ability  to access  mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market  for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 to 9 including the three top ups and 
QuickQuid should  put things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms H paid on loans 5 to 9 including the top ups;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
write off any unpaid interest and charges on loan 9, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Ms H*; 
the number  of loans taken from 5 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  5 to 9 should be removed from Ms Hs 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Ms H a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one. If QuickQuid intends  to 
apply the refund  to reduce  any outstanding capital balance, it must  do so after deducting the tax.
*If after taking  these  steps Ms H still owes money on loan 9, QuickQuid must  treat her fairly and 
sympathetically when trying to reach any agreement on how to repay the outstanding principal due.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Hs complaint. CashEuroNet  UK 
LLC (trading as QuickQuid) should pay Ms H compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 July 2019.
