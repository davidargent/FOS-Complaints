K821x#15complaint
Ms P complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) was irresponsible  to lend 
her money.
background
Ms P took out 11 loans  with QuickQuid between January 2015 and July 2018. She topped 
up several of the loans.  A summary  of the loans is below:
Ms P says that she was stuck in a cycle of borrowing more money to repay previous loans. 
Ms P doesnt think that QuickQuid carried out adequate affordability assessments. 
Ms P wants QuickQuid to refund the interest  and charges that shes  paid on the loans. And 
Ms P wants QuickQuid to remove  any negative  information about  the loans from her credit 
file.
The adjudicator recommended that Ms Ps complaint should be upheld  in part. In summary, 
she thought that it was reasonable of QuickQuid to agree loans one to three and loans 10 
and 11. But the adjudicator thought QuickQuid shouldnt have agreed  loans  four to nine.
The adjudicator recommended that QuickQuid refund  all interest  and charges that Ms P had 
paid on loans four to nine.  And  the adjudicator said QuickQuid  should remove  any 
information about loans four to nine from Ms Ps credit  file. 
QuickQuid disagreed with the adjudicators view so the complaint  has been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms P 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a Loan Date borrowed

Ref: DRN53329902number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that 
QuickQuid should  fairly  and reasonably  have  done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think its important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Ms P could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook defines sustainable as being  
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. 
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
consumer wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ps complaint.
QuickQuid has told us about the checks it did before lending  to Ms P. It asked Ms P for 
details of her income and normal  expenditure. It then validated this information  against her 
credit file and other data sources. And it did further checks  on Ms Ps credit file before each  
of the loans. 
loans one to three, ten and 11
I agree  with the adjudicator that early on in Ms Ps lending history with QuickQuid it was 
reasonable to agree  loans  one to three  based  on what  QuickQuid  knew about Ms P.
Given the significant gap between settling  loan nine and taking out loan ten, I cant  say that 
QuickQuid shouldve done more than it did before agreeing these two loans either. 
Ref: DRN53329903As Ms P hasnt raised any objection  to the adjudicators  recommendation in relation to loans 
one to three, ten and 11, I dont  think that I need  to say more  about them.
loan four
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Ms Ps lending with QuickQuid. Ive looked  to see if 
there was a point  at which QuickQuid should  reasonable have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid shouldve realised that it wasnt 
reasonable to lend more money  to Ms P.
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ps case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
four. I say this because:
by loan four, Ms P had been borrowing almost continually and had topped  up loan 
three twice.
by the time that Ms P asked for loan four, shed been borrowing from QuickQuid for 
almost eight months and wasnt making any inroads  in to the amount that she owed. 
By this time, Ms P had paid a considerable amount of interest to QuickQuid to 
effectively service  a debt over an extended period of time.
from loan four onwards, Ms P was borrowing regularly and repeatedly  from 
QuickQuid and she topped up each loan at least once. So QuickQuid  shouldve  seen 
that it was likely Ms P had to borrow more to cover the hole left by repaying  each 
earlier loan. This meant that Ms Ps indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
although there were  some gaps between repaying some of the loans and taking on 
new ones, I dont  think that they were long enough for QuickQuid to reasonably  
conclude that Ms Ps financial situation  had improved.
I think the pattern  of lending shouldve alerted QuickQuid to the likelihood that Ms P 
was having problems managing her money. So I think that QuickQuid shouldve been  
concerned that she wouldnt be able to repay  loan four onwards sustainably.
I think that Ms P lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing for loans four to 
nine. This is because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ps indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short term use over an extended  period  of time.
the number  of loans, combined with the total length of time Ms P had been borrowing 
from QuickQuid was likely to have  had negative implications on her ability  to access 
mainstream credit. This kept Ms P in the market  for these high-cost loans.
I appreciate what QuickQuid says about  the mere  number  of loans being an insufficient 
basis on which to conclude that the loans  were unsustainable. But QuickQuid will know  from 
previous decisions  that there are cases where this service considers the overall  lending  
pattern and not just the affordability of each loan.  
Ref: DRN53329904When a consumer borrows  a number of times over an extended period, its most likely that 
the consumer  isnt using the loans for their intended purpose  that is to help with temporary  
cash flow problems.
QuickQuid also says that Ms P repaid each loan successfully but QuickQuid will know  or 
should at least  know from previous decisions  that it doesnt automatically follow that this 
means Ms P was able to repay the loans  sustainably. 
So Im upholding  Ms Ps complaint about  loans four to nine.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges that Ms P paid on loans four to nine;
 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
if it chooses to, apply the refund  to any outstanding principal balance  before paying any 
remaining balance (if there is any) to Ms P; and
the number  of loans taken from loan four to loan nine means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans four to nine should  be removed from 
Ms Ps credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Ms P a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one. If 
QuickQuid intends  to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding balance,  it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Ps complaint in part and direct  CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 August 2019.
