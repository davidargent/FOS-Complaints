DRN-3278429
The complaint
N, a limited company, represented by its director, complains about the service it received 
from National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) when opening a company account with 
them.
What happened
In 2020, N wished to open a business account with NatWest. During the application process, 
N was wrongly told it needed to reapply for the account as a not-for-profit organisation. N 
complained and NatWest agreed they made mistakes during the application process. They 
say the account should have been set up for a Limited Company and they acknowledged 
there had been delays in Ns account being created as it was wrongly told to reapply.
N complained to the ombudsman service and our investigator found that NatWest didnt 
need to do anything further to put things right. He explained that NatWest acknowledged 
there were errors and delays in opening the account, but as N didnt provide details as to 
how it was impacted by the delay, he felt there was nothing further NatWest needed to do.
N disagreed with the outcome and so the complaint was passed to me to decide on.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding this complaint, and Ill explain why below. There are 
aspects to Ns complaint I havent considered  and thats deliberate. What follows are my 
comments on what I believe to be the main points to consider to resolve this complaint in a 
fair way.
N wished to open a company account with NatWest. NatWest opened an account for a not-
for-profit organisation, although N was a limited company. NatWest asked N for more details 
about its purpose which N gave. NatWest say, following a delay of around a month and after 
N had to reapply, the correct account was opened for it.
NatWest agreed that the service N received and the delays it experienced were 
unacceptable and apologised for it. They also asked N that if there were any external 
financial knock on effects as a result of their error, to let them know. So, I need to consider 
whether NatWests response is enough in this instance.
From the information provided to me, N hasnt clearly explained the financial impact the 
delay in opening the account had on it. So, I cant fairly say NatWest didnt do enough here. I 
also think NatWests apology is enough as a response to the delay in the opening of the 
account, considering the time it took to resolve the matter.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask N to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 April 2022.
