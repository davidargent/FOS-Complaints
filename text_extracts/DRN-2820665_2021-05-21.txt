The complaint
Mrs G complains that her sale of goods was not covered by PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCAs seller protection policy. She also complains that PayPal did not do enough to defend 
a chargeback claim by the buyer.
What happened
In February 2020, Mrs G sold two items to a buyer overseas for a total of £3,900. This sale 
was not covered by PayPals seller protection policy, but Mrs G says she didnt know that at 
the time. In May, the buyer raised a chargeback on his payment. Mrs G sent PayPal 
information to defend the chargeback, but the buyers claim was upheld. The goods were 
never returned, so Mrs G was left without her goods and without her money. She had tried to 
raise the matter with the buyer, but his friend had responded to her with abuse.
Mrs G complained to PayPal. PayPal explained that the outcome of the chargeback claim 
was beyond its control, since this was decided by the credit card scheme provider. It said 
that its own seller protection policy did not apply, because the payment had been 
categorised as a personal payment to friends or family, and such payments are not eligible 
under the policy, which is only for the commercial sale of goods. PayPal told Mrs G that if 
she had wanted to be covered by the policy, then she should have returned the payment and 
asked the buyer to send it again in the correct category.
Mrs G was not satisfied with that response, because she had not known how the payment 
had been categorised by the buyer. She brought this complaint to our Service, and provided 
screenshots to show what information PayPal had given her at the time of the payment, and 
that nowhere did it show that the payment had been designated as a personal payment for 
friends or family. She said that had she known, she would have ensured that the payment 
was correctly categorised, but there had been no way to know that. She added that the 
incorrect categorisation of the payment by the buyer was clear evidence of the buyers 
dishonesty, and that this should have been taken into account in the chargeback. She also 
said that PayPal had told her that she could keep the money while the matter was 
investigated, but it had then reneged on that promise and debited the money from her 
account. She complained that PayPal had ignored or returned her letters.
PayPal responded with screenshots of its own, to demonstrate that the transaction was not 
eligible under the seller protection policy. It compared the screenshot of this transaction with 
another one by Mrs G, only a few days earlier, which had been eligible. It said that it had 
therefore provided Mrs G with enough information about the status of this transaction. It also 
said that the transaction was not eligible for a second reason: a pre-condition for eligibility is 
that the goods must be shipped to the shipping address provided in the transactions details 
page in the sellers PayPal account. Since no shipping address is displayed for ineligible 
transactions, it followed that Mrs G had not been able to comply with that condition. PayPal 
reiterated that it was not responsible for the outcome of the chargeback claim. It said its user 
agreement makes clear that a payment can be withheld during a chargeback claim.
Our investigator upheld this complaint. She accepted that the chargeback had been out of 
PayPals hands. But she thought that PayPal could and should have done more to make it 
clear to Mrs G that the transaction was not covered by its seller protection policy. She said it 
followed that it was not reasonable to expect Mrs G to have asked the buyer to resend the 
payment. The result was that she had been left with no goods and no money. She concluded 
that as the policy would have applied if Mrs G had been told it didnt apply, PayPal should 
refund the cost of the goods.
PayPal did not accept that opinion. It asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I uphold this complaint, for the same reasons as our investigator gave.
I do not uphold Mrs Gs complaint about how PayPal dealt with the chargeback. I have no 
reason to doubt that PayPal passed on to the credit card scheme provider Mrs Gs full 
defence to the claim. The outcome was determined by the scheme, not by PayPal, and so 
PayPal is not responsible for the outcome. I am also satisfied that PayPals user agreement 
states that payments can be held while a chargeback is ongoing.
I uphold the complaint about the seller protection policy. I accept that the transaction was not 
eligible for cover under the policy, for the reasons PayPal explained. But I am persuaded 
that it was not made sufficiently clear to Mrs G that the transaction had been categorised by 
the buyer as a personal payment to his family or friends (ineligible), rather than as a 
payment for the commercial sale of goods (eligible). I think that because although I have 
seen the screenshots PayPal sent us, showing the status of the transaction, that is only 
visible if the seller goes to that page and looks for it. It is therefore much less conspicuous 
than the email PayPal sent to Mrs G on the day the payment was received. The email sets 
out clearly the amount and date of the payment, the name of the buyer, and a unique 
transaction ID number. But it does not say anything about how the payment has been 
categorised, or about whether it is covered by the seller protection policy. And Im satisfied 
that if Mrs G had been told that the payment was not covered, then (given the amount of 
money involved) it is more likely than not that she would then have taken the necessary 
steps to ensure that it was covered  by returning the payment and asking the buyer to send 
it again in the proper category. She would then have been covered by the policy, and I think 
the evidence is clear enough that she would likely have won her dispute if it had been 
adjudicated by PayPal under its policy. There is clear evidence that the goods were received 
by the buyer, and no clear evidence that they were damaged or otherwise not as described. 
I also take into account the dishonest conduct of the buyer.
Mrs G has also complained about PayPal not responding to some of her correspondence, 
but while I am sure that was frustrating, I dont think it affected the outcome of the 
chargeback, or of this complaint either. I will not award separate compensation for that.
Putting things right
If this transaction had been covered by PayPals seller protection policy, then PayPal would 
have refunded Mrs G the full price of the goods, which is £3,900. Therefore I think it would 
be fair to order PayPal to refund her that amount.
I will also award interest on this compensation at our usual rate.
My final decisionMy decision is that I uphold this complaint. I order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay 
Mrs G £3,900, and also to pay simple interest on that amount at the rate of eight per cent a 
year, from 8 July 2020 to the date of settlement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2021.
