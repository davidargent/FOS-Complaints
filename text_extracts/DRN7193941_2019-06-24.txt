Miss B complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss B took out a total of five loans  with QuickQuid between August 2016 and May 2017.  
She topped  up loans  3 and 5 once each, and topped up loan 4 three times.

Miss B believes QuickQuid was irresponsible to lend to her. She believes that if it had 
carried out proper  checks, it shouldnt have  agreed  to lend. And she says the situation 
caused her a lot of emotional and financial stress.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. In summary,  she 
thought that if QuickQuid  had carried out proportionate checks,  it wouldnt have agreed to 
loans 4 and 5. So she said QuickQuid should  refund all interest and charges that Miss B 
paid on those loans,  with interest  on the refund. And she said it should  remove any negative 
information about loans 4 and 5 from Miss Bs credit file.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
QuickQuid was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make checks  to see whether 
Miss B could afford  to pay back the loans before it lent to her. Those checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Miss B was borrowing,  and her lending history, 
but there was no set list of checks QuickQuid had to do.
The Financial Conduct Authority was the regulator at the time Miss B borrowed from 
QuickQuid. Its regulations for lenders are set out in its consumer  credit  sourcebook  
(generally referred to as CONC). These regulations require lenders to take reasonable 
steps to assess the customer's ability to meet repayments under a regulated credit 
agreement in a sustainable manner without  the customer incurring financial difficulties or 
experiencing significant adverse consequences . They define sustainable as being  able to 
make repayments without undue difficulty.  And explain  that this means borrowers should be 
able to make  their repayments on time and out of their income and savings without having to 
borrow to meet these  repayments. 
Ref: DRN71939412So, the fact that the amounts borrowed and the interest paid might  have been low in 
comparison with Miss Bs income, or that she managed to repay  most of the loans in full, 
doesnt necessarily  mean  the loans were affordable for her, or that she managed  to repay  
them in a sustainable manner. In other words I cant assume that because  Miss B managed  
to repay  most of her loans  that she was able to do so out of her normal means  without 
having to borrow  further.
QuickQuids told us about the checks it did before lending to Miss B. Before each  loan it 
asked her for details  of her income  and normal expenditure. It then validated this information 
against her credit file and other data sources.  And it did further  checks on Miss Bs credit  file 
before each of the loans. QuickQuid hasnt  been able to give us all the results of those 
checks but Im not aware of anything on Miss Bs credit file that is likely to have caused 
concern.
I think the checks that QuickQuid carried out before making loan 1 were proportionate. It was 
Miss Bs first loan with QuickQuid. The scheduled  repayment wasnt  far short of a third of 
Miss Bs declared monthly take-home pay. But based on the details of her regular  monthly 
expenditure that Miss B provided, the loan would have appeared to be affordable for Miss B. 
And I dont  think it was unreasonable of QuickQuid  to go ahead and make  the loan without 
carrying out more  detailed affordability  checks.
As it was, Miss B repaid loan 1 early.  Around  seven weeks later,  she applied for loan 2. The 
amount she applied to borrow was higher than loan 1. The figures she provided  for her 
income and expenditure suggested,  again,  that she ought to be able to afford the 
repayments relatively comfortably. But I think that the fact that shed returned  to borrow a 
significant amount  relatively quickly ought to have prompted QuickQuid to ask Miss B 
specifically for details of any other short-term loans she had outstanding at the time.
But Ive looked  at Miss Bs bank statements to see what its likely QuickQuid would have 
discovered if it had asked Miss B about any other short-term loans she had outstanding. And 
it doesnt look as if she would have been  expecting to make  repayments on any other short-
term loans during the period in which she had loan 2. So even if QuickQuid had asked  about  
Miss Bs financial circumstances in as much detail as I think  it should have done, I think  
loan 2 would  still have appeared to be affordable to her.
Less than three weeks passed between Miss B settling loan 2 and applying  for loan 3. But 
loan 3 was for significantly less than loan 2. And on the basis  of the information Miss B 
provided about her regular monthly  income and expenditure, it would have looked as if shed 
be able to afford the repayment comfortably. So I dont think  it was unreasonable  of 
QuickQuid to agree to the loan without  carrying out more detailed checks.
But even though loan 3 was for substantially less than the previous loans, Miss B topped it 
up and extended  the term. And when she repaid it, she immediately applied  for loan 4. 
I think that at this point  QuickQuid ought to have  been  concerned that although the amount 
Miss B was applying to borrow  was, again,  small compared with her stated monthly income, 
her pattern  of borrowing  suggested that she might  be relying  on short-term loans to make 
ends meet. And I think  that at this point QuickQuid should have decided that it was no longer 
reasonable to rely on the information Miss B provided about  her finances. By this stage, it 
would have been proportionate for QuickQuid to independently verify  the state of Miss Bs 
finances.
Ref: DRN71939413If QuickQuid had looked into Miss Bs financial situation as carefully as I think  it should have 
done, it would have seen that her income  was unstable. And around  that time her income 
was generally no more than £700-£800 per month.  Whats more, its clear  from her bank 
statements and what Miss Bs told us that her monthly expenses  were, in fact, considerably  
higher than the £450 shed told QuickQuid about,  leaving her with no disposable income  
from which to repay  any further borrowing. And her financial situation didnt improve 
significantly for the rest of the time that she was borrowing from QuickQuid. So I dont think 
QuickQuid should  have given Miss B loans 4 or 5.
putting things right
For each of loans  4 and 5 QuickQuid should:
Refund any interest and charges paid by Miss B on the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each of these amounts from the date 
they were  paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Bs credit  file in relation  to the loans.
However, I note that after the adjudicator issued her view, QuickQuid wrote off the full 
principal balance of £750 that was outstanding on loan 7. And I consider it would be unfair 
not to allow  QuickQuid to offset  that against  the refund  Ive set out above. This means that if 
the total interest and charges that Miss B paid on loans 4 and 5 plus interest at 8%, 
calculated as set out above, amounts to less than £750, QuickQuid does not have  to make 
any refund  to Miss B. But if it amounts to more than £750, QuickQuid may subtract the £750 
its written off, before paying the balance  of the compensation  to Miss B.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. I require CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as 
QuickQuid) to put things  right by doing  as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 July 2019.
