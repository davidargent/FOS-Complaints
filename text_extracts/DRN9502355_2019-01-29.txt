K820x#14complaint
Mr M, a director of S, complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie ,SCA  froze  their account 
which has cost the company  a significant amount of money.
background
Mr M says that PayPal invited S to borrow money from it, which it did and later paid off the 
loan. He says a further loan offer was made  in August 2016 which  again  was taken out. But 
in March 2017 PayPal froze the account  and told it that 16 items that were offered for sale 
be removed. Mr M says the products it sells are safe and that the company didnt receive  
any warning. He says PayPals action has cost the company about £144,000 and it still owes  
PayPal about  £8,000.  Mr M says PayPal shouldve carried out a risk assessment when it lent 
to the company and not waited until after the loan was granted to take that action.
PayPal says it carried out a review  in March 2017 and had concerns about 16 products that 
S was offering  for sale. It says those products breached its Acceptable  Use Policy (AUP) 
and under the terms and conditions of its agreement with S was entitled to freeze its 
account.
Mr M brought the complaint to us and our investigator looked at some of the items for sale 
and thought overall PayPal hadnt  made a mistake or acted unfairly. He thought it was up to 
PayPal to make such commercial decisions as it had done and had reasonably  concluded 
that S had breached its AUP. The investigator  thought that one of the products contained an 
ingredient that required  a prescription in one country and another  product contained an 
ingredient that was classed as a controlled  substance in another. The investigator didnt 
think PayPal was obliged  to carry out any checks prior to the lending and thought it was up 
to S to make sure it complied with PayPals  AUP.
Mr M doesnt accept that view and says PayPal didnt  carry  out due diligence  before lending. 
He says S didnt ask PayPal to lend to it but it was PayPal that approached  it. Mr M says his 
company doesnt  sell dangerous items and would like PayPal  to reinstate its account.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall conclusions  as the investigator  for the same  reasons. I realise  Mr M will be 
disappointed by my decision and I make  it clear that I appreciate  his frustration in that S 
didnt ask PayPal  to lend to it. 
Ive looked at the terms and conditions of Ss account and PayPals AUP which Im satisfied 
S would have agreed to when the account  was opened. And Im satisfied that PayPal is 
entitled to freeze or restrict an account  where it has reason to believe a company is engaged  
in a restricted activity. I make clear that I think its up to PayPal to make such  a 
determination when  exercising its commercial judgement.  And Im satisfied that the 
investigator has explained his findings in respect  of two products. But in any event I think  its 
for PayPal  to reach such a decision if it concludes a product may be unsafe or hasnt 
complied with its AUP.
I appreciate Mr S believes PayPal should  have carried out checks  on S before lending. But I 
dont think it reasonable to expect PayPal to check all of Ss products and Im satisfied its 
AUP makes clear what its policy is. And I think  its for S to ensure it complies with that AUP.
Ref: DRN95023552Overall as I dont think PayPal has made a mistake here or acted unfairly  I cant order  it to 
reinstate Ss account. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M on behalf of 
S to accept  or reject  my decision before 1 March 2019.
