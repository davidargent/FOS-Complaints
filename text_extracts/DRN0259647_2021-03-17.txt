Mr B complains NewDay Ltd repeatedly failed to apply his payment of £343.70 to his 
Aquacard credit card.  
Aquacard is a trading  name of NewDay, but for the purposes of this decision I will only refer 
to NewDay. 
background
Mr B tried to make two payments to his credit card on 2 August 2018, but for some reason 
only one payment was successful. Mr B called NewDay on 3 August 2018 and made the 
payment of £343.70  over the phone  instead. 
Mr B chased  NewDay on 13 August 2018 and 16 August  2018  as he could  see the payment 
still hadnt reached his account despite  promises that it would do so.  
It took NewDay a while  to sort out what had gone wrong. And so Mr Bs account wasnt 
credited with the £343.70 until 28 August 2018.  The payment was backdated to 3 August 
2018 and showed on the September 2018  statement.  
On 16 August 2018 NewDay  apologised for the delay in applying the payment. They also 
refunded all interest that had been  applied to the account in the August 2018  statement and 
refunded Mr Bs overlimit fee of £12 (plus interest) which had been caused by the delayed  
payment. In addition, NewDay  offered Mr B £65 for the trouble the matter had caused him. 
Mr B didnt accept this. But it appears  NewDay still credited this to Mr Bs account as Ive 
seen this on the statement dated 16 September 2018. 
It should be noted that while Mr B was trying to resolve this matter  with NewDay, a new 
problem arose with the account. 
Mr Bs account was hacked  and the associated  address altered. NewDay investigated this 
as a separate matter and agreed  Mr Bs account  had been hacked by a third party. Mr B, as 
he is entitled to, brought  this issue as a second  complaint to our service  which  has been 
considered separately  to this one. That complaint also considers Mr Bs concerns  about the 
impact on his credit file. 
Our investigator didnt  uphold Mr Bs complaint. They felt that, in the circumstances, NewDay 
had done enough to put things right for Mr B. However, as Mr B disagreed the complaint  has 
come to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I dont think  Mr Bs 
complaint should  be upheld  as I broadly agree  with the investigators conclusions  for the 
reasons below.
Mr Bs overall concerns about his account  are closely  connected across the two complaints 
Ive described above which he has brought to our service. However, I must be clear  that the 
considerations under this decision relate only to the problems Mr B had in trying to make  the 
payment of £343.70  to his credit card account. So I will not be referring to any of the 
Ref: DRN02596472complaint points raised by Mr B which relate to how his account  was hacked and the 
consequences of this. 
It therefore follows that Ive not considered the impact to Mr Bs credit  file here. This is 
because at the time NewDay corrected Mr Bs account with the payment of £343.70,  there 
were no monies to chase  him for as he was yet to receive his next statement due for 
September 2018. So Im satisfied any outstanding debt was not brought about by the original 
problem subject to this complaint. 
Ive looked at why Mr Bs payment of £343.70  didnt reach his account  when he expected it 
to. 
Mr B says he was making the payment to ensure hed cleared the balance to zero.  Looking 
at the statement from August  2018,  its clear to see that in August 2018 Mr Bs payments 
were aimed at clearing  the outstanding balance carried over from July 2018. The total 
carried over from July 2018 was £2,217.71 and Mr B had paid £74.01 and £1,800 towards  
clearing this. The £343.70 wouldve completed paying off this sum. But it should be noted  
that Mr B continued to spend significantly on the credit  card on 3 and 14 August 2018, so the 
balance increased  again straight  away. 
Had Mr Bs £343.70 payment been  made successfully the outstanding balance at the time of 
the August  2018 statement would have been within the credit  limit of £4,050  instead the 
new balance  was £4,070.42.  
Its not been possible to understand exactly why Mr B was unable  to make  the second  
payment of £343.70  on 2 August 2018  when the other was successful. However, he 
reasonably called NewDay the following day to remedy things. NewDays investigation  found  
that the individual Mr B spoke with on 3 August 2018 had used the wrong  processing  system 
to allocate the payment to Mr Bs account. Mr B should be aware that no one benefited from 
this sum as it appears the amount of £343.70 was placed in a suspense  account  an 
account NewDay (like other credit providers)  will use to hold funds where its not clear  where  
they belong. So from what Ive seen, this does  appear to have been human  error.  
NewDay reviewed the matter and apologised to Mr B for the delay in the payment reaching  
his account. It seems,  from understanding NewDays internal processes, they located and 
remedied the problem  with the payment within their permitted  timeframe. And while  perhaps  
this could have  been done  sooner  given   as Mr B says  he was told on more than one 
occasion it would be done the following day, I think NewDays steps  to put things right was 
fair in the circumstances. They  backdated  the payment, removed interest and the fee which 
was applied, as well as credited Mr Bs account with £65 as compensation to reflect  the 
trouble caused.  
my final decision
For the reasons  above I agree there  was a delay in Mr Bs payment of £343.70 reaching his 
account, but I think what NewDay Ltd has done to put things right is fair in the 
circumstances. My final decision  is therefore  that I do not uphold  Mr Bs complaint about 
NewDay Ltd. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 April 2021.
