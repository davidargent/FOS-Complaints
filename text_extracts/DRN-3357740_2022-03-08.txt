The complaint
Mr M complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr M entered into a membership agreement for a timeshare in December 2009 to increase 
his timeshare holding and he also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance to pay for the increase. The loan agreement was for a loan of £7,760 which 
included a consolidation of a previous loan of £3,061 from a third party which he used to pay 
for another membership agreement.
Mr M says that he became aware in January 2018 that he had cause to make a claim to 
Barclays Partner Finance under the Consumer Credit Act and his representative then made 
a claim to it on his behalf under section 140 of that Act in September 2018. Barclays Partner 
Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to that claim by March 2019 so a complaint 
was made to this service. The complaint says that: Barclays Partner Finance paid a 
commission to the timeshare company which wasnt declared to Mr M; a proper assessment 
of Mr Ms ability to afford the loan wasnt conducted; the timeshare company unduly 
pressured Mr M into entering the membership agreement and the loan agreement; the 
timeshare was misrepresented to Mr M; and the timeshare company used aggressive 
commercial practices to pressure Mr M; all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to 
section 140  and it said that the complaint should also be considered under section 75 of 
that Act.
Barclays Partner Finance says that its not reasonable for it to be asked to consider the claim 
as its outside of the Limitation Act 1980. Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ms 
complaint should be upheld. He said that Mr Ms claim was more than likely time-barred 
under the Limitation Act so he thought that Barclays Partner Finances decision not to look 
into his claim was fair. He also said that the loan looked to have been settled early and he 
hadnt seen anything that would suggest the lending was unaffordable.
Mr Ms representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says, in summary, that:
there is no statutory time limit on raising a complaint under the Consumer Credit Act 
or for asking this service to look into a refusal by a creditor to properly investigate a 
complaint and the time limit of six years applies to the raising of a court action;
the claim isnt time-barred and Mr M only discovered the actual characteristics of the 
timeshare many years after he bought it including the near perpetual length of the 
contract and the unlimited liability for management charges which were concealed at 
the point of purchase and are unduly onerous terms - so the limitation period is 
postponed until he could be aware of the facts with reasonable diligence by sections 
32(1)(b) and 32(2) of the Limitation Act;
Mr M became aware that he had cause for complaint in January 2018 when he 
sought advice on this matter for the first time and thats the date of knowledge for the 
purposes of the six year limitation period;
there was an unfair creditor-debtor relationship and the existence and the amount of 
commission paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the timeshare company were 
concealed from Mr M and the limitation period for a claim under section 140A is 
postponed until he could be aware of those facts; and
the loan has all the hallmarks of an unaffordable loan and no affordability checks or 
proof of income were carried out. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ms complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down his claims under the 
Limitation Act and his representative says that theres no statutory time limit on 
raising a complaint under the Consumer Credit Act and the time limit of six years 
applies to the raising of a court action;
I accept that Mr M has referred his complaint to this service within six years of the 
event that hes complained about  which is the turning down of his claims under the 
Consumer Credit Act - but I need to consider whether Barclays Partner Finance has 
acted fairly in saying that the Limitation Act applies to his claims;
Mr Ms claims are under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  in this 
decision Im not determining the outcome of those claims as only a court would be 
able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ms claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented to him and 
that he wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to him;
in making a claim under the Consumer Credit Act, Mr M is seeking a legal remedy, 
so if Barclays Partner Finance turned down his initial claim, he would be able to ask a 
court to consider it or ask our service to assess if Barclays Partner Finance had 
acted fairly  but that means that Barclays Partner Finance is able to consider any 
legal defence it may have to his claims, whether or not Mr M subsequently decided to 
take his claim to court - so although the Consumer Credit Act doesnt contain any 
explicit time limits within the body of the legislation, Im satisfied that the Limitation 
Act does apply in the way it does to all legal claims;if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr M could have made a claim to the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him into buying 
the timeshare soon after he entered into the membership agreement in December 
2009 as that was when he entered into an agreement based on the alleged 
misrepresentations of the timeshare company and says that he suffered a loss as he 
entered into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the 
timeshare;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at about that time, so he would have had 
six years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance  but he didnt make a claim against Barclays Partner Finance until 
September 2018, which was more than eight years later so outside of the time limits 
set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr Ms representative says that Mr M only became aware that he could make a claim 
to Barclays Partner Finance after he sought advice from it in January 2018  but 
when he had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist him for the purposes of 
the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are 
extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr Ms 
claims;
Mr Ms representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr M and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Mr M entered into the loan agreement in December 2009 and Barclays Partner 
Finance says that it was settled in May 2011 - so Mr M would have needed to make a 
claim against Barclays Partner Finance within six years of May 2011  but he didnt 
make a claim to it until September 2018, more than seven years later, which was 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr Ms representative says that information about the credit agreement and 
timeshare was deliberately concealed from Mr M and that he didnt discover the 
concealment until after hed sought advice from it in January 2018;
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors 
right of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation 
doesnt begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with 
reasonable diligence have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that 
deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some 
time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;Mr M and his representative have set out what they say happened before Mr M 
entered into the membership agreement and loan agreement in December 2009  
but I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
deliberate concealment of any relevant information, in fact many of the things that 
they say werent right would have been known to Mr M at the time of the sale, such 
as the length of the contract, so I dont consider that section 32 is applicable in these 
circumstances;
Mr Ms representative has said that Barclays Partner Finance should have told him 
about any commission that it paid to the timeshare company for arranging the loan 
 but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, 
was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the timeshare company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid 
it tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance didnt breach any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under 
any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to 
Mr M risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr Ms representative says that the loan was unaffordable for Mr M and that no 
affordability assessment was made before the loan was made to him;
Ive seen no other evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for Mr M and he 
didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about the affordability of the loan or ask 
it for any information about the affordability assessment until September 2018  as 
the loan was made in December 2009 and ended in May 2011, I consider it to be 
more likely than not that any complaint about the affordability of the loan would now 
be time barred;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr M was unduly 
pressured into entering into the membership agreement or loan agreement in 
December 2009 or that the timeshare company used unacceptable commercial 
practices against Mr M  he didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about those 
issues until September 2018  nearly nine years after hed entered into the 
agreements and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have 
complained to Barclays Partner Finance about any such issues before then;
Mr M says that hed bought a timeshare in June 1994 and he upgraded it in 2005  
and he had issues with the sales practices that were used both times - if he 
considered that he was unduly pressured into entering into those arrangements or 
that unacceptable commercial practices had been used, I consider it to be unlikely 
that hed have then entered into the membership agreement in December 2009;
Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to Mr Ms claim by 
March 2019 so a complaint was made to this service  I consider that it should have 
assessed his claims under sections 75 and 140A but it didnt do that so I cant say 
that it acted fairly and reasonably in response to his claims  but I consider that it 
wouldnt have upheld the claims if it had properly considered them as it would have 
said that the claims werent made within the periods set out in the Limitation Act; and 
I sympathise with Mr M for the issues that hes had with his timeshare and the 
difficulties that hes described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to him any of the 
money that he paid under the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 April 2022.
