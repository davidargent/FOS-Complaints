The complaint
Mr K complains that Nationwide Building Society wont refund to him the money that he paid 
to a bathroom company. 
What happened
Mr K used his Nationwide credit card to make two deposit payments to a bathroom company 
in February 2020 for what he understood to be a fully project managed service for the supply 
and installation of a bathroom and cloakroom for a total price of £22,000. The first payment 
was for £500, the second payment was for £1,700 and the receipts for both payments 
included the bathroom companys terms and conditions for supply contracts. The bathroom 
company sent Mr K a quotation acceptance document in June 2020 for him to sign to accept 
the quotation for the work and included different terms and conditions which were called 
Contract and Guarantee. 
Mr K says that those terms and conditions removed the bathroom companys liability for 
providing key elements of the project management service so he didnt sign the quotation 
acceptance and, after discussions with the bathroom company, he cancelled his order and 
asked for his deposits to be refunded. 
Mr K claimed a refund of the £2,200 that hed paid to the bathroom company from 
Nationwide under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in August 2020. The 
bathroom company sent Mr K a cheque for £1,418.57 in October 2020 and said that hed 
been charged £250 for the design of the bathroom, £250 for the design of the cloakroom, a 
restocking fee and its loss on some ordered items. 
Nationwide said that it was unable to see that there had been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the bathroom company based on the information that Mr K had 
provided. It also said that it was unable to review the fairness of the bathroom companys 
terms and conditions and that it had no legal grounds to raise a claim against the bathroom 
company. Mr K wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that 
there had been a breach of contract or a misrepresentation by the bathroom company and 
she thought that its payment was fair because Mr K hadnt cancelled the agreement within 
seven days. 
Mr K has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He has provided 
detailed responses to explain why he disagrees with our investigators recommendations 
and to ask questions about his contract with the bathroom company. He also says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that the bathroom company acted unreasonably and not 
in good faith and it failed to provide project management services and introduced new terms 
without his agreement, and that Nationwide hasnt acted fairly. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ks complaint about Nationwide, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that 
Nationwides response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but 
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ks claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
Mr K paid £500 to the bathroom company in February 2020  the receipt doesnt say 
what the payment was for but Mr K says, in a detailed timeline that hes provided, 
that it was for a design service and the receipt says: Where deposits are taken 
please note that part of the deposit is for our design service, which is £250.00 ;
the bathroom companys terms and conditions for supply contracts were included 
with that receipt  but I consider it to be clear from the evidence thats been provided 
that the contract wasnt just a supply contract and that other services were to be 
provided to Mr K;
Mr K paid £1,700 to the bathroom company later that month as a deposit for the 
supply of bathroom products, wall and floor tiles, utility products, underfloor heating, 
tanking and a project managed service for a total cost, including VAT and delivery, 
of £22,000  and the quotation showed that the cost of the project managed service 
was £14,160;
the bathroom companys terms and conditions for supply contracts were again 
included with that receipt even though services were included in the quote and the 
scope of the project managed service wasnt described in any further detail  but at 
that time Mr K had had at least five appointments with the bathroom company and I 
consider it be reasonable to conclude that there would have been discussions about 
the project managed service;
Mr K asked the bathroom company to provide a contract for the work  and there 
was a delay in that being provided which will, at least in part, have been caused by 
the government imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic  but hed made 
the two payments to the bathroom company even though it hadnt provided the 
applicable terms and conditions to him;
the bathroom company sent Mr K a quotation acceptance document in June 2020 for 
him to sign to accept the quotation for the work and it included the Contract and 
Guarantee terms and conditions;
Mr K says that those terms and conditions removed the bathroom companys liability 
for providing key elements of the project management service so he didnt sign the 
quotation acceptance  but those were the bathroom companys standard terms and 
conditions and, if the terms and conditions were an important consideration for Mr K, 
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have required that they be 
provided before he paid any money to the bathroom company;
Mr K had discussions with the bathroom company about the terms and conditions but 
it said that the terms and conditions were also available on its website and could 
have been requested from its showroom;Mr K wasnt satisfied with the terms and conditions on which the project management 
service would be provided so the bathroom company gave him three options: accept 
the terms and conditions for the project managed service; move to a supply only 
contract; or cancel the order but there would be some charges for goods that it had 
already received;
Mr K cancelled the order in August 2020 and asked for his deposits to be refunded  
letters were exchanged about the refund and the bathroom company then sent Mr K 
a cheque for £1,418.57 in October 2020 and said that hed been charged £250 for 
the design of the bathroom, £250 for the design of the cloakroom, a 
restocking/postage fee of £125.53 and its loss on some ordered items of £155.90;
I can understand Mr Ks frustration and confusion about his contractual arrangement 
with the bathroom company and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect it to 
have provided the applicable terms and conditions to Mr K sooner than it did  but its 
failure to do so isnt something for which Nationwide would be liable under section 75 
and Im not persuaded that it didnt act in good faith;
Nationwide would only be liable to Mr K under section 75 for any breach of contract 
or misrepresentation by the bathroom company  and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation 
by the bathroom company in these circumstances;
although there is a lack of clarity about the terms of the contract, its clear that the 
bathroom company had started, and was ready to continue with, a project managed 
service to Mr K and I dont consider that Mr Ks issues with the terms and conditions 
that he was sent in June 2020 are enough to constitute a breach of contract by the 
bathroom company;
I consider it be reasonable to conclude that there had been discussions between 
Mr K and the bathroom company about the project managed service but that service 
wasnt described in any documents  the bathroom company was offering its normal 
project managed service to Mr K but its terms and conditions werent acceptable to 
him but I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that the bathroom 
company misrepresented its services to Mr K;
I dont consider that Mr K was entitled to a full refund of the money that hed paid to 
the bathroom company when he cancelled his order  the bathroom company says 
that it had designed the bathroom and cloakroom so charged him £250 for each of 
those designs  Mr K said that he would pay for the bathroom design but not the 
cloakroom design as he hadnt received the design  but the order had been based 
on the design of the bathroom and cloakroom and, even if Mr K hadnt been provided 
with the detailed design that he expected for the cloakroom, I consider that its fair 
and reasonable for the bathroom company to have charged him for both designs;
the installation was due to take place in September 2020 so, when Mr K cancelled 
the order in August 2020, I consider it to be reasonable to expect that the bathroom 
company would already have received at least some of the products required for the 
installation  it says that it sold some items that had been ordered at a loss of 
£155.90 and that the restocking and postage fees for other products was £125.53 
and it charged Mr K for those amounts;
the bathroom company had already provided some project managed services to Mr K 
so I consider that the refund of £1,418.57 that it paid to him was fair and reasonable 
in these circumstances;
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute;theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made, but if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules  and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success  I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
I consider that the bathroom company would have defended any chargeback claim 
that was made by Nationwide in these circumstances as it would have said that Mr K 
had cancelled the order  and it had then refunded £1,418.57 to him and it would 
also have said that he wasnt entitled to a refund of the remaining £781.43;
I dont consider that there was a reasonable prospect of a chargeback claim being 
successful in these circumstances and I dont consider that there was any 
requirement for Nationwide to make a chargeback claim for the payments that Mr K 
had made to the bathroom company so Im not persuaded that it acted unfairly or 
unreasonably in not doing so;
I consider that Nationwides response to Mr Ks claim under section 75 was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Nationwide to refund to 
Mr K any of the money that he paid to the bathroom company, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 May 2022.
