K821x#15complaint
Mr J complains that CURO TRANSATLANTIC  LIMITED (trading as WageDayAdvance) was 
irresponsible to lend to him.
background
Mr J had three loans from WageDayAdvance between  July 2012 and September 2012:
Loan Date Amount Scheduled Repayment Repaid Status
1 20 Jul 2012 £100 24 Aug 2012 £145 24 Aug 2012 On time
2 6 Sep 2012 £250 25 Sep 2012 £339 25 Sep 2012 On time
3 26 Sep 2012 £400 25 Oct 2012 £533 11 Aug 2013 4 x deferrals
.
WageDayAdvance says it asked Mr J for information  about  his income and expenditure and 
used this information, in conjunction  with Mr Js borrowing history to make  its lending 
decisions. It says it assessed that the maximum loan that Mr J could  afford was £1,000,  but 
consistently lent him less than that. It further  explained that, in 2012, the credit reference 
agencies were not a reliable source  of information about short-term  lending.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld in part. He was satisfied that 
WageDayAdvance did enough checks before approving the first two loans,  but considered it 
should have asked him about his other short-term credit commitments  before approving  
loan 3. However, as Mr J had provided no evidence about his financial circumstances at the 
time of the third loan, our adjudicator was unable  to say what  further checks  may have 
shown. That said, he noted  that allowing a customer to defer  repayment  of a loan more  than 
three times, without further assessment, contravenes the Consumer Finance Associations 
(CFA) Lending Code.  He recommended  that WageDayAdvance should refund all interest  
payments after the third deferral of loan 3 (+8% statutory  interest) and remove any negative 
information about loan 3 from Mr Js credit  file.
WageDayAdvance responded to say, in summary,  that although the CFA code was agreed 
in July 2012, it was not implemented until November 2012, after Mr J took out the third loan. 
Therefore, it says, it does  not apply to loan 3 as this was taken out in September 2012.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
WageDayAdvance was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make 
sure Mr J could  afford to repay the loans  before  it lent to him. Those checks  needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr J was borrowing, and his lending  history. But 
there was no set list of checks WageDayAdvance had to do.
Loans 1 and 2
Im satisfied that WageDayAdvance  did enough checks before approving Mr Js first two 
loans. I say that because the repayments  were  a small proportion of Mr Js declared  income  
and WageDayAdvance also asked him about his expenditure. This showed  that he had a 
disposable income that far exceeded his repayments. So I cant say WageDayAdvance was 
wrong to approve  Mr Js first two loans.

Mr J applied for loan 3 within a day of repaying  his second loan. As this was also for 
significantly more money than the previous  loans,  I consider WageDayAdvance should have 
asked him whether he had any other  short-term  loans at the time. I cant see it did that, 
although I acknowledge WageDayAdvance says it wasnt  unreasonable for it to assume  
short-term loans were included in the figures Mr J declared as his expenditure.
That said,  Im unable  to say what such checks would have shown as Mr J hasnt provided 
the relevant information about  his financial  circumstances at the time. So I cant  conclude 
WageDayAdvance did anything wrong by approving Mr Js third loan.
However, WageDayAdvance allowed Mr J to defer the repayment  of this loan four times. 
The Consumer Finance Associations (CFA) Lending Code says that a business should not 
allow a consumer to defer  repayment of a loan more than three times, without further 
assessment. This Lending Code was published in July 2012, so I consider  
WageDayAdvance should  have taken  this into account before it agreed  to defer Mr Js 
repayment for a fourth time.
I accept that WageDayAdvance  says the code  wasnt implemented  until November 2012, 
and therefore  it wasnt required  to follow the code  until that date. But I dont consider that 
makes a difference here.  I say that because the lending decision  for the fourth deferral 
happened in January 2013  after both the publication date and the date WageDayAdvance 
says it was implemented. So, at the time of the fourth deferral, Im satisfied the code applied 
and WageDayAdvance should  not have approved the deferral without further assessment.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. CURO  TRANSATLANTIC  LIMITED 
(trading as WageDayAdvance) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr J paid after the third deferral of loan 3;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loan 3 from Mr Js credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires WageDayAdvance to take off tax from this interest. 
WageDayAdvance must give Mr J a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 February  2019.
