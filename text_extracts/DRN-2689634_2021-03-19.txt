The complaint
Ms Q thinks that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, lent to her irresponsibly when approving her
for a credit card and when the credit limit on the card was later increased.  
What happened
Ms Q applied for an Aqua credit card in December 2017. The credit application was
approved, and Ms Q was issued a card with an initial credit limit of £450. In April 2018, Aqua
offered to increase Ms Qs credit limit to £1,200. Ms Q didnt decline the offer, and so the
credit limit was increased.
Ms Q got into financial difficulty in 2019 and was unable to meet the necessary minimum
payments. NewDay issued a default notice to Ms Q, but Ms Q was unable to make the
necessary payments on the account. NewDay defaulted Ms Qs account in April 2020.
Ms Q wasnt happy and thought that NewDay had offered credit to her that she couldnt
afford, so she made a complaint. NewDay looked at Ms Qs complaint, but they said that
they checks that they had undertaken when offering the credit demonstrated to them that
they had not acted irresponsibly, either at the time of the original credit card application, or
the later credit limit increase. NewDay also felt that they had acted appropriately in how they
had managed Ms Qs account once Ms Q had fallen into arrears. So, they didnt uphold the
complaint.
Ms Q wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that it had been appropriate for
NewDay to offer credit to Ms Q at the time of the initial credit application. However, they felt
that Ms Qs circumstances at the time of the credit limit increase were such that NewDay
had offered credit to Ms Q irresponsibly at that time.
So, our investigator said that NewDay should take action because of this. The
recommendations made by our investigator included refunding any interest and charges
applied to the account above the initial £450 credit limit and removing any adverse
information from Ms Qs credit file that had been reported because of the credit limit
increase.
NewDay accepted most of the actions recommended by our investigator, but they put
forward an argument as to why it wouldnt be fair to ask them to remove the adverse
information from Ms Qs credit file. Our investigator considered this argument and issued a
second view which confirmed that he was withdrawing the requirement for NewDay to
remove the adverse information from Ms Qs credit file, but that all the other previous
recommendations remained in place.
Ms Q wasnt happy that the investigator had amended his recommendations in this way, so
the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 16 February 2021 as follows:
I must begin by confirming that I am in agreement with the recommendations made 
by our investigator which NewDay has previously accepted, and while I will not refer 
to these during the course of this section, I will include these in the instructions Ill 
make to NewDay toward the end of this letter.
The key issue here is whether NewDay should remove the adverse information from 
Ms Qs credit file, as per the original recommendation made by our investigator.
Instructing a business to remove adverse credit information from a customers credit 
file is a course of action that this service has the remit to make, and one which I 
consider to be fair and reasonable when considering the circumstances of this 
complaint. NewDay have agreed that they offered credit to Ms Q irresponsibly when 
increasing the credit limit on her account, and so I can find no reason why it wouldnt 
be fair to instruct NewDay to remove the adverse information on Ms Qs credit file 
that has arisen from this irresponsible lending.
NewDays argument against this course of action appears to be based on features of 
their own internal systems that would make complying with this instruction 
problematic. However, this does not provide a sufficient reason to withhold a fair 
outcome to a customer. So, I will be instructing that NewDay remove the adverse 
information from Ms Qs credit file.
Finally, I feel that the inconvenience that Ms Q has experienced in regard to the 
events surrounding this complaint has not been appropriately considered, so I will 
also be instructing NewDay to make a payment to Ms Q of £100 because of this. 
However, NewDay can apply this £100 to any debt that remains on Ms Qs account 
once all other restorative action instructed below has been completed.
I invited Ms Q and NewDay to provide any comments that they wished me to consider before 
I made my final decision. Ms Q accepted my provisional decision. However, NewDay raised 
several points.
The first was that, as a provider of credit, NewDay are obliged to make accurate reports to 
the credit reference agencies, and that one reason for this is so that businesses to whom Ms 
Q might apply to for credit in future have an accurate record of how she has managed 
previous credit. 
NewDay also point out that retaining a record of how Ms Q has managed the higher credit 
limit in this instance on her credit file would help to prevent the very thing that Ms Q is 
complaining about happening again  being approved for a level of credit that is unaffordable 
for her.
I can appreciate NewDays point here to a degree, and this service understands well the 
importance of accurate credit file reporting. 
But my decision here includes that Ms Q should never have been offered the higher level of 
credit that NewDay authorised her for in April 2018. And it follows from this that any potential 
mis-management of that credit by Ms Q which has led to adverse information being recorded 
on her credit file should never have happened. And this is because Ms Q shouldnt have had 
the higher level of credit to potentially mis-manage, because that higher level of credit wasnt affordable for her.
NewDay have also raised concerns that my provisional decision doesnt acknowledge that 
any accountability or responsibility falls on Ms Q for how she managed the higher level of 
credit. But NewDay had a responsibility here also  to ensure that they werent authorising 
Ms Q for unaffordable levels of credit  and this responsibility is in place precisely to prevent 
customers such as Ms Q being granted inappropriate levels of credit and then getting into 
unsustainable levels of debt.
I must also note that it isnt the case that my decision absolves Ms Q of all accountability, 
and I say this because Im not asking NewDay to write off any of the capital balance that 
Miss Q has used here. Its fair that Ms Q should repay this balance, because its money that 
she has had the use of. 
But NewDay shouldnt have offered Ms Q a credit limit increase in April 2018. And it is the 
case that I feel that the accountability for the subsequent management of that credit facility 
falls back to NewDay. And this is because any potential mis-management of the higher 
credit facility by Ms Q was only made possible because NewDay authorised her for that 
higher credit limit.
So, it doesnt feel fair to me that Ms Q should have paid fees or charges, or have incurred 
adverse information on her credit file, because of NewDay authorising her for a level of credit 
that was unaffordable for her. And it must also be noted that Ms Q didnt apply for this higher 
level of credit, but rather that it was offered to her by NewDay.
All of which means that it remains my opinion that the outcome I outlined in my provisional 
decision is a fair and reasonable one, and this includes the provision that NewDay must 
remove all adverse information from Ms Qs credit file following the credit limit increase in 
April 2018. And so I will be upholding this complaint on that basis.   
Putting things right
NewDay should refund interest and charges applied to Ms Qs account above the £450
credit limit and rework her credit card account. Any such refund should be applied to reduce
Ms Qs outstanding balance. If NewDay deducts any income tax from this amount, it must
provide the necessary certificate to Ms Q.
NewDay should also check for any periods when Ms Qs payments would have been enough
to clear her balance and, if this is the case, it should pay 8% annual simple interest on any
periods when Ms Q would have been in credit.
NewDay should recall the account from the debt collection agency and remove any adverse
information from Ms Qs credit file following the credit limit increase in April 2018.
NewDay should make a payment of £100 to Ms Q, although this payment can be used to
reduce any outstanding balance still present on the account once the actions referred to
above have been completed, with any remaining credit paid to Ms Q.
Finally, NewDay should assess whether any debt remains on the account following these
actions and should make appropriate arrangements moving forward. If Ms Qs account
cannot be returned to the previous contractual terms, as NewDay have suggested, I leave it
to NewDays discretion to agree repayment terms with Ms Q that differ from the contractual
terms, so long as any difference is in Ms Qs favour.  
My final decisionMy final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua,
on the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms Q to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 April 2021.
