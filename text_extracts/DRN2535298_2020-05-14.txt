K820x#14Complaint
Mr T complains that Creation Financial Services Limited (which  I will refer to as Creation) 
held him liable for credit card transactions that he says he neither made nor authorised.
Background
Mr T had a Creation credit card. 
In June 2017 Mr T went on holiday to Spain. Whilst on holiday he visited  a gentlemans club,  
which I will refer to as club B, on 17 June 2017.  Between 17 and 18 June 2017 15 
transactions were  made on Mr Ts credit card. He disputes 13 of the 15 payments. 
Below are the transactions I consider  relevant to Mr Ts complaint. The transactions in bold 
are the ones Mr T disputes.

Mr T says he was out drinking with a friend on the night of 17 June 2017. Hes explained that 
he and his friend went to club B, which is a gentlemans bar. Mr T says on arrival  at the club 
he bought some drinks  and after about  half an hour his friend  left him and went  back to his 
hotel, leaving him alone  at the club.
Mr T has told us that he thinks his drink was spiked and he blacked out in the club after his 
second drink, though  he didnt seek medical treatment or report  the matter  to police. He says 
he woke up in the club around 7am the following morning and cant  remember  much  about 
the night. Hes explained that he was still in possession of his credit card and wallet. So, he 
didnt think anything was amiss and went back to his hotel.
Mr T says apart from buying drinks  when he first arrived at the club,  he didnt carry out any 
other transactions at the club and shouldnt be held responsible for them. He believes the 
staff at the club took advantage of his drugged state and potentially saw him inputting his 
PIN when  he bought  drinks at the bar. And thinks someone must have taken his card after 
hed passed out.
When the investigator spoke to Mr T about  what had happened, he told the investigator that 
the fraudsters also tried to use his bank card for an account he has with another bank, which  
Ref: DRN25352982I will refer to as bank  B. Hes said that the PIN for this card is different to his Creation card, 
so the transactions were declined. Mr T said he reported what  happened to bank B.
Creation didnt accept  Mr Ts disputed  transaction claim because:
Mr T says he hadnt disclosed his PIN to anyone else,  it wasnt recorded anywhere 
and wasnt a number  easily  guessed by a third party
the correct PIN was used for the transactions
Mr T initially told Creation that he had lost his card
he later said the card didnt leave  his possession and he still had it at the time of 
raising the dispute
Mr T hadnt  provided any plausible explanation as to how his bank card and PIN 
were compromised.  And told the bank when  he reported the claim I took every  
reasonable care to mitigate the risk of 'shoulder  surfing'  - I keep no record  of my PIN 
as it's memorised, nobody  knows my PIN number and I always  try to ensure nobody 
can see me entering my PIN
there are genuine transactions  between  the ones Mr T disputes. 
Having looked  at the sequence of events, the investigator said it was more  likely than not 
Mr T authorised the disputed transactions. Mr T disagreed. As no agreement  could be 
reached the complaint has come to me to decide. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint
Generally, Creation are required to refund unauthorised transactions and are entitled to hold 
consumers liable for authorised transactions. The relevant regulations,  to this effect, are the 
Payment Services Regulations 2009  (the PSRs 2009).  Mr T says he didnt make the 
transactions and is seeking a refund of just under £6,000.  So, my primary concern is to 
decide whether  or not I think Mr T authorised  the payments from his account. If I decide on 
the balance of probabilities that he did, then I am unlikely to ask Creation to refund them. 
Im satisfied from the banks technical  evidence that Mr Ts genuine card and PIN were  used 
to make the disputed transactions.  But the regulations relevant to this case  say that is not, 
on its own, enough to enable Creation to hold Mr T liable. So, I also need  to think  about  
whether the evidence suggests Mr T most likely  consented to the payments being made.
Based on what Mr T has said, there are only three  scenarios which  explain what happened. 
He made  the payments himself  either  knowingly or wasnt aware  he was making the 
payments because he was drugged. Alternatively, as Mr T has suggested,  a staff member 
shoulder surfed him, stole  his card while he was drugged  and used it at the club before 
returning it to him before  he woke up.
Ive considered the possibility that Mr Ts card was taken by someone else at the club and 
gained access to his PIN. And that he didnt  carry out the transactions. But having 
considered all the evidence I dont think this is the most likely explanation and Ill explain 
why:
the transactions were made using Mr Ts genuine card and PIN, but I dont see a 
convincing explanation for how a third party could  have known his PIN and gained 
Ref: DRN25352983possession of his credit card. I say this because  from looking at the timings  of the 
transactions the first disputed transaction was made  only ten minutes after Mr T says 
he bought some drinks  at 22:38. This means  a third party had a window of just ten 
minutes to drug Mr T, take his card and use it at 22:48. And I think this is unlikely.
Ive also kept in mind  that Mr T said he went to the club with a friend who stayed with 
him for at least half an hour at the club. With this in mind I think  its unlikely a third 
party would risk being seen taking and using Mr Ts card.  And that Mr Ts friend 
would leave him in a drugged state and not alert the police or seek  some  medical  
help for him. But Ive not seen any evidence  to support that this happened.
Mr T says he had his credit card in his possession when he left the club and the 
transactions took place over a period of about  five hours, on average every  half hour 
or so. Whilst its possible I dont think that an unknown  third party would  risk taking 
Mr Ts wallet, replacing it, taking it again,  completing  further  transactions and then 
returning the card. This back and forth wouldve  created an unnecessary risk of Mr T 
becoming aware that fraudulent transactions  were taking place. 
I also think it would be unusual for a third party,  having managed  to take Mr Ts card 
and PIN without him noticing, to make  transactions with twenty and thirty minute  
gaps between them. In these circumstances Id expect an unknown third party to 
maximise use of the card by accessing  any available  funds as quickly as possible as 
they wouldnt know when Mr T might notice his card was missing.
there appears to be a genuine transaction between the ones  Mr T disputes which 
was made on 18 June 2017  at 00:48, for £41.68. Mr T said he simply doesnt 
remember anything about this transaction, but he hasnt disputed  it. So, I think  its 
likely he consented to this transaction. 
I think its worth noting that Mr T has been consistent about  saying  he believes his 
drink was spiked. So, Ive also considered if he made these transactions, whilst in 
this state of mind, whether this would make a difference.  Even if he completed  the 
transactions whilst  under  the influence of a substance, this doesnt mean the 
transactions werent authorised. Creation wouldnt have known of Mr Ts state and he 
was the one who ultimately gave consent.  And for the reasons Ive already  given  I 
think it most likely that Mr T did consent to these transactions,  even in the 
circumstances hes described  of his drink  being spiked.
Ive also considered whether the bank  ought  to have flagged or stopped these 
transactions but I dont think that would have resulted in a different outcome. I say 
this because even  if Creation had contacted  Mr T to raise suspicion about  the 
transactions, Im satisfied Mr T would most likely  have indicated hed consented 
them.
I think the most compelling  argument against third party  theft, is the use of Mr Ts 
other bank card.  Mr T told the investigator that the card for his account  with bank B 
was also taken by the fraudsters. And they attempted  to use it but couldnt because  
the PIN was different  to his Creation card PIN. But bank B has provided
evidence that contradicts  what  Mr T has said. This shows Mr Ts bank card was used 
to make three transactions at club B, on 18 June 2017, which match  the general 
pattern and amounts spent on his Creation card. Mr T hasnt disputed these 
Ref: DRN25352984transactions. So, I think its most likely  he consented to these transactions.  And his 
card wasnt  taken by a third party.
In summary,  for the reasons Ive explained,  I think its more  likely than not that Mr T 
authorised the transactions hes disputed. I therefore think its fair and reasonable for 
Creation to refuse him a refund of these transactions.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 June  2020.
