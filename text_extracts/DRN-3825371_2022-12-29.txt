Morses responded to Mr Ms complaint by issuing a final response letter in May 2022. It did 
not uphold his complaint. 
Mr M referred it to the Financial Ombudsman Service and one of our adjudicators looked at 
it. He had noticed the three month gap in the lending but did not think that it broke the chain 
of loans approved for Mr M and so he treated it as one loan chain. 
Our adjudicators view was that by loan 4 the pattern of lending itself showed that the loans 
from that point were unsustainable  so Morses ought to have ceased to lend at loan 4  his 
outcome was to uphold the complaint for loans 4 - 7.
Morses disagreed and gave several reasons as to why, which are summarised here:
Loans 6 and 7 relate to a brand new account and Morses did treat Mr M as a new 
customer after the break
£300 loans were relatively low value
The loan repayments remained the same at £15 a week
Mr M had a good repayment history
Morses did an income and expenditure assessment (I&E) for each loan
It was able to either verify Mr Ms incomes or check them through Credit Reference 
Agencies (CRA) 
For the loans taken after 2019 it used Office of National Statistics (ONS) data 
It looked at Mr Ms credit commitments using the credit search results
Morses sent to us screenshots of Mr Ms comments to the agents when applying for 
the loans. All of these I have reviewed
Morses said: each affordability assessment showed he had sufficient uncommitted 
and available income to meet his repayments to Morses Club and we never used 
more than half'.
Morses said Mr M had the choice whether to take a series of loans or cease after a 
loan. 
It has not seen any evidence to show that Mr M was using other funds to meet his 
repayments and so causing him to borrow again. 
Mr Ms representative has acknowledged the fact the case was being passed to an 
ombudsman for review. It has, in the past, said that it cannot send to us any further 
information about Mr Ms finances. 
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide and on 8 December 2022 I issued a 
provisional decision giving reasons why I considered that part of the complaint ought to be 
upheld, but for different loans (loans 2 to 7) and for different reasons to those given by our 
adjudicator.
I gave both parties time to respond. I duplicate here (in smaller type) my provisional findings 
and then go on to finalise the decision. 
My provisional decision dated 8 December 2022 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about high cost, 
short-term and home credit lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance, and good industry 
practice - on our website.
Morses had to assess the lending to check if Mr M could afford to pay back the amounts hed 
borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was proportionate to the 
circumstances. Morses checks could have considered several different things, such as how much 
was being lent, the size of the repayments, and Mr Ms income and expenditure.
I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been
proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done more to establish
that any lending was sustainable for Mr M. These factors include:
Mr M having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mr M having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time 
(reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or 
was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr M coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also suggestive 
of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr M. Our adjudicator considered this to be the 
case for Mr M from Loan 4.
Morses was required to establish whether Mr M could sustainably repay the loans  not just whether 
he technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money to make the 
repayments could of course be an indicator that Mr M was able to repay his loans sustainably. But it 
doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and, 
made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to make 
them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those repayments 
are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Mr Ms complaint.
Pattern of lending
I do not agree that the three month gap caused a break in the lending. I do not know why Mr M 
reapplied to Morses with a fresh customer number, but that largely is irrelevant. I note that he did and 
that Morses treated him as a new customer. But I think its highly likely that Morses was aware, or 
ought to have been aware, that Mr M had just paid off a loan with it three months earlier. And so, 
I consider that after having had Mr M as its customer for two and a half years, that a three month gap 
would not lead to a break in the customer relations and a break in the loan chain.
However, I do not consider that a three month break likely reveals a reliance on the loans as our 
adjudicator has indicated for loans 6 and 7. It seems more likely that it would be reasonable for 
Morses to consider Mr M as not being reliant on its credit after a three month break. And so, I have 
reconsidered the complaint afresh.
I am issuing a provisional decision as I plan to uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and I explain going 
forward. And here is the information Morses has provided from its I&E assessment sheets.

7 £188.50 £124.72 £63.78*£71 37.67%
*these asterixis mark the loan application details where there were no figures included in the I&E for 
groceries. Which leads me to conclude that these disposable income figures would have been lower 
realistically after Mr M had paid for some food. 
##The final two columns are taken from the Morses records sent to us and it must have discovered 
the other credit commitment costs from its research. Morses has not been able to send to us the 
credit search results for loans 1 to 5. It has sent us a set of search results dated October 2020 which 
dovetails with loan 6. And in that document it states that Mr Ms total monthly payments on all 
accounts (excluding mortgages) and active was £416 which would translate to be around £96 a week 
and it has recorded £90 a week for total other credit which seems to have been about right.
And that was calculated to have been 29.69% of his weekly income of £303.16 for loan 6. Therefore, 
applying that logic to the other figures in the columns it seems that the last column is the credit 
commitment cost to Mr M as a percentage of his weekly income before the Morses loan was added in.
Looking at those columns I consider that
- Mr M was on a low income most of the time and
- the percentages for loans 2 to 7 were too high for a low wage person for them to be 
sustainable with the Morses loans as well, and
- the Morses loans were consistently £15 a week but on top of significant other credit.So, although I do not have the credit search records for loans 1 to 5, it seems that Morses knew these 
details and it had taken the time to make these calculations. And the information from the credit 
search done in October 2020 dovetails with the calculations. Loan 7 appears to have been applied for 
when Mr M had experienced a significant reduction in wage level from just over £303 to £188.50.
I have read the screenshots sent to us by Morses for Mr M. It seems that he was receiving reduced 
household outgoings and was well supported by his wife. Still, I consider that for loans 2 to 7 the 
percentage Mr M was already spending on credit costs were too high, he had a relatively low to 
modest income and these figures were before the Morses loan repayments were added in to the I&E 
assessment.
Overall, I consider that loans 2 to 7 ought not to have been approved for Mr M.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Ms representative has responded to say that Mr M agrees with my provisional decision 
and Morses has told us that it has nothing else to add. 
Considering I have no further evidence or submissions from either party then I see no 
reason to depart from the provisional findings and the outcome. Those are repeated here 
and form part of the final decision.
For the reasons given I uphold the complaint in relation to loans 2 to 7. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Morses should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Mr M at loan 2, as Im satisfied it ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mr M may have simply left matters there, not
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between him and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative 
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Mr M in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Mr M would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options.
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Morses liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has
done wrong and should put right.
Morses shouldnt have given Mr M loans 2 to 7.
A) Morses should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards interest,fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B) Morses should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr M
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr M originally made the
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Morses should pay Mr M the total of A plus B.
D) Any adverse payment information recorded about loans 2 to 7 should be removed from
Mr Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to deduct tax from this interest. Morses should
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax Morses has deducted if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and I direct that Morses Club PLC 
does as I have outlined above in the putting things right part of the decision. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 January 2023.
