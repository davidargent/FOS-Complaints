The complaint
Mr M complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their decision to place a 
limitation on his account and the processing of a payment made around the same time.
What happened
Mr M held an account with PayPal for several years. In February 2021, PayPal decided to 
place a limitation on Mr Ms account following a compliance review. At the same time, they 
made Mr M aware that they would need further documentation from him before the limitation 
could be removed.
On the same day the limitation was placed, PayPal also made Mr M aware that a payment 
hed made in the days before hadnt been taken from his current account as there were 
insufficient funds in that account. So, they said the payment had instead been taken from his 
PayPal balance, while also saying it had been taken from his credit card account instead. Mr 
M was unhappy, so he raised a complaint.
Mr M didnt think PayPals decision to limit his account was fair and that it was done without 
any reasonable warning. Mr M explained he had been a customer of PayPals for several 
years without issue, so he didnt think there was any reason for a limitation to be placed. So, 
he refused to provide the information PayPal were asking for and instead wanted his 
account to be re-instated. Mr M also disputed the failed payment from his linked current 
account as he felt there were sufficient funds. And he was unhappy that PayPal provided 
contradicting information about this. So, he wanted an explanation as to what had happened.
PayPal responded and didnt uphold the complaint. They thought they had acted fairly, and 
in line with the terms and conditions of the account, when placing a limitation on the account 
until further information was provided by Mr M. And as Mr M hadnt provided this, they 
thought it was reasonable for the account to remain limited. So, they didnt think they needed 
to do anything more regarding this. They didnt comment on Mr Ms concerns regarding the 
contradiction in how the transaction was processed. Mr M remained unhappy with this 
response, so he referred his complaint to us. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They thought PayPal were 
able to limit Mr Ms account, based on the terms and conditions of the account he held. And 
they didnt think PayPal were unfair to refuse lifting the limitation until Mr M had supplied the 
information they needed to pass their security checks. So, they didnt think PayPal needed to 
do anything more for this aspect of the complaint. Our investigator also recognised the 
contradiction in the information PayPal provided regarding the processing of Mr Ms 
payment. But as this payment was made, they didnt think Mr M had been impacted in a way 
that meant compensation should be provided.
Mr M disagreed with this view, and he requested that our investigator put questions to 
PayPal on his behalf, which our investigator did. But PayPal didnt respond. Our investigator 
explained theyd received no additional information that changed this initial view and so, the 
complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr M. I appreciate hes used 
his PayPal account for several years without issue. So, I can understand the upset and 
inconvenience hed have felt when his ability to use this account was limited, without 
receiving warning that this was going to happen. I can also understand why Mr M would 
seek clarity on why the account had been limited and dispute the need for him to provide 
further information. 
I also recognise Mr Ms bank has disputed PayPals testimony that the payment processed 
around the same time failed due to his current account had insufficient funds. So, I can 
appreciate why Mr M would want PayPal to clarify this, and the contradictions show in the 
emails they sent. And when PayPal didnt do this, I can appreciate why Mr M feels this is 
evidence of the poor service he received.
But for me to say PayPal should remove the limitation, or compensate Mr M, Id need to be 
satisfied they made an error when limiting the account initially, or failed to act in line with the 
terms of the account when placing it. Or, that PayPal have acted unfairly in a way that has 
impacted Mr M in a way that means compensation should be paid. And in this situation, I 
dont think thats the case.
Before I explain why Ive reached my decision, I think it would be useful for me to explain 
how, and what, Ive been able to consider. I understand Mr M had raised issues regarding an 
account opened by his partner. As this relates to his partners account, this is a complaint 
that would need to be raised by his partner and responded to separately by both PayPal and 
our service. So, I havent thought about this further.
I also appreciate Mr M has questioned PayPals decision to review his account, and the 
process they followed when doing so leading to the limitation. But the processes PayPal put 
in place to monitor an accounts activity, and what they deem to be suspicious, is PayPals 
own commercial decision to make. And any complaint about a business process, and 
commercial decision of a business, would fall under the remit of the industry regulator the 
Financial Conduct Authority to investigae. So, I havent thought about or commented on this 
further.
Instead, Ive looked at PayPals decision to limit the account until Mr M provided information 
and thought about whether they acted in line with the terms of the account when doing so. 
And whether they acted fairly during this process.
PayPal have a duty to ensure they protect themselves and their customers from potential 
crime. So, I would expect them to undertake reviews of customer accounts to ensure they 
meet this obligation.
I can see the terms of the account Mr M held, PayPals user agreement, states that:
Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we
notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us asunusual or suspicious. Limitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping
your PayPal account open before going on to provide a non-exhaustive list of reasons when 
an account could be limited. 
The user agreement then explains that a customer will need to resolve any issues with your 
account before a limitation can be removed. Normally, this is done after you provide us with 
the information we request. 
In this situation, PayPal requested Mr M to provide proof of identity and a recent bank 
statement before the limitation could be removed, which Mr M refused to do as he wanted an 
explanation as to why the limitation was placed. But I wouldnt expect PayPal to provide this 
information, as it is commercially sensitive.
Mr M has confirmed that some months after the limitation, PayPal stated they found 
suspicious activity on the credit card linked to his PayPal account. But he doesnt think 
PayPal have access to the information on this account, so disputes this. While PayPal would 
be unable to see itemised usage of this credit card account, they can see the way this 
account is used and maintained is reported to Mr Ms credit file. So, PayPal would have 
access to some information regarding this and I dont think this information in itself suggests 
PayPal have acted unfairly. Mr M has explained he wants proof of this suspicious activity, 
but again, this isnt something I would expect PayPal to provide, nor is it something they are 
obligated to do.
From the terms of the account, I think PayPal were able to limit Mr Ms account if they felt 
the account may be a risk to them or Mr M. Or, if they felt they needed additional information 
to keep the account open. I can see PayPal requested information from Mr M, so Im 
satisfied they needed additional information from Mr M and so, Im satisfied they acted fairly, 
and in line with the terms of the account, when limiting it.
I also think PayPal made it clear what information they needed before the account would 
have the limitation removed. And although I understand Mr Ms reservations, I think it was Mr 
Ms own decision to refuse providing this documentation. I think the terms of the account 
make it reasonably clear that the information would need to be provided before the limitation 
could be removed and so, I dont think I can say PayPal have acted unfairly by keeping the 
limitation in place until this was received. So, I dont think they need to do anything more for 
this aspect of the complaint.
Ive then turned the processing of the payment Mr M made around the time the limitation 
was placed. I can see Mr M received two e-mails from PayPal at the same time, which 
provided conflicting information about how the payment had been processed. And these 
emails were sent just after the limitation had been placed on the account.
I think its clear this contradiction confused Mr M. And I appreciate his frustration as I cant 
see PayPal have provided answers to his questions following his complaint. But this would 
fall under PayPals response to Mr Ms complaint, so part of their complaints handling 
process. And complaint handling is an unregulated activity, which our service is unable to 
decide upon. So, Im unable to comment on PayPals failure to respond to Mr Ms questions, 
or our service when we put them to PayPal on his behalf.
But even so, Mr M has confirmed the payment he attempted to make went through. And that 
he was aware of which account this came out of. So, while I understand Mr M intended for 
the payment to be paid from his PayPal balance, I dont think Mr M has been impacted either 
financially or emotionally by the payment processing in a way that means PayPal should 
compensate him on this occasion. And because of this, I dont think PayPal need to do 
anything more.I understand this isnt the outcome Mr M was hoping for. And I recognise this leaves Mr M in 
the same position of needing to provide PayPal with information before the limitation will be 
removed, which is something he doesnt think he should need to do. But as Ive explained 
above, I think this request is fair and that it falls in line with the terms Mr M agreed to when 
opening his account. So, I dont think PayPal need to do anything more on this occasion.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 September 2022.
