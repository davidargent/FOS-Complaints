The complaint
Mrs M is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) havent accepted her
husbands affidavit that outstanding debts listed jointly in both their names are his sole
responsibility. Mrs M is also unhappy that NatWest havent responded to a subject data
access request that she made or that they havent acknowledged her complaint.
What happened
In 2019, Mrs M was contacted by a third-party debt collection company about a balance
outstanding. It was explained to Mrs D that the balance was an amalgamation of a credit
card, loan, and overdraft balances, all with NatWest. Mrs D asked the debt collection
company for copies of all the relevant documents and was informed that these had been
requested from NatWest at around the beginning of November 2019.
In March 2020, with Mrs M having not received the documents shed requested, she
telephoned NatWest directly to raise the request again and to lodge a formal complaint. In
addition, Mrs M also sent NatWest a letter by recorded delivery reiterating her complaint and
data subject access request, but this letter was later returned to Mrs M unopened and
without explanation. Finally, Mrs M visited her local NatWest branch seeking assistance, but
was told that she couldnt be helped in branch and would have to contact NatWests
customer service  which Mrs M had already tried without success.
Frustrated at receiving no response from NatWest, and with the disputed adverse credit file
reporting relating to these balances causing Mrs M increasing distress because of issues
she was having refinancing her mortgage while that adverse reporting was in place, Mrs M
referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators attempted to liaise with NatWest about this issue and asked
NatWest to respond to Mrs Ms complaint and issue a final response letter. However,
NatWests initial responses to this service were perfunctory, and ceased altogether after
March 2021, at which time NatWest had providing some, but not all, of the information
requested from it by this service. Furthermore, to date, NatWest have also not issued a
formal response or acknowledgement of Mrs Ms complaint as requested.
In the absence of continuing engagement from NatWest, our investigator looked at this
complaint. They noted that NatWest had confirmed to this service that theyd only been able
to locate limited documents as the accounts were all over ten years old which meant that
many account documents were no longer retained. However, NatWest were able to provide
a loan document showing that the loan was opened in Mrs Ms and her husbands joint
names in 2005.
Our investigator also noted that, given that the accounts were in joint names, it was at
NatWests discretion as to whether they were willing to accept an affidavit signed by Mrs Ms
husband absolving Mrs M of responsibility for these loans. And NatWest confirmed to this
service that they werent willing to accept this affidavit.
Because of this, our investigator didnt feel that they could reasonably recommend for
NatWest to amend Mrs Ms credit file as she would have liked, although they did feel that
Mrs M had been significantly distressed and inconvenienced by NatWests failure to engage
with her about this matter, and so they recommended that NatWest pay Mrs M £800
compensation because of this.
Mrs M wasnt satisfied with the recommendation put forwards by our investigator, and
NatWest didnt respond to say whether they accepted our investigators recommendations or
not. So, the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 4 March 2022 as follows:
I can appreciate how Mrs M might feel, given that her husband has signed an 
affidavit absolving her of responsibility for these accounts that were initially taken in 
her and her husbands joint names, that she should no longer be incurring the 
adverse reporting on her credit file in regard to these accounts that she is.
However, while Mrs Ms husband may have signed that affidavit, given that the 
accounts in question were taken as joint accounts and are therefore in both Mrs Ms 
and her husbands names, there is no obligation on NatWest to accept the affidavit 
signed by Mrs Ms husband or to consider these balances as no longer being jointly 
and severally outstanding.
NatWest have confirmed to this service that they dont accept that affidavit, and that 
they consider that the accounts remain in Mrs M and her husbands joint names and 
that therefore Mrs M and her husband remain jointly and severally liable for the 
outstanding balances such that the credit file reporting on Mrs Ms credit file is fair 
and reasonable.
Given that NatWest are entitled to take this position, I find it difficult to conclude that
NatWest have treated Mrs M unfairly by continuing to consider the accounts as being 
joint accounts or by making the reports to Mrs Ms credit file that they have. And 
while I appreciate Mrs M will be disappointed by this outcome, I dont feel that I can 
fairly or reasonably uphold this aspect of her complaint.
Im aware that Mrs M feels that NatWest continuing to report adverse information to 
her credit file has caused detriment to her given that its affected her ability to get a 
favourable mortgage rate. But accepting as I do that NatWests credit file reporting is 
fair and reasonable, as explained above, I also wont be upholding this aspect of Mrs 
Ms complaint.
However, I am satisfied that NatWests ongoing failure to engage with Mrs M about 
this matter, including NatWests failure to engage with this service, will have had a 
significant impact on Mrs M. I say this because Mrs M has been without NatWests 
answer on this issue for some time and I can appreciate this will have meant that she 
feels shes had no closure on this matter. So, Mrs M has remained distressed and 
inconvenienced by this matter for a wholly unreasonable and unnecessary amount of 
time  essentially since the end of 2019.
Mrs M has told us about the stress shes suffered, brought about in the large part by 
the uncertainty of not having this matter addressed by NatWest. And even though what NatWest would have said about this complaint would likely not have been the 
outcome Mrs M wanted, I think its fair to say that NatWest is responsible for a lot of 
the uncertainty shes felt here. Importantly, NatWest could have quickly and 
reasonably resolved this by responding to either Mrs M, or this service, over the large 
period of time that this matter has been outstanding. I consider the impact on Mrs M 
of NatWests failure to engage with her and formally respond to her about this matter 
to have been significant.
I do need to acknowledge that Im not upholding Mrs Ms complaint in regard of the 
affidavit signed by her husband. But Ive also considered the understandable hope 
that Mrs M has held for this long period of time that she thought her desired course of 
financial action might be possible in the absence of being told that it wasnt.
In not responding to Mrs M, NatWest has also not allowed Mrs M to move forward 
from an informed position. Nor has it advised what the correct position is and what 
more she could have done. Those suggestions may not have been what Mrs M 
wanted, but theyd no doubt mean that she would have been in a more informed 
position sooner than she now is.
While our investigator recommended a compensation amount of £800  I feel that 
bringing this amount to £1,000 would be more reflective of the impact NatWests 
handling of this situation has caused her. Thats a relatively significant sum, but in my 
view, its fair and proportionate to whats happened here.
As such, my provisional decision here is that I will be upholding this complaint in Mrs 
Ms favour on this limited basis only, and that NatWest must make a payment of 
£1,000 to compensate Mrs M for the upset that Im satisfied she has unfairly and 
unreasonably incurred. NatWest must pay this compensation directly to Mrs M and 
may not apply this payment to one of the outstanding account balances unless Mrs M 
permits them to do so.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mrs M and NatWest the opportunity to provide 
any comments or new information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a final 
decision. NatWest confirmed that they were happy to accept my provisional decision, 
whereas Mrs M reiterated a request for this service to find out why NatWest didnt respond to 
letters sent to them by her mortgage provider.
I can appreciate Mrs Ms position, and while I acknowledge that NatWest havent responded 
to various correspondence and requests here, I dont feel that the provision of a specific 
reason as to why this was the case is feasible in this instance. 
Ultimately though, as explained in my provisional decision letter above, I do feel that Mrs M 
has incurred significant upset and inconvenience as a result of NatWest not responding 
when they reasonable should, and its for this reasons that Im instructing NatWest to pay 
compensation to Mrs M of £1,000, which I continue to feel provides fairly compensation to 
Mrs M for what has occurred.
As such, I can confirm that my final decision here is that I am upholding this complaint in Mrs 
Ms favour on the limited basis explained above.
Putting things right
NatWest must make a payment of £1,000 to Mrs M to compensate her for the upset that Im 
satisfied she has unfairly and unreasonably incurred here. NatWest must pay this amount directly to Mrs M and may not apply this payment to one of the outstanding account 
balances unless Mrs M permits them to do so. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc on 
the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 May 2022.
