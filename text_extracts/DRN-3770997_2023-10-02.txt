The complaint
Mr G complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he paid for some holiday club membership 
points. His wife is also involved in his complaint and hes being represented by a claims 
management company.
What happened
Mr G and his wife had bought 204,001 holiday club membership points from a holiday 
company and Mr G says that he paid for them using loans provided by Barclays Partner 
Finance. They then entered into a purchase agreement to buy an additional 46,000 
membership points from the holiday company in October 2015 for a price of £8,500. Mr G 
also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of 
that amount and agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £125.80 to Barclays Partner 
Finance. 
Mr Gs representative made claims, on behalf of Mr G, to Barclays Partner Finance under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in May 2020. It said that the product 
was misrepresented to Mr G and his wife; the contract was breached; commission was paid 
between Barclays Partner Finance and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr G 
which created a breach of fiduciary duty and caused an unfair relationship; and the loan was 
unaffordable. 
Barclays Partner Finance didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so a 
complaint was made to this service. Mr Gs complaint form says that the holiday company 
and Barclays Partner Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford 
the loan; Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt 
declared to him and the holiday company unduly pressured him and his wife into entering 
into the purchase agreement and him into entering into the loan agreement; all rendering the 
loan agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Gs complaint should be upheld. She wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract. She said that she hadnt seen enough to 
suggest that the relationship between Mr G and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and 
she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was 
unfair. She also said that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending 
was unaffordable for Mr G.
Mr Gs representative, on behalf of Mr G, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It has provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday 
company and the unfair terms that it uses. It has also raised its serious concerns about the 
way that the finance was sold to Mr G and says that the holiday company didnt broker 
proper credit and failed to meet the standard of a regulated firm.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Gs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr G and his wife signed the purchase agreement in October 2015 to buy 46,000 
holiday club membership points which increased their number of points to 250,001 
and the holiday company agreed that they would be able to surrender their points 
from their fifth year of membership;
they also signed other documents including a form about their right to withdraw from 
the agreement and credit applications and Mr G signed the loan agreement and a 
customer compliance statement;
Mr Gs representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in May 2020 about 
the purchase agreement that Mr G and his wife had entered into in October 2015 and 
Mr G then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter refers to claims under 
sections 75 and 140A, including that the 46,000 points were misrepresented to Mr G 
and his wife, but his complaint form only refers to claims under section 140A and 
doesnt refer to a misrepresentation made by the holiday company;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Gs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays 
Partner Finances response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Mr G has also referred to the other purchases of points that he and his wife made 
from the holiday company before October 2015 but I consider it to be clear from his 
representatives May 2020 letter to Barclays Partner Finance that the claim that has 
been made relates only to the purchase that they made in October 2015  and 
Mr Gs complaint form says that the transaction that hes complaining about took 
place in October 2015  so Im only considering in this decision his complaint about 
Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims that were made to it under section 
75 and 140A about the October 2015 purchase;
the May 2020 letter says the points were misrepresented to Mr G and his wife 
because they were advised that the product was of some substance and that the 
purchase would be an investment as the product would increase in value and, after a 
period of a few years, they would be able to sell it at a considerable profit  but it 
says that the product is worthless and has no merit;
neither Mr G nor his representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentation was made, the conversations 
that took place or the information that was provided to Mr G his wife before their 
October 2015 purchase;
Mr G and his wife had previously bought a total of 204,001 membership points from 
the holiday company so I consider it to be reasonable to conclude that they ought to have been aware of how the membership and the points operated before they 
entered into the agreement to buy another 46,000 points in October 2015;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
represented to Mr G and his wife that the additional points were an investment, that 
the points were misrepresented to them by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the purchase agreement by any such misrepresentations;
the May 2020 letter also says that the holiday company has ceased to trade and has 
committed a repudiatory breach of contract but Ive seen no evidence to show that 
the holiday company has stopped trading and Im not persuaded that theres been a 
breach of contract by the holiday company for which Barclays Partner Finance would 
be liable under section 75;
the May 2020 letter says that the loan was unaffordable for Mr G and his complaint 
form says that the holiday company and Barclays Partner Finance failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan  but the evidence provided by 
Mr G includes the credit applications that were made by him and his wife;
Mr G and his wife had signed the credit applications and confirmed that they were 
home-owners, with no mortgage, that Mr G was employed with a gross annual 
income of £40,000, and that his wife had an income of £10,000;
Mr G also signed the customer compliance statement in which he confirmed: l/we 
are confident that from an income perspective  the repayments will be met now 
and in the future;
the loan was made to Mr G in October 2015 but Ive seen no evidence to show that 
he asked Barclays Partner Finance for any information about the affordability 
assessment that it conducted before his representatives May 2020 letter and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have raised any concerns 
about the affordability assessment before then;
Barclays Partner Finance hasnt provided any further information about the 
affordability checks that it conducted at that time but I consider that it would have 
been reasonable for it to have concluded on the basis of the information that Mr G 
and his wife had provided that Mr G could afford a loan with a monthly repayment of 
£125.80;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mr G, that Barclays Partner Finance should have done more to assess 
the affordability of the loan for him, that the loan was mis-sold to him or that Barclays 
Partner Finance has acted incorrectly in connection with the loan;
Mr Gs complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured him and his 
wife into entering into the purchase agreement and him into entering into the loan 
agreement - but Mr G and his wife had signed the form about their right to withdraw 
from the purchase agreement within 14 days without giving any reason and Mr G 
confirmed in the customer compliance statement that he signed that he understood 
the right to withdraw from the loan agreement and how and when he might exercise 
that right  but Ive seen no evidence to show that he contacted either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance to withdraw from either the purchase 
agreement or the loan agreement within the applicable withdrawal periods;
Mr G and his wife signed those agreements in October 2015 but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that they complained to either the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the undue pressure that Mr G claims was applied to them until 
his representatives May 2020 letter  if they had been unduly pressured into signing 
the purchase agreement and didnt want to buy the additional points, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted either the holiday company or 
Barclays Partner Finance about that issue sooner that they did;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr G and his wife were 
unduly pressurised into entering into the purchase agreement or that Mr G was 
unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them;
the May 2020 letter says that commission was paid between Barclays Partner 
Finance and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr G which created a 
breach of fiduciary duty and caused an unfair relationship and Mr Gs complaint form 
says that Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which 
wasnt declared to him - but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what 
commission, if any, was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 15% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr G 
risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr Gs representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses  but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in the agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr G and his wife and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr G and Barclays 
Partner Finance;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Gs relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr G and Barclays 
Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Mr Gs claims so I 
cant say that its response to his claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had 
properly responded to his claims I consider that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for it not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mr G for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership points and the health and other difficulties that hes described, but I find 
that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance to refund to him any of the money that hes paid under the 
loan agreement, to cancel the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 October 2023.
