Miss B has said Sunny did not identify  that she was dependant  on payday loans. She has 
said Sunny  didnt carry out appropriate affordability checks. Sunny has said it undertook 
eligibility, creditworthiness  and affordability checks. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Bs complaint  in part and said loans 6 to 8 should not have 
been given. Sunny disagreed but it did agree to make an offer on loans 7 and 8. Miss B 
rejected its offer so the complaint has now been passed to me to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN08738362the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint.
A proportionate  check for loan 5 would  most  likely have shown that Miss B was having  
trouble in managing her money. Miss Bs credit report showed that she had a number of 
existing short-term credit commitments when she applied for loan 5. It was clear from this 
that Miss B wasnt using  these high-cost loans to deal with a short-term cashflow problem. 
So, in these circumstances,  Sunny  ought to have realised it was unlikely Miss B wouldve 
been able to sustainably repay loan 5  and any subsequent loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Bs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss B was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss B had taken out six loans  within  seven months and Miss B 
had been indebted  to Sunny for months. So Sunny ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Miss B was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying 
her previous loan was leaving  in her finances  and that Miss Bs indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
From  loan 6 onwards  Miss B was provided with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. 
Ref: DRN08738363Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan 8 was 
taken out just over seven months after Miss Bs first. And it was for a larger  amount. 
Miss B had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.
I think that Miss B lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Bs ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept him/her  in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So I am upholding the complaint about loans 5 to 8 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 5 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Miss Bs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 8 should be removed from 
Miss Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Bs complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 March  2020.
