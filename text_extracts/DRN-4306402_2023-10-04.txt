The complaint
Mrs B complains that Tandem Personal Loans Limited wont refund to her the money that 
she paid for some holiday club membership credits. Her friend is also involved in her 
complaint and shes being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs B and a friend entered into a membership application agreement to buy 1,000 holiday 
club membership credits from a holiday company in May 2018. The membership price was 
£3,975 and Mrs B also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a finance provider for a 
loan of that amount. She agreed to make 35 monthly repayments of £137.50 and a final 
payment of £137.35 to the finance provider. 
Mrs B and her friend wrote to the holiday company in March 2020 to cancel their 
membership because the monthly payment was too much and they hadnt taken a holiday 
with the holiday company since theyd bought the membership. The cancellation wasnt 
accepted. Mrs B phoned the finance provider and complained that the credits were mis-sold 
to her and her friend and the loan wasnt affordable. The finance provider didnt uphold her 
complaint and said that the loan application was auto-accepted based on the information it 
had at that time which showed that Mrs B had over £300 in disposable income available.
Mrs Bs representative then made claims, on behalf of Mrs B, to the finance provider under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in August 2020. It said that the 
product was misrepresented to Mrs B and her friend; the contract was breached; 
commission was paid between the finance provider and the holiday company which wasnt 
disclosed to Mrs B which created a breach of fiduciary duty and caused an unfair 
relationship; and the loan was unaffordable. 
The finance provider didnt uphold those claims. It said that: all customers attend a video 
recorded compliance interview with a compliance manager where every aspect of the 
purchase is explained to them prior to signing all of the documentation; the value of the 
membership was in the experiences and holidays taken and the credits werent marketed as 
anything other than credits which can be exchanged for rights of occupation and use in a 
unit of accommodation or a yacht or use of other lifestyle products; a new management 
company had been appointed and was able to fully service Mrs Bs contract and her 
membership and at no time had Mrs Bs rights of use and occupation been affected by the 
liquidation of the previous management company so there had been no breach of contract; 
and there was no commission arrangement between it and the holiday company.
Mrs B wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. Mrs Bs 
complaint form says that the holiday company and the finance provider failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan; the finance provider paid a commission to 
the holiday company which wasnt declared to her and the holiday company unduly 
pressured her and her friend into entering into the membership application agreement and 
her into entering into the loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement unfair pursuant to 
section 140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Bs complaint should be upheld as he didnt 
think that the finance providers decision to turn down her claims was unfair or unreasonable. 
He wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and he didnt 
think that the holiday company had breached the contract. He said that he hadnt seen 
enough to suggest that the relationship between Mrs B and the finance provider was unfair 
and he wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was 
unfair. He also said that he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was 
unaffordable for Mrs B.
Mrs Bs representative, on behalf of Mrs B, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It says that the product was sold as an investment and the credits could be 
rented out and an income obtained. It has provided a generic submission from counsel about 
the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses and it says that non-payment of 
maintenance fees results in the cancellation of the membership but not the finance 
agreement and there are significant hidden charges and liabilities found within the 
documents which makes the relationship unfair. It has also raised its serious concerns about 
the way that the finance was sold to Mrs B and says that the holiday company didnt broker 
proper credit and failed to meet the standard of a regulated firm.
Mrs Bs loan was transferred to another finance provider in August 2022 and since then it 
has been transferred to Tandem Personal Loans.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Bs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mrs B and her friend entered into a membership application agreement in May 2018 
to buy 1,000 holiday club membership credits and they signed a standard information 
form which says that the product was:  a short-term membership with 1,000 
[credits] giving members access to the benefits available within the  Club;
they also signed other documents including an initial disclosure document, a 
separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given and an exchange 
contract, and Mrs B electronically signed the loan agreement and confirmed that 
shed seen and read the pre-contract credit information and the loan explanation 
documents;
Mrs B and her friend wrote to the holiday company in March 2020 and said that they 
wanted to cancel their membership but the standard information form that theyd 
signed says: The Membership Application is subject to the timeshare contract rules 
and therefore may be terminated within the withdrawal period  After the expiry of 
such withdrawal period the contract may not be terminated. However, each of the 
benefits referred to in Part 1 will expire in accordance with the Terms and Conditions 
applicable to each;
Mrs B and her friend had signed the separate standard form of the withdrawal notice 
that could be given which made it clear that they could withdraw from the 
membership application agreement within 14 days without giving any reason;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs B and her friend exercised their right to 
withdraw from that agreement during the withdrawal period and I dont consider that 
they had the right to cancel the agreement when they wrote to the holiday company 
in March 2020;Mrs Bs representative made claims to the finance provider in August 2020 and 
Mrs B then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter refers to claims under 
sections 75 and 140A, including that the credits were misrepresented to Mrs B and 
her friend, but her complaint form only refers to claims under section 140A and 
doesnt refer to a misrepresentation made by the holiday company;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Bs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not the finance 
providers response to her claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mrs Bs representatives August 2020 letter says the credits were misrepresented to 
Mrs B and her friend because they were advised that the product was of some 
substance and that the purchase would be an investment as the product would 
increase in value and, after a period of a few years, they would be able to sell it at a 
considerable profit  but it says that the product is worthless and has no merit;
Mrs B says that she and her friend were told that the credits could be redeemed 
when they wanted to book a holiday  and that they could only book a studio 
apartment at the resort but could also book any other resort or hotel owned by the 
holiday company  and if they didnt want their week they could ask friends and 
family to take a holiday and charge them but they didnt know anyone that would be 
interested as it wouldnt be cost effective as they had to eat at the resort which was 
very expensive and they would have to hire a car because it was so isolated;
the credits can be exchanged for rights of occupation and use in a unit of 
accommodation or a yacht or use of other lifestyle products so I dont consider that 
theyre worthless and neither Mrs B nor her representative has provided a detailed 
account of the circumstances in which Mrs B and her friend were told that the credits 
were an investment, the conversations that took place at that time or the information 
that was provided to Mrs B and her friend;
there was no reference in the letter that Mrs B and her friend wrote to the holiday 
company in March 2020 to the credits having been misrepresented to them as an 
investment and the holiday company says that all customers attend a video recorded 
compliance interview with a compliance manager where every aspect of the 
purchase is explained to them prior to signing all of the documentation;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
represented to Mrs B and her friend that the credits were an investment, that the 
credits were misrepresented to them by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the membership application agreement by any such 
misrepresentations;
the August 2020 letter also says that the holiday company has ceased to trade and 
has committed a repudiatory breach of contract - the finance provider said that a new 
management company had been appointed and was able to fully service Mrs Bs 
contract and her membership and at no time had Mrs Bs rights of use and 
occupation been affected by the liquidation of the previous management company so 
there had been no breach of contract;
I consider that the liquidation of the holiday company would be a breach of contract 
for which Tandem Personal Loans would now be liable under section 75 - but I also consider the appointment of the new management company to have been a suitable 
remedy for that breach of contract, and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs B and 
her friends use of their credits has been adversely impacted by the liquidation of the 
holiday company and Im not persuaded that they would be entitled to terminate the 
membership application agreement in these circumstances;
Mrs B and her friend said in March 2020 that they hadnt taken a holiday with the 
holiday company since theyd bought the membership but the credits were available 
for them to use so it was their choice not to use them and Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract by the 
holiday company for which Tandem Personal Loans would now be liable under 
section 75;
the August 2020 letter says that commission was paid between the finance provider 
and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mrs B which created a breach of 
fiduciary duty and caused an unfair relationship and Mrs Bs complaint form says that 
the finance provider paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt 
declared to her;
the finance provider says that there was no commission arrangement between it and 
the holiday company and Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that any 
commission was paid by the finance provider to the holiday company;
the August 2020 letter also says that the loan was unaffordable for Mrs B and her 
complaint form says that the holiday company and the finance provider failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan  and Mrs B said in the 
March 2020 letter to the holiday company that she hadnt even realised that shed 
taken out a loan;
the finance provider said that the loan application was auto-accepted based on the 
information it had at that time which showed that Mrs B had over £300 in disposable 
income available and it also said that a full credit and affordability check was 
completed, Mrs B met its lending criteria so the application was conditionally 
accepted, and she then signed the loan agreement;
Mrs B had signed a document which said that she agreed to apply for a loan from the 
finance provider where payment needed to be covered in 36 months and she 
electronically signed the loan agreement in May 2018 and confirmed that shed seen 
and read the pre-contract credit information and the loan explanation documents, she 
also electronically signed a direct debit mandate and had made monthly payments of 
£137.50 to the finance provider, so I consider that she ought reasonably to have 
known that shed entered into a loan agreement with the finance provider;
the loan explanation documents said: It is important that you only enter into this 
agreement if you can comfortably afford the payments, and are not aware of any 
potential changes in your circumstances that could affect your ability to make the 
payments in the future;
Mrs B phoned the finance provider six times between March and July 2020 about her 
loan and she said in July 2020 that she couldnt afford the loan  she provided 
information about her income and expenditure which showed that she had a monthly 
disposable income at that time of £681 so she agreed to leave the amount of her 
monthly loan repayment unchanged and the finance provider provided her with 
contact details for a debt charity and a citizens advice bureau;
the finance provider hasnt provided any further information about the affordability 
checks that it conducted before the loan was made to Mrs B but I dont consider that 
Mrs B has provided enough evidence about her financial situation in May 2018 to 
show that a loan with monthly repayments of £137.50 wasnt affordable for her at that time and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the finance 
provider should have done more to assess the affordability of the loan for her, that 
the loan was mis-sold to her or that the finance provider has acted incorrectly in 
connection with the loan;
the finance provider was required to respond to any financial difficulties that Mrs B 
was experiencing positively and sympathetically  and I consider that its response to 
the phone call that Mrs B made to it in July 2020 shows that it responded to her 
financial situation positively and sympathetically;
Mrs Bs loan has now been transferred to Tandem Personal Loans and its also 
required to respond to any financial difficulties that Mrs B is experiencing positively 
and sympathetically  so if Mrs B is having difficulties with her monthly loan 
repayments, I suggest that she contacts Tandem Personal Loans and explains those 
difficulties to it; 
Mrs Bs complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured her and her 
friend into entering into the membership application agreement and her into entering 
into the loan agreement but if they had been unduly pressured into entering into the 
membership application agreement and didnt want to buy the credits, I consider that 
it would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted either the holiday company 
or the finance provider within the applicable withdrawal period to withdraw from the 
agreement;
the loan agreement clearly set out Mrs Bs right to withdraw from the loan agreement 
within 14 days without giving any reason but Ive seen no evidence to show that she 
contacted the finance provider within the withdrawal period to withdraw from the loan 
agreement;
there was no reference in the letter that Mrs B and her friend wrote to the holiday 
company in March 2020 to the holiday company unduly pressuring them and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs B and her friend were 
unduly pressurised into entering into the membership application agreement or that 
Mrs B was unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the 
holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mrs Bs representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses and it says that non-payment of 
maintenance fees results in the cancellation of the membership but not the finance 
agreement and there are significant hidden charges and liabilities found within the 
documents which makes the relationship unfair  but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in the agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mrs B and her friend and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mrs B and the finance 
provider;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs Bs relationship 
with the finance provider was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs B and the finance 
provider in these circumstances;I sympathise with Mrs B for the issues that she and her friend have had with their 
membership credits but I consider that the finance providers responses to the claims 
that had been made to it were fair and reasonable in the circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Tandem Personal Loans 
to refund to Mrs B any of the money that shes paid under the loan agreement, to 
cancel the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action 
in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 November 2023.
