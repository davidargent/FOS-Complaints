K821x#15Complaint
Ms W complains about the way Interactive Investor  Services Limited (IISL) handled her 
request to transfer  her Deferred Annuity pension into a Self-Invested  Personal  Pension 
(SIPP).
Background
Ms W had a Deferred Annuity pension which she wanted to transfer  into a SIPP managed  by 
IISL and contacted it in late 2017. There were problems with the collation and processing of 
the required paperwork, and the associated delays ultimately led to Ms W cancelling  the 
transfer request  prior to it being completed.
Ms W complained to IISL about the delays, the lost paperwork and the poor customer  
service and wanted the administration  fee she paid to be refunded.  IISL acknowledged the 
complaint but didnt  send her a final response. So Ms W complained to our service. In 
addition to her complaint  about the administration and poor customer  service, she also said 
this had led to lost investment opportunities.
IISL responded to our investigation by partially upholding her complaint. It acknowledged  
that it had provided  Ms W with extremely poor customer service  and had failed to clarify the 
outstanding issues  with the transfer  request. It offered £500 compensation. But it didnt think 
Ms W had been prevented from trading because her funds had always  remained with her 
current provider, so it didnt offer compensation for this aspect of the complaint. Unhappy 
with this, Ms W brought  her complaint to this service.
Our investigator thought the offer of £500 for the distress and inconvenience caused  to her 
by IISL was reasonable, and that in addition she should be refunded the £120  administration 
fee she had paid. And having seen evidence of her intended fund choice and financial 
advisers recommendation,  he also thought  Ms W had lost the opportunity  to invest her 
funds. To remedy this, he thought IISL should calculate the value of Ms Ws account from six 
weeks after she first arranged the transfer,  until she cancelled it on 19 March 2018. He said 
IISL should  then work out the difference between  this value,  and the value the fund would 
have had should it have been invested  in a medium risk fund as per Ms Ws wishes. And 
should it find Ms W would  have incurred a loss, this should be paid to her.
Ms W agreed with this outcome, but IISL did not. It said it was willing  to transfer  the £120 
administration fee back into her SIPP account,  but this would need  to be transferred  to 
another provider  if she wanted to close her SIPP account. And it disputed the date the 
transfer was cancelled. It said it was cancelled on 31 January 2018, and it couldnt  be held 
responsible for any loss of value before or after this date. As agreement  couldnt be reached,  
the complaint  was passed to me.
I issued a provisional decision on 4 March 2021. In my provisional decision  I said:
This complaint is about the service  IISL provided  Ms W. She says the poor service  and the 
associated delays led to a loss of investment opportunity. 
 
IISL have  not disputed the service  it provided was not good and offered £500 in recognition  
of the distress and inconvenience this has caused Ms W. Initially Ms W accepted this was a 
fair amount but has most recently indicated substantially more  compensation wouldnt be 
unreasonable to her. Having considered all the evidence provided, Im currently minded to 
Ref: DRN78882182say the £500 IISL has offered is fair and reasonable for the trouble  and upset it caused  in the 
circumstances, so I wont be commenting  on this further here.
But in addition to the distress and inconvenience Ms W has experienced, I agree with the 
investigator that the poor service  provided to Ms W also caused  her financial loss. The rest 
of this decision will explain what I currently think IISL should do to put things  right. 
Refunds: I think it is fair that IISL refund  the £120 which  is in Ms Ws trading account. This 
was a fee used to set up the SIPP, which was ultimately  not needed and cancelled. I havent  
seen any reason why this cant  be refunded  directly  to Ms W, so this should be done  and the 
account closed.  Ms W has been  without  access  to these funds, so interest on this amount 
should also be paid as set out below. 
For the same reason,  I also think it is fair and reasonable to also refund the £10 remaining in 
the SIPP account. IISL have said this isnt possible  due to the rules  of the pension, and it 
could only be transferred into another pension. I dont think Ms W should lose out on this 
amount, so if possible, I think IISL should transfer  this into Ms Ws new SIPP  without charge, 
or alternatively should pay her £10 directly and cover any penalty  imposed by HMRC on this 
amount.
Loss of investment opportunity: there appears  to have been a misunderstanding, by IISL 
and the investigator, about  the nature of the funds Ms W wanted to transfer into the SIPP 
managed by IISL. For clarity, there  was no possibility of these  funds being  invested prior to 
the transfer, as the transfer  was from a deferred  annuity from a former occupational pension  
scheme. There are no funds as such associated  with the deferred  annuity that could  be 
invested before transfer. Instead,  the amount to be transferred would be based  upon an 
actuarial calculation of the value of the deferred annuity. Ms W says she wanted  to transfer 
for precisely  this reason  - to provide her with investment  control. So, because of the poor 
customer service  which  IISL has acknowledged,  and the associated  delays, I am satisfied 
there was a lost opportunity to invest.  What I need to decide,  is over what  period was this 
opportunity lost and the appropriate  investment benchmark to apply when determining any 
financial loss
Ms W has said she should be compensated  for the loss of investment opportunity until she 
opened a SIPP with an alternative provider  in October 2018. But Im afraid I dont agree with 
this. I can see that Ms W was frustrated with the problems caused by IISL, and that she 
cancelled the transfer because of these frustrations. But Im satisfied that IISL would have 
provided the SIPP required, despite the delays,  and although I cant say for sure when this 
would have happened, I dont think it would have taken until October 2018. So I dont think it 
would be fair for me to say IISL are responsible for the entire time. 
I am aware  that transfers such as this one can take some time. IISL has indicated  it can take 
6-8 weeks.  Looking at the process here,  I think  six weeks is a reasonable time to expect the 
transfer to be completed. And having looked  at the timeline, and after considering  everything 
that happened and what the parties have said about  this, I think a reasonable date for the 
start of the process would be 5 January 2018, as this is the date Ms W provided the last form 
required by IISL for the set up. So I think it is reasonable to expect it to have  been  set up by 
19 February 2018.
IISL have  said the transfer was cancelled  on 31 January 2018,  but Ive seen nothing to 
suggest this was the case. I can see however, that Ms W cancelled the transfer on 
16 March 2018  during  a telephone  call, and this was acknowledged by IISL three days  later. 
Ref: DRN78882183And as Ive said above, I dont think it would be fair to hold IISL responsible for any loss of 
investment opportunity after this date. 
So, I think it is reasonable to conclude the relevant calculation dates for the investments are 
19 February 2018  16 March 2018.  So IISL need  to use these dates when it calculates if 
Ms W has lost out financially by not being  able to transfer the value of her deferred annuity 
to the SIPP  she had requested, over this period. 
Ms W has provided  evidence that she was a medium risk investor. Ive seen nothing to 
suggest otherwise.  So I intend to say that the benchmark shown below should  be used to 
determine the investment loss. 
  
Fair compensation
My aim is that Ms W should be put as closely as possible into the position  she would 
probably now be in if the transfer had gone  as it should.
As the transfer  ultimately  didnt  occur, its difficult to know precisely what  would have 
happened to the value  of Ms Ws deferred  annuity  if it was transferred to the IISL SIPP,  but 
Im satisfied that what Ive set out below is fair and reasonable given Ms W's circumstances 
and objectives  at the time she sought to transfer.
What should IISL do?
To compensate Ms W fairly, IISL must:
Compare the performance of Ms W's investment with that of the benchmark shown. If 
the fair value  is greater  than the actual  value, there is a loss and compensation is 
payable. If the actual value is greater than the fair value, no compensation is payable.
IISL should add interest as set out below.
If there is a loss, IISL should pay into Ms W's pension plan to increase its value by 
the amount of the compensation and any interest.  The amount paid should  allow  for 
the effect of charges and any available  tax relief. Compensation  should  not be paid 
into the pension  plan if it would conflict with any existing protection  or allowance.
If IISL is unable to pay the compensation into Ms W's pension plan, it should pay that 
amount direct  to her. But had it been  possible to pay into the plan, it would have 
provided a taxable income. Therefore, the compensation  should  be reduced to 
notionally allow  for any income tax that would otherwise  have been  paid.  
The notional allowance should  be calculated using Ms W's actual or expected 
marginal rate of tax at her selected retirement age. 
For example, if Ms W is likely to be a basic rate taxpayer at the selected retirement 
age, the reduction would equal the current basic rate of tax. However, if Ms W would 
have been able to take a tax-free lump sum,  the reduction should be applied to 75% 
of the compensation.
Refund Ms W the £120  fee, plus 8% simple  interest calculated  from 16 March  2018 
to the date of settlement.
Ref: DRN78882184Transfer, without charge, the £10 from her IISL SIPP account into her new SIPP. If 
this is not possible  then it should  pay this amount directly  to her and cover any 
penalty imposed  by HMRC on this amount.
Pay Ms W £500 for the trouble and upset caused by the poor service.
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If IISL deducts  income  tax from the 
interest, it should tell Ms W how much  has been  taken off. IISL should give Ms W a tax 
deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.

Ref: DRN78882185Why is this remedy suitable?
Ive chosen this method of compensation because:
Ms W wanted  capital growth  and was willing to accept some  investment risk.
The FTSE UK Private Investors Income  total return index (prior to 1 March  2017, the 
FTSE WMA Stock  Market Income total return index) is made up of a range of indices  
with different asset classes,  mainly UK equities  and government bonds. Its a fair 
measure for someone who was prepared to take some  risk to get a higher return. 
Although it is called income index, the mix and diversification provided within the index is 
close enough to allow me to use it as a reasonable measure of comparison given Ms W's 
circumstances and risk attitude.
The response  to my provisional  decision
Ms W accepted the decision in general  terms, but provided evidence  in the form of an email 
sent by IISL dated 19 December 2017,  in which it stated that the pension transfer had 
started, and was expected to take approximately six weeks from that point.  So, she thought  
the calculation  period  should be six weeks from the date of that email,  and not from 
19 February 2018 as I had provisionally decided. 
IISL, other than acknowledging  it had received them, did not respond to either  the 
provisional decision or the additional submission from Ms W.
My findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also considered  again  my provisional  
findings in light of Ms Ws response to it. And having  done  so I am upholding Ms Ws 
complaint but am making an adjustment to my provisional calculation  dates  for the 
comparison against the benchmark  shown.
Ms W has provided  evidence that shows IISL expected the transaction to take six weeks 
from 19 December 2017. And having  looked at the timeline of events from that date I think 
Ms W has responded to its requests for the necessary documentation  in a timely  manner. I 
also consider it reasonable to assume,  that the six weeks estimated by IISL to be necessary  
to complete the transfer would have  included the timely submission of the required 
paperwork. 
So, for this reason Im satisfied that the starting date for the calculation of the comparison 
against the benchmark shown should  be 31 January 2018. And as Im still satisfied that 
Ms W requested the cancellation of the transfer  on 16 March  2018, I see no reason to depart  
from my provisional end-date for the comparison.
What should IISL do
To compensate Ms W fairly, IISL must:
Compare the performance of Ms W's investment with that of the benchmark shown. If 
the fair value  is greater  than the actual  value, there is a loss and compensation is 
payable. If the actual value is greater than the fair value, no compensation is payable.
Ref: DRN78882186IISL should add interest as set out below.
If there is a loss, IISL should pay into Ms W's pension plan to increase its value by 
the amount of the compensation and any interest.  The amount paid should  allow  for 
the effect of charges and any available  tax relief. Compensation  should  not be paid 
into the pension  plan if it would conflict with any existing protection  or allowance.
If IISL is unable to pay the compensation into Ms W's pension plan, it should pay that 
amount direct  to her. But had it been  possible to pay into the plan, it would have 
provided a taxable income. Therefore, the compensation  should  be reduced to 
notionally allow  for any income tax that would otherwise  have been  paid.  
The notional allowance should  be calculated using Ms W's actual or expected 
marginal rate of tax at her selected retirement age. 
For example, if Ms W is likely to be a basic rate taxpayer at the selected retirement 
age, the reduction would equal the current basic rate of tax. However, if Ms W would 
have been able to take a tax-free lump sum,  the reduction should be applied to 75% 
of the compensation.
Refund Ms W the £120  fee, plus 8% simple  interest calculated  from 16 March  2018 
to the date of settlement.
Transfer, without charge, the £10 from her IISL SIPP account into her new SIPP. If 
this is not possible  then it should  pay this amount directly  to her and cover any 
penalty imposed  by HMRC on this amount.
Pay Ms W £500 for the trouble and upset caused by the poor service.
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If IISL deducts  income  tax from the 
interest, it should tell Ms W how much  has been  taken off. IISL should give Ms W a tax 
deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
