K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that Active Securities  Limited  (trading as 247Moneybox) gave him loans that 
were unaffordable.
background
During 2013, 2016 and 2017 Mr C borrowed nine payday loans from 247Moneybox, as 
follows:
Loan No Amount Date  lent Date repaid
1 £60 1 February 2013 5 March 2013
2 £60 29 December 2016 27 January 2017
3 £80 30 January 2017 25 February 2017
4 £155 2 March 2017 25 March  2017
5 £230 27 March  2017 27 April 2017
6 £295 27 April 2017 26 May 2017
7 £408 26 May 2017 27 June  2017
8 £385 28 June  2017 27 July 2017
9 £499 1 August 2017 25 August  2017
Each of the loans  was repaid in full and on time. 
Mr C believes  that 247Moneybox  was wrong  to lend to him on multiple occasions and, 
generally, by increasing amounts. He feels that, had proper affordability  checks  been carried  
out, it wouldve  been evident  that the loans  werent  affordable to him.
247Moneybox believes  that it did undertake sufficient checks before each loan and had 
satisfied itself that the loans were affordable on each occasion. 
Our adjudicator felt that the checks carried out by 247Moneybox for loans 1 to 5 inclusive 
were sufficient but that they didnt go far enough for loans 6 to 9 inclusive. As such, she 
recommended that some  compensation  be paid to Mr C in relation  to the last four loans.
Mr C has offered no objection to the adjudicators  opinion, but 247Moneybox hasnt 
responded. In these  circumstances the complaint has been  passed to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
247Moneybox was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make checks to see whether 
Mr C could afford to pay back the loan before  it lent to him. Those checks  needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr C was borrowing and his lending  history, but 
there was no set list of checks that 247Moneybox  had to do.
Before each Loan, 247Moneybox asked Mr C for details of his income and expenditure. It 
then applied a buffer  of 55%, meaning  that it wouldnt  lend more  than 45% of his monthly 
disposable income. In addition,  when  he applied for loan 3, the lender asked Mr C 
Ref: DRN21141812specifically to let it know if there  was any reason  why he shouldnt enter into the loan 
agreement, including other  payday loans. Mr C didnt offer any further information. 
247Moneybox has told us that its credit scoring  threshold was exceeded on each loan 
application, although I havent seen  the results of this. It also carried  out employment  
verification with Mr Cs employer. 
loan 1
Mr Cs first loan was for a relatively modest  amount and I think it wouldve been reasonable 
for 247Moneybox  to rely upon the information that hed provided to it.
loans 2 and 3
There was a gap of over three years between loan 1 being repaid and Mr C borrowing again  
from 247Moneybox. I think this is a sufficiently long period  of time for 247Moneybox to 
reasonably consider that Mr Cs financial circumstances may well have changed. 
Loans 2 and 3 were, once again,  of relatively  modest value compared to Mr Cs declared  
income of around  £1,300. As Mr C had stated his regular monthly  outgoings to be around 
£650, this implied  he had monthly disposable  income of over £600. I think that, in these  
circumstances, the checks that the lender carried out were sufficient. 
loan 4
Loan 4 was for a higher  amount  and was granted very shortly after repayment  of the 
previous borrowing.  Mr C said that his monthly income was £1,285 against which he had 
expenditure of £654, giving disposable  income of £631 with which to repay this loan at £185.
Whilst this was the third consecutive month  that Mr C had borrowed from 247Moneybox,  the 
loan repayment  wouldve  appeared affordable  based upon the information Mr C had 
provided. I can see that the questions the lender did ask of Mr C included details of his credit 
commitments, and I think that its checks were proportionate in the circumstances. 
loan 5
Loan 5 was taken just two days after repayment of loan 4 and was, once more, for an 
increased amount.  Given this was now the fourth consecutive month that Mr C had borrowed 
from it, and because the amount borrowed had increased month on month, I think that 
247Moneybox ought  to have been concerned that he perhaps wasnt using these payday  
loans in the manner for which they were  intended  (as providing a temporary solution to a 
short term cash flow issue). 
I think that, in these circumstances, 247Moneybox  shouldve sought information about,  not 
just Mr Cs regular income  and expenditure, but also details of any other short term loan 
commitments he mightve had. I cant see that it did this and so it follows  that I dont  think  its 
checks here went far enough.
Having concluded  this, I must then consider whether  the better checks that I think were  
proportionate might have led the lender to come to any different decision.  Ive looked at 
Mr Cs bank statements from the time and can see no evidence that he had any other short  
term loans at that time. As such I think that, if 247Moneybox had asked Mr C for details of 
Ref: DRN21141813other short term loan commitments it would, most likely, still have considered  this loan to be 
affordable. Therefore I dont believe that it was wrong to provide the loan.
loans 6 to 9
Loans 6 and 7 were  each drawn on the same day that the previous loans were  repaid and 
they were,  as before, for increasing amounts. Against this background I think  that 
247Moneybox should,  by that time, have been questioning whether it could rely upon the 
information that Mr C was providing to it. I feel that, for each of these loans, it shouldve 
independently verified the information  through a comprehensive review of Mr Cs financial 
situation. There are a number of ways in which this couldve  been  done such as asking for 
copies of wage  slips, bills or bank statements etc. I cant  see that it did this, and so I dont 
think that its checks were sufficient.
Ive looked at Mr Cs bank statements and can see that, at the time he applied for loan 6, his 
actual income was £1,150 and he had normal expenditure  of over £720 which implies he 
had disposable  income of £430 with which to service his borrowings. The repayment 
required for loan 6 was £366. Whilst it mightve appeared to 247Moneybox that the loan 
should be affordable, it wouldve left Mr C with a surplus of only approximately  £64 for the 
month. If he then had any unexpected, or unaccounted,  expenses  - of even a negligible 
amount - its likely that hed have been left with no disposable income. 
I dont think that these financial circumstances justify a conclusion that the loan was 
sustainably affordable. And I think that if 247Moneybox had seen this position it wouldnt,  as 
a responsible lender, have agreed to provide this loan to Mr C.
Ive also reviewed Mr Cs bank statements for loans 7 to 9 and can see that his financial 
position didnt  appear to improve.  In fact it seems to have  deteriorated,  with loans being 
taken from other short  term lenders alongside 247Moneybox.
Against income  of £1,310  at the time of loan 7, Mr C had regular expenditure of at least 
£800, in addition to which he had other short term loans of £200 plus interest  to settle.  I dont 
think, in these circumstances, that the repayment  of £516 attaching to loan 7 could be 
considered affordable. 
Loan 8 was given on the day following repayment of the prior loan. I can see that, in the 
preceding month,  Mr Cs income  was £1,307 and he had regular expenditure of over £650, 
together with short  term financial  commitments  to lenders other than 247Moneybox of £338.  
I think that, had 247Moneybox carried  out the better  checks that I consider to be 
proportionate it wouldve  seen that its proposed loan repayment  of £477 was unaffordable.
When he applied for loan 9, I can see from Mr Cs bank statement that his income  in the 
month before was £1,275.  His regular  expenditure was at least  £800 and he had other short 
term credit  commitments  of £300.  Here  again I think that, if itd done  better  checks, 
247Moneybox wouldve  seen that its loan repayment of £599  wasnt affordable.
In summary,  I think that 247Moneyboxs checks for loans 1 to 4 were proportionate and that 
it wasnt wrong to provide  these to Mr C. 
I dont believe that its checks went far enough  for loan 5 but I  think  that, even if it had 
undertaken better checks, it would most likely have still decided to make  the loan. I dont 
therefore think it was wrong to provide  this loan. 
Ref: DRN21141814But, for the reasons outlined above, I dont think that it was right to provide loans 6 to 9 
inclusive, and so it must  pay some  compensation to Mr C.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Cs complaint in part. To put things right Active 
Securities Limited should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 6 to 9 inclusive;
pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the dates of settlement;
remove any adverse information  about  these loans from Mr Cs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Active Securities Limited to take off tax from this interest. 
Active Securities Limited must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if 
he asks for one.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 February  2019.
