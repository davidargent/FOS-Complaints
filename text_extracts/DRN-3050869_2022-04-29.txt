The complaint
Miss C has complained about loans given to her by Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 
118 Money. Shes complained using a claims management company (CMC) but for ease Ill 
refer mainly to Miss C.
What happened
Miss C has applied for and received several loans from 118 Money as shown below. She 
says that 118 Money didnt carry out sufficient checks on her applications. If it had, she says 
it ought to have refused to lend to her as the loans were unaffordable.

Loan 5 15/12/18 £3,056 24 months £238.77 £900
118 Money looked into her complaint and rejected it. It said it had followed its usual 
underwriting process using industry standard verification checks. It was satisfied that the 
loans were affordable for Miss C at the time.
Miss C was unhappy with 118 Moneys response, so she referred her complaint to our 
service. One of our investigators looked into it. She felt on balance, that 118 Money had 
reached a fair decision to lend Loans 1-3, but that it shouldnt have agreed to Loans 4 and 5. 
She asked 118 Money to put matters right.
Miss C accepted what our investigator said, but 118 Money didnt. It agreed with her 
comments regarding Loans 1-3, but maintained it was fair for it to lend Loans 4 and 5 too. 
118 Money said there was no evidence that Miss C was credit hungry as her balance to 
limit ratio on her existing credit remained steady between Loans 3 and 5.
As there was no agreement, the complaint has been passed to me for review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As theres now no dispute between the parties regarding Loans 1-3, Ill not comment further 
on the decision to agree those loans and will focus solely on the lending decisions for Loans 
4 and 5. It is important to acknowledge the earlier loans however, as they have a bearing on 
my decision on the later ones.
Weve set out our approach to complaints about unaffordable lending on our website  
including the key relevant rules, guidance, good industry practice and law. Ive considered 
this approach when deciding this complaint.
 
118 Money needed to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to ensure that it didnt 
lend to Miss C irresponsibly. Its not about 118 Money assessing the likelihood of it being 
repaid, but it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on her. There is no set list of 
checks it had to do, but it could take into account several different things such as the amount 
and length of the loan, the amount of the monthly repayments and Miss Cs overall 
circumstances.
Taking all that into account, I think a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to 
have been more thorough where:
a customer has a low income (because it may make it more difficult to make loan 
payments of a set amount from a low level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (because it may be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment for a particular level of income);
the longer the term of the loan (because the total cost of the credit is likely to be 
higher, and the customer is obliged to make payments for a longer period); and
the greater the number and frequency of loans and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (because the risk of repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing has become or was becoming 
unsustainable).
118 Money had agreed three loans for Miss C between November 2015 and September 
2017 as can be seen above. Loan 1 was repaid in full on 30 March 2016. Loan 2 was for 
£2,000 and was drawn in January 2017 to be repaid over two years. In September 2017, 
Miss C applied for an extra £750  Loan 3. Despite making repayments, the amount she 
borrowed increased to £2,323 over two years. So she increased her indebtedness both in 
terms of the amount borrowed and the term over which the debt would last. The repayment 
increased by £30 a month too.
Just six months later, Miss C applied for Loan 4 to release a further £750 and repay Loan 3. 
Again, the loan was to run two years and repayments were increasing a little over £30. While 
shed made repayments to Loan 3 the balance hadnt reduced significantly, so the effect of 
this new loan was to increase her overall indebtedness in amount and term as she had 
earlier.
I think this ought to have led to 118 Money seeking to get a fuller understanding of Miss Cs 
financial situation. It seems shed not proven an ability to sustainably repay the money shed 
already borrowed up to that point. I say this because shed borrowed £2,000 just over a year 
earlier and owed more than that due to a top up, despite making the required repayments. 
Effectively, shed borrowed back in a top up, a proportion of what shed repaid without 
making inroads into the outstanding debt. 
Ive already mentioned that 118 Money had a duty to ensure Miss C could afford to repay the 
loan sustainably - that is, she should be able to repay the credit without undue difficulty, 
while being able to meet other commitments and without having to borrow further. 
I dont think Miss Cs track record with 118 Money has demonstrated an ability to sustainably 
repay what shes borrowed.
If 118 Money had sought to gain a better understanding of Miss Cs finances, it might have 
done so by asking to see some bank statements. If it had, it would have seen that in 
February 2018, Miss C received £1,146 from her employer, and in March 2018 she received 
£902. The statements reveal a monthly debit which appears to be to a family member for £300 with the reference loan, as well as payments to other creditors, and payments to a 
previous employer for overpaid salary.
In its assessment notes, 118 Money says it believed Miss C earned less than shed quoted 
on her application and based its assessment on her earning £1,304.35 each month. It 
calculated her expenditure as £1,008 per month so believed she had £295 disposable 
income from which to meet the required £183 repayment. But as Ive said, Miss Cs bank 
statements show the income figure 118 Money had arrived at was significantly more than 
Miss C had received in the preceding two months alone. Based on the income received to 
her account, I dont think the loan was affordable for Miss C. 
For the reasons Ive set out, I think 118 Money ought to have refused to lend Loan 4 to 
Miss C as there was sufficient evidence that it was unlikely to be sustainable for her.
By loan 5, 118 Money said it believed Miss Cs income to be £1,500 per month and her 
expenditure £1,031, leaving a disposable income of £468 from which to pay the instalment of 
£239. The bank statements shes provided for the three months prior to the application for 
Loan 5, dont show her income. They do show a total of £2,100 coming in from another 
credit provider with references of furniture and Christmas. But the debits for those months 
dont show expenditure of that nature, simply repayments to other creditors such as credit 
cards and 118 Money. The statements also show a direct debit for £40 to another finance 
agreement being reversed after it took her account overdrawn.
Again, theres a trend here of Miss C making a few payments to a loan and then seeking to 
borrow more as, it seems, her finances become tight again. 118 Money has referred to 
Miss C not being credit hungry. But for the reasons Ive set out I think it seems she sought 
to borrow further funds every few months extending her indebtedness in terms of money and 
time, without ever making inroads into the amount borrowed. Her loan with 118 Money in 
January 2017 was £2,000, but by the time this was due to have been repaid, she owed in 
excess of £3,000 and still had two years to run despite making the required payments. 
For the reasons Ive set out, I think 118 Money ought to have refused to lend Loan 5 to 
Miss C as there was sufficient evidence that it was unlikely to be sustainable for her. I say 
this because it seems she was repeatedly refinancing the loan over the same period of time.  
Putting things right
When I find that a business has done something wrong, Id normally direct that business to 
put the complainant in the position they would be in now if the mistake it made hadnt 
happened, as far as is reasonably practical. In this case, that would mean putting Miss C in 
the position she would be in now if she hadnt been given Loans 4 and 5. But Miss C was 
given the loans and used the money so its fair that she should repay what she borrowed.
So, I think 118 Money should:
Calculate the total amount Miss C received from 118 Money under Loans 4 and 5 
and deduct from that figure the repayments shes made to each.
 
oIf this results in Miss C having repaid more than she received, any 
overpayments should be refunded to her. Interest at a rate of 8% simple per 
year should be added to any overpayments from the date they were made 
until the date of settlement*.
oIf the calculation means theres still a balance for Miss C to pay, 118 Money 
should let her know how much is outstanding and reach a suitable, affordable 
payment plan with her. I remind 118 Money of its obligation to treat customers fairly. 
Remove any negative information recorded on Miss Cs credit file regarding Loans 4 
and 5.
* If 118 Money considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income tax 
from that interest, it should tell Miss C how much its taken off. It should also give Miss C a 
tax deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 
Money should put matters right as Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 May 2022.
