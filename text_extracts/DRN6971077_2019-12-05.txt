K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains PayPal  Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) says hes not eligible for a 
refund under  its Seller Protection scheme.
background
In May 2018  Mr M sold a graphics  card for £450. He received a payment from the buyer  
through PayPal,  and posted the item using a next day guaranteed delivery service. But in 
July 2018 PayPal concluded  that the payment sent to Mr M hadnt  been authorised by the 
account holder,  in other words that it was a fraudulent payment. PayPal reimbursed the 
payment to the account holder, and took this amount from Mr Ms PayPal account. 
Mr M was unhappy about this and complained to PayPal. PayPal said the payment wasnt  
covered under its Seller Protection scheme,  which can protect  sellers  against losses 
resulting from unauthorised activity.
 
Mr M said hed paid a fee to PayPal, and so he should have Seller Protection and be 
refunded. But PayPal told Mr M it had resolved this issue, and so he asked  our service to 
investigate. He told us hed like PayPal to put things right by refunding  him £450  and 
admitting that its lack of security allowed the fraudulent payment.
 
PayPal told our service it couldnt  refund Mr M. It said the payment in question hadnt 
included a shipping  address, so its system  had automatically marked  it as ineligible  for Seller 
Protection. It said this was in line with the Seller Protection eligibility criteria in its terms and 
conditions. PayPal said it was for Mr M to check that the payment was eligible before he 
posted the item, and that he would  have been  able to see it wasnt  eligible on his PayPal  
transaction details  screen.  
Mr M told us he wasnt aware of this screen.  He provided a copy  of the email exchange 
between himself and the buyer, in which the buyer  provided a shipping address  before 
making payment.  Mr M also provided a post office receipt as proof of postage. Our 
investigator used the post office  receipt to trace the delivery, and saw the item was delivered 
to the shipping address the buyer had given Mr M. 
After looking into things,  our investigator  didnt  uphold  Mr Ms complaint. She thought this 
payment hadnt  met PayPals Seller Protection criteria,  because a shipping  address hadnt 
been included  with the payment and so the payment had been marked as ineligible on 
Mr Ms PayPal  account. 
Mr M disagreed. He said hed paid a fee to PayPal and that hed been left out of pocket even 
though hed done nothing  wrong. So our investigator asked PayPal for more information  
about the fee Mr M had paid as well as the fraudulent payment. PayPal confirmed Seller 
Protection was a free service and that the fee Mr M had paid was its usual  payment  
processing fee. And it said the fraudulent payment wasnt its fault.
Our investigator reconsidered Mr Ms complaint. She said there was no evidence to suggest  
the fraudulent  payment was caused by PayPal. But there was evidence the item had been 
sent and delivered,  so it wasnt  reasonable for PayPal to refuse Seller  Protection  just 
because there wasnt  a shipping address on its system. She said PayPal should  therefore 
reassess Mr Ms claim  under its Seller Protection scheme. 
Ref: DRN69710772PayPal disagreed and maintained that it had acted in line with its terms and conditions. So 
this complaint was passed to me to make a decision. I asked PayPal why it needed the 
payment to include shipping details, and what it did with this information.  PayPal said that to 
be eligible for Seller Protection, a payment must be marked as eligible and the seller  must 
post their item to the shipping  address shown on the transaction details screen. It said it 
used that shipping address information  to check the item had been delivered.  
Mr M confirmed that in June 2018,  around the time PayPal  was investigating the 
unauthorised payment,  he emailed PayPal a copy of his proof of postage along with a copy 
of the email exchange hed had with the buyer.  And Mr M gave us evidence  to support this. 
Ive now gone  on to make my decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im upholding it.
PayPal says its Seller Protection is a free service but that in this case Mr M isnt eligible for it 
because a shipping  address wasnt included  with the transaction,  as set out in its terms and 
conditions. PayPal says it needs the shipping address to be included with the payment so it 
can check if an item has been delivered.
I understand what PayPal  is saying about  its terms and conditions.  But my role here is to 
decide what is a fair and reasonable outcome  for Mr Ms complaint. And I dont think its fair 
for PayPal  to decline Seller Protection  to Mr M in this particular case.  Ill explain why.
Ive seen that Mr M and the buyer  had an email exchange in which  the buyer gave Mr M 
their shipping address.  The buyer then sent payment, and Mr M posted the item. Ive also 
seen a copy of Mr Ms post office receipt.  It shows he posted the item to the same postcode 
the buyer gave  in their shipping address, so I think its more  likely than not that Mr M posted 
the item to the buyers full shipping address. 
Our service has traced the delivery using the tracking reference on the post office receipt. 
This shows the item was delivered to the shipping address the buyer  gave Mr M. Based on 
this, Im satisfied Mr M sent the item to the address  the buyer gave him, and that the item 
was delivered to that address. So there was a shipping address and it was provided to Mr M 
before he received payment - it just wasnt recorded  on PayPal.
Ive seen the email  Mr M sent to PayPal in June 2018, around  the time PayPal was 
investigating the unauthorised payment. In that email, Mr M gives PayPal the shipping 
address, as given  to him by the buyer, along with proof of postage to that address. 
So PayPal did have  the shipping address at the time it was investigating the payment in 
question, albeit not in exactly the place it wanted it to be recorded. And I think this was 
sufficient for PayPal to be able to check whether the item had been  delivered, which is the 
reason PayPal says it needed the shipping information in the first place.
For these reasons, I dont  think  its fair for PayPal to say Mr M isnt eligible for Seller 
Protection for this payment solely because the shipping address wasnt  recorded in a 
particular place. To put things right, PayPal should  consider  a claim for Mr M under its Seller 
Protection scheme regarding this payment.
Ref: DRN69710773But Im not asking PayPal to do anything further regarding the fraudulent payment, as Ive 
not seen enough evidence to suggest  that payment happened  because of an error on 
PayPals part.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im upholding this complaint.  PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA 
should consider  a claim for Mr M under its Seller Protection scheme regarding this payment.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 January 2020.
