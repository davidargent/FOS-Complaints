The complaint
Mr G complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money (118 118) was
irresponsible to lend to him on two occasions.
Mr G has brought his complaint to us via a complaints management company but, for
simplicity, Ill refer to him throughout.
What happened
118 118 agreed two loans for Mr G in 2021. The first was for £1,000 agreed in June, the
second was for £5,000 agreed in December. The first loan was to be repaid over a year with
monthly repayments of £105. Mr G repaid this in full the following month, paying less than
£100 in interest. The second loan is still running. The repayments are £166 a month over
five years, and Mr G has met all his payments on time to October 2022.
Mr G said that he was dependent on credit at the time each loan was taken out and 118 118
should have seen this through its checks and not agreed to lend to him.
118 118 didnt uphold Mr Gs complaint. It said that Mr G was asked to provide his income
and expenditure details on his applications, which it sense-checked with reasonable
averages. 118 118 said it also checked Mr Gs credit file to understand his expenditure
towards his existing credit and that it was satisfied it had acted correctly in agreeing these
loans for Mr G.
Mr G referred his complaint to us. Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint be
upheld because they found that Mr G had enough disposable income to meet his
repayments each time and didnt have any adverse information on his credit file.
Mr G didnt agree with this recommendation and asked for his complaint to come to an
ombudsman for a review and it came to me. I issued a provisional decision on 23 November 
explaining why I thought Mr Gs complaint should succeed and sharing the information Id 
relied on. I allowed some time for either party to comment on what Id said or provide any 
new information they wished me to consider. Ive had no response from either party. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reconsidered everything and having no new information to consider, I see no reason 
to depart from my provisional conclusions. I remain of the view that Mr Gs complaint should 
be upheld. Ill set out my reasons again in this final decision on the matter. 
As Id said in my provisional decision, Ive had regard to the regulators rules and guidance 
on responsible lending (set out in its consumer credit handbook  CONC) which lenders, 
such as 118 118, need to abide by. 118 118 will be aware of these, and our approach to this 
type of lending is set out on our website, so I wont refer to the regulations in detail here but 
will summarise and refer to them where appropriate.
Before entering into a credit agreement, 118 118 needed to check that Mr G could afford to
meet his repayments out of his usual means for the term of the loan. This means he should
be able to make his repayments without having to borrow further, while meeting existing
commitments and without experiencing adverse consequences. The checks 118 118 carried
out needed to be proportionate to the nature of the credit (the amount borrowed or the term,
for example) and to Mr Gs particular circumstances.
The overarching requirement was that 118 118 needed to pay due regard to Mr Gs interests
and treat him fairly. CONC 2.2.2G(1) gave an example of contravening this as targeting
customers with regulated credit agreements which are unsuitable for them by virtue of their
indebtedness, poor credit history, age, health, disability or any other reason.
With this in mind, my main considerations are did 118 118 complete reasonable and
proportionate checks when assessing Mr Gs application to satisfy itself that he would be
able to make his repayments without experiencing adverse consequences? If not, what
would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown and, ultimately, did 118 118 make
fair lending decisions?
118 118 carried out an income and expenditure assessment when Mr G applied for his first
loan - it recorded his monthly income as £3,694 and his total expenses as £2,981. It also
recorded that £1,831 of these expenses went towards repaying existing debt. 118 118
provided the credit file information it relied on and Ive reviewed this. It shows that Mr G had
17 active accounts and over £26,500 of existing debt. Hed taken almost £2,900 in cash
advances over the previous year.
The income and expenditure assessment for Mr Gs second loan taken out in December
2021 records that his monthly income was £4,123 and his expenses were £2,396, with
£1,113 spent on repaying existing debt. The credit file information provided by 118 118
shows that Mr G had debts of almost £27,500 and had taken out £200 of cash advances in
the previous 12 months. I note £200 was advanced from Mr Gs 118 118 credit card in
November.
As 118 118 will know, it needed to have regard to information which might indicate that a
customer is in, has recently experienced, or is likely to experience, financial difficulty. While
Mr G appeared to have sufficient disposable income to repay his loans, I think 118 118
should have seen from the information it had that it was highly likely Mr G was reliant on
credit and so wouldnt be able to meet his repayments for either loan without borrowing
further or experiencing adverse impacts on his finances.
Furthermore, I dont think a more in depth check of Mr Gs circumstances would have
provided any reassurance to 118 118 that Mr G would be able to meet his payments out of
his usual means. Mr G provided bank statements for a current account which shows
payments to more than a dozen lenders including short term lenders around the time of his 
first 118 118 loan. The statements show significant amounts of deposits and withdrawals
from the account, for example more than £55,000 was deposited in the three months prior to
the first loan with over £54,000 being withdrawn.
I dont know enough about Mr Gs circumstances to understand why he was borrowing and
spending to this extent but it clearly well exceeded his usual means. It doesnt seem to me
that Mr Gs pattern of borrowing had changed before taking out his second loan.
In summary, I dont think 118 118 treated Mr G fairly or with due regard to his interests whenit agreed to lend to him on the basis of the information it had due to his high levels of
indebtedness. I dont think further information about his circumstances would have provided
any reassurance that these loans would be suitable for Mr G. Ive concluded that 118 118 
was irresponsible to have agreed to lend to him on either occasion.
Putting things right
Ive concluded that 118118 was irresponsible to have agreed to lend to Mr G on either
occasion. So he shouldnt have to pay any interest, fees or charges associated with the
loans. 118 118 should:
refund all interest, fees and charges that Mr G paid on the loan agreed in June 2021; 
and 
cap the amount Mr G has to repay on the second loan agreed in December 2021 to 
the capital he borrowed, in other words £5,000; and 
oIf Mr G has paid more than this then 118 118 needs to refund these 
overpayments to him along with 8% simple interest per annum* from the date 
of payment to the date of settlement of this complaint. In this case 118 118 
needs to remove any adverse information about this loan from Mr Gs credit 
file; or 
oIf Mr G has not yet repaid the capital, then 118 118 needs to treat Mr G fairly 
and with forbearance and due consideration regarding his outstanding capital 
balance. This may mean coming to an affordable repayment plan with him. 
Once the loan capital has been repaid, then 118 118 should remove any 
adverse information about this loan from Mr Gs credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires 118118 to take off tax from this interest. 118118 must 
give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I am upholding Mr Gs complaint about Madison CF UK
Limited trading as 118 118 Money and it now needs to take the above steps to put things
right for him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 January 2023.
