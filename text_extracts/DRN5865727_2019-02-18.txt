K821x#15complaint
Mr A has complained that Link Financial Outsourcing Limited is chasing him for repayment 
of a debt of over £300,000. Mr A says that Link has already  acknowledged  that he agreed 
with the original creditor in 2015 that he would repay £36,000.
background
Mr A had a mortgage with a bank. The account fell into arrears. On 5 May 2015 Mr A 
entered into an agreement with the bank which was embodied  in a written contract between  
them. 
It was agreed that Mr A would pay £300 per month  for 120 months (so a total of £36,000) 
beginning in June 2015, which would be accepted by the bank in full and final settlement of 
the outstanding debt.  The bank also agreed to release  its security  over the property. As a 
result, the debt became  unsecured.
The bank later sold the debt to Link. In 2017  Link contacted Mr A claiming he owed  over 
£300,000, rather  than the balance of the £36,000  that had been agreed  with the bank. Mr A 
complained to us. Link accepted it had made a mistake and apologised.
But in 2018 Link again contacted Mr A claiming he owed  substantially more than the actual 
debt. Mr A contacted us, and an adjudicator looked at the complaint. Link failed to respond 
to any of his enquiries,  so the adjudicator assessed the complaint on the basis of the 
information available to him.
Having done so, he was satisfied Link had once again made the same  error as in the past by 
disregarding the agreement Mr A had entered into with the bank on 5 May 2015. 
The adjudicator upheld the complaint. He asked  Link to send  Mr A an up-to-date  statement 
showing the correct  balance, re-allocate his payments to reduce  his actual balance and pay 
£150 for the trouble and upset caused.
Link failed to respond, so the case has been  passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im upholding this 
complaint.
Im satisfied Link has repeated the error  it made  in 2017 by claiming Mr A owes  over 
£300,000, when his debt is the residue of the £36,000 as per the agreement  of 5 May 2015.
Link has provided no explanation for this, but Im satisfied it is bound by the 5 May 2015 
agreement. Furthermore,  Ive seen Links response  to the previous  complaint dated 
6 December 2017 in which Link accepted it had failed to take note of the agreement  with the 
bank. I find Link is therefore estopped from disputing the existence and the legally-binding 
nature of the agreement with the bank; as purchaser of the debt which is the subject of that 
agreement, Link is bound  by it.
Ref: DRN58657272Im satisfied Links actions caused  Mr A distress and inconvenience.  I think £150 
compensation is too low, given this is a repeat  of Links poor conduct  from 2017, and its 
failure to provide any response to the complaint. I am instead  ordering Link to pay 
compensation of £300 to Mr A. 
Prior to issuing this decision I told Link I intended  to do this and gave it an opportunity to 
respond by a particular  date. Link asked  for an extension of time to respond, which  I granted. 
But the deadline has passed and Link has failed  to respond.  
In the circumstances, given the absence of any response from Link to this complaint, and 
taking into account  the trouble, upset, distress  and inconvenience caused to Mr A, I am 
satisfied an award of £300  compensation is fair, reasonable and proportionate.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. In settlement I order Link Financial Outsourcing  
Limited to do the following:
provide Mr A with up-to-date statements of his account;
ensure all payments  are correctly allocated to the account;
write a letter of apology;
pay Mr A compensation  of £300 for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 March  2019.
