K821x#15complaint
Miss D complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, (QQ)  and
Pounds to Pocket,  (P2P),  gave her loans that she couldnt afford to repay. The complaint 
has been brought to this service on Miss Ds behalf by claims management company. But for 
ease I shall refer below to all actions being  taken  by Miss D.
background
Miss D was given 10 payday loans, eight  top up loans and one refinance loan by QQ 
between April 2017 and August 2018. And P2P gave her one instalment loan in March 2018.  
QQs payday loans  were repayable by two to three  instalments. The instalment loan was 
repayable by seven  monthly instalments. All the loans have been  repaid. A summary of the 
loans taken out by Miss D is shown below:

Ref: DRN32826532The adjudicator recommended that the complaint  should be upheld  in part. It appears  that 
her numbering of the loans  treated  the loans from QQ and P2P separately.  But I dont think 
the loans should be treated separately  as they were  all lent by CashEuroNet.  Using  my 
numbering, the adjudicator recommended that the complaint about Loans 3a to 11 be 
upheld. 
CashEuroNet disagreed and responded to say, in summary, that its checks  were  adequate 
and proportionate. It said that Miss D had paid each loan successfully. CashEuroNet  also 
provided this service with a document which is titled CEU Lending Criteria and Proportionate 
Checks to show its entire  lending process. The lender said that Miss D was told of the need 
to save income from a previous month to repay  the final repayment in QQs loans. 
CashEuroNet had also said that starting from 1 March  2015, it had implemented an 
affordability assessment  that was consistent  with the Financial Conduct Authoritys (FCA) 
Handbook.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
When CashEuroNet lent to Miss D the regulator  was the FCA and relevant regulations  and 
guidance included  its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC). The CONC contained 
guidance for lenders about  responsible lending. 
With regard to CashEuroNets  assessments  after 1 March 2015, this service has addressed  
this specific point by CashEuroNet  in previous decisions. I would remind  CashEuroNet  at 
this point of the FCA guidance on how complaints  are to be dealt with promptly and fairly  
(my emphasis) by businesses. In particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which  says that businesses 
procedures for complaint  handling should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA, other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
So my decision will focus on the specifics of Miss Ds complaint and what both parties have 
said about this.
CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss D 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
Ref: DRN32826533number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required to 
establish whether  Miss D could sustainably repay her loans   not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the CONC defines sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties 
and in particular  the consumer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ds complaint.
CashEuroNet did a number of checks before it lent to Miss D. It asked her for details of her 
income and expenditure. Miss D declared  her income as £1,797 for all the loans. Miss D 
declared her expenditure as £775 until Loan 9 when  it increased to around £1276. 
CashEuroNet also checked her employment and housing status. From the information  
CashEuroNet gathered, Miss D was employed  and rented  her home.  
CashEuroNet also checked Miss Ds credit file before agreeing  to the loans.  CashEuroNet  
hasnt provided  us with the results of its credit  checks. 
Ref: DRN32826534I think that the checks CashEuroNet carried out before agreeing Loans 1 to 3 were  
proportionate. The repayments that Miss D needed  to make on Loans  1 to 3 were relatively 
modest compared to the income that she declared  to CashEuroNet.  The highest repayment 
for Loans 1 to 3 was £244.80.  I dont think the repayments were so large  that its obvious 
they wouldve  caused Miss D financial difficulty.
So given Miss Ds repayment amounts, what was apparent about her circumstances at the 
time, and her history  with the lender, I dont think it wouldve  been  proportionate for 
CashEuroNet to ask her for the amount of information that would be needed to show the 
lending was unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Miss D provided or the information 
CashEuroNet shouldve  been aware of, which meant it wouldve been  proportionate to start 
verifying what she was saying. So I dont think CashEuroNet  was wrong  to give Loans  1 to 3 
to Miss D.
But a day after Loan 3 was taken out, Miss D took out Loan 3a. The loan amount had 
increased substantially  to £500  with a highest  instalment  of £856.80.  This repayment was 
almost 48% of her declared income  and Miss D needed to make that repayment less than 
two months after taking the loan. I also note that Loan  3 was taken out just eight days after 
Loan 2 was repaid. This doesnt suggest that Miss D would have had surplus funds available 
to her from month  to month. But CashEuroNet said that Miss D could save  some 
disposable income in the first month to put towards her final repayment. But I dont  agree  
that was reasonable here. By that time Miss D had been borrowing loans regularly from 
CashEuroNet and I dont  think  that should  have given the lender any confidence that Miss D 
was in a position to save  money each  month,  or that what shed said about  her disposable 
income was likely to be entirely accurate. So I dont think it was reasonable for CashEuroNet  
to have given  Loan 3a to Miss D. And for broadly the same reasons I dont think it was 
reasonable for it to give Loans  4 and 4a to her.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of CashEuroNets lending history  with Miss D, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which the lender should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ds case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
Loan 5. I say this because:
Miss D had taken out a loan of £200 the previous April and she was now asking for a 
loan of £500. She hadnt made any inroads  into her debt over this time and paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to CashEuroNet over an extended 
period. 
Loan 5 was provided within four days of settling Loans 4 and 4a and the loan amount 
had again increased.  I think  that increase in borrowing alone should  have put 
CashEuroNet on notice that Miss D might  be experiencing some  financial pressures.  
And the fact that she took this loan just days after repaying  her previous borrowing 
might have  added to those concerns.
CashEuroNet ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss D was having  to 
borrow further to cover the hole that repaying  her previous loan had left in her 
finances. 
Ref: DRN32826535There were  some  very small gaps  between loans  being repaid and a new loan being 
granted including one of around  four weeks before Loan  4. But, I dont think it would 
have been reasonable  for CashEuroNet to conclude these  gaps were  any indication  
that Miss Ds finances had moved  on from whatever situation had required her 
previous loans.
I can see that as CashEuroNet didnt stop lending at this point, Miss D went on to take out 
high cost loans  for almost  a further eight  months.  The amount of top up and refinance  loans 
taken by her should  have  suggested to CashEuroNet  that she was struggling to manage  her 
finances. 
I think that Miss D lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from 
Loan 5 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ds indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the length of time that Miss D had been taking out short  term loans was likely to have 
had negative implications on her ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept her 
in the market for these high-cost loans.
The fact that the loans  were  repaid does not mean that they were  repaid sustainably, 
or without causing Miss D undue difficulty.  
I should add Ive considered the points CashEuroNet made in response to the adjudicators  
view. 
CashEuroNet provided this service with a document which is titled  CEU Lending Criteria and 
Proportionate Checks, which isnt case-specific. This service has responded to 
CashEuroNets submission of this document on many previous occasions  and so Ill say no 
more about it here. But I have taken its contents into account,  including  CashEuroNets 
argument about consumers being  able to save to repay the final balloon repayment.
I note that Loans  3a to 5a and Loans  7 onwards were due to be repaid over two or three 
monthly repayments. CashEuroNet says that Miss D would have read and checked a box to 
advise her that she may need to save income  from the previous month (or months)  in order  
to have sufficient  money  to pay the final repayment. I dont think  this removes 
CashEuroNets responsibility  to check that Miss D could meet her repayments in a 
sustainable way, although it might be the case early on in the lending relationship that it 
might be reasonable  for the lender  to think that Miss D could be in a position  to meet her 
loan repayments  when they fell due. But all of Miss Ds loans were taken out within  days or 
weeks of repaying a previous one. So by the time she came to ask for Loan 3a onwards, I 
dont think it was reasonable for CashEuroNet to lend to Miss D on the basis that she was in 
a position to potentially save money  over the loan term.
CashEuroNet also said that Miss D had managed to repay all the loans successfully. But I 
think it will (or ought to) know  from previous  decisions that this service  considers there will 
be times when the pattern of lending  alone  is enough to indicate that a consumer is likely to 
be in financial difficulty  or would otherwise be harmed should  relending  continue. So it 
Ref: DRN32826536follows that successful repayment of a loan doesnt automatically mean it was repaid 
sustainably. And when a consumer  borrows numerous loans over a long period of time, its 
most likely that the loans  arent being  used for their intended purpose of temporary cash  flow 
problems. As CashEuroNet will know, the FCA made it clear  in a recent letter to CEOs of 
high cost lending  firms  that a high volume of relending..may be symptomatic  of 
unsustainable lending  patters. And I think that is the case  here.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  Loans  3a onwards. CashEuroNet should put things 
right as follows.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss D paid on Loans 3a to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse entries about Loans  3a to 4a from Miss Ds credit file;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 5 to Loan 11 means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  Loans 5 to 11 should be removed from 
Miss Ds credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Miss D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks 
for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this 
complaint, I order CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid, and Pounds to Pocket, to:
1.Refund all interest  and charges Miss D paid on Loans 3a to 11;
2.Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement;
3.Remove any adverse  entries about  Loans  3a to 4a from Miss Ds credit file; and
4.The number of loans  taken from Loan 5 to Loan 11 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about Loans 5 to 11 should  be 
removed from Miss Ds credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Miss D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks 
for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 August 2019.
