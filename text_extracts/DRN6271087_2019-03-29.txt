K822xcomplaint
Mrs E complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) recommended  an unsuitable 
contents insurance policy to her.
This complaint concerns  the sale of insurance when Mrs Es policy  was upgraded. Mrs E 
made a separate complaint about an insurance  claim she made under this policy.  So for 
clarity, Im not considering  the claim within this decision.
 
background
In October  2017 Mrs E took a Renters Contents Insurance policy  with NatWest. It provided 
up to £25,000  of contents cover in her home at an annual cost of £50.40.
In February 2018  Mrs E attended a NatWest  branch to withdraw jewellery from a safety 
deposit box. During a conversation with a representative she says NatWest recommended  
that she increase  her contents cover. NatWest upgraded her policy to a Standard Contents 
Insurance policy. This increased her cover up to £50,000 for an annual  cost of £67.20.
Mrs E was looking  to sell the withdrawn jewellery. And shortly after she found a cash buyer 
online who was looking to pay her around  €400,000. After the sale Mrs E discovered the 
money they had paid with was counterfeit. Mrs E then made a claim under her contents 
insurance which was declined due to a policy exclusion related to theft by deception.
Mrs E complained and said NatWest  hadnt  been  clear with her about the level of cover she 
had. NatWest said neither  the original contents  policy nor the upgraded insurance  she took 
out were appropriate  cover for the jewellery. And it said it wouldnt have been able to insure 
contents to that value.  NatWests staff member said he specifically recalled explaining the 
policys level of cover, and policy limits  for individual items to Mrs E. He said Mrs E had 
mentioned her jewellery to him. But his recollection  was she had said she was in the process  
of selling it so she wasnt looking  to insure the items shed  withdrawn.
NatWest said the jewellerys high value compared to the policy limits of the both insurances 
 £25,000 and £50,000  indicated Mrs E had never intended to purchase cover  for these 
items. NatWest also said Mrs E had already arranged to sell her jewellery  prior to attending 
the branch. And she hadnt  sought  out or believed shed taken cover for the jewellery.
Mrs E brought her complaint to our service  and one of our investigators looked  into her 
concerns. She said NatWest hadnt been clear about the policy, and believed it had led 
Mrs E to think  her jewellery  would be covered by the policy.  And she said if Mrs E had 
known NatWest wouldnt have covered  her, she wouldve  looked  for cover elsewhere.
However the investigator didnt think Mrs E would have found a contents  policy  on the 
market that wouldve covered  her for the type of claim  she later needed to make  because  
of common exclusions around theft. So she didnt think  Mrs E had lost out as even if it had 
sold appropriate cover, the later claim wouldve been declined  anyway.
Ref: DRN62710872But the investigator felt Mrs E only agreed  to the upgraded  policy because she thought she 
was covered for her jewellery.  And so she said NatWest should refund the difference in price 
between the two policies as well as give £100 for upset caused to Mrs E. NatWest agreed to 
this but Mrs E didnt.  So the complaint was passed to me for an ombudsmans  decision.  I 
issued a provisional decision on 21 March 2019 explaining why I intended to say NatWests 
suggested settlement  was fair. Ive summarised  this decision below:
NatWest said it sold the upgraded policy on a non-advised basis. Mrs E said shed 
been recommended  the policy by a female  advisor. I understood she spoke to a 
female member of staff initially about  her safety  deposit box, but was then referred  to 
a male colleague to discuss  the sale itself. Taking this into account alongside 
NatWests representatives testimony, I wasnt persuaded NatWest  recommended 
the insurance to her.
Because it was sold on a non-advised basis, NatWest didnt have to check  if the 
policy was right for Mrs E. Instead  it had to provide information about the key 
features and exclusions of the policy in a clear,  fair and not misleading way to allow 
her to make an informed choice.
NatWests representative had given his recollection that he did verbally explain the 
policy in detail before  the sale went ahead.  I accepted it was possible that some 
aspects of the policy may not have been  discussed. But I said based on what  I had, it 
seemed likely that the increased policy limit of £50,000 at least wouldve been  
discussed. And this was because  it was a key difference  between the policy  she 
already had and the one she was taking.
So I thought  it was more likely that Mrs E wouldve known she was agreeing to cover  
with a £50,000 contents limit. And this suggested Mrs E knew  that the policy wouldnt 
have covered the jewellery she was looking to sell given its high value.
I said it wasnt disputed that Mrs E had already arranged to sell her jewellery prior to 
withdrawing it from NatWest. And Id seen nothing to suggest  Mrs E approached 
NatWest or any other insurers  to look for cover  for these items. Again I thought this 
suggested insuring  the jewellery hadnt  been  a priority for Mrs E. So I was satisfied, 
as NatWest had suggested,  that it was more likely Mrs E didnt intend to insure the 
jewellery because  she had the sale already arranged.
Having reviewed the policy in detail, I said Id seen no reason to suggest this policy  
was mis-sold to Mrs E. 
Overall I thought the offer NatWest had made would put Mrs E back  in the position  
she wouldve been had the upgraded policy never  been sold to her. And I was 
satisfied this, and the £100 it offered for any trouble and upset was fair. So I wouldnt 
be asking NatWest  to do anything  further.
I explained I would consider any further evidence before issuing my final decision. NatWest 
had no further  comments. Mrs E disagreed  and reiterated that she was told she was fully  
covered  by NatWests  representative, and that she had been  taken advantage of. She has 
also said shes spoken to the police about her previous insurance  claim.
Ref: DRN62710873my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Mrs E feels very strongly about her complaint.  But Ive been  given nothing new 
to consider. So I havent been persuaded to change my mind from my provisional decision.  
And I think NatWests offer of £100  and to refund the difference in premium costs between  
her original policy and upgraded policy is fair.
As Ive outlined, Ive not considered the claim Mrs E made on her policy  within this decision. 
So Im not going to comment on the polices observations as its not related to this complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I think the offer NatWest made following our investigators 
assessment is fair. And Im not asking it to do anything  further.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 April 2019.
