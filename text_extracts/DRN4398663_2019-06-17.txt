K820x#14complaint
Mr T complains about National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)  and the service he 
received when trying to use his debit card for the first time.  He says he was not told in 
advance that he would  need to use his card with a PIN before it would work on a contactless  
transaction, and that when he contacted NatWest to find a way of accessing  his account he 
found the staff unhelpful.  
 
background
Mr T opened a NatWest account in February  2019.  A PIN was produced and sent to him by 
post. 
The following  day a debit card was sent to Mr T. 
Mr T received the card, but had not received  the PIN. He tried to use the card as a 
contactless card but was unable to, as the card had not been used with the PIN to activate 
the contactless function. 
Mr T telephoned NatWest a number of times  over the following two weeks. 
Mr T explained during  his calls that he had not received a PIN, and was unable to use the 
card for contactless transactions. NatWest advised him that the card was active, but that 
contactless could  only work after the card was used  with the PIN. 
NatWest ordered  a replacement PIN for Mr T and that was posted to him, approximately 10 
days after the original  PIN was posted.  
This does  not appear to have arrived either. 
Mr T made a complaint to NatWest.
NatWest sent its final response to Mr Ts complaint in late February  2019.  
In this response, NatWest did not uphold  the complaint, but acknowledged that there had 
been shortcomings in the customer service provided. NatWest credited Mr T with £30 
compensation to reflect  this. 
Mr T was not happy with this and contacted us. He complained  that he had not been  told 
that he needed the PIN to activate  the contactless function on the card and that he had been 
wrongly advised he could use the banking app immediately to transfer funds to another  
account or to withdraw cash from an ATM. He was also upset  that NatWest  had paid money 
into his account  without seeking  his consent. 
One of our investigators  has looked  into Mr Ts complaint  and has set out her view to the 
parties. In listening to the calls she noted that NatWest had offered Mr T £35 compensation 
and had only paid £30 to Mr T. NatWest  has now corrected this by paying a further  £5 to Mr 
T. 
The investigator agreed that there  had been  some poor service in not informing Mr T that he 
may not be able to use the app immediately,  and that some  of his calls were frustrating. She 
did not find evidence  that Mr T had been  wrongly advised about  needing to use a PIN with 
Ref: DRN43986632his card,  and thought that the offer made my NatWest was reasonable to reflect the service  
issues. 
Mr T was not happy with this and asked for an ombudsman decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate the frustration  that Mr T must have felt, to have received his card and then not 
be able to use it. He has explained that he had to walk a long distance because  he was not 
able to use the card to pay for transport, and this was particularly distressing for him as he 
has a disability which makes walking long distances  more difficult. 
I do, however,  have  to look at what,  if anything,  the business has done wrong, before I can 
look at the effect  upon Mr T. 
Mr T says that he understood that he would be able to use the card without the PIN but, like 
the investigator, I have not seen  evidence that Mr T was wrongly  advised  by NatWest about  
this. During his calls,  staff made clear  that it was a necessary security measure to only allow  
a card to be used by contactless transaction after it had been verified by the card holder 
using the PIN. 
NatWest has provided evidence that it sent out the PIN initially,  and again when requested 
later. These were sent to the same address  as the card was sent to, which  had reached Mr 
T. I appreciate that these letters did not reach Mr T, but I cannot say that NatWest did 
anything wrong  in relation to this. 
In respect of the customer service Mr T received when he called to enquire how he could 
access his funds, I agree that this could have  been better. Mr T was clearly frustrated and 
some of the processes that Mr T had to go through were cumbersome and not customer 
focussed. I think that this caused Mr T frustration and some  wasted time. 
Mr T thinks that he should have been  advised that the app would require a wait of 72 hours  
before he could use it. I agree that this would have been helpful, but overall I think that 
NatWest did try to help Mr T, in the circumstances. 
Mr T thinks that NatWests offer of £35 compensation is insufficient for the level of 
inconvenience he suffered. 
I understand this view,  but I think that the offer by NatWest is appropriate  for the 
inconvenience Mr T suffered as a result of the poor customer service  (e.g. wasted time and 
frustration over the days when he called).
The majority of the distress and inconvenience  Mr T suffered was as a result of not receiving 
the PIN, and for believing that he could use the card without the PIN. As set out above I do 
not think that these  effects were NatWests fault and so I cannot  ask NatWest to compensate  
Mr T for the majority of the inconvenience he suffered.  
Mr T is also upset  that NatWest paid compensation directly into his account without his 
consent. The investigator addressed this making  clear that by paying in an amount there 
Ref: DRN43986633was no suggestion  that Mr T had resolved  his complaint, and consequently I do not consider 
that this was poor service. 
I realise that this will be disappointing  for Mr T, but I hope the above explains why I agree 
that NatWest has made an appropriate  offer to reflect its failings, and why I do not ask it to 
do anything further.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I do not uphold Mr Ts complaint and do not ask 
National Westminster Bank Plc to do anything further. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 July 2019.
