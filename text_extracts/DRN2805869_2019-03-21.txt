K821x#15complaint
Mr B says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent QuickQuid and Mr B my provisional  decision on this complaint on 4 March  2019. A 
copy of it is attached and it forms part of this final decision. I asked both parties to let me 
know if they had anything to add. Mr B didnt send me anything else to consider. QuickQuid 
didnt agree with my provisional decision and Ive considered the points it made below.
my findings
Ive considered again all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have also taken into account the law, 
any relevant regulatory  rules and good  industry practice at the time.
Part of QuickQuids response to my provisional  decision  was general information about its 
lending processes. I said in my provisional  decision that I wasnt  going to address generic  
points like these as this service had already done so directly and in earlier decisions. This 
remains the case.
In respect of Mr Bs complaint, QuickQuid  said:
We cannot  agree that QuickQuid  failed  to adequately monitor  Mr [B]'s lending history during  
the course of time in which each loan agreement was effective. As a business we are 
encouraged to consider a consumers lending history, therefore its prudent for the business  
to take into consideration Mr [B]'s repayment history  and by the time he had requested  his 
3rd loan, he had established  a good lending and repayment history with us. 

In addition, Mr [B] borrowed his first and second loan which  was scheduled to be repaid over 
3 periods. The same [behaviours] are shown for loans 3 and 4, in which after Mr [B] 
requested the top ups for both loans, the loan was scheduled to be repaid over 2 periods. 
Therefore, Mr [B] had disposable income  per month  to make his repayments.  It is important  
to note that Mr [B] had repaid  his first 3 loans  as scheduled or earlier  than the contractual  
agreement which showed sound repayment  history.  This shows that Mr [B] was able to 
establish balance  between his monthly repayments  and regular financial commitments. Our 
records also indicate that at no time did Mr [B] contact the business and advise of any 
financial difficulty or burden.
My provisional decision was that the complaint about the loans QuickQuid approved  on and 
after 17 June 2017 should be upheld. Ive reviewed  everything in light of what QuickQuid has 
said.
Its disappointing that QuickQuid hasnt provided any new customer-specific information 
about its lending  decisions  in Mr Bs case.  I still havent seen any information  about what  
QuickQuid saw from its credit checks.  And QuickQuid hasnt provided any comment on the 
particular credit commitment figures  and the significant adverse information  I quoted from 
Mr Bs credit  report. 
I had said: I can see Mr B had three regular long-term loans, with repayments  of £109, £362  
and £450 a month. the loan repayments alone  suggest Mr B was spending 70% of his 
Ref: DRN28058692income repaying medium to long-term  debt and he was committed  to repaying £921  a 
month, not the validated amounts of £819  or £640.
Id also said: Ive also seen that by June 2017, one of the credit  cards was in early arrears 
and the other in late arrears. One of the three loans had defaulted in April 2017 and one 
other was in early  arrears. Other accounts, including a telecoms  account,  were in arrears  as 
of June 2017.
I concluded that QuickQuid wouldve likely been aware of the above and I still think  this is 
the case.
QuickQuid has suggested that as the loans were  spread across  more than one month,  Mr B 
did have the disposable income  to repay them.  But Mr Bs regular credit commitments alone 
were significant  at about 70% of his stated income. Hed have other living  costs  too, like 
food, travel and accommodation. 
I dont think its reasonable to suggest the remaining  30% of his income was enough to meet 
his other  usual living costs and also sustainably  repay QuickQuid loans 3 and 4. And this is 
demonstrated by the financial difficulties which were  obvious from his credit  report by 
June 2017.
I also dont think its enough  to simply note that Mr B repaid  his loans on time and conclude  
from this that future loans  would automatically be sustainably affordable.  When considering  
a lending history, how a loan is repaid is as important as whether it was repaid. Repayments  
should be sustainable and as QuickQuid  knows, this service considers repeat lending  to be 
a sign of likely financial difficulty.
But I didnt place much  weight on this in my provisional decision and I didnt say Mr Bs 
lending history, on its own, was enough to suggest the loans  were  not likely  to be affordable.  
My findings  were essentially that QuickQuid knew  or ought to have known  enough about 
Mr B, from the information available  to it, to see that the loans were not sustainably 
affordable to him, given his existing commitments  and the recent defaults and late payments 
on other accounts.
QuickQuids response  to my provisional  decision therefore doesnt really add anything  new.  
My final decision is therefore  the same  as my provisional decision and Im upholding Mr Bs 
complaint in part.
Ref: DRN28058693putting things right
Im upholding the complaint about loans  3-4a,  so QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr B paid on loans  3-3a
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr B paid them until the 
date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  loans 3-4a from Mr Bs credit history
For loans 4-4a, QuickQuid should refund  any amount  Mr B repaid above  £350, adding 8% 
simple interest from when hed repaid the principal sum until the date of settlement.
HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Mr B a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold the complaint in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 April 2019.

Mr B had four loans with QuickQuid, two of which  were topped-up (3a and 4a). This means  extra funds 
were borrowed during the course of the loan agreement.  Ive set out an overview of the lending in the table

An adjudicator  considered this complaint and he recommend it be upheld  in part. He didnt think  it was right 
for QuickQuid  to have approved loans 3a-4a. QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint 
was passed to me to decide.
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. I have  also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory  rules and 
good industry  practice at the time. QuickQuid said that it could not agree that it was irresponsible  in lending 
to Mr B. Its response to the adjudicator was as follows:
Thank you for providing  your assessment regarding Mr [B's] complaint. In response to your assessment 
which recommends CashEuroNet UK uphold loans which were funded after March 2015,  we regret  to 
inform you that we cannot  agree to your recommendations in relation to QuickQuid  loans 3 and 4. We 
would like to provide more  information regarding these loans. I have attached  the entire lending process  
including all the checks that we perform prior to lending
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument directly  and through earlier  final 
decisions. So I am not going to address this point  here, though I have considered  it alongside everything 
else in making my decision. 
My decision will focus on the specifics of Mr Bs complaint and what  both parties  have said about this.
The FCA was the regulator  at the time Mr B borrowed the loans in question. Bearing  in mind the rules  and 
guidance set out in its Principles for Business (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), I 
would expect a lenders  affordability assessment to vary with circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific 
regulations here because, as before, I would  expect  Quick Quid to be conversant with these through 
previous ombudsman decisions, particularly  recent decisions, which  set these out in detail.) 
In general, Id expect a lender  to require more assurance the greater the potential  risk to the consumer of 
not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable  way. So, for example, Id expect a lender to seek more 
assurance by carrying  out more detailed checks:
Ref: DRN28058695-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income; or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
what did QuickQuid  do?
Ive seen  that at the time of each loan QuickQuid  recorded  that Mr B was working  and was living in rented  
accommodation; his net monthly income was recorded as £1,350 throughout the period  of lending.  
QuickQuid also recorded  information about Mr Bs monthly  expenditure and the net total was £525  for each 
loan application. This included £50 for other monthly  credit commitments. QuickQuid  also carried out credit  
checks, but it hasnt shown us the full detail of these.
was this enough?
Because QuickQuid didnt provide the full results of its credit  checks, its not possible  for me to say whether  
it did enough in Mr Bs case. I say this because I dont know to what extent what Mr B told QuickQuid 
differed to what it saw from its credit checks  or how it took any differences into account.
What Mr B said about his income and expenditure suggested he had disposable income of around  £825 a 
month. But I think its likely QuickQuids  credit checks wouldve  picked up some expenditure  beyond what  
Mr B declared.  Ive seen from Mr Bs credit file that he had a high street bank  loan with a monthly payment  
of £450  at the time of loans 1 and 2. Mr B also had a credit card for which the minimum repayments were in 
the region  of £10 a month  which may have formed part of the £50 declared.
Deducting an additional £400 from Mr Bs declared  disposable income would leave him with just over £400 
a month for other  commitments. The largest payment  for loan 1 was £439.60  which exceeds my estimate 
of Mr Bs disposable  income. Ive thought about whether  it wouldve been reasonable for QuickQuid to think  
Mr B could carry over income to make  this largest  payment. In Mr Bs particular circumstances, I dont think 
it wouldve been unreasonable for QuickQuid to conclude he could have  been able to do this for loan 1. 
This was his first loan and the first two payments were relatively  small. At this time, I dont think QuickQuid 
was aware of any indicators  of significant recent financial difficulty. So although  Ive not seen evidence  of 
proportionate checks, I dont think proportionate  checks wouldve suggested loan 1 was unaffordable  and I 
do not intend to uphold the complaint about it.
I think Mr Bs circumstances  were similar at the time of loan 2 and the highest payment  of £367.20 would  
not have appeared  to be unaffordable  based on disposable monthly income of about  £415. Although  there  
is only a small difference between the two figures, leaving little margin  for unexpected (or underestimated) 
expenditure, I think  the relatively  small size of the first two payments means  allowing  for a narrower  margin  
for Mr Bs last payment wouldnt be unreasonable given this was early on in the lending relationship. Ive 
also taken into account  that loan 2 was smaller than loan 1 and that Mr Bs credit file didnt show signs of 
significant difficulty at this time. I dont  intend to uphold the complaint about  loan 2.
For loans 3 and 4 and the tops-up, I dont  think QuickQuids lending decisions  were responsible  as Ill 
explain.
QuickQuid has said that at the time of loan 3, its credit checks validated  Mr Bs existing credit commitments 
as £819 for loan 3 and as £640 for loan 4. It hasnt shown us how it arrived at these  figures,  which are 
significantly more than hed declared.
Excluding his credit commitments, Mr Bs declared  expenditure was £475 a month. Adding what QuickQuid 
says are its own validated credit commitment figures  to Mr Bs other  declared expenditure  creates  a total 
expenditure figure  of £1,294 for loan 3 and £1,115 for loan 3. Bearing in mind  Mr Bs net monthly income 
was declared  as £1,350, this would only leave him with disposable income of £56 a month  for loan 3 and 
£235 for loan 4.
On the above figures, both loans 3 and 4a are unaffordable simply when taking into account the information 
QuickQuid says it relied on. The repayments for both loans 3 and 4a exceeded Mr Bs disposable income,  
even when taking into account  that they were due across  two months. Its more debatable whether the 
initial amount lent for loan 4 was affordable based on monthly disposable income of £235. It would only be 
affordable if Mr B saved money from August 2017 to make the September payment. On balance,  unlike  for 
Ref: DRN28058696loans 1 and 2, I dont think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to accept  Mr B was likely  to be able to do this  
given the frequency with which he was now accessing high-cost credit.
As Ive not been shown how QuickQuid arrived at the validated  figures quoted above, Ive looked at his 
credit file to see what information was available  to it. I can see Mr B had three  regular long-term loans,  with 
repayments of £109, £362  and £450 a month. He also by this time had two credit cards.
The loan repayments alone  suggest Mr B was spending 70% of his income repaying  medium to long-term 
debt and he was committed to repaying  £921 a month, not the validated amounts of £819 or £640. 
Ive also seen  that by June 2017, one of the credit cards was in early arrears and the other in late arrears. 
One of the three loans had defaulted in April 2017 and one other was in early arrears. Other accounts,  
including a telecoms  account,  were in arrears as of June  2017. I appreciate  that QuickQuid operates in a 
market where borrowers  may have less than perfect credit histories. But the adverse information  available  
about Mr B wasnt historic, it occurred around  the time he asked for loans 3 and 4.
Given that QuickQuids initial checks suggested the loans  were unaffordable and that it ought to have 
known (from credit  checks) that Mr B was experiencing  financial difficulty,  Im surprised it didnt do more  to 
look into his situation   for example contacting  Mr B so it could ask about his debts and/or  manually 
underwrite the loan to further test what,  if anything,  he could afford to borrow. That QuickQuid didnt do 
anything outside of its normal process  undermines what it says about its checks  always being proportionate  
since March 2015.
With this said, QuickQuid actually had enough information to see that loans 3 and 4 were not likely to be 
sustainably affordable  for Mr B. From what  Ive seen, further  checks  wouldve only confirmed what  
QuickQuid essentially  already  knew.  So I intend to uphold the complaint  about loans 3-4a.
putting things  right
I plan to tell QuickQuid to:
refund the interest  and charges  Mr B paid on loans 3-3a
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr B paid them until the date of 
settlement
remove  any adverse information about loans 3-4a from Mr Bs credit history
QuickQuid says there is still an outstanding balance on loans 4-4a.  But from the information  provided, Mr B 
has already repaid  more than the £350  he borrowed. So QuickQuid  should  refund any amount Mr B repaid 
above £350, adding 8% simple interest from when hed repaid  the principal sum until the date of 
settlement.
HM Revenue & Customs  requires  QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give Mr B a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.

I plan to uphold the complaint in part and to tell CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right by taking  the steps 
set out above.
