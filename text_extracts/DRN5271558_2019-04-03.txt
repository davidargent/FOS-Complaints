K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains about a number of loans CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) lent 
him. Mr S says he couldnt afford  the loans.
background
QuickQuid lent Mr S 11 loans, the loan amounts  varied from £50 to £500  and a number of 
the loans were topped-up with additional borrowing. Theres  an appendix to this decision 
which shows the loans.  From what I can see, Mr S has repaid all his loans. 
Mr S complained to QuickQuid about all his loans through a third party representative. 
QuickQuid didnt uphold  his complaint, it said it lent each  of his loans responsibly. Unhappy  
with QuickQuids response,  Mr S brought his complaint  to this service.
One of adjudicators looked at Mr S complaint and thought it should be upheld in part. Our 
adjudicator thought that QuickQuids checks for loans 1 to 3 went  far enough but that 
QuickQuid shouldve taken its checks further  before agreeing to lend loan 3a and all the 
subsequent loans. Our adjudicator thought that sufficient checks  would  have shown that 
QuickQuid was wrong to lend Mr S loan 4a onwards. 
QuickQuid didnt agree, it said the loans our adjudicator recommended should be upheld  
were lent after it implemented changes  to its lending decision in March  2015 and the loans 
were lent responsibly.  
So as the complaint remains  unresolved, it has come to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr S complaint. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr S complaint in part and have explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr S income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
Ref: DRN52715582a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income, 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher, 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans, 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr S complaint. These  questions  are:
1.did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable  and proportionate  checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr S would  be able to repay in a sustainable  way?  If not, would 
those checks  have shown that Mr S would have been able to do so?
2.taking  into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  
pattern of lending increase Mr S indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
3.did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably in some other  way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr S complaint.
did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy  
itself that Mr S would  be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr S would  have been  able to do so?
QuickQuid has said it carried out checks before  lending to Mr S. It has said it searched  Mr S 
credit file, asked him for his income and expenditure amounts. It says it validated  the figures 
Mr S provided through third party agencies.
Mr S has provided a copy of his bank statement and I can see that he had two recent 
defaults recorded on his file before he was lent loan 1 in October 2014. I dont think at this 
stage the defaults shouldve  meant that QuickQuid automatically decline Mr S applications 
for credit but it shouldve  been mindful  of them when it lent to Mr S. Bearing in mind the 
relatively low loan amounts compared to Mr S declared income  of £1,100  and as this was 
early in the lending relationship, I think QuickQuids checks  went far enough for loans 1 to 3. 
Mr S declared his expenses as £325,  and based  on the information QuickQuid had, Mr S 
was in a position to afford to repay loans 1 to 3. 
By the time of loan 3a, Mr S had been borrowing from QuickQuid for about four months 
without any breaks and his borrowing was increasing  Mr S had to repay a maximum of 
around £300 for loan 3a, this was more than a quarter  of his declared  income.  Also, he had 
now had another  default on his credit file. I think for loan 3a and the subsequent  loans,  
QuickQuid shouldve taken it checks further  to understand Mr S financial position better 
especially his total expenses. And so I dont  think  QuickQuid did enough  before  agreeing  to 
lend loan 3a onwards.
Had it carried out sufficient checks,  its likely to have found that Mr S was borrowing from 
other short term lenders  and at the time he was due to repay  loan 3a, he had around  £231 
outstanding to another lender. Taking into account  the Mr S income and monthly  living 
expenses information  (income £1,100  and expenses £325), it suggests that he was in a 
position to sustainably repay  the maximum of around £300 due for this loan.
Ref: DRN52715583Turning to loan 4, at the time Mr S income  and expenses  were similar to the previous loan 
and Mr S continued to borrow  from other payday  lenders  and when he took out this loan,  he 
had around £420 outstanding to another short term lender. And although  I think  Mr S was in 
a position to sustainably repay loan 4, I dont think  he could afford loan 4a. The additional 
borrowing on loan 4 meant that he now had to repay more  than £281  and given his 
outstanding short term commitments at the time,  he wasnt in a position to sustainably repay 
this loan.
So Im upholding  Mr S complaint about  loan 4a because I dont think that QuickQuid carried 
out reasonable and proportionate checks and such checks wouldve more  likely than not 
shown QuickQuid that Mr S couldnt  sustainably repay the loan.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 5 to 11 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
taking into account  the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr S indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending to see if there was a point at which  QuickQuid 
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. 
And so QuickQuid shouldve realised  that it shouldnt have provided  any further lending. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr S case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 5. I say this because the amounts Mr S was borrowing  were  generally increasing, and 
QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was likely  his indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. Mr S was borrowing from QuickQuid continually for more than two years  and 
there were no gaps that were significant enough  for QuickQuid  to reasonably believe that he 
wasnt reliant on the loans.
Also, Mr S was repaying and almost  immediately borrowing again. In some instances he was 
borrowing on the same  day he repaid  a loan and Mr S received more than 20 advances from 
QuickQuid in the time he was borrowing. Bearing  in mind the purpose of short-term  loans 
and the relevant rules and regulations, the frequency and length of time for which  Mr S 
wanted to borrow  ought to have  caused QuickQuid concern. I note QuickQuids own website 
acknowledges, Short-term loans should  be used for short-term  financial needs only, and not 
as long-term financial  solution. As a responsible lender, we do not encourage the frequent 
use of our service.
Mr S wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid  and was in effect 
paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended period. Also during 
the period of lending loans 5 to 11, I think its likely QuickQuids  checks would have shown 
that Mr S had now defaulted  on three  credit commitments  and he had now been  borrowing 
continuously from QuickQuid for around seven months, at this stage, this would suggest that 
he was struggling  to repay and couldnt  sustainably afford  to repay the loans and was 
borrowing to repay  credit.  And this should have concerned QuickQuid.
In response to our adjudication, QuickQuid has said:
Ref: DRN52715584We started implementing changes to the affordability assessment in June 2014 and all the 
changes were completed by Feb 28th 2015. Starting 1st March  2015 before Mr [S] borrowed 
these loans, QuickQuid  had implemented an affordability review that is consistent with the 
FCA Handbook and that was in place at the time we received authorisation by the FCA. We 
confirm that this assessment was conducted  properly  and individually  for each of the loans 
you are recommending.
 
And that:
since 1st March 2015, QuickQuid implemented affordability review, which involved 
collecting and validating  income and expense details from customers, in line with the FCA 
Handbook. As such, we believe Mr [S] loans issued  post 2015  were affordable.
It provided further detail  about the checks it had made when it approved  loans from 2015  
onwards in a document called CEU  Lending Criteria  and Proportional Checks.  And this 
response didnt  change our adjudicators opinion.
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument  directly and through 
earlier final decisions. So Im not going  to expand on this point any further  here, though Ive 
considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. 
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman  are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent 
who handled  the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  
complaints received by the respondent and using this in training and development of 
the individuals dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA, other relevant regulators and the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  and communicating it to the individuals dealing  with 
complaints in the respondent. 
This is why my decision  has focussed on the specifics of Mr S complaint and what both 
parties have said about  this.
Overall, I think Mr S lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
to 11 when it ought to have known  that:
these  loans had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr S indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive  credit over an extended  period of time,
the sheer  number of loans was likely  to have had negative  implications on Mr S 
ability to access  mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
Ref: DRN52715585So Im also upholding  Mr S complaint about loans 5 to 11 because  the overall pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr S in some  
other way.  
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 4a to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were  paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative  information about loan 4a from Mr S credit  file;
the number of loans taken from loan 5 onwards  means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 11 should be removed from 
Mr S credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr S 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right as Ive set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 May 2019.
