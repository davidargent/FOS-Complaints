K821x#15complaint
Mr E says Novaloans Ltd (trading as Cash4unow) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about four instalment loans Cash4unow provided to Mr E between  
June 2017 and July 2018. Mr Es borrowing history is as follows:
loan 
number start  dateloan 
amount instalmentshighest 
repayment end date
1 01/06/2017 300 4 112.14 15/09/2017
2 27/09/2017 300 4 115.16 15/01/2018
3 19/01/2018 400 6 125.37 13/07/2018
4 27/07/2018 400 6 123.72 outstanding
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Es complaint and thought that proportionate  checks wouldve 
shown that Mr E couldnt afford to sustainably repay  loans 2 to 4 and Cash4unow shouldnt 
have lent him those loans.  Cash4unow disagreed  and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Cash4unow needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr E 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
The adjudicator didnt think Cash4unow  was wrong  to lend loan 1 to Mr E. From what  I can 
see, Mr E hasnt disagreed with this finding and so I dont think this loan remains  in dispute. 
I have focussed  my decision on loans 2 to 4, as they remain  in dispute.
Cash4unow has told this service the checks it carried out before lending  any of the loans. It 
says it checked  Mr Es income and expenses and also searched his credit  file. Mr Es 
declared income was £1,620 and his expenses varied from £820  to £1,092. The credit check  
for loan 2 showed that Mr B was borrowing from other short term lenders and there was an 
outstanding balance on these other short term loans. 
I can see that Cash4unow asked Mr E about  his payday loan commitments when he applied 
for loan 2 and Mr E didnt declare that he was making any payments towards payday loans. 
Id expect a lender to react to the information it sees about a consumer before lending.  I 
think Cash4unow was aware at the time it lent this loan that Mr Es use of short  term loans 
was increasing and so it shouldve  reacted by verifying the information Mr E provided as 
there was an obvious discrepancy.
Ref: DRN96718852If Cash4unow took its checks further, it would likely  have found that Mr E was borrowing 
from at least four other  short term lenders  and Cash4unow wouldve been  aware  that Mr E 
was likely having wider  financial problems and wouldve struggled to repay  the loan. In the 
circumstances, Cash4unow  shouldnt have lent this loan.
By loan 3 Mr E had been borrowing from Cash4unow for around  six months  without any 
breaks and this was now his third loan. The loan amount for loan 3 was higher than any of 
his previous loans  and he was due to be tied into repaying the loan for six months. I think  by 
this point Cash4unow shouldve been looking  to build a clear  picture  of Mr Es finances 
including verifying  some the information  hed provided. I cant  see that it did this so I dont  
think its checks for loans 3 went far enough.
Loan 4 was taken in similar circumstances to loan 3 and I think Cash4unow should also 
have been looking  to build a clear  picture of Mr Es circumstances before lending. And so I 
dont think it did enough before agreeing to lend this loan.
Had Cash4unow carried out proportionate checks  before  lending  loans 3 and 4, it wouldve 
seen that Mr E was borrowing regularly from other short term lenders and he was also 
spending significantly on gambling transactions. For example in the month before loan 3 was 
approved, Mr E spent  over £2,300 in gambling transactions and this was also the case  when 
loan 4 was approved. Mr Es expensed outweighed his income.
This wasnt a sustainable position and as a responsible  lender, it shouldnt  have lent Mr E 
those loans.
So Cash4unow needs to put things right.
putting things right  what Cash4unow  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr E paid on loans 2 to 3;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove all interest and charges on loan 4 and treat all payments Mr E made  towards 
loan 4 as repayments  towards  the principal  amount,
if there is still an outstanding balance after re-working loan 4 then the redress  amount  
from the other loans  may be used to repay this. If this results in a surplus  then the 
surplus should be paid to Mr E with 8% simple  interest. However if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Cash4unow  should  try to agree an affordable repayment 
plan with Mr E. Cash4unow can only make  a deduction if it still owns  the loan.
remove any negative information  about these loans from Mr Es credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash4unow to take off tax from this interest. 
Cash4unow must give Mr E a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
Ref: DRN96718853my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold Mr Es complaint partially and require Novaloans Ltd 
to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 November  2019.
