K822xcomplaint
Miss S complained that Red Sands Insurance Company  (Europe) Limited added a specific  
exclusion to her pet insurance  policy and that it delayed paying  her claim. My references to 
Red Sands  include  its agents.
background 
In 2015 Miss S made a claim  on her pet insurance  policy for her cats diarrhoea. At that time 
she had a policy that gave cover  for a medical  condition for 12 months.  Red Sands paid the 
claim. On 30 March 2016 Miss S upgraded the policy to a lifetime policy.
In 2017 Miss S cat was vomiting blood.  The vet practice sent a claim direct to Red Sands in 
2018. Red Sands paid the claim. But it noticed  that when Miss S claimed for the diarrhoea in 
2015 it hadnt added an exclusion it wanted to add to her policy  as a result of that claim.  The 
exclusion was for all claims  with respect to the digestive system with effect  from 30 March 
2015. 
Red Sands  wrote to Miss S on 19 April 2018  and told her it had applied  the exclusion  to her 
policy. It said it was paying  her claim for vomiting as it had overlooked adding the exclusion 
following the 2015 claim.
Miss S complained to us. She was very unhappy  Red Sands had added the exclusion only 
two weeks after her policy renewed.  She also said Red Sands had delayed in paying her 
claim for vomiting  as the treatment happened in 2017.
Our investigator thought Red Sands had acted unfairly in adding  the exclusion for digestive 
system claims  to the March 2018 policy. But it could notify Miss S if it wanted to add the 
exclusion when the policy renewed in March  2019.  Our investigator also initially thought 
Red Sands  should  pay Miss S £200  for her distress and inconvenience  at the delay in the 
claim being paid.
Red Sands  agreed  to remove  the exclusion from Miss S current  policy.  It said it would add 
the exclusion if she renewed the policy in 2019.  But it wouldnt agree to pay the £200 as 
Miss S vet had submitted  the claim in January 2018 and shed only asked for the claim to be 
assessed on 29 March  2018. It paid the vet in mid April 2018 so it said it didnt delay. 
Red Sands  sent us its records about  the contact it had with Miss S from the time the vet 
submitted the claim.
Our investigator told Miss S about Red Sands' offer and on the new evidence  from 
Red Sands  she was no longer recommending that it pay Miss S £200.
Miss S said she agreed about the policy  but wanted compensation for her distress  and 
inconvenience.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Red Sands  has now agreed to remove the exclusion for digestive system claims from 
Miss S March 2018 policy. It says it will add the exclusion if Miss S renews the policy in 
Ref: DRN52154212March 2019. Miss S has told our investigator she agrees to that so I dont need to consider 
that matter further.
The only issue left for me to decide is whether Red Sands delayed in paying  Miss S claim or 
gave poor service, and if it did whether I should  award Miss S compensation.
Red Sands' notes  show that it received the claim form from Miss S' vet practice in 
January 2018.  On 29 January 2018  Miss S told Red Sands not to look at the claim as the vet 
had submitted the claim form without her consent. On 28 March 2018  the vet practice  spoke 
to Red Sands to chase  the claim. It told the vet practice Miss S had said not to look at the 
claim. On 29 March 2018, having spoken to the vet practice, Miss S contacted Red Sands 
and said she wanted it to assess the claim. Red Sands paid the claim on 19 April 2018.  It 
didnt delay in assessing the claim once Miss S told it to assess.
Ive seen the comments Miss S made to our investigator about Red Sands service but they 
dont alter my decision that it gave  her reasonable service. On the claim form Miss S had 
agreed to Red Sands  liaising with the vet practice direct about  her claim, and to pay the vet 
direct. So Red Sands  didnt do anything wrong in liaising with the vet practice.  Red Sands 
wasnt wrong to text Miss S to thank  her for the 2018 claim because although her cat was ill 
in 2017 Red Sands didnt  receive the claim until 2018.
Theres no basis for me to award any compensation to Miss S.
my final decision
I partly  uphold  this complaint. 
I require Red Sands Insurance Company (Europe) Limited to remove  the exclusion for all 
claims with respect to the digestive system with effect from 30 March  2015 from Miss S 
March 2018 policy,  as it and Miss S have now agreed.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 February  2019.
