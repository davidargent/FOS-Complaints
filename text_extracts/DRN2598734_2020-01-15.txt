background
This complaint is about nine high-cost short-term loans Nova  provided  to Mr C between 
August 2016 and August  2018. Mr Cs borrowing history  is as follows:

1 17/08/2016 15/11/2016 3 £180.00 £90.17
2 29/11/2016 15/02/2017 4 £500.00 £189.42
3 16/02/2017 15/05/2017 3 £700.00 £346.36

7 16/02/2018 04/05/2018 4 £430.00 £175.80
8 14/05/2018 07/08/2018 3 £190.00 £93.38
9 08/08/2018 07/02/2019 6 £600.00 £199.12
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Cs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because they felt if Nova had done  proportionate checks  it would 
have shown Mr C wasnt managing his finances. Nova disagreed  and said Mr C was making  
his repayments  on time and in full which indicated he was managing  his credit commitments. 
Nova asked for an ombudsmans review, so the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Nova needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Nova should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN25987342the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Nova  was required to establish  
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint. Having done  this, Ive decided  to partially 
uphold the complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Nova needed  to do more when it approved  loans 1 to 3. Mr C 
didnt disagree  with the adjudicators findings about  these loans. As there is not dispute 
about these loans, I wont be making any findings  on them. But Ive kept them in mind  when  
thinking about the context  of the overall lending relationship. 
This leaves  loan 4 onwards for me to consider. As our adjudicator  explained, a proportionate 
check for loans 4, 5 and 6 would most likely  have  shown  that Mr C was borrowing from other 
short-term lenders. This was increasing  his monthly  outgoings and was most  likely an 
indication that he was in a cycle  of debt and was further borrowing to cover the hole that 
repaying his previous loans was leaving in his finances. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Novas lending history  with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Nova should  reasonably have seen that further lending  
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And Nova should have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point Nova ought to have realised Mr C was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr C had been indebted to Nova for 18 months.  So Nova ought  to have 
realised it was more likely  than not that Mr Cs indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Ref: DRN25987343Mr Cs first loan was for £180 and loan 7 was for £430.  At this point Nova ought to 
have known that Mr C was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr C was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. 
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Nova. Loan 9 was taken 
out just under two years after Mr Cs first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr C had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Nova over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Nova continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards  
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Cs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him/her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 to 6 and loans 7 to 9 and Nova  should 
put things right.
putting things right  what Nova  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 4 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4, 5 and 6 from Mr Cs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7, 8 and 9 should  be removed from 
Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Nova to take off tax from this interest. Nova must give Mr C a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. Novaloans  Ltd should  
put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 February  2020.
