DRN-4248823
The complaint
Mr N complains about a limitation and a returned payment on his account with PayPal 
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal). 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
For me to say PayPal did something wrong when limiting an account, Id need to be 
satisfied that they failed to act within the terms of the accounts User Agreement. Or, 
if I feel like they did work within these, that it was unfair for it to limit the account in 
the circumstances of this complaint. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
Ive seen the reasons for the limitation on Mr Ns account and Im satisfied these are 
fair and in keeping with the terms of the User Agreement.
Having said that, PayPal did reverse a payment that Mr N didnt ask it to when he 
reported a dispute on another transaction. This payment was for Mr Ns car 
insurance, and I can understand the trouble and upset this caused Mr N when 
PayPal refused to reverse it.
Although Mr N himself was unable to make the payment again because of the 
limitation, PayPal shouldve sent the payment back to the merchant when Mr N 
notified it of the mistake.  
PayPal also withheld the money for a period which caused Mr N to further worry. Im 
satisfied this payment shouldnt have been included in the money held by PayPal as 
part of the limitation of the account and Mr N should be compensated given what Ive 
said above.
Having considered the initial mistake and the impact it had, and the delays in 
returning the money to Mr N, I find the £150 the investigator has recommended fairly 
compensates Mr N for the trouble and upset it caused.  
Putting things right
PayPal should pay Mr N £150 compensation for the reasons Ive given above. 
My final decision
My final decisions is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
and direct it to pay Mr N £150. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 August 2023.
