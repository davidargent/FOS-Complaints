K821x#15complaint
Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent QuickQuid and Mr H my provisional decision on 6 March 2019.  A copy of it is attached  
and forms part of this final decision. The full background to the complaint in set out in the 
provisional decision and its appendix  so I wont reiterate that there.
I asked both parties to let me know if they had anything to add. Mr H confirmed he had 
nothing else to add. QuickQuid responded with some additional points  for me to consider, so 
Ive considered these  points   as well as everything previously provided  below.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr Hs case.
Im afraid a number of the points QuickQuid  made  in response to my provisional decision are 
not new and so I dont intend  to address them in a great deal of detail.
QuickQuid hasnt commented on what I said about proportionate checks for loans 3a-5 and 
what such checks would likely have shown. It has reiterated what its own checks  for these 
loans showed,  but as I found these checks were  not proportionate, theres no reason 
repeating this information should change my provisional findings.
For loans 6 and 7, I said that QuickQuid should reasonably have  realised, from the pattern of 
lending alone,  that further lending would be unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful.
QuickQuid had the following to say about  loan 6:
During the time Mr [H] held loan 6, I can see that he was able to repay this without any late 
fees assessed to his account. In fact, I can see that he was able to repay  this loan in full 
before the contractual payoff date. I can see that the loan was due to be paid in full on 02 
March 2017 and Mr [H] was able to repay this loan in full on 06 February  2017.
And in respect  of loan 7, it said:
There was a breaking period of 92 days before Mr [H] requested loan 7. If there were any 
kind of financial instability,  I believe this break  in lending was enough time to regain  financial 
stability. Additionally,  the loan amount requested decreased by £350.00.
So QuickQuid hasnt  clearly responded to my finding that the pattern of lending alone  was 
enough to establish that loans 6 and 7 were not likely to be sustainable. And it hasnt clearly 
challenged my finding that, the overall pattern of lending increased [Mr Hs] indebtedness in 
a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and he lost out as a result.
I take it that the references to the early repayment of loan 6 and the breaking  period between 
loan 6 and 7 mean that QuickQuid doesnt accept the pattern of lending  here was indicative 
of a problem.
Ref: DRN52745342I accept that Mr H usually  repaid QuickQuid on time.  But hed been borrowing  from it for a 
year up to this point and was still borrowing  large  amounts. So although Mr H settled  some  
of his earlier loans  on or before time, hed not freed  himself of the need to keep borrowing. 
I remind QuickQuid that, when looking at a lending  history, how a loan was repaid is just as 
important a consideration as whether a loan was repaid.  I accept successful repayment of a 
short-term loan may well mean  it was repaid  sustainably  depending on the other factors  in 
play. But QuickQuid is aware  that this service  considers repeat lending  to be an indication 
that short-term loans are not being  repaid sustainably  particularly where a large number of 
short-term loans are taken out with little break between them. I also bear in mind  the 
purpose of short-term loans is to meet  a short-term need and that they are not generally 
considered suitable for those in need  of a long-term financial solution.
So I dont  consider that Mr H repaid loan 6 on time or early to be an indicator that the loan 
was automatically sustainable.  I accept loan 7 was £350 smaller than loan 6. But I dont think  
a 92 day gap is significant in the context of someone whod been indebted to QuickQuid for 
around 15 months. I think the proximity  of loan 7 to loan 6 still suggests Mr H wasnt  settling 
his loans sustainably   and this is borne out by what happened with loan 7. Mr H wasnt able 
to repay  it, and as far as I know  still hasnt.
The points raised by QuickQuid havent  persuaded me to depart from my provisional 
findings. So Im upholding Mr Hs complaint  part for the reasons given above and in my 
provisional decision.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 3a to 6b;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 3a-5 from Mr Hs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 means  any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 6-7a should  be removed from Mr Hs credit file.
I understand there is still an outstanding  balance  on loan 7/7a. So QuickQuid  should  remove 
all interest and charges  from the balance and treat any payments made as if they were 
payments towards  the principal. QuickQuid may then offset what it owes Mr H against the 
balance of loan 7/7a. It may only offset in this way if it still owns the debt.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Mr H a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN52745343my final decision
I uphold the complaint in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 April 2019.

complaint
Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC,  trading  as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr H had seven loans with QuickQuid, three of which were  topped up. Ive set out some of the 
information QuickQuid provided about the loans in a table which is attached as an appendix to this 
decision.
An adjudicator has considered this complaint and recommended it be upheld in respect of loans 3a-
7a. QuickQuid  didnt agree  with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide. 
Theres been  no further dispute  about  loans 1-3, so I wont be considering those  in my decision  
unless Mr H makes further representations.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website  and Ive 
taken this into account in deciding  Mr Hs case. 
Im planning to uphold Mr Hs complaint about loans  3a-7a  and have explained why below.
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr H could repay his loans 
in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Mr Hs income and expenditure.  With this in mind, in the early stages  of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion of their 
income 
the amount, or amounts,  due to be repaid are higher  
there is a larger number  and/or frequency of loans 
the period of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind,  I think that there are three key questions for me to consider in order to fairly 
and reasonably determine  Mr Hs complaint. These questions are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy 
itself that Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable way?  If not, would those  checks have 
shown that Mr H would have  been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase  Mr Hs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ref: DRN527453453.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other  way?
Ive carefully thought about  all of these questions and what they mean  for Mr Hs complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that 
Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those  checks have shown that Mr H 
would have been able to do so?
I do not think  the checks  QuickQuid carried out before approving loans 3a-5 were proportionate. 
For loan 3a, Mr H asked to borrow an extra £550 just one day before he was due to make a very 
modest payment of £14.40 for loan 3. That Mr H appeared to be short  of money  before making such a 
small payment ought  to have caused  QuickQuid  concern,  as should the overall size of the loan and 
largest payment relative to Mr Hs declared  monthly income (£2,000). I think it wouldve been 
proportionate for QuickQuid  to ask Mr H for some sort of evidence of his income and outgoings (such 
as, bank statements  and/or  payslips) so it had enough information  about Mr Hs financial 
circumstances to decide  what,  if anything, he could  afford to borrow at this time.
I think  the same  applies to loan 4, where  the largest repayment was almost 75% of Mr Hs net 
monthly income. There was then a two month gap to loan 5, which was a much smaller  loan. Ive 
thought about whether  this means it wouldve been reasonable for QuickQuid to make less thorough 
checks, compared to loan 4. But bearing in mind that Mr H had been persistently  borrowing from 
QuickQuid for a year at this point, I dont think a two month gap is enough to suggest  hed likely freed 
himself of the need to borrow repeatedly.
Ive looked at proof  of Mr Hs income and expenditure,  including his bank statements. I think its 
reasonable to rely on these  in the absence of any other evidence.
Ive seen that around the time of loan 3a, Mr H received  salary, tax credits and payments from his 
partner (which I take to be contributions towards the household costs) averaging  around £3,500 a 
month. The largest payment  Mr H had to make to QuickQuid was £862.
At this time Ive seen  that Mr Hs expenditure included  rent of £1,150 a month  much higher than 
hed declared. He also had childcare costs of at least £600 a month, £120 for council  tax and a 
regular loan payment of £235. He was also paying another high-cost  creditor around £1,000 a month. 
Taking only this expenditure  which  isnt a comprehensive  list  into account shows Mr H didnt have 
enough disposable income to sustainably  make the largest repayment of £862.  Ive also noted that Mr 
H was borrowing large sums from friends, suggesting  he wasnt able to meet his existing 
commitments  let alone  new commitments  from his own income.
Mr Hs income varied,  but Ive continued to use the higher figure  of £3,500  (rather than what Mr H 
declared) for loan 4 to take account of this as I think it represents a fair average for this period.  For 
loan 4, Mr Hs highest repayment was £1,498. As this is even higher  than the repayment  for loan 3a, 
Ive considered whether  QuickQuid wouldve seen that Mr Hs circumstances had changed since loan 
3a was approved. I think it wouldve seen a decrease  in what  he was due to repay  other high-cost 
lenders; he typically was repaying  around £530 a month to a regular  high-cost  creditors and an 
instalment loan. But even taking this into account,  I dont think a repayment of £1,498 wouldve 
appeared to be something Mr H wouldve been able to pay without borrowing again as he still didnt 
have this much disposable  income in a typical month.
Loan 5 was much smaller   with the largest repayment being just £308. Ive considered 
Mr Hs bank statement  for October 2017, to see whether his expenditure  decreased, but Ive still seen 
that his typical expenditure was at least £3,000 a month  and in this month his total income was 
closer to £3,000. Hed also borrowed £1,300 from another high-cost creditor.  On balance, I dont  think  
it wouldve been reasonable  for QuickQuid to conclude  for this that further lending wouldve likely 
been sustainable affordable for Mr H.
Ref: DRN52745346So Im planning to uphold Mr Hs complaint about loans  3a to 5 because  I dont think  that QuickQuid 
carried out reasonable and proportionate checks and such checks wouldve more likely than not 
shown QuickQuid that Mr H couldnt sustainably repay these  loans.
I havent recreated  individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans  6 to 7a because I dont think  
that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of lending 
increase Mr Hs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of lending.   Ive looked to see if there was a point at which 
QuickQuid should reasonably have seen that further  lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. 
And so QuickQuid should have  realised that it shouldnt have provided any further lending. Given the 
particular circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say this 
because:
Mr H continued to borrow large  amounts  (relative to his income)  including borrowing a total 
of £1,250  for loan 6  and QuickQuid ought to have realised it was likely  his indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably
Mr H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount they owed lender. And was in effect 
paying large amounts of interest  to service  this debt over an extended period
I think  that Mr H lost out because QuickQuid  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period of time
the number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Hs ability to access 
mainstream credit  and so kept him in the market for these high-cost  loans
So Im upholding Mr Hs complaint about loans 6 to 7a because  the overall  pattern of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and he lost out as a 
result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  everything provided. Having  done  so, Ive not seen anything  here that 
leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards  Mr H in some other way.  
putting things  right  what QuickQuid  needs  to do
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans  3a to 6b;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information about loans  3a-5 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 means  any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about loans 6-7a should be removed from Mr Hs credit file.
I understand there is still an outstanding balance on loan 7/7a. So QuickQuid should remove all 
interest and charges from the balance and treat any payments made as [if] they were payments 
towards the principal.  QuickQuid may then offset  what it owes Mr H against the balance of loan 7/7a.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Mr H a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
