The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as F, is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc
(NatWest) sent it a series of missed payment letters regarding its Bounce Back Loan
(BBL) when the BBL was up to date.
Fs complaint is brought to this service by its director, whom Ill refer to as Mrs S.
What happened
To briefly summarise: Mrs S received a notice from NatWest which said Fs BBL payment
hadnt been made but that Mrs S didnt need to worry because NatWest would reattempt the
payment. But the following month Mrs S received a similar notice from NatWest which again
said F hadnt made its BBL payment.
Mrs S checked Fs bank account and saw that the payment had been made to the BBL that
month. But the missed payment letters from NatWest kept coming, and shortly afterwards
Mrs S received a letter from NatWest which explained F had defaulted on its BBL agreement
such that the full outstanding balance was due. Mrs S wasnt happy about this, so she raised
a complaint on Fs behalf.
NatWest responded to Mrs S and explained that F had missed a BBL payment which had
never been caught up, and as such they didnt feel theyd acted unfairly for considering Fs
BBL as being in arrears as they had. Mrs S wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so she
referred Fs complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel NatWest had acted
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation and so didnt uphold the complaint. Mrs S
remained dissatisfied, so Fs complaint was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 22 August 2023 as follows:
The focal point of this complaint appears to be that Mrs S is unhappy with the notices and
service she received from NatWest regarding Fs BBL, which NatWests notices explained to
Mrs S was in arrears.
As such, I feel its important to note immediately that F did miss a payment towards its BBL
and so was in arrears on the loan. Specifically, Fs BBL account statements show that F
didnt make the December 2021 BBL payment. And while F did make subsequent monthly
payments towards the BBL, it never caught up on the December 2021 payment that it
missed, meaning that the loan remained in arrears.
Mrs S has complained that NatWests notices said that NatWest would reapply for the
missed payment, but that NatWest never did. But ultimately, I feel it was Mrs Ss
responsibility, as the director of F, to ensure the BBL payments were made and that the BBL
agreement was adhered to. And if NatWest didnt take the missed payment, for whatever
reason, it was for Mrs S to make Fs payment so that the arrears of Fs account was cleared.
Mrs S has also complained that a few months after the December 2021 missed payment and
after being told NatWest would reapply for it, she spoke with NatWest and asked why F was
still receiving letters saying that a payment had been missed. And Mrs S has also said the
NatWest agent she spoke with couldnt give her an answer as to why F were receiving the
letters it was.
NatWest have no record of such a call, and the only contact notes that have from the month
Mrs S has said the conversation took place is an outbound call they made to Mrs S where
Mrs S said she wasnt available to talk and would call NatWest back. However, like what Ive
explained above, and regardless of whether NatWests call notes are accurate or not, I feel it
was Mrs Ss responsibility, as Fs director, to have known that a scheduled payment hadnt
been made towards Fs BBL and that the BBL was in arrears, and to have taken the required
action to clear Fs BBL arrears - which Mrs S didnt do.
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly by following the BBL
arrears process that they have  because ultimately Fs BBL was in arrears.
Mrs S is also unhappy with the service and communication she received from NatWest
surrounding this matter, including the notices she received and the conversations she had
with several NatWest staff. But NatWest dont have record of many of the conversations that
Mrs S refers to, and Mrs S hasnt provided any evidence of these conversations, for instance
in the form of call records from the phone number she used to contact NatWest.
Conversely, NatWest have provided contact notes relating to F to this service. And these
notes show that NatWest attempted to contact Mrs S about Fs BBL on several occasions
following the December 2021 missed payment, but without success.
Where the testimonies of two parties contradict one another, as they do in this instance, I
must decide  if I feel its reasonably possible to do so  which version of events I feel is
most likely to have happened, on balance, and in consideration of all the information
available to me. And, in this instance, given the information provided by NatWest and the
lack of corroborating evidence provided by Mrs S, as described above, I find NatWests
position to be the more plausible.
Finally, Mrs S has explained that NatWest have recently contacted her about overcharges
on her BBL that she feels should be considered in the context of this complaint. However,
the overcharges that Mrs S refers to dont relate to Fs BBL but instead to a different loan
that F held with NatWest, and so arent relevant here.
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have done anything wrong or acted unfairly
here as Mrs S contends. And it follows from this that my provisional decision will be that I
wont be upholding this complaint.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mrs S and NatWest the opportunity to respond 
and to provide any comments or new information they might wish me to consider before I 
moved to issue a final decision. NatWest confirmed they had no further submissions they 
wanted to make, whereas Mrs S didnt respond.As such, in the absence of any comments or new information, I see no reason not to issue a 
final decision whereby I do not uphold this complaint on the basis described above. And I 
therefore confirm that I do not uphold this complaint accordingly. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask F to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 October 2023.
