K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains about the administration  by Clydesdale Bank  Plc of  his mortgage  
account. Mr M believes that its not been calculated  correctly. Mr M would like 
compensation of £5,000 for the time and trouble  its caused him and £2,000 per day 
if its impacted his credit rating. Mr M would also like the bank to  rework/recalculate 
the figures  from 2009 and pay him interest  on his losses.
background
Mr M took out a mortgage  with Clydesdale in 2009 for £41,475 on  a repayment 
basis. The mortgage was on a fixed rate product until April 2011 Mr M took out a 
further fixed rate product until June 2016. After  this the interest  rate went  onto the 
Standard Variable  Rate (SVR).
Mr M says:
The payment of £230.33 quoted in his mortgage offer in 2009 was calculated 
incorrectly and believes that it should be £230.30 so he believes that hes 
been making overpayments.
In the mortgage offer dated 13 April 2011  Clydesdale quoted a mortgage 
balance of £39,500 and Mr M believes  that it was never that figure and should 
have been £39,258.90. Mr M said this caused him  an initial loss and further  
loss in the monthly payments.
Mr M believes that the monthly payment  figure quoted  in the mortgage offer of 
13 April 2011  should be £231.02 and not £232.52
Mr M believes that the payments  that Clydesdale  requires him to pay on  the 
SVR are too high.  Mr M says that from August 2016  he was asked to pay  
£239.02 when he believes the correct monthly payment  should  be £237.03.
When the SVR changed in September  2016  Mr M was asked  to pay £234.56  
per month when he should have been  asked to pay £232.60 per month.
In December 2017 after a change to the SVR Mr M was asked to pay £238.74 
when he should  have been asked to pay £236.63.
Mr M has been paying by standing  order  rather than Direct Debit because he 
doesnt accept that the amount  being  quoted by Clydesdale  is correct.
Our investigator said that it wasnt  our role to carry  out audits but to insure that 
consumers are treated fairly. On that basis he didnt recommend that this complaint 
should be upheld. Mr M disagreed and asked for a review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN82704702Mr M has provided a number of calculations in support of his  complaint which Ive 
considered in detail although I havent referred  to them all in this decision.  Mr M 
believes that he has been  overcharged on his mortgage account from 2009. Ive 
listed above a summary of  the instances where he believes he  has been 
overcharged. In each  instances Mr Hs says his figures  are per loan  payment  
calculation using PMT function. Mr M has provided me with figures  he obtained from 
an online calculator  to say that the contractual monthly payments the bank has 
asked him to pay are incorrect. 
In support of his complaint, Mr M asked  me to consider the mortgage offer of 2009  
as evidence that the banks calculations are incorrect. Section 5 of the mortgage  
says that Mr M who was borrowing £41,475.00  would have to pay pack over  the 
period of the loan £71,957.40 which  the bank says is £1.73 for every £ borrowed.  Mr 
M says thats  incorrect.  My calculation is that its £1.73  to the nearest penny. 
As this section  of the mortgage offer was for illustration purposes only, to give Mr M 
an idea of the cost of the mortgage over 25 years, I wouldnt have  expected the bank 
to show the figure calculated to the final decimal point  but rather  rounded to the 
nearest penny which it appears to have  done.  This doesnt support Mr Ms view that 
the banks  calculations are incorrect. 
Mr M also asked me to consider a mortgage offer of 13 April 2011 as again showing 
the banks  inaccurate figures, The bank stated  that Mr M would have  to pay back  
£1.63 for every £ borrowed. On my calculations thats correct rounded to the nearest 
penny. Again this doesnt support  Mr M. 
Although Mr M can show  that the calculation of the monthly payments on the online 
calculator is different than the banks  there is no evidence that  the banks  calculation  
is incorrect. Clearly this is quite a complex calculation as the debt is being amortised 
over a number of years  and both interest  and capital are being paid down. 
The bank  is in the business of selling mortgages and is regulated in  that by the 
Financial Conduct Authority. Fundamental to that regulated activity  is the production 
of accurate figures for the contractual monthly  payments. Because of that  regulation  
customers should be able to rely on the figures produced by the bank as accurate.  
Unless there is a manifest error in its calculation  we wouldnt expect the bank  to 
produce the basis of its calculations for each customer on  an individual basis. 
Although I recognise the online  tool is producing a different  figure than the bank,, Mr 
M has produced no supporting documentation  to show that the Clydesdale figure  is 
wrong and the online calculation correct in respect of the repayments on his  
mortgage. In that event, as Clydesdale is subject to regulation, I think its reasonable 
for me to accept the figure from the bank.  
The other issue  that Mr M raised is that he was charged interest on a figure  of 
£39,500 when the figure should have been  £39,258.90  in April 2011. The higher 
figure appears in the mortgage offer and seems to  be based on the approximate 
balance in the preceding month.  This doesnt  appear unusual as the balance will 
change between applying for the mortgage  product and the new offer issuing.  But I 
Ref: DRN82704703looked at the mortgage statements and there  is no evidence that  Mr M was being 
charged interest on a higher  balance  than was the case.  
So, although Ive carefully  considered Mr Ms complaint and recognise the strength 
of feeling he has about it, I cant fairly uphold this complaint.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to 
accept or reject my decision before 26 December 2019.
