The complaint
 Mr L, a sole trader, complained because PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA put a restriction on 
his account. He provided the evidence which PayPal requested, but PayPal didnt promptly 
remove the restriction.
 
What happened
 Mr L set up a PayPal account in early 2020, and sold some items online. On 1 May 2020, 
PayPal asked Mr L for proof that some of the items had been delivered, and it put a 
restriction on Mr Ls account. This meant he couldnt withdraw the money which the buyers 
had sent. This was over £3,000.
Mr L said he provided the information PayPal wanted, many times, but PayPal didnt remove 
the restriction. He contacted this service.
On 9 June PayPal issued a final response to Mr L. It pointed out that the PayPal User 
Agreement said that a limitation could be placed on an account at any time. But it said it had 
now reviewed the information provided, and it had removed the restriction that day. So Mr L 
could withdraw his money.
But on 9 September 2020, Mr L contacted this service again. PayPal had put another 
restriction on his account. Mr L said that this time the amount he couldnt withdraw was only 
£85, but PayPal wouldnt release this and were asking for the same information hed already 
provided.
Our investigator contacted PayPal, and forwarded the information which Mr L had already 
sent to PayPal. She asked what was outstanding, and PayPal said that it needed information 
about Mr Ls business, including what he was selling and where he gets his supplies. The 
investigator explained to Mr L that hed need to respond to its information request, and 
PayPal would then need to review that information and respond.
But the investigator didnt think PayPal had treated Mr L fairly in the way it had handled the 
matter. Mr L had provided information in May 2020, and had thought the matter was 
resolved. But there was now another request for information, which should have been 
requested and resolved back in May 2020. So she thought PayPal should pay Mr L £150 
compensation for distress and inconvenience.
PayPal refused. It said it had limited Mr Ls account in order to be able to conduct an internal 
review  which was permitted in the terms and conditions. PayPal said the review had 
shown that the information Mr L had provided was unsatisfactory, which was why the 
account had been limited. It said it had provided Mr L with the correct information on how to 
submit the information it needed, and had released Mr Ls money. PayPal didnt agree it 
should pay compensation and asked for an ombudsman decision. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 First, I recognise that PayPal has the power to request more information from its users, and 
to put limits onto accounts while it investigates. So I cant say, as Mr L would ideally like, that 
PayPal should stop locking his account. And PayPal told the investigator that it now needs 
more information about his business, including what he sells and where he gets his supplies 
 which its entitled to request. Mr L will need to provide this before PayPal can review his 
account again.
But I can also see that Mr L has had a great deal of frustration trying to sort this out. Hes 
sent us evidence of the chats, where he tried to get the restrictions removed, and didnt get 
helpful replies. Mr L said he repeatedly sent PayPal evidence of the deliveries, but kept 
being asked for the same information again. His frustration is very clear, both from the chat 
messages, and in what hes told this service.   
I recognise that PayPal said it had provided Mr L with the correct information on how to 
submit the information it needed. But PayPal hasnt provided any evidence to show exactly 
what had been unsatisfactory, or that it had indeed clearly communicated this to Mr L. Mr L 
would have found it particularly frustrating when, after submitting evidence multiple times, 
and thinking the problem had eventually been sorted out in June 2020, he found that PayPal 
had restricted the account again. PayPal was asking for more information, and it hasnt told 
either Mr L or this service that this was because of any new circumstances. Its not clear to 
me why PayPal didnt request the business information it now needs, back in May or June 
2020.
So I consider that Mr L suffered distress, inconvenience, and frustration when he sent the 
information PayPal requested on multiple occasions, and didnt get clear information about 
what was missing. And even after he thought it was resolved, his  account was restricted 
again in September 2020, without a clear reason about what had now changed. So I find that 
PayPal should pay Mr L £150 compensation for the distress and inconvenience it caused 
him.
My final decision
  My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA 
to pay Mr L £150 compensation for the poor service he received, and the frustration, distress 
and inconvenience this caused him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 September 2021.
