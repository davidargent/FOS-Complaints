K820x#14complaint
Mrs L complains  that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly chased her for repayment  of a 
loan.
background  
In November 2006 Mrs L took out a loan with NatWest. It had a repayment term of 10 years.
In August  2016  she called  them to check that the repayments were  due to finish in 
November 2016,  and NatWest told her that they were. However in November 2016 she was 
told that she still owed  them  two payments, which she disputed.
NatWest chased  Mrs L for payment, and closed her accounts with them.  They also wrote  to 
her husband  and advised him that they would close their joint account unless Mrs L was 
removed as a joint account holder.
In July 2018 NatWest  sent Mrs L a letter informing her that she was due a refund of £422.99,  
and that they had used  this to offset  her debt with them. She then received a cheque for an 
additional £267.43 they said they owed her too. 
Mrs L complained to NatWest. She disputed that she had an outstanding debt and felt the 
bank werent entitled to keep any of her refund.
NatWest didnt think theyd done anything wrong. They felt the refund had put Mrs L back in 
the position she would have been  in had they not applied the interest and charges it related 
to. And they said that they were  entitled  to use this money to offset  the outstanding balance  
on her loan.
Mrs L brought her complaint to our service. Our investigator explained that NatWest hadnt 
been aware that they were going to issue a refund to Mrs L during the period they were  
chasing her for the debt. And they felt it was reasonable NatWest had pursued the debt and 
that theyd used their rights to offset the refund they issued against it.
Mrs L disagrees. She has now accepted that she had missed repayments on her loan. But 
she feels NatWest should have told her about  this sooner, and had a number of 
opportunities to recognise their mistake. Shes also upset  that theyve pursued her for money 
to settle her debt with them  for 2 years  before informing her about  this refund. Shes 
explained that their pursuit of the debt left her feeling  harassed  and unwell. So the case has 
been passed to me to review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I know  Mrs L will be disappointed, but I 
agree with our investigator that NatWest acted reasonably when  they pursued this debt. Ill 
explain why.
I appreciate Mrs L disputed that she owed NatWest money on her loan, and felt so strongly  
about this that she refused to pay them the amount they told her was due. Shes told us that 
they made a mistake  when they failed  to let her know that she missed  a repayment in 
October 2013. And still didnt inform her of this when she called in August 2016 to check her 
Ref: DRN32088052loan was due to be fully repaid in November that year. Ive already  explained  separately  to 
the parties why I cant consider these specific events here because  they were referred to us 
out of time, and our jurisdiction rules  dont allow us to.
I understand Mrs L has now acknowledged  that statements show  two repayments were  
missed on her loan. But she is understandably upset that NatWest  pursued her for this debt 
as they have now issued her with a refund that offset it. If NatWest had issued this refund  
sooner, she probably  wouldnt have been chased  for the debt - or at least  not for as long as 
she was. 
Mrs L says that shed told NatWest previously  that they owed her money. But she wouldnt 
have been aware  of the refund NatWest issued in relation to her loan in July 2018, as 
NatWest hadnt  previously identified it was owed  or communicated anything about it to her. I 
can see from the account notes NatWest have provided that at one point a payment 
protection insurance claim was discussed.  But even  if Mrs L considered  that NatWest owed 
her money in relation to other matters, that doesnt affect the status of this loan.
Looking at the final response  letter NatWest  sent to Mrs L about  this matter, I think  that they 
could have better explained  what had happened and why this refund was due. So I can 
understand why Mrs L may not be clear  about  whats gone on here.  But essentially NatWest 
discovered that they hadnt correctly notified  her about some  interest  and charges that had 
been applied  to her loan account, and so felt it was fair to refund them.
I appreciate that because  of the circumstances  around the disputed loan balance, this is 
especially frustrating for Mrs L. But NatWest werent  aware  of this at the time they were  
chasing her for the debt. And I will add that this was something of an industry- wide issue 
that affected many lenders, not just NatWest. 
Mrs L had missed some repayments which meant her loan hadnt  been repaid in full. So I 
cant say that NatWest acted unreasonably when they pursued for this outstanding  sum. 
NatWest used part of the refund she was due to clear Mrs Ls debt. I understand why she 
was unhappy  about this as at this time she still doubted that she owed them any money.  But 
NatWest were entitled use their right to offset this redress against the debt owed. And in 
doing so, and issuing Mrs L with a cheque for the remainder of the refund,  they were  putting 
her back  in the same financial  position  she would have been in if they hadnt  added the 
interest and charges it related  to. So Im satisfied Mrs L hasnt suffered any financial loss 
here. 
Mrs L feels she has been harassed by the manner of NatWests  pursuit  of her debt. But in 
looking at whats happened here I havent seen any evidence that they acted unreasonably. 
I appreciate Mrs L will be very disappointed with my decision. And I dont  underestimate the 
distress and upset shes experienced here.  But in this case,  I think NatWest acted fairly and 
reasonably based on their knowledge  at the time.  So I cant fairly find that they did anything 
wrong.
