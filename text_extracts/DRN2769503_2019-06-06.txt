Miss R complains about the way NewDay Ltd (trading as Aqua)  handled a chargeback  
request. 
background 
Miss R booked a trip using her Aqua credit card. But because  of a computer issue it wasnt  
clear whether the first booking went through on 9 February 2018. As a result,  Miss R paid 
again. Miss R was charged  for both bookings but the retailer refunded one of them on 
15 February 2018. 
Miss R was due to travel on 1 March 2018  but says she didnt receive confirmation from the 
retailer that her booking had gone through. As a result, Miss R says she didnt use the 
holiday shed booked. 
Miss R contacted Aqua on 12 March 2018 to raise a chargeback request. Aqua temporarily 
refunded the transaction. Around a month later the merchants bank responded and said it 
had already refunded one of the bookings made and that Miss R had used the services she 
paid for with the other payment. 
On 24 May 2018 Aqua  sent Miss R some forms to complete in order  to proceed with the 
chargeback request. Aqua  says the forms gave  Miss R 14 days to respond before her claim 
would be closed. 
Aqua says because  it didnt hear back from Miss R it closed the claim on 11 June 2018  and 
reapplied the transaction to her account.  Aqua  says it spoke to Miss R on 20 June 2018 and 
she confirmed she had sent the forms back. The forms  were received on 26 June 2018. 
Miss R complained on 19 October 2018  but there  was a delay  in responding. Aquas since  
made Miss R an offer of £50 because  of the way it handled her complaint. 
Miss R asked us to look into her complaint and it was passed to an investigator. The 
investigator didnt  ask Aqua to refund the payment  as it didnt receive a response from 
Miss R within  14 days  after it wrote  to her on 24 May 2018. Miss R didnt agree with the 
investigators view and asked to appeal so her complaints  been  passed to me to make a 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The circumstances of Miss Rs complaint have been somewhat complicated by the fact she 
initially made two payments to book a trip. But I can see from the statements that the 
merchant refunded one of the payments a few days after it was made.  
The chargeback request  Miss R made  was in relation to the other  payment she made. From  
what Ive seen, the key issue  here is that Aqua sent Miss R important information  about her 
chargeback claim on 24 May 2018 but didnt  receive  a response within the 14 day time limit. 
Thats the point  the chargeback claim was closed down. 
Ref: DRN27695032Weve asked Aqua for a copy of the information it sent Miss R on 24 May 2018 but it hasnt  
been able to supply a copy. However, I can see from Aquas correspondence  notes that it 
wrote to Miss R on 24 May 2018. The note says Repress (Representment)  docs  issued to 
cardholder to be reviewed.  
On 8 June 2018 Aquas notes say that no repudiation response received. As a result,  
Miss Rs chargeback claim was closed.  Aquas contact  notes  for 20 June 2018 say 
customer called as she has sent the repudiation form back  to us last week.  Advised her we 
havent received  it yet
It would be better if we had a copy of the information  Aqua sent to Miss R on 24 May 2018 
but I think we can proceed  without  it. Thats  because  Im satisfied from what Ive seen that 
Aqua did send important information about Miss Rs chargeback request to her on 
24 May 2018. The contact notes show on 20 June  2018 Miss R confirmed shed received the 
information and sent the form required back the week before.  Aquas notes  show  the 
information was received  on 26 June  208. But by then the 14 day deadline had run out and 
the chargeback  claim had been  closed. And I can see that Aqua had already debited 
Miss Rs credit card for the disputed amount on 11 June 2018. 
The investigator said that its unlikely that the chargeback wouldve been successful in any 
case. But I think the key issue here is that Aqua didnt receive the information  it needed  
within the deadline set. Thats why this chargeback  claim didnt proceed. 
I agree  there were delays responding to Miss Rs complaint and Im pleased Aqua has 
recognised that and offered £50. I leave it to Miss R to decide whether she wishes  to accept 
Aquas offer.  
Taking everything Miss R and Aqua have provided into account,  I havent been persuaded to 
uphold this complaint.  Im satisfied that Aqua wrote  to Miss R on 24 May 2018 and asked for 
a response within 14 days but didnt receive  it. Im also satisfied that Miss R did receive  the 
information Aqua sent because she confirmed that during a call on 20 June 2018. The 
information was returned to Aqua on 26 June 2018  but by that point it was too late as the 
chargeback claim was closed. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint  beyond the £50 NewDay Ltd has offered. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 July 2019.
