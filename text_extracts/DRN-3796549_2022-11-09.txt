The complaint
Mrs N is unhappy with how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA handled a claim she made 
under its buyer protection program. 
What happened
Mrs N has explained that she purchased a bed online  paying £179.99 for it. However, she 
has said that when the bed arrived, the item wasnt as it had been described on the relevant 
website. Mrs N has explained that the bed was missing some fabric, didnt have drawers that 
she had paid for, and wouldnt assemble. Because of this, Mrs N raised a claim under 
PayPals buyer protection program, on 22 January 2022.
Five days later, on 27 January 2022, PayPal contacted Mrs N and said that the website she 
had purchased the bed from had agreed to provide a full refund once the bed had been 
returned to it. PayPal said that Mrs N needed to initiate the return shipment and upload the 
tracking information in the Resolution Centre before 7 February 2022. PayPal then said that 
once the website Mrs N purchased the bed through confirmed it had received the item, a 
refund would be provided to Mrs N, and her claim would be closed.
However, Mrs N has said this wasnt what happened. Instead, her claim was closed, with 
PayPal finding in the sellers favour. So, Mrs N didnt receive a reimbursement of the 
£179.99 she had paid.
PayPal said this was because Mrs N failed to comply with its shipping requests in a timely 
manner. And it said Mrs N didnt provide it with valid shipping information. Both of which it 
said were requirements of its buyer protection program. 
Mrs N didnt think it was correct  or fair. She said that she had uploaded information to the 
resolution centre on 7 February 2022, including an invoice from the courier company she 
had arranged to return the bed through. Mrs N said she also spoke to PayPal and told it the 
bed would be delivered to the seller on 8 February 2022, which it said wasnt a problem. And 
a refund would be provided to her following the bed arriving with the seller on 8 February 
2022. 
Mrs N said the bed was delivered on 8 February 2022 as expected. And she provided 
evidence of this to PayPal. But PayPal then didnt reimburse her with the £179.99. Instead, 
PayPal said that Mrs N needed to have provided a valid tracking number for the delivery. 
And whilst Mrs N had given other information, she hadnt given a valid tracking number. So, 
PayPal said it wouldnt be providing the reimbursement. 
Mrs N was unhappy with this. She said the courier company didnt provide tracking numbers, 
and she was told by PayPal that other proof of delivery would be accepted. Because Mrs N 
was unhappy, she raised a complaint with PayPal. 
PayPal considered the complaint but maintained its position on the matter. So, Mrs N 
referred her complaint to this service for an independent review. 
Our investigator considered this complaint and didnt think it should be upheld. They said 
PayPal had acted in line with the PayPal user agreement, when not finding in Mrs Ns 
favour. Our investigator said Mrs N hadnt provided the necessary information before 7 
February 2022. And that the relevant terms and conditions required a tracking number to 
PayPal  which Mrs N didnt provide. So, he didnt recommend PayPal did anything 
differently.
Mrs N didnt agree. She said she had returned the bed and had proof of this. And now the 
seller had both the bed, and her money. So, she was out of pocket by £179.99. In addition, 
to £60 she had needed to pay the courier to return the bed.
Because Mrs N didnt agree, this complaint has been referred to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision to the parties. In this I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im intending on upholding this complaint, and requiring PayPal to issue the 
refund of £179.99. Plus 8% interest, simple per annum, from the date PayPal received a 
copy of the delivery note, to the date of settlement, less any tax properly deductible. Ive 
explained why Im intending to decide this below.
Ive reviewed the user agreement that Mrs N agreed to, when using PayPal. And having 
done so, I can see that this explains PayPals buyer protection programme. The buyer 
protection program notes that, where applicable, it will entitle the buyer to a full 
reimbursement of the purchase price paid for an item, plus any original shopping costs.
One such situation is where the item received is significantly not as described. Mrs N has 
said the bed was missing some fabric, as well as drawers. And it wasnt possible to 
assemble the item. Neither party has disputed this would meet the criteria for being 
significantly not as described. And therefore, that Mrs N can raise a claim under the buyer 
protection program for this. So, I havent considered that any further.
Instead, Ive considered whether PayPal came to a fair decision to find in the sellers favour 
 given the terms and the PayPal Buyer Protection Program and the other information 
provided. And I dont think it did.
PayPals terms and conditions note that Mrs N must respond to PayPals requests for 
documentation or other information, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to 
a claim for reimbursement. PayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party 
evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specified. You must respond to 
these requests in a timely manner, as requested in our correspondence with you.
Ive reviewed the correspondence PayPal sent to Mrs N.
An email Mrs N was sent on 27 January 2022.This said Mrs N needed to initiate the return 
shipment and upload the tracking information in the Resolution Centre before 7 February 
2022. So, the return of the item had to be arranged before 7 February 2022. Its important to 
highlight that initiating the return isnt the same as having completed the return at that point. 
Mrs N was able to return the item after 7 February 2022, as long as she had proof shed 
arranged it.
Based on the information Ive received; I cant see that Mrs N had initiated the return and 
uploaded tracking information before 7 February 2022. Mrs N initiated the return and provided information for it on 7 February 2022. So, she didnt respond before 7 February 
2022 as requested, in line with the terms. 
But I also need to consider what is fair and reasonable here. Mrs N did initiate the return and 
provide information on the return on 7 February 2022. Im aware of this because Ive listened 
to a phone call between Mrs N and PayPal on 7 February 2022. Mrs N told the 
representative the return was arranged and that the courier was due to pick up the bed, and 
deliver it to the seller the next day, on 8 February 2022. The PayPal representative told Mrs 
N that whilst the claim had been closed, it would be able to look further into it.
The representative said that once the bed was delivered the next day, Mrs N could provide 
evidence of the item being delivered, such as a confirmation letter after delivery. And at that 
point the claim will be reopened and decided in Mrs Ns favour. 
Im also aware Mrs N was told she didnt need to provide a tracking number, but other 
evidence would be fine. In an online chat, Mrs N was told the following:
In order for you to be eligible for PayPal buyer protection we would need proof of the item 
being returned to the address we have provided via email. 
This proof can come in the form of a tracking number or an invoice or collections docket 
stating where the item is being delivered to and who it was collected by.
So, once Mrs N provided this information, I think PayPal should have done what its 
representative said it would, and reopen the claim, finding in Mrs Ns favour. 
Mrs N did provide this information. Mrs N provided a signed document, confirming the item 
was delivered to the address PayPal had provided. And a photo of this too. And PayPal dont 
dispute this. Given the information is in line with what Mrs N was told she would need to 
send  I dont think PayPal has acted fairly in maintaining its decision to find in the sellers 
favour. 
Mrs N has raised that she needed to pay shipping costs, to return the faulty bed to the seller. 
And I appreciate this was the case. But PayPals terms and conditions are clear. It is the 
responsibility of the buyer to pay these  as detailed below:
Comply with PayPals shipping requests in a timely manner, if youre filing a Significantly 
Not as Described claim. PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to 
the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide 
proof of delivery.
And, 
IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify 
as part of the settlement of your claim. PayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to 
reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.
Given the above, Im not intending on requiring PayPal to reimburse Mrs N for the cost of 
shipping the bed back via courier.
Mrs N responded to my provisional decision and accepted. Although she did note that she 
had paid for the bed via PayPal credit, and the £179.99 and therefore been subject to 
interest on that account. PayPal didnt respond to the provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. Neither party has provided 
any evidence or comments which alters the outcome detailed in my provisional decision or 
alters the reasoning for this. So, my decision remains the same as that noted in my 
provisional decision.
Mrs N did note that as she had paid for the bed using PayPal Credit, the £179.99 had been 
incurring interest too. And Mrs N has provided me with evidence of this. But Im satisfied the 
award Ive already detailed is fair and reasonable. It provides an amount of 8% interest from 
when I think PayPal should have accepted the dispute. This being the date it received a 
copy of the delivery note, to the date of settlement. 
This interest is and above the amount of interest charged on Mrs Ns PayPal credit account. 
So, it allows for the interest on that to be covered, as well as recognition of the time Mrs N 
has been without the funds. So, my award remains the same.
My final decision
Given the above, Im upholding this complaint, and requiring PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA to issue the refund of £179.99. Plus 8% interest, simple per annum, from the date 
PayPal received a copy of the delivery note, to the date of settlement, less any tax properly 
deductible. 
If HM Revenue & Customers requires PayPal to deduct tax from this interest, PayPal should 
give Mrs N a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if they ask for one. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs N to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 December 2022.
