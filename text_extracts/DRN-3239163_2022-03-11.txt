The complaint
Miss P and Mr R complain National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly closed their 
accounts in 2018, didnt return all the funds held, and have provided poor customer service.
To put things right, Miss P and Mr R want their funds returned and compensation for the 
poor service.    
What happened
In 2018, NatWest reviewed Miss P and Mr Rs accounts and decided to withdraw their 
banking facilities. Miss P and Mr R made enquiries at that time to withdraw their funds.
In 2020, Miss P says she was reviewing her personal details and recalled they had not been 
repaid the residual funds held in their closed NatWest account. As a result she complained 
to NatWest. 
NatWest told Miss P and Mr R it was holding onto some funds, but it would need a particular 
form completed in branch for them to be released. Miss P says she then went into branch 
and staff were not able to help her as they didnt know what form she was talking about. 
It appears several calls and correspondence were exchanged between NatWest and Miss P 
and Mr R about the matter. A few months later NatWest explained there wasnt any 
remaining funds to return as they had been withdrawn in 2018. 
Unhappy with what NatWest said Miss P and Mr R referred their complaint to this service. 
One of our Investigators then looked into the matter. 
Im aware there have been several responses between this service and Miss P in which our 
Investigators and NatWests position has changed. To keep matters simple, Ill summarise 
the most contemporaneous outcome and points:  
- NatWest reviewed and withdrew Miss P and Mr Rs banking facilities fairly and in line 
with its terms and conditions 
- They were satisfied the full closing balance was removed at one of NatWests 
branches by Mr R in 2018
- NatWest should have told Miss P and Mr R earlier in 2020, when asked, that the 
funds had been returned and not incorrectly told them funds were remaining. 
Because of this NatWest later offered £100 for poor customer service and any 
trouble and upset caused. Our investigator said this offer was fair 
Miss P and Mr R disagree. They question whether their account was settled in full and if they 
had received all the funds which remained at closure. 
It follows this matter has now been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Banks in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their 
legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of an 
existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to restrict, or in some 
cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
Because of this I dont think NatWest did anything wrong when reviewing and restricting 
Miss P and Mr Rs accounts. 
A bank is also entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with a 
bank. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the 
terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account, which NatWest and Miss P and Mr R had to 
comply with, say that it could close the account by giving them notice. And in certain 
circumstances it can close an account immediately. 
Having looked at the information given to me by NatWest - which Im under no obligation to 
disclose - Im satisfied it was entitled to close the account in the way that it has done. 
Miss P and Mr R questioned whether they received any of their money back, and later 
questioned if theyd got it all back.  
Firstly, I have seen the withdrawal slip from NatWests branch records. Having compared the 
signature on this to Mr Rs driving license, Im persuaded it was most likely he that withdraw 
the money in 2018. So Miss P was wrong to say they had not received any money. The 
withdrawal amount also matches with screenshots and statements Ive been sent by 
NatWest for the account. 
 
Theres been some confusion and ambiguity around whether the full funds were returned to 
Miss P and Mr R. Having looked at all the evidence available, Im satisfied it was. In reaching 
this determination, Ive taken into account the small overdraft on the account before a credit 
was made on the account  which I understand related to Mr Rs income. 
Ive also accounted for funds transferred from a savings account held. 
A sum of around £275 was also transferred to a suspense account which was deducted 
from the final settlement. NatWest say this was used to off-set a debit balance for one of 
Miss Ps accounts. 
Miss P disputes having had another account. Ive been sent records by NatWest which Im 
satisfied shows she did have another account and that it was in a debit balance. 
So, overall, Im satisfied, as Ive said, that NatWest did pay Miss P and Mr R the correct 
amount in 2018 to settle the accounts they held with it. 
Lastly, its clear NatWest made a mistake in 2020 when it told Miss P that it still held 
substantial funds in the account. NatWest also told Miss P and Mr R to go into branch to 
complete a form to get the funds released. This led to a sequence of events over several months of correspondence, phone calls and branch visits before NatWest realised it had 
misguided Miss P and Mr R about holding, and therefore having, their funds. 
Because of the distress and inconvenience this caused, NatWest offered Miss P and Mr R 
£100. I dont think NatWest needs to do anymore to put things right.  
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part, and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Miss P and 
Mr R £100 compensation for the reasons given above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P and Mr R 
to accept or reject my decision before 8 April 2022.
