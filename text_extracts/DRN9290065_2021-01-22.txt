K821x#15Complaint
Mr T complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA will not refund him £3,850 he paid for 
equipment he bought  on eBay. The equipment was never delivered. Mr T would like a 
refund.
Background
On 28 March 2018 Mr T bought a digger on eBay for £3,850 from a seller  I will refer to as F. 
Mr T paid for the digger  using PayPal Credit.
The machine  wasnt delivered at the agreed  time.  When Mr T contacted  F he found out that 
F was a re-seller and had not owned  the digger. F told Mr T she had transferred the money 
to the account  of the seller who I will call A who was due to deliver  the item. 
He raised a claim with PayPal on 3 April 2018 as the item didnt arrive.  PayPal  declined  the 
claim they said that Mr T had bought a vehicle  and so PayPal buyer protection  did not apply.
Mr T also made a claim under Section 75 of the Consumer  Credit Act 1974 (CCA) against  
PayPal. PayPal declined  this claim.  They said the funds were  sent to F, but the supplier of 
the goods was A. As they didnt think there was a direct relationship  between  the creditor,  
the debtor  and the supplier they didnt think Section 75 applied.
Unhappy with PayPals  response he referred the complaint to our service.
One of our investigators  looked into the complaint.  He said that the digger constituted  a 
vehicle so wasnt covered under the PayPal buyer  protection.  He also thought  that Mr T had 
a valid Section 75 claim and asked  PayPal to reconsider  their position. PayPal said they 
would look at the Section 75 claim again.  Unfortunately, PayPal didnt get in touch with Mr T 
and didnt respond to our investigator.  Our  investigator issued  his view. He said that Mr T 
had a valid Section  75 claim  and PayPal should  refund  £3,850.
PayPal disagreed they said they had worked within their terms of use. They also said there  
was no direct relationship  between the debtor, creditor and supplier as the supplier of the 
digger was A therefore Section 75 didnt apply.
As there was no agreement the matter has come  to me to decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so I have reached the same  
conclusion as the investigator for broadly the same  reasons.
Ref: DRN92900652PayPal protection
I note that Mr T bought  the digger using PayPal Credit. 
PayPal have said that the digger is a vehicle and therefore isnt covered by PayPal buyer 
protection. Having  looked at the evidence I agree with the investigator  that PayPal protection 
is not available in this case because a digger  is a vehicle.
Section 75 claim
Section 75 is also relevant to this complaint. This says,  in certain circumstances, that the 
borrower under a credit agreement has an equal right to claim against the credit provider if 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation  by the supplier of goods or services.
So, under Section 75, in certain circumstances, Mr T has an equal right to claim against 
PayPal as he does  the supplier F, if theres been a breach  of contract or misrepresentation 
by the supplier. My role isnt to decide  PayPals  liability under Section 75. Instead, as statute 
requires me to, I need to decide  whats fair and reasonable, taking into account  any relevant 
law, such as the Consumer Credit  Act 1974.  
The digger  cost £3,850  so Im satisfied  this claim falls within the financial limits of Section 75.
Ive looked at whether there  has been  a misrepresentation or breach of contract  in the 
supply of the digger. The digger was not supplied,  this is not in dispute, so I am satisfied  that 
there has been a breach of contract.
The general effect of Section 75 is that if certain conditions are met, and Mr T has a claim for 
misrepresentation or breach of contract  against  a supplier of goods or services, he can also 
bring that claim against the supplier of finance. Which here is PayPal. One of those 
conditions is that there  must be a debtor- creditor -supplier relationship (d-c-s).  Ill explain  
this in more detail later. But a key factor is that for Mr T to have a claim under Section 75 he 
must have  a contractual relationship with F. Where information is incomplete, unclear  or 
contradictory - as some of it is here -I reach  my conclusions  on the balance of probabilities.  
That is, what I think is most likely  to have happened  in light of the available  evidence and the 
wider surrounding  circumstances.
Ive thought about the d-c-s relationship here.  PayPal have said that they decline the claim 
because the supplier of the digger F was a reseller  and therefore didnt own the digger but 
was selling it on behalf of A. Mr T has said he didnt know that F was a reseller  and didnt 
know of As existence.  He contracted with F for the supply of a digger and paid F in good 
faith.
Mr T used  his PayPal Credit to pay F. I accept that F didnt have the digger  to sell but, in my 
opinion, that is no different  from a retailer contracting to sell an item and running out of stock  
or being let down by its own supplier. I also accept that Mr T was not aware that F was a 
reseller. PayPal was also not aware that F was a reseller. I am of the view that Mr T had a 
contractual relationship with F for the supply of a digger and that F did not supply  the digger 
as she was let down by her own supplier.  I am satisfied that Mr T didnt have a contractual  
arrangement with A. So, I am satisfied that the d-c-s link is not broken here. 
In my opinion, on the information that was available, PayPal was not entitled to conclude  that 
the d-c-s link was broken.  And so, PayPal did not act fairly when it declined to review Mr Ts 
Section 75 claim any further. It follows that I think the complaint should  be upheld.
Ref: DRN92900653My final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above my final decision is that I uphold the complaint. 
I require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA to refund Mr T £3,850 together with any interest 
charges incurred as a result of this payment.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 February  2021.
