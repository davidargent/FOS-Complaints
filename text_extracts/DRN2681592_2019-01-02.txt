K822xcomplaint
Miss C says Bank  of Scotland  plc (Bank of Scotland) mis-sold her a payment protection  
insurance (PPI)  policy.  
background
This complaint is about a credit  card PPI policy taken out in 2004.  The policy was added  to 
Miss Cs credit card account  when she applied for the card during a meeting at the bank.
Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint.  Miss C disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Miss Cs case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Miss Cs complaint because:
I think Bank of Scotland made Miss C aware that the PPI was optional  and that she 
chose to take it. I say this because  she made  it clear on the application form she 
signed that she wanted to take the policy out. The application form Miss C signed 
showed she had a choice. And although  the cross in the box for PPI is electronically  
populated I think  this happened  as a result of a conversation she had with a Bank of 
Scotland adviser.
I think Bank of Scotland recommended the PPI to Miss C, so it had to check  that the 
PPI was right for her and based  on what Ive seen of her circumstances at the time, I 
think that it was. For example she wasnt affected by any of the exclusions to or limits  
on the PPI cover  and she seems to have had a need for the cover  because she didnt  
have much sick pay available to her. She also didnt have any other  means to cover   
all her outgoings if she couldnt work. As Miss C had only been working for her 
employer for about six months I dont think shed have  been entitled  to much, if any, 
redundancy pay.
Its possible the information Bank of Scotland gave Miss C about  the PPI wasnt  as 
clear as it shouldve  been.  But she chose to take it out - so it looks like she wanted  
this type of cover. And it seems  like it would have been useful for her if something 
went wrong. I also havent seen any evidence to suggest that it was unaffordable for 
Miss C. So I dont  think better information  about the PPI would have put her off taking 
out the cover. 
Ive thought about everything Miss C has said - including what she has said about not 
knowing the PPI was optional and that she was given misleading  information, but these  
points dont change  my decision.
Ref: DRN26815922This means  I dont  think the PPI was mis-sold.  So Bank of Scotland doesnt need to refund 
everything Miss C paid for it. But Bank  of Scotland has already offered to give Miss C back  
some of the cost of the PPI. I dont think it needs to do anything more.  
If it hasnt  already, Bank of Scotland will make arrangements to pay Miss C now Ive issued 
my final decision. 
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 February  2019.
