K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc hasnt  been able to find his savings 
account or give him access  to his funds. Mr A has raised concerns that NatWest didnt follow 
his instructions to upgrade the account.  Mr A also complains  that NatWest  failed to tell him 
when it relocated his branch. 
background
Mr A has provided a statement to show he held a savings  account with NatWest  and in June 
1987 it had £8,482.60 in it.  
In 2015 Mr A contacted NatWest and asked  it to withdraw funds from his account. But 
NatWest wasnt able to locate an account for Mr A. Mr A complained  and NatWest explained 
its records only go back around  seven  years and it didnt have any records  to show hed 
previously sent instructions to withdraw funds  or upgrade  the account. NatWest  said it 
closed Mr As branch  in 1995 and transferred accounts held there  to another branch. 
NatWest also said that there wasnt any records of Mr As account on its dormant account 
register. 
Mr A referred his complaint to this service and an adjudicator looked at what had happened.  
She thought  NatWest had dealt with Mr As complaint fairly so didnt ask it to do anything  
else. The case closed and the original adjudicator left. But Mr A then responded and asked 
for his case  to be relooked at. As a result, its been passed to me to make a decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A has raised several complaints about what happened but I think  the focus here is on 
whether he still has savings in an account with NatWest, regardless of whether that 
accounts dormant  or not. And from what Ive seen, I dont think Mr As original savings  
account from 1987 remains open  or that NatWest still holds  his money. Ill explain why. 
I dont doubt that in 1987 Mr A had a savings account with NatWest with around £8,400 in it. 
But the evidence  Ive seen doesnt persuade  me that the account  remains open  or that the 
funds are still saved. Businesses  cant keep  information indefinitely and NatWest  has 
explained that it only retains customer  information  for seven years.  As a result,  the searches 
its completed only go back seven  years so any accounts that were opened and 
subsequently closed before that time wouldnt be located. Given  the account hasnt been  
located I think its more  likely than not that the account was closed more than seven years 
before Mr A contacted NatWest about it. 
If Mr As money was still in the savings account which had become dormant Id have 
expected NatWest to have been  able to trace it on its dormant account register.  NatWest  
has sent us evidence of all the searches its completed for Mr A and I can see that nothing  
was found on the dormant  account register. Im satisfied that NatWest has shown Mr A 
doesnt have a dormant account.  
Ref: DRN97137822Where evidence or information is incomplete  Ill base my decision on the balance  of 
probabilities. That is, what I consider most  likely to have occurred in light of the available 
evidence and the circumstances of the complaint. 
In this case, I think the absence of a record on the dormant account  register means the 
account must either be active and open  or closed. And NatWest has completed searches 
which show Mr A hasnt  held an open  account  with it in the seven years before he 
complained. As a result, I think that means  Mr As account was most likely closed before that 
time and the information about  it has since been  deleted. 
Mr A says he wasnt told when NatWest closed his branch and moved his account  to another  
branch. But I dont think thats  impacted  his complaint. If Mr As savings account had 
remained open I dont  doubt it wouldve been moved  to the new branch. But its also possible 
the savings account was closed between 1987 and 1995 when the branch closed. NatWest 
has already explained, it doesnt  hold any records from the time and I havent  found any 
evidence of an error here. 
Mr A has raised several concerns about whats happened and I want to assure  him Ive read 
everything hes said when  bringing  the complaint. But Ive focused on what I think  is the key 
issue here - whether Mr As savings account remains  open. Im sorry to disappoint Mr A but 
Im satisfied NatWest was unable to trace  his account because  it no longer exists  and was 
most likely closed more than seven years  before  he complained. As I havent found  its made  
an error so Im not telling NatWest to take any further action to resolve this complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or reject  my decision 
before 13 April 2019.
