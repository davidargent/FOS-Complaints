The complaint
Ms P complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA lent to her irresponsibly. 
What happened
In January 2020 Ms P applied for a credit account with PayPal. PayPal approved the 
application and gave Ms P a credit account with an initial credit limit of £500. 
Ms P complained that PayPal had lent to her irresponsibly.
PayPal didnt uphold the complaint. It said it had carried out proportionate checks before 
lending to Ms P.
Ms P brought her complaint to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She said that she didnt think that PayPal had 
carried out reasonable and proportionate checks but said that if they had done the checks 
wouldve shown that the lending was affordable for Ms P.
Ms P didnt agree so Ive been asked to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable lending on 
our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering Ms Ps complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say that PayPal had to carry out reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure that the lending was affordable for Ms P. These checks 
needed to be borrower focused and could involve consideration of things such as the 
amount of credit, the total amount repayable, the amount of the repayment and the 
consumers financial circumstances.
Theres no set list of checks a lender must carry out. But lenders are required to have regard 
to the factors Ive mentioned above when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate. 
PayPal has told this service that it obtained details of Ms Ps employment, residential status 
and income and expenditure. It says it carried out a credit search and used all of this 
information to determine whether Ms P could afford to repay the credit.
Ive looked at the information obtained by PayPal. Ms P told PayPal she was employed part 
time earning between £1501 and £2000 per month. Ms P also declared monthly expenditure 
of £500. Using this information, PayPal calculated that Ms P had disposable income of 
between £1000 and £1500 per month.
PayPal used a third party industry tool to check Ms Ps level of unsecured debt. This showed 
that Ms P wasnt over indebted.
Based on the information it had gathered, PayPal assessed the credit as affordable.
PayPal hasnt provided evidence of the information it relied on to make its lending decision. 
So I havent been able to look at the results of the credit checks or the information provided 
by Ms P when she applied for the account.
Because of this, Im unable to say that PayPal carried out reasonable and proportionate 
checks.
Ive therefore gone on to consider what reasonable and proportionate checks would have 
shown.
Ive reviewed a credit file provided by Ms P. This contain information which is relevant to the 
time when Ms P entered into the agreement with PayPal. This is the best evidence I have 
available for Ms Ps credit commitments at the time. Im satisfied that it shows the 
information that PayPal wouldve seen from a credit search at the time.
There are 12 active accounts on the credit file. There are some missed payments on the 
accounts but overall, it appears that Ms P was managing the accounts. There are no 
defaulted accounts or county court judgments.
The credit file shows that Ms P had around £30,000 of unsecure debt. This is a significant 
level of debt and I think Ms Ps repayments would have taken up a large part of her income. 
Its clear from the credit file that Ms Ps regular monthly expenditure was around £1500 per 
month, which is more than the £500 declared in the application. So I would have expected 
PayPal to carry out further checks to verify Ms Ps income and expenditure. It could have 
done this by looking at her bank statements. So Ive looked at these to see what PayPal 
might have discovered had it carried out these checks.
The bank statements show that Ms P received child tax credit of £933 each month, disability 
living allowance of £327 and child benefit of £192. She also received £650 each month from 
her employment. So her total average monthly income was £2103. This is broadly in line 
with what she declared to PayPal when she applied for the account.
Even though Ms Ps monthly expenditure was higher than the £500 used in PayPals 
affordability calculations, I think that even with expenditure of £1500 PayPal wouldve 
concluded that the lending was affordable for Ms P. This is because Ms P had sufficient 
monthly disposable income to afford the credit.
Based on what Ive seen, I think that reasonable and proportionate checks wouldve shown 
the credit to be affordable for Ms P. 
I understand that Ms P had some difficulties making payment to PayPal and wanted to link a 
debit card to her account. I can see that she has set up a debt management plan. The 
provider of this plan will be able to manage any payment to PayPal going forwards.
Taking everything into consideration, Im unable to say that PayPal has treated Ms P unfairly 
or that it lent to her irresponsibly. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2023.
