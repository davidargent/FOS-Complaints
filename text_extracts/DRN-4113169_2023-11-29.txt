The complaint
Mr and Mrs G have complained about a mortgage current account (MCA) reserve they hold 
with Barclays Bank UK PLC. They say the MCA reserve limit has been increased over the 
term of the mortgage with no affordability checks being carried out.
What happened
This mortgage was taken out in 2008. The original mortgage offer shows a loan amount of 
around £415,000 (plus fees), of which £95,000 was to be held on an interest only basis, with 
the rest on repayment. The term was shown as 13 years and 7 months.
As part of the mortgage an MCA was opened, and the offer said that had a reserve limit (in 
other words, a secured overdraft limit) of £66,960.
Various letters were issued over the years. Some of which being in;
July 2015 about the mortgage term coming to an end, and in that it said the MCA 
reserve debt was around £113,000,
April 2016 in which Barclays said it would be reducing the MCA reserve limit from 
£160,810 to £149,900, and
April 2017 in which Barclays said it would be reducing the MCA reserve limit from 
£170,070 to £163,200.
Both the April 2016 and April 2017 letters said:
Rebalancing  how does it work?
Your mortgage currently has a rebalancing feature. This means that your Mortgage 
Reserve limit automatically goes up as your main mortgage balance reduces either through 
normal monthly payments or any voluntary overpayments or lump sum payments.
Rebalancing provides flexibility when managing your finances but any outstanding balance 
still has to be repaid at the same time as the mortgage. It is therefore important that you 
have a plan in place to repay any outstanding Mortgage Reserve balance on or before your 
mortgage is repaid.
Depending on your repayment plans you may find it easier to manage your finances by 
removing the rebalancing feature and keeping your Mortgage Reserve at the limit agreed. 
If you do not require rebalancing on your Mortgage Reserve, please call us on [phone 
number] and we can remove it for you. The information on rebalancing in the enclosed 
leaflet may help you decide whether you would like this feature permanently removed.
Both letters gave three options. The April 2016 letter gave the choices as:
1. A limit of £149900 meets my / our current needs with the answer to that being You do 
not need to do anything The new limit will be automatically applied to your Mortgage 
Current Account on, or shortly after, 9 June 2016.
2. I / we would like a limit lower than £149900 or would like the Reserve facility removed 
with the answer to that being Please call us on [phone number] Our specialist team 
can amend the limit for you.
3. I / we would like a limit higher than £149900, but no more than £160810 with the 
answer to that being Please call us on [phone number] before 9 June 2016 Our 
specialist team can arrange this for you.
The April 2017 letter gave the choices as:
1. A limit of £163200 meets my / our current needs with the answer to that being You do 
not need to do anything The new limit will be automatically applied to your Mortgage 
Current Account on, or shortly after, 16 June 2017.
2. I / we would like a limit lower than £163200 or would like the Reserve facility removed 
with the answer to that being Please call us on [phone number] Our specialist team 
can amend the limit for you.
3. I / we would like a limit higher than £163200, but no more than £170070 with the 
answer to that being Please call us on [phone number] before 16 June 2017 Our 
specialist team can arrange this for you.
In 2021 Mr and Mrs G complained to Barclays and then referred that complaint to our 
service.
An ombudsman colleague issued a decision about our jurisdiction in August 2022. She 
summarised the complaint as:
Mr and Mrs Gs complaint is about a mortgage current account (MCA) they have with 
Barclays Bank UK Plc. They believe the account was mis-sold as they didnt want it and it 
was not suitable for their needs. In addition, they have told us that Mr G was 
inappropriately told by his relationship manager in 2011 to use the MCA reserve to fund his 
business, as it was the cheapest way to borrow. They said that they only discovered shortly 
before making their complaint that the MCA reserve needs to be repaid at the same time 
as the mortgage. They feel that they were misinformed about using the MCA reserve.
And her decision was:
My decision is that Mr and Mrs Gs complaint about their MCA being mis-sold and the 
advice Mr G received to use the reserve funds for business purposes in 2011 fall outside 
our jurisdiction. The remaining issues Mr and Mrs G have raised, and which Barclays has 
had the opportunity to consider, fall within our jurisdiction and will now be considered by 
our investigator.
The investigator set out his thoughts on the remainder of the complaint, which was that 
Mr and Mrs G were unhappy with the support Barclays offered them during Covid. Whilst 
that complaint was ongoing Mr and Mrs G raised a new point in respect of the MCA reserve. 
The new point was that the reserve limit was increased over the life of the mortgage without 
any affordability checks being undertaken. That was set up as a new complaint, which is 
what Im looking at here.Our investigator said that we could only look at the reserve limit changes in the six years 
running up to the complaint point being raised as any earlier ones hadnt been complained 
about within the time limits set out in our rules. He also said we wouldnt look again at the 
points that had been considered (or excluded) under the previous complaint Ive referred to 
above. He went on to consider the increases over the last six years and didnt uphold the 
complaint.
Mr and Mrs G didnt agree with our Investigators assessment of their complaint and said 
theyd like an ombudsman to look at everything and they mentioned things that had been 
part of the previous complaint.
As an agreement couldnt be reached it was passed to me to decide.
I issued a decision about our jurisdiction in October 2023. In that I said we wouldnt 
reconsider a complaint about the original sale of the MCA or the advice Mr G says he 
received to use the funds for business purposes, and I will only be considering the increases 
in the MCA reserve limit in the six years leading up to this complaint point being raised.
I understand Mr and Mrs G are unhappy about my decision about our jurisdiction but Im 
satisfied Ive not erred in my application of our rules, and so I wont be making any further 
comment about that or anything Ive said we wont be considering. Instead Ill just be dealing 
with the part of the complaint I said we can decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Whilst there was some reference to the MCA reserve limit increasing in previous 
correspondence, the first instance I can find of a complaint formally being raised about this 
point was when our Investigator did so with Barclays on 14 October 2022. Prior to that our 
Investigator had told Mr and Mrs G they needed to raise it as a separate complaint, but Ive 
not been provided with any evidence that they did so. That means the six-year period I can 
consider here started on 14 October 2016. 
As I cant consider what happened before October 2016, that means I cant consider what 
the original reserve limit was, or what was said about rebalancing at the time. In October 
2016 the MCA reserve limit was £156,060 so that is the starting point of my considerations (I 
cant consider what happened before then to get it to that level). I understand the limit was 
£220,160 in October 2023, an increase of £64,100.
Whilst it is earlier than the period Im able to consider for this complaint, Ill mention it here 
for completeness as it forms part of the background to explain what has happened. Barclays 
wrote to Mr and Mrs G in April 2016 to say it will be reducing the reserve limit unless 
Mr and Mrs G got in contact with it to discuss other options. Following that the limit was 
lowered in line with the letter. The same happened in 2017 and 2018, with a further 
decrease in 2020 and again in January 2021. Since January 2021 the reserve limit has 
remained the same.Mr and Mrs G have made withdrawals from the MCA reserve, with the following transactions 
for the period I can consider showing in these monthly statements:
December 2016 £5,000
January 2017 £14,000
February 2017 £3,000
March 2017 £1,500
July 2017 £2,000
September 2017 £4,000
October 2017 £1,000
December 2017 £2,500
December 2018 £1,500
January 2019 £15,000
March 2019 £3,000
April 2020 £10,000
And in the period from October 2016 to April 2022 Mr and Mrs G made the following 
payments into the account:
November 2016 £1,500
December 2019 £750
October 2019 £2,500
Then from May 2022 Mr and Mrs G started to make payments in of £250 a month.
Im satisfied that by October 2016 Mr and Mrs G were aware how this account worked and 
that the limit would increase as the main mortgage account balance went down, without 
affordability checks being completed each time. 
If Mr and Mrs G felt that wasnt the right thing for them then they didnt have to continue to 
use the account. They could have stopped withdrawing money and instead just made 
payments into it to reduce the balance. Instead, they withdrew a further £62,500, and paid in 
just £4,750 (up until April 2022).
Barclays role is to administer the account, not to manage it on behalf of Mr and Mrs G, or 
police their spending. So if Mr and Mrs G hadnt wanted the MCA debt to increase, all they 
needed to do was to stop using it once it reached the limit they were happy with and then 
maintain the interest payments. There was no obligation on the part of Mr and Mrs G to 
continue to use the MCA reserve, and I cant hold Barclays responsible for the fact that they 
did so. Mr and Mrs G have had the benefit of the funds they withdrew and, in the period Im 
able to consider, Im satisfied they were aware of the interest theyd be paying on those 
funds and that theyd need to repay them at the end of the mortgage term.
Since at least February 2015 Barclays has been writing to Mr and Mrs G to say that if they 
wanted the rebalancing feature turned off then they just needed to make contact with 
Barclays and it could be done. That would have stopped the reserve limit from increasing 
further.
There was no regulatory requirement for Barclays to carry out affordability checks on an 
ongoing basis; that was one of the features of a flexible mortgage account like this (just as it 
was with other mortgage providers that offered similar products). Having reviewed the 
contact notes Ive not seen any evidence to indicate that Mr and Mrs G made contact with 
Barclays to ask that it stop the reserve limit increases and had Mr and Mrs G done so Ive no 
reason to believe that wouldnt have happened.Whilst Ive a great deal of sympathy for the situation Mr and Mrs G found themselves in, with 
the pandemic impacting Mr Gs work and the mortgage term ending with a significant 
balance outstanding, I cant say Barclays did anything wrong here as the account operated 
as it was intended to and Barclays didnt have to carry out ongoing affordability checks.
Mr and Mrs G will need to discuss repayment of the MCA reserve with Barclays, as the 
balance is due in full, in line with the contractual terms. In this regard, I would remind 
Barclays that, where customers are in financial difficulty, the bank must treat them positively 
and sympathetically when considering repayment proposals. Furthermore, Mr and Mrs G 
need to provide full and open disclosure of their financial circumstances, in order that 
Barclays can give fair consideration to any offer of payment. But thats not something I can 
intervene in as part of this decision. Mr and Mrs G will need to discuss their payment 
proposals with Barclays. If they think the bank isnt treating them fairly in relation to their 
proposals, they may be able to bring a fresh complaint about that to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service at that time.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs G to 
accept or reject my decision before 27 December 2023.
