The complaint
Mr S complains that Tesco Personal Finance PLC trading as Tesco Bank unfairly charged 
interest on a credit card balance.
 
What happened
Mr S has a Tesco credit card. On 23 May 2021 Tesco Bank sent Mr S a credit card 
statement that said the outstanding balance was £1,685.97 and the minimum payment due 
was £50.69, to be paid by 17 June 2021. Mr S paid £1,685.97 on 10 June 2021 and cleared 
the outstanding balance in full. 
On 23 June 2021 Tesco Bank sent Mr S another credit card statement that showed he had 
cleared the previous months balance. But Tesco Bank said Mr S needed to pay £19.88 by 
18 July 2021 to cover interest applied to his account between 24 May 2021 and 23 June 
2021. 
Mr S complained and said hed cleared the outstanding balance in line with the May 2021 
statement Tesco Bank sent him. Tesco Bank didnt agree and said the interest it was asking 
him to pay was correct and covered the period between the statement dated 23 May 2021 
and Mr S payment of £1,685.97, made on 10 June 2021. 
Mr S referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They thought 
Tesco Bank had correctly calculated the interest it asked Mr S to pay. Mr S asked to appeal 
and said Tesco Bank unfairly charged interest as hed cleared the balance in full. Mr S 
explained he checked online and saw the balance displayed was £0. Mr S also told us Tesco 
Bank continued to apply interest and charges despite him disputing the outstanding balance. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Tesco Banks credit card statement dated 23 May 2021 showed Mr S owed £1,685.97 from 
the previous month. To clear the balance in full he needed to pay that amount by 17 June 
2021. And Mr S did that on 10 June 2021. I understand Mr S feels the interest of £19.88 
Tesco Bank later applied wasnt right, but I dont agree. The interest charged was in line with 
the credit cards terms and conditions. 
The credit agreement Mr S accepted says You will not pay interest on new purchases if you 
pay your balance in full and on time. Otherwise, the period over which interest is charged is 
as follows: From the date debited to your account until repaid in full. The terms go on to say 
If you pay the balance in full, any interest charged from the previous statement to the date 
of full repayment will be debited the following month.
So whilst I agree Mr S did clear his balance in full on 10 June 2021, he still needed to pay 
interest on the outstanding balance of £1,685.97 that accrued from 23 May 2021. And, in line 
with the credit agreement, interest that accrues between the previous statement balance and 
the date its cleared is debited the following month. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr S but Im satisfied Tesco Bank correctly calculated interest of 
£19.88. I know Mr S has raised concerns that Tesco Bank charged late fees and further 
interest when he didnt clear the balance. But Tesco Banks terms say it can charge late fees 
and interest when payments arent made in line with the credit agreement. 
Mr S says the way Tesco Bank applies interest is unclear and has changed over time. But 
the interest applied to Mr S credit card is in line with the credit agreement he accepted when 
it was opened. Im satisfied the terms and conditions, along with the monthly statements 
Tesco Bank sent Mr S are sufficiently clear in setting out what payments were required and 
how they were calculated. I havent seen anything to show Tesco Bank has made any errors 
in the way its applied interest or with the payments its asked Mr S to pay. As Im satisfied 
Tesco Bank dealt with Mr S complaint fairly Im not telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2021.
