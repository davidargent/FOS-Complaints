The complaint
Miss H complains that she wasnt allowed into a branch of National Westminster Bank Plc  
(NatWest) to check her account because of Covid restrictions.
What happened
In June last year Miss H tried to visit a branch of NatWest and has told us she was worried 
her account was overdrawn. Miss H has explained she was concerned about payments 
leaving her account and wanted to check everything was ok. Miss H has also told us she has 
dyslexia which means online banking isnt suitable for her and that she has concerns over 
the security of telephone banking. 
The branch advised it wasnt open for queries or transactions that could be completed online 
or on the phone due to Covid restrictions, although some customers were allowed in. Miss H 
was given the details of a NatWest helpline that specialises in giving additional support to 
customers that ask for it.
Miss H then visited another branch which let her in and provided the information and 
assistance she wanted. 
Miss H complained and NatWest apologised for the inconvenience caused but said the first 
branch had acted correctly by denying entry. NatWest said Covid restrictions meant 
customers could only come into a branch to complete specific transactions. NatWest 
apologised for any trouble and upset caused and paid Miss H £30 compensation and £12 
costs. 
Miss H referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
thought NatWest had dealt with Miss H fairly when she visited the branch and in line with 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidelines. They also thought NatWest had dealt with 
Miss Hs complaint fairly so didnt ask it to do anything else. Miss H asked to appeal, so her 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand that Miss H doesnt use online banking because of dyslexia and doesnt trust 
telephone banking. I also appreciate Miss H visits a branch when she wants to check on her 
account and ask questions. But I have to balance that against guidelines given by the FCA 
and impact of Covid on NatWests ability to operate as normal. 
I wont quote the FCA guidance again here as I can see the investigator has set it out in full 
in their findings. But Im satisfied the FCA issued guidance to banks that said customers 
should only visit branches when absolutely necessary and that alternatives, like online and 
telephone banking, should be used instead. Im satisfied NatWests decision to limit branch 
access was in line with the guidelines and I think its reasonable to say it was seeking to 
protect customers and staff during extremely unusual trading conditions. 
I understand Miss H was subsequently able to visit another branch of NatWest and enter. 
But Im satisfied the first branch was acting in line with the guidance issued by the FCA and 
NatWests approach during the pandemic. 
Miss H has told us she doesnt like using telephone banking and is concerned about being 
scammed. However, given the challenging conditions and restriction of branch access, I 
think calling NatWest was a reasonable alternative. I understand NatWest gave Miss H 
details of a specialist helpline and I think that shows its branch staff listened and were trying 
to assist her, despite being unable to let her in. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Miss H but I havent found she was treated unfairly by NatWest 
in this case. NatWest apologised for the inconvenience caused and paid her £30. NatWest 
also covered Miss Hs costs of visiting the second branch. Im satisfied thats a fair way to 
resolve Miss Hs complaint, so Im not telling it to take any further action or increase the 
award. 
 My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 July 2021.
