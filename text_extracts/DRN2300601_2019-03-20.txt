K820x#14complaint
Mr K says Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds)  mis-sold  him a Silver packaged bank account in 
2012. Hes used a Claims Management  Company (CMC) to make his complaint.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr Ks complaint  and didnt think Lloyds had mis-sold  the 
account. The CMC  disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Ks complaint.  
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Mr Ks complaint. Id like to 
explain the reasons  for my decision. I think Mr K chose to take the account. He appears to 
have had an identifiable need  for some of the main benefits and it was up to him to use 
them. 
So overall I dont  think that clearer information wouldve changed Mr Ks decision to accept 
what looks to have  been a fair recommendation made by Lloyds. And, in these 
circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Ks complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 April 2019.
