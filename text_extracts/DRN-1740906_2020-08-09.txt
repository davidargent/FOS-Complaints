The complaint
Mr R complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited, trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk 
(MoneyBoat) lent irresponsibly to him. 
What happened
Between June and August 2019, Mr R borrowed two loans from MoneyBoat. The lending 
history is set out below: 
LoanDate 
TakenDate 
RepaidInstalments AmountHighest 
Repayment
1 12/06/2019 22/08/2019 6 £200.00 £54.60
2 22/08/2019 outstanding 6 £1,500.00 £465.00
I can see that before the loans above were agreed, MoneyBoat had turned Mr R down for 
several loans. The amount Mr R requested in respect of that borrowing ranged from £200 to 
£800. 
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be upheld in respect of loan 2. MoneyBoat 
strongly disagreed with that view. It said that Mr Rs indebtedness had decreased by the 
time he applied for loan 2 and that his disposable income exceeded £200 per month. 
As the parties are not in agreement with what our adjudicator said, the matter has been 
passed to me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MoneyBoat required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay the loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
 
So, applying those factors to this case, as I said above, Mr R applied for loan 1 after having 
several applications turned down by MoneyBoat. He applied for £1,350. MoneyBoat asked 
him about his income and expenditure and it also undertook a relatively in-depth credit check 
before agreeing to lend Mr R £200. 
From the credit file, I think there were a number of entries that should have put MoneyBoat 
on notice that Mr R was struggling financially. He had a County Court judgment with a 
significant outstanding balance. That judgment was not satisfied. Additionally, Mr R was 
behind with some repayments and some of his accounts were in default. 
I can see that Mr R declared his income at that stage to be £1,217. MoneyBoat verified his 
income with the credit reference agency. Mr R said his expenditure was £400. He said he 
had no housing costs and he was making no credit repayments. MoneyBoat made 
alterations to his declared expenditure because it was aware that Mr R did have some debts 
and I think those adjustments were appropriate. 
For loan 1, given the amount that was agreed and the adjustments made to Mr Rs 
expenditure, I think MoneyBoat did just about enough to be reasonably satisfied that the 
repayments were sustainably affordable. 
But I dont think the position was the same in respect of loan 2. I think it is important to stress 
the amount of agreed borrowing on this occasion was £1,500. When he made the 
application, I can see Mr R told MoneyBoat that his income had increased, but his 
expenditure in respect of food, transport and other expenses had decreased. 
It is significant that Mr R took loan 2 out on the same day that he repaid loan 1. And this, 
coupled with the number of declined loan applications, should have put MoneyBoat on notice 
that Mr R may not be borrowing to meet a one-off expense, but to meet an ongoing need.  
There were several entries on the credit file which suggest that Mr R would struggle to make 
these repayments. The outstanding balance in respect of the County Court Judgment was 
over £1,400. Mr R was behind with his credit card and loan repayments where the 
repayments were £84 and £166 respectively. The intended repayments for the loan hed 
applied for with MoneyBoat were £465 per month. The loan repayments alone were almost a 
third of Mr Rs total income. So if Mr R hadnt been able to make his credit card and existing 
loan repayments for less than half that amount, it is unclear to me how MoneyBoat could 
have reasonably concluded hed be able to sustainably pay back this £1,500 loan at the rate 
of £465 per month.  
MoneyBoat argues that Mr Rs disposable income indicated that the loan repayments would 
have been affordable. But as I said above, MoneyBoat shouldnt have made this decision by 
narrowly applying a strict pounds and pence calculation. It should have looked at Mr Rs 
circumstances as a whole. Given the information on Mr Rs credit file about how hed been 
able to manage his finances, I dont think a repayment of over 30% of his income was 
sustainably affordable  particularly when Mr R was behind with repayments that constituted 
a significantly smaller percentage. 
For the reasons set out above, I dont think MoneyBoat should have agreed to lend loan 2 to 
Mr R. It will need to take action to put things right. 
Putting things right
As I said above, it appears there is an outstanding balance in respect of loan 2.
If that is the case and MoneyBoat sold the outstanding debt to a third party, it must buy it 
back if it can and then follow the steps set out below. If it cannot buy the debt back, it must 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below. 
a) MoneyBoat must remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance of loan 2, 
and treat any repayments made by Mr R as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on this loan. If this results in Mr R having made overpayments then 
MoneyBoat must refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated and 
paid on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. 
b) However, if there is still an outstanding balance then MoneyBoat should try to agree 
an affordable repayment plan with Mr R. It must not pursue outstanding balances 
made up of principal it has already written-off. If MoneyBoat and Mr R do agree a 
repayment plan, I remind MoneyBoat of its obligation to treat Mr R fairly
c) MoneyBoat must remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Rs credit file in 
relation to loan 2. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. My final decision
I have upheld the complaint to the extent set out above. I require Evergreen Finance 
London Limited, trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk, to put things right as set out above 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 September 2020.
