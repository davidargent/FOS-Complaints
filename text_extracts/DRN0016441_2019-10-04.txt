Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Bs complaint  and thought  the loans from the sixth loan 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. Elevate disagreed and the complaint was passed  to me 
to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Elevate needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
Ref: DRN00164412But certain factors might  point to the fact that Elevate should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Elevate was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
Loans 1 to 5
Taking into account the size and timing of loans one to three, and where the amount Mr B 
was borrowing was decreasing, I dont think that it would have been  proportionate to expect 
Elevate to ask him for more information about his financial circumstances than it did. By loan 
four, however, I think  Elevate should  have taken  steps to build a more detailed picture of 
Mr Bs financial situation. But I havent seen anything in the information  provided which  
suggests that, had it done  so, Elevate would have known that he was struggling financially. 
Loans 6 to 13
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Elevates lending history  with Mr B, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point  at which  Elevate  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Elevate should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Ref: DRN00164413Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because at this point Elevate ought  to have realised  Mr B was not 
managing to repay his loans sustainably. Mr B had taken already taken out five loans in nine 
months. And on two occasions new loans were taken out before an earlier one had been 
repaid. And Elevate  ought to have realised  it was more likely than not Mr B was having to 
borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances.
There is a gap of four and a half months between loans seven and eight. This is much  longer 
than any other gaps in Mr Bs lending, either  before or after these loans. However, taking  
into account Mr Bs overall  pattern of borrowing  and, in particular, that the eighth  loan is 
twice the size of the seventh loan,  I dont think this gap is big enough for Elevate to have 
properly considered that Mr B had got his finances  under  control in that period. So I find that 
all the loans should be considered as a single chain  of lending.
I think that Mr B lost out because Elevate continued  to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time. 
Altogether he was indebted  to Elevate for about a year and a half. 
I appreciate Mr B doesnt  appear to have paid any interest  for loans six or seven, but 
these will still have appeared on his credit record. The number of loans and the 
length of time over which Mr B borrowed were likely to have had negative  
implications on Mr Bs ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans six to thirteen and Elevate should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Elevate needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loan six to thirteen;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans six to thirteen should be removed 
from Mr Bs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate to take off tax from this interest. Elevate must 
give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN00164414my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Bs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr B compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 November 2019.
