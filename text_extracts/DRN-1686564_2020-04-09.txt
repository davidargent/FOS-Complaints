The complaint
Miss C complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA didn't notify her correctly about a 
default notice on her PayPal Credit account.
What happened
Miss C is unhappy that PayPal sent a default notice to her home address in the post, rather 
than by email. Due to her personal circumstances at the time Miss C couldn't collect post 
from her home address and says she relied on email correspondence from PayPal. Miss 
C says this meant that payment wasn't made to the account, and a default was registered on 
her credit file.
PayPal say they followed the correct procedures in accordance with the User Agreement 
and their policies. One of our investigators looked into what happened. He thought PayPal 
acted fairly and followed the correct procedures. He noted PayPal weren't aware Miss C 
didn't have access to her post at the time and that there was no agreement in place for 
reduced payments to the account. Miss C remained unhappy so the complaint has come to 
me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss C has provided a lot of information about her complaint, especially about her 
circumstances around the time of the missed payments and default. I want to reassure Miss 
C that I've read and considered everything she has provided, even if I do not mention all the 
detail. I've condensed all the information into a brief summary which reflects the informal 
nature of our service. I'm satisfied I understand the crux of the problem; Miss C thinks the 
default notice should've been sent by email.
I've no doubt at all that Miss C was going through a difficult and stressful time. She was out 
of the country looking after her sick father, and taking unpaid days off work, whilst continuing 
her studies.
What I need to consider here is not whether Miss C was having difficulties, she clearly was, 
but whether PayPal acted fairly by sending the default notice in the post, and I think they did.
No payments were made to the account for several months. During this time PayPal emailed 
Miss C monthly statements showing the outstanding amounts, as well as the late payment 
fees being charged. 
The statements said to remedy the situation at the soonest convenience to prevent further 
contact from PayPal. They gave contact details and said there were several options 
available to assist Miss C. On Page 2 of the statement there's a section called 
'Managing Your Money' where it says to call PayPal Customer Service if there are difficulties 
making payments, as well as details of other organisations that might be able to help.  Miss C says she read the statements, but because of her situation didn't feel able to contact 
PayPal. Without any contact from Miss C PayPal followed the procedures in the User 
Agreement, and acted along industry guidelines by sending default letters to her home 
address. PayPal also tried to contact Miss C by phone, but the number they had was 
incorrect. 
Had PayPal been aware of Miss C's situation I would've expected them to consider treating 
her as a vulnerable consumer and perhaps acting differently. But they weren't aware so 
didn't know extra care might be needed. 
When Miss C came back to country she tried to set up a direct debit for payments to the 
account, but there was a problem. Miss C mistakenly set up a direct debit for bank payments 
to her PayPal transaction account, rather than her PayPal Credit account. Even if this had 
been done correctly, the payments would've been made too late to stop the default being 
registered.
Miss C says had she been told about the default by email she would've acted 
differently because the seriousness of the situation would've been clearer to her. This is of 
course entirely possible, but in this set of circumstances I need make a decision about what 
did happen, not what might've happened. PayPal sent monthly statements showing the 
arrears amount with contact details asking her to contact them so they could better 
understand her circumstances. I'm satisfied PayPal gave enough information on the 
statements to make Miss C aware of the seriousness of the situation with her account.
It remains that no payments were made for several months, and Paypal wasn't contacted 
about the account. I'm satisfied PayPal acted correctly when issuing the default notice. They 
followed the User Agreement and industry standards. PayPal hadn't heard from Miss C so 
they had no way of knowing of her circumstances. Had PayPal been aware I might've 
expected them to act differently, but this wasn't the case.
My final decision
For the reasons I've explained above, my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 May 2020.
