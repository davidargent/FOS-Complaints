The complaint
Mr T says Bank of Scotland plc mis-sold him a mortgage payment protection insurance 
(MPPI) policy.
What happened
Mr T took out an MPPI policy with a mortgage in 2009. He paid a monthly amount for the 
policy.  
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mr T disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, so 
the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Ts case. 
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ts complaint for the following reasons.
From what we know about how Bank of Scotland sold this type of PPI at the time, I think its 
likely that Bank of Scotland made Mr T aware that he had a choice about buying the MPPI, 
and that he chose to take it. 
Bank of Scotland recommended the MPPI to Mr T, and it seems to have been right for him 
based on what Ive seen of his circumstances at the time. 
Its possible that Bank of Scotland couldve explained the cost of the policy better than it did. 
But even if it had, I think Mr T would still have bought it. 
Its possible Bank of Scotland didnt point out the main things the policy didnt cover. But Mr 
T doesnt appear to have been affected by any of those things. 
Ive taken into account Mr Ts comments, including what hes said about not remembering 
taking out PPI in 2009. But these points dont change my conclusion. Bank of Scotlands 
records show that is when the PPI was sold. Thats the best evidence available, as it is 
possible that Mr T has simply forgotten about it, given how long ago it was.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 May 2020.
