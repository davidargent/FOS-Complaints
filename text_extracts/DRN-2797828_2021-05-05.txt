The complaint
The estate of the late Mrs M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wont write off
the remaining amount of a loan made to Mr and Mrs M, which her family have long had 
concerns about, and which they consider has already been substantively repaid.
Ms M brings this complaint on behalf of the estate.
What happened
Ms M said that her mother, Mrs M, had sadly died early in 2020. Ms M was seeking to
resolve her mothers estate.
Ms M said that NatWest was asking the estate to repay the remaining balance on a loan
made to her mother and father several years ago. Ms M has long had concerns about this
loan, including whether it was appropriate for her parents when it was granted, and about
how it has been managed by NatWest since.
Mrs M told us that she had asked our service to consider those points since her father
passed away, and weve not been able to do this, because of the time that had elapsed. But
she said that now her mother had also passed away, and NatWest was refusing to write off
the loan. She wanted us to consider a complaint about that. She was very unhappy with how
much her mother had been asked to pay. She thought the initial loan had been paid off, and
what the estate was being asked to pay NatWest would just be interest.
Ms M thought the initial loan was for £22,000. NatWest said it was actually for a principal
sum of £24,500, plus interest of £7,229.47, making a total of £31,729.47. It said the loan was
taken out by Mr M and Mrs M in October 2004.
After a short time, Mr M got into difficulties with his payments. He missed the payment for
April 2006, and he started to make reduced payments on the loan after that. NatWest then
obtained a county court judgment (CCJ) for the rest of the money owed on the loan.
Unusually, although this was a joint loan, NatWest only took this case, and obtained
judgment, against Mr M. We dont have this judgment, but NatWest does, and it has
confirmed that this is the case.
I understand that Mr M started to pay £200 per month, as set out in the judgment, in April
2009.
NatWest said it still thought Mrs Ms estate owed this money. It wrote to Ms M in July 2020,
to say that it understood it might be difficult to progress a house sale at that time, but it would
keep the loan in its recoveries department until the estate was able to go ahead with the sale
of Mrs Ms house.
Our investigator said that this loan was payable by Mrs M, and so the estate does still owe
this money. He said that our service couldnt make NatWest write off the loan in these
circumstances. Its usual for a bank to wait to see if there are any funds left in an estate
before it decides what to do about a loan, and that was what NatWest had said it wanted to
do here.
Ms M said she wanted her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman, so it was passed
to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Before I start, I should set out that this complaint is brought on behalf of the late Mrs 
M. It is her complaint, which the estate is entitled to ask our service to consider. So 
as part of this complaint, Im looking at whether NatWest has been fair to Mrs M.
And I think I ought to start by saying that I dont think it would be reasonable in this 
case to ask NatWest to simply write off this loan now. I know Ms M has expressed 
doubts as to whether her late mother was ever party to this loan. But Im satisfied that 
Mr and Mrs M did borrow this money jointly, and it doesnt look to me as if the 
principal amount of £24,500 that was lent to them, even without any interest at all, 
has quite been paid back yet.
NatWest has explained that its too long ago for it to look back at the original lending
decision that was made in 2004. And thats not the complaint Im looking at here.
Although I cant look at the original lending, Ms M might also like to know that even if 
our service does decide that lending has been unaffordable, its very unusual for us 
to say that the principal doesnt all need to be paid back.
But I also note that Ms M has been very unhappy with how much her late mother was 
asked to repay. It appears that NatWest has simply asked Mrs M to maintain the 
payments which were due under the CCJ. And I can look at that.
This is a complex case. So Ill summarise what Im proposing now, then explain it 
below. 
-I can consider what NatWest is asking Mrs M to repay  because it asked Mrs 
M to pay from 2015 (after Mr M died).
-But the balance of the loan in 2015 seems to me to be unfair, as Mrs M was 
still being asked to pay all the interest that NatWest was originally going to 
charge on the loan (before Mr M got into difficulties with his payments).
-So, I think we need to get the balance as at 2015 right. 
-And the way to do that is to rework the loan on the basis of interest being 
charged up to 2006 (to the date when Mr M got into payment difficulties, and 
NatWest was accepting smaller payments).
-
Now Ill explain why I think that.
We know that the CCJ in this case was obtained against Mr M alone. NatWest has 
also been very clear that this CCJ ended when Mr M died, and that it was asking Mrs 
M to pay as the joint signatory on the loan, not as part of Mr Ms estate.
I noted, when considering the schedule of this loan, that none of the interest applied 
at the start of the loan appears to have been removed when Mr M got into difficulties 
with his payments, or when the CCJ was obtained. Whilst our service might expect 
someone who has got into difficulties with payments to pay back the money that has been borrowed, it would be less common for us to say that the full amount of interest 
originally envisaged on the loan also has to be paid.
I asked NatWest about this, and it said that the amount of the debt was fixed by the 
CCJ, and wasnt something our service would be allowed to look at.
I cant overrule what a court says. And if this case were about Mr M, then I think 
NatWest would be right  we couldnt look at the amount of the debt. But its not. Its 
about Mrs M. The CCJ didnt involve her in any way, so I dont think that this 
judgment has fixed the debt against her. So I think I can consider what it was fair to 
ask her to repay.
NatWest didnt ask Mrs M to pay this debt until 2015. Before then, Mr M was paying, 
under the terms of the CCJ. So a complaint about how much NatWest asked Mrs M 
to pay in 2015 isnt out of time now.
But what NatWest asked Mrs M to pay then, was based on what had happened 
before this. So I think we need to look further back, in order to put right what 
happened in 2015. As Ive explained, I dont think the CCJ helps with this, because 
that didnt affect Mrs M. So I think we need to look at the overall position of the loan, 
and what Mrs M (along with Mr M) was apparently able to pay.
I think its reasonable for NatWest to have said to Mrs M, in 2015, that she should 
continue to repay until the principal is paid back. And I also think it was reasonable 
for NatWest to say then that Mrs M should also pay interest, under the loan as it was 
originally envisaged, for the period when she and Mr M were meeting the originally 
envisaged payments. But I think its less reasonable to have asked Mrs M (who was 
presumably no more able to pay this loan in 2006 than Mr M was) to make payments 
that cover the interest originally envisaged for the rest of the term of the loan.
It doesnt seem to me to be fair and reasonable for NatWest to have asked Mrs M in 
2015 to pay absolutely all the interest that NatWest had originally envisaged charging 
on this loan.
Thats not because I think the original lending was unfair. Its because Mrs M does 
appear to have faced an extended period of financial difficulties, which meant she 
wasnt able to pay the loan back under the original agreement.
So I think that what NatWest should do is to work out, on the basis of the loan as 
originally envisaged, what each months interest charge would have been if interest 
had been charged per month, not all at the start. It should do this on the basis of the 
original payments being made throughout the term of the loan.
It should then reduce the outstanding debt by any interest which would have been 
charged, after the date when NatWest first started to accept smaller payments from 
Mr M, which was 30 May 2006. NatWest can give credit for the interest it refunded on 
15 May 2018, of £1,614.93, when its making this calculation.
It seems likely that the estate of Mrs M will still be asked to pay the remainder of the 
loan, if it has assets available to do so. But I think the amount would more closely 
reflect what I think Mrs M shouldve been asked to pay in 2015. And that will, I think, 
provide a fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
NatWest replied, to suggest something else. What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest contacted our service to say it would like to suggest something else instead. 
My provisional decision asked NatWest to rework the loan which was originally made to Mr 
and Mrs M, so that interest was only charged up to May 2006. I said that after that, the loan 
should be interest free. This would mean that repayments would cover the principal (the sum 
originally lent) and a little interest. So the overall debt would be reduced, but the estate 
would still need to pay the remaining sum. 
But what NatWest suggested would leave the estate rather better off. 
NatWest said that £22,463.05 had been repaid to the loan. It also said that it has received 
payments of £1,797.78, in a separate account which were to be allocated towards 
repayment of the loan debt. NatWest didnt say where these payments came from, but it 
seemed likely that Mr or Mrs M held a separate account with it, and NatWest was suggesting 
it would use that money to help repay the loan. Thats what I would expect NatWest to do.
NatWest said that would mean that the principal amount borrowed in 2004 (£24,500) had 
almost been repaid. 
What Id proposed as a resolution to this complaint would mean that after the money 
NatWest already holds was used to pay part of the debt, the estate would still owe some 
money. My proposal would mean the estate would need to pay £239.17 to clear the total 
amount of the principal sum borrowed. And it would also need to pay the interest due from 
2004 to 2006. 
But NatWest said it was prepared to write this off. It wouldnt ask the estate to pay this. 
Ms M had contacted our service in the meantime, to say that she was still very unhappy with 
how NatWest had treated Mr and Mrs M. She wanted to be able to move on, so she had 
been reluctantly prepared to accept my decision. 
We put NatWests offer to her, as this would leave the estate in a rather better position than 
it wouldve been in under my proposal.
Ms M said she was happy to accept this offer to bring the matter to a close. She asked that if 
the estate did owe anything, NatWest get in touch and let her know. I dont think thats likely 
to be the case, as under the proposal NatWest has made, it will only use money it already 
has towards the repayment of the debt, and wont ask the estate to pay over any more. 
So thats the award Ill now make. 
  My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc can use the sum of £1,797.78 which 
it has already received towards repayment of the loan owed by the estate of Mrs M. Then it 
must write off the remaining debt.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mrs 
M to accept or reject my decision before 2 June 2021.
