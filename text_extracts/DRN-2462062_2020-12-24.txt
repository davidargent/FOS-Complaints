The complaint
Mr S complains about what happened when PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA dealt with a 
chargeback request on his behalf.
 
What happened
Mr S runs his own small business, accepting commissions from clients. He takes payments
via PayPal.
In June 2019, Mr S accepted a commission for £10,000. Some months later (but still well
within Mr Ss deadline for completion) the client asked for a progress update. Mr S sent
photos, and the client terminated the contract. Mr S says his business was entitled to keep
the 30% deposit which was non-refundable and had been paid through PayPal.
The client raised a dispute through PayPal to get this deposit returned, but PayPal defended
it. In January the client raised a Chargeback through his Bank. PayPal asked Mr S to submit
his defence evidence within ten days. Mr S told us he did that by email, and got confirmation
emails from PayPal to show that it had received this.
Mr S said PayPal never submitted this evidence as part of its defence. PayPal repeatedly
told him it hadnt received any evidence. Mr S said PayPal had taken the money back out of
his account, which meant he was left with a negative balance, and PayPal is now harassing
him for payment.
PayPal said that Mr Ss client had filed external chargebacks directly with his card issuer on
the two payments hed made to Mr S, for £1,465.50 and £396.80. So PayPal said it had
asked Mr S for evidence that the service has been received and that the buyer has benefited
from the service he provided. PayPal said that under its user agreement, proof of delivery for
intangible items and services means compelling evidence to show the sale was fulfilled,
including but not limited to the following:
a. The date the item or service was provided.
b. The recipients address (for instance, email/IP) where applicable.
This section of PayPals terms appears to come from its rules on seller protection.
PayPal said it didnt get Mr Ss response by the deadline. It hasnt explained why not. It said
it was aware that he sent information via email and it had reviewed that. Mr S had sent an
invoice, his explanation of events and photos of the work carried out. PayPal said Mr S had
told it he still had the items. So PayPal said it couldnt confirm that the buyer had received
the service or benefited from the service. PayPal told us that meant it couldnt dispute these
chargebacks with the credit card company.
PayPal said it had considered whether it could refund Mr S under its seller protection policy.
Unfortunately his transactions did not meet its Seller Protection eligibility criteria. PayPal said
it would refund the chargeback fees for the two transactions, which were £12 each, and it
would offer a credit of £500 to address the upset this matter had caused Mr S.
Mr S didnt want to accept that. He told us about the significant impact this complaint was
having on his business, and on both his mental and physical health.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said PayPal had acted in
line with the strict interpretation of its user agreement. So, although he understood that this
had distressed Mr S, he wasnt able to suggest that PayPal should reimburse the full cost of
the buyers chargeback. He was pleased to see PayPal had waived the chargeback fees,
and offered £500 credit. Our investigator thought it was fair for PayPal to do this.
Mr S wanted an ombudsman to consider his complaint, so it was passed to me for a final
decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
PayPal received a chargeback request from the bank which holds an account for Mr 
Ss client. What I have to consider here is how PayPal responded to that chargeback 
request.
PayPal said it didnt receive evidence from Mr S, but its internal notes suggest it did 
receive evidence from him within the deadline it set him. So, from what I have seen, I 
think its likely that this evidence was sent, and received.
Mr S told PayPal that the money his client had paid was a non-refundable deposit. 
He said the contract for the commission was conducted over the phone, in line with 
the clients preference, but the standard terms for a commission were discussed. 
That includes a 30% deposit, which is non-refundable if work is cancelled.
Mr Ss website shows the terms that he applies to commissions. That website sets 
out that Mr S will require a 30% deposit upfront, before work starts. And it also makes 
clear that this deposit wont be refundable. It also says it wont return any items to the 
client, unless work hasnt started.
This seems to me to support what Mr S said about the contents of the contract he 
reached with this client, and in particular, that the deposits paid were likely to be non-
refundable, in the circumstances of this case.
PayPal asked Mr S to provide evidence that the service had been received and the 
buyer had benefitted from this, because it says thats what its user agreement 
requires. But that part of PayPals terms covers whether Mr S was eligible for seller 
protection. And that only becomes relevant if the chargeback was successful. I think 
PayPal has become confused here, and skipped a step in what it shouldve done. Ill 
explain that.
PayPal had been sent was a chargeback claim, made by the clients bank.
So the key rules that apply in a chargeback arent the detailed agreement between 
PayPal and Mr S. The relevant rules are the ones that the card scheme operator 
applies to its chargeback scheme. (I note that we have no information on which 
scheme this was, it will be decided by whichever symbol is on the clients card. 
However the schemes are broadly similar in operation, so I dont think I need this 
further information to decide this case.)This chargeback was made because the client said the items hadnt been received. 
What PayPal needed to send to the clients bank wasnt proof that items had been 
sent to the client. It needed to send proof that Mr S didnt have to send the items, 
because the contract had been cancelled, AND that in these circumstances, the 
contract Mr S had entered into with the client meant he could keep the deposit, to 
cover the work hed already done.
Its possible that PayPal may have needed to revert to Mr S to ask for more detail on 
this chargeback. But if so, the presence on Mr Ss website of terms which set out the 
position as he described it, makes me think this couldve been provided. And I think if 
PayPal had sent Mr Ss evidence to the clients bank, then its more likely than not 
that this chargeback wouldnt have been successful. Then none of this money 
wouldve been taken from Mr Ss PayPal account.
I think PayPal should refund Mr S the money it took from his account, of £1,465.50 
and £396.28, as well as the two chargeback fees of £12 each, that it took at the 
same time.
Mr S has described in some detail the impact this case has had on him. He said the 
money he owes because of this has meant hes unable to carry on his business. He 
also told us that hes suffering with anxiety and depression, and has lost significant 
amounts of weight.
I think that PayPal made a mistake, and that has caused quite some distress to Mr S. 
I think PayPal should pay Mr S £500 in compensation.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Mr S sent a reply, accepting the decision. PayPal asked for more time to consider its 
response, and said that it wasnt clear on the reasons for the compensation awarded in this 
case. Mr S then wrote again, detailing new problems he was having with PayPal, which he 
feared were linked to his current complaint.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal hasnt yet had a chance to consider the further complaint that Mr S has told our 
service about, which covers difficulties on his new account. Our service has told Mr S that he 
will need to complain about those issues to PayPal before we are able to consider them. 
PayPal has said it isnt clear about why Id suggested a payment of £500 in compensation 
for this case. It had previously made an offer of £500 in compensation, but it had made clear 
that this was partly in order to assist Mr S in resolving the outstanding debit on his account. 
Mr S asked if he could accept this offer, whilst he was waiting for his case to be considered 
by an ombudsman, but PayPal said it thought it should wait until this case was resolved. So I 
understand that PayPal hasnt paid Mr S anything in respect of this complaint.
Its no more than coincidence that Im proposing a compensation payment of £500 in this 
case. My assessment of the appropriate award in this case is based on what Mr S told us 
about the impact this had on his business, and on him personally. 
Mr S told us that hed chosen this particular work because of the benefit to his mental health. 
But the problems hed experienced and the debt hed been left with meant he felt it wasnt viable to keep his business going. He said hed been left unemployed, and had been unable 
to find other work. He told us that this in turn had affected his physical and mental health, 
and hed been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Hes provided details of the medical 
treatment he received. I understand that Mr S has now sought to restart his business.
I have reconsidered all the information sent to our service by both parties about this case, 
and I havent changed my mind about the award. Ill now make the award I originally 
proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must refund two payments of 
£1,465.50 and £396.28, as well chargeback fees totalling £24, onto Mr Ss account. And it 
should also pay Mr S £500 in compensation.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 January 2021.
