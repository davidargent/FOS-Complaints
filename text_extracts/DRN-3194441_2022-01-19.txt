The complaint
Mr C complains that TransUnion International UK Limited reported information about a loan 
in his name on his sons credit file. 
  
What happened
In August 2021 Mr C contacted TransUnion after details of a loan in his name were found on 
his sons credit file. Mr C has explained that the situation caused serious family difficulties 
and also meant his son wasnt able to extend the limit on a credit card. 
TransUnion responded on 1 October 2021 and upheld Mr Cs complaint. TransUnion 
confirmed the situation had come about due to systems issues and took steps to remove the 
loan from Mr Cs sons credit file. 
Mr C referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They upheld 
Mr Cs complaint and asked TransUnion to pay him £250 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused. TransUnion asked to appeal and said it didnt agree that £250 was a fair way to 
resolve Mr Cs complaint but did make an offer of £150. 
TransUnion asked to appeal, so Mr Cs complaint has been passed to me to make a 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
All parties agree that a loan in Mr Cs name appeared on his sons credit file. TransUnion 
has confirmed that was a mistake caused by the way its systems match data and shouldnt 
have happened. When Mr C complained, TransUnion took steps to delete the entry from his 
sons credit file and apologised. 
Ive considered how to fairly resolve Mr Cs complaint. Hes told us that the information 
recorded about the loan caused serious problems with his son and family. Mr C has 
explained there were arguments and that his son was upset when a credit limit increase was 
declined by a credit card provider. I can only consider how an issue affected Mr C, but I can 
see the error caused a lot of trouble. Mr C has confirmed the matter continues to cause 
problems.
Im satisfied the level of distress and inconvenience caused to Mr C was significant and that 
the award should reflect that. As a result, Im upholding Mr Cs complaint and directing 
TransUnion to pay him a total of £250 for the distress and inconvenience caused by its 
actions. In my view, that figure more fairly reflects the impact of TransUnions errors on 
Mr C. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct TransUnion International UK Limited to 
pay Mr C £250.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2022.
