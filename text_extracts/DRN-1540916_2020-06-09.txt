The complaint
Ms P has complained about loans granted to her by Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny (Sunny or the lender).  Ms P says that Sunny was irresponsible to lend 
to her because she could not meet her repayments and ended up having to borrow further. 
Ms P has brought her complaint to this Service through a claims management company. For 
simplicity, I will refer to Ms P throughout this decision. 
What happened
Sunny agreed 22 loans for Ms P from February 2018 to September 2019. The loans were all 
instalment loans to be repaid over six months and ranged in value from £50 to £450. The 
below table sets out some information Sunny has provided about these loans (with numbers 
rounded to the nearest pound). 
As the table shows many of the loans ran concurrently and the last two were still outstanding 
when Ms P brought her complaint to this Service. Sunny has since confirmed that there is no 
longer an outstanding balance on Ms Ps account as her final loans were repaid in August 
and September 2019.

Our adjudicator upheld Ms Ps complaint in part and recommended that Sunny refund all the 
interest and charges she paid on loans 9 to 22 because they found that by loan 9 Sunny 
ought to have realised that Ms P was having problems managing her money and that her 
pattern of borrowing by loan 11 clearly showed that it wasnt likely she was managing her 
repayments sustainably.
Sunny disagreed with this recommendation but offered to refund interest and charges on 
loans 19 to 22 because, it said when looking at Ms [P]s overall usage, we recognise that by 
loan [19] it would have been prudent to have investigated further before granting this loan 
onwards as the customers loans were not decreasing significantly. Likewise, there is no 
significant break in the lending relationship and this may pose a risk to sustainably being 
able to repay back the loans or manage her money. Further, this pattern could have led us to 
question the manner in which the customer used our Sunny [instalment loan] product as it 
may have indicated they were perhaps not, using the credit appropriately.
Ms P didnt accept this offer and so the complaint has come to me, as an ombudsman, for 
review and decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending  including the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Ive followed that 
approach here. 
The Financial Conduct Authority was the regulator when Ms P took out her loans. The 
relevant rules and guidance set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook said that for all loans 
Sunny needed to check that Ms P could afford to meet her repayments in a sustainable 
manner. This meant Ms P being able to meet her repayments out of her normal income 
without having to go without or borrow further. 
The regulations werent prescriptive about what checks Sunny needed to carry out in order 
to reasonably assess whether Ms P would be able to meet her repayments sustainably. But 
the regulations said that such checks needed to be proportionate. This suggests that the 
same checks might not be the appropriate thing to do for all consumers, or for the same 
consumer in all circumstances.
In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed checks
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. 
Sunny says it asked Ms P for information about her income and expenses each time she 
applied for a loan. The lender recorded Ms Ps monthly income as £2,175 for her first ten 
loans. This dropped to £1,300 at loan 11 and again to £1,000 at loan 14. From loan 15 
onwards Sunny recorded Ms Ps income as £1,500. It recorded Ms Ps monthly expenses, 
which included credit commitments, as generally increasing ranging between £175 and 
£1,000. 
Sunny also said that it used information from third party credit reference agencies to ensure 
the loans were affordable for Ms P and to check her credit history. It hasnt provided the 
results of these checks but it has provided a summary which states that Ms P didnt have 
more than four outstanding loans from other short term providers when she applied for
loan 2 onwards. 
The summary also states that there were no bankruptcies, debt management plans or recent 
county court judgements recorded on her credit file. The summary does show that around 
the time she applied for her fourth loan onwards Ms P had recently defaulted on existing 
credit. It doesnt, however, show the amount of any existing debt or how much she was 
paying towards this. 
Sunnys estimated disposable income for Ms P averaged £1,500 for her first ten loans, then 
dropped significantly for loan 11 to about a third of that. In fact for loan 14, Sunny estimated 
that Ms P had a disposable income of £80, not enough to be able to meet her contractual 
loan repayments for her outstanding loans. But, as I will explain, I think Sunny ought to have 
stopped lending to her before then.
I think Sunnys checks were proportionate for Ms Ps earlier loans but when shed repaid and 
borrowed again a few times I think Sunny ought to have looked into her finances in more 
detail before lending to her again and verified the information she was providing. Ms P hasnt 
shared her credit file or any bank statements with this Service, so I have limited information 
about her financial situation or how she was managing any existing credit commitments. 
While I cant say for sure what Sunny would have found out had it carried out proportionate 
checks, looking at everything in the round, I think there are strong indications in the 
information I do have to suggest that Sunny should have declined to lend to Ms P from
loan 9 onwards.
Our adjudicator found that Sunny ought to have declined to lend to Ms P when she applied 
for this loan because she already had three outstanding loans with Sunny and it was likely 
she was having problems managing her money. Sunny disagreed with this finding and said 
that allowing customers to take out a number of loans provided flexibility. 
I dont think that taking concurrent loans is automatically indicative of money problems  it 
may be but it depends on the circumstances. I appreciate that Ms P had been borrowing for 
three months when she took out loan 9 however, even over this relatively short period, there were indications that she was having problems managing her money. By loan 9 Ms P had 
repaid and borrowed again within a matter of days or weeks at least four times and with this 
loan she was once again indebted to Sunny for an amount of £450 across several loans. 
When she repaid one of these loans she replaced it with loan 10. In these circumstances, I 
dont think Sunny should have agreed to loans 9 or 10 because of the risk that Ms P wasnt 
going to be able to repay them sustainably.
Sunny offered to refund the interest and charges Ms P paid on loans 19 to 22 acknowledging 
that the pattern of borrowing by that point suggested that she wasnt using its loans for short 
term needs. 
I agree that it was irresponsible to have agreed these loans but I also think Sunny should 
have stopped lending to Ms P before then, specifically when she asked for her eleventh 
loan. This loan was for £450  the largest single amount shed borrowed so far. At this point 
shed been borrowing for almost seven months, having first taken out a loan of £300, and it 
doesnt seem to me that shed managed to make any inroads into her debt in this time.
Ms Ps pattern of taking out further loans when she repaid previous loans and taking out 
loans concurrently had been clearly demonstrated by that point. This pattern suggests to me 
that she couldnt repay her debt without needing to borrow again, that she wasnt managing 
to meet her repayments sustainably and it was likely that she had an ongoing need for 
additional income. I think Sunny should have recognised this and declined to lend to her.
I have considered what Sunny said in response to our adjudication  that the overall 
borrowing pattern presented could be interpreted as Ms P having difficulty with her finances 
or going through a potentially difficult time in other words with car repairs, home repairs or 
other unexpected expenses as opposed to persistently reliant on short term loans. In other 
words Ms P might have been experiencing a series of short term financial problems. This 
was a possibility, but I dont think its the most likely explanation here. As the loan table 
shows Ms P had repaid loans and borrowed soon after many times by this point. And I dont 
think it was fair of Sunny to agree further credit for Ms P beyond this, given the potential risk 
to her that this pattern of borrowing demonstrated.
I think Ms P lost out when Sunny agreed loan 11 and went on to agree more loans for her for 
another year because these loans unfairly prolonged her indebtedness and allowed her to 
take expensive credit intended for short term use over an extended period. The number of 
loans and length of time she borrowed over was likely to be seen negatively by other 
lenders, potentially keeping her in the market for high cost loans. 
Putting things right
As Ive explained above, I find that Sunny was irresponsible to have agreed further credit for 
Ms P from and including her ninth loan taken out on the 27 May 2018. In order to put things 
right for her, Sunny should:
a. refund all interest and charges Ms P paid on loans 9 to 22; and
b. pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the dates of settlement; and 
c. remove any adverse information about loans 9 and 10 from Ms Ps credit file and 
remove all information about loans 11 onwards because any information recorded 
about these loans is adverse.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I am upholding Ms Ps complaint about Elevate Credit 
International Limited (trading as Sunny) in part and it should put things right for her as Ive 
outlined. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2020.
