The complaint
Mr W has complained about the loans he took out through Elevate Credit International 
Limited (trading as Sunny). He says the loan were not affordable and forced him into a spiral 
of debt.
What happened
Mr W took 41 loans with Sunny between May 2016 and April 2019. Each of the loans was 
due to be repaid over a period of six months  but in most cases Mr W repaid the loans 
early. Some of Mr Ws loans overlapped with one another. A summary of some of Mr Ws 
borrowing is shown below.

The repayment figure is sometimes made up of multiple payments when the loans 
overlapped. Mr W borrowed a further 31 loans between January 2017 and April 2019 
ranging from £50 to £850. 
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and recommended Sunny refund the interest and 
charges on loans 4 to 41 as well as making amendments to Mr Ws credit file. She said if 
Sunny had done proportionate checks it would have realised at loan 4 that Mr W was having 
problems managing his money and from loan 6 onwards the overall pattern of Mr Ws 
borrowing suggested he had become persistently reliant on short-term loans. 
Sunny didnt accept the adjudicators view but accepted it may have been prudent to contact 
Mr W to discuss his financial circumstances from loan 24 onwards, and on this basis, it 
made an offer from loan 24 onwards. Mr W did not accept the offer as it wasn't in line with 
the adjudicator's view.
As the case could not be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when Sunny lent to Mr W. The 
FCAs Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC) is the specialist sourcebook for credit-related 
regulated activities. It sets out the rules and guidance specific to consumer credit providers, 
such as Sunny. 
It is important to note that the FCA didnt, and doesnt, specify exactly how an assessment of 
affordability is to be carried out but the extent and scope and the types and sources of 
information to use needed to be enough to be able to reasonably assess the sustainability 
of the arrangement for the consumer.
In other words, the assessment needs to be consumer-focussed. It is not an assessment of 
the risk to the lender of not recovering the credit but of the risk to the consumer of incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant adverse consequence as a result of the 
decision to lend.
CONC may not mention the number of previous loans a customer has had with a particular 
creditor as a relevant factor in determining what verification checks are proportionate. But as 
outlined in my provisional decision, as set out in CONC, the risk to the consumer directly 
relates to the particulars of the lending and the circumstances of the consumer. Therefore, a 
lenders assessment of creditworthiness would likely need to be flexible. That is to say, what 
is sufficient for one consumer might not be for another, or indeed what might be sufficient for 
a consumer in one circumstance might not be so for the same consumer in other 
circumstances.
Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment of creditworthiness to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance, the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. 
Certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include, 
but are not limited to:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr W could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Sunny said it undertook an independent check of the information Mr W had declared in his 
application. It said it used credit reference agency information as part of its checks which 
takes into account all other credit commitments, including any short term loans which were 
reported to the credit reference agency, as part of every affordability assessment. 
I think the checks Sunny did were proportionate for the first three loans and the information 
Mr W provided indicated that the loans were affordable. These were Mr Ws first few loans 
with Sunny, so I think it was entitled to rely on the information Mr W provided about his 
income and expenses. 
But by the time Mr W asked for loan 4, Sunny should have done more than rely on the 
information he was providing about his finances. I think it should have taken steps at that 
time to independently verify Mr Ws actual financial position. I dont think Sunnys checks 
achieved this. Sunny has told us that the data reported to credit reference agencies is not 
updated in real time  so it didnt necessarily capture all the short term loans. In addition, Ive 
seen nothing to suggest Sunny independently checked or discovered the true extent of Mr 
Ws expenses. 
Mr W provided us with his bank statements and his credit file, so we could see what better 
checks would have shown Sunny. 
Having done so, I think a proportionate check for loans 4 -6 would most likely have shown 
Sunny that Mr W was having problems managing his money. Mr W was spending a 
significant proportion of his income through on-line betting websites - very frequently. And 
knowing this Sunny would have thought that Mr W couldn't repay these loans in a 
sustainable manner and therefore it wouldnt have provided these loans to him. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldn't have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ws case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
Mr W had taken out seven loans within five months. So Sunny ought to have realised 
it was more likely than not Mr W was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr W's indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mr Ws first loan was for £150 and loan 7, along with overlapping loans 4 and 6, was 
for £1,150.  At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mr W was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need.
 
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny.
Loan 7 was taken out five months after loan 1. It (along with overlapping loans 4 and 
6) was over seven times the amount Mr W initially borrowed on loan 1. 
 I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 
7 onwards. These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use. The sheer number of 
loans was more likely than not to have had negative implications on Mr Ws ability to access 
mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 7 to 41 as well as loans 4 to 6 and Sunny 
should put things right as set out below.
Putting things right
 Sunny shouldnt have given Mr W loans 4 to 41and should put things right as set out below:
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr W towards interest, fees and 
charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where applicable, 
but not including anything Sunny has already refunded.
 
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr W which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr W originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
 
C. Pay Mr W the total of A plus B.
 
D. Remove any adverse information Sunny has recorded on Mr Ws credit file in relation 
to loans 4 to 6. The overall pattern of Mr Ws borrowing for loans 7 to 41 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans 
entirely from Mr Ws credit file. 
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, Ive decided to partially uphold Mr Ws complaint and direct 
Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 February 2020.
