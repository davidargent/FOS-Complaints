K820x#14complaint
Mr O complains National Westminster Bank Plc will not refund some  disputed transactions. 
He also complains about the service  he received when  he raised the matter.
background
Mr O says a number of transactions to an online bingo company  which  were  made  from 
his account  were  not made  by him. He complained  to NatWest and wanted his money  
returned.  
NatWest investigated  the matter  but said it was holding Mr O liable for the transactions 
because it had contacted the bingo company  M.  M had confirmed that the payments had 
been made using  an account  in the name  of Mr O.  The details it held for Mr O matched 
those which  NatWest held.
Unhappy with NatWests  decision, Mr O came to this service.  He  said NatWest  had failed  to 
check the IP address of the transactions.  He didnt suggest what  that investigation might 
have shown.  He  also said he should not be held liable for the money lost.
Our investigator did not think he could ask NatWest to do anymore.  He told Mr O that he 
(the investigator) thought it was more  likely  than not that Mr O had made or authorised these 
transactions.  He  didnt  agree that NatWest had provided Mr O with a poor service or that its 
staff were rude to him.
The matter  was then passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Generally speaking, if the evidence shows its more likely than not that Mr O authorised  
these transaction,  NatWest is entitled to hold him liable for them.  However, if the evidence  is 
to the contrary,  NatWest  must refund the money.
The relevant  rules say its not enough for NatWest to show  the payments were authenticated  
 that is Mr Os genuine card being used.  It must also show that he consented to the 
payments being  made.
From the evidence I have  seen, I am satisfied that the payments were  authenticated.  For 
the following  reasons,  I dont think  its unfair  for NatWest to have concluded that Mr O also 
consented to the transactions:
-the payments  to M were made from an account held in Mr Os name   with the same 
personal details  as both NatWest  and this service hold for him;
-Ms notes show that on the last day of the disputed  transactions,  they had a phone 
call with Mr O who was asking for the account to be suspended as he had a 
gambling problem  and wanted  to be excluded from the site for life.  I dont think  a 
fraudster would  have  that conversation with M;
Ref: DRN54932172-there would  be no benefit to a fraudster in setting up an account with M in Mr Os 
name and using his bank  details  because any winnings would also be paid into Mr 
Os account;
-Mr O does not report his card being  lost or stolen.  He  thinks  his ex-partner may have 
used the card previously and may still have those  details.  If that was the case, Mr O 
was under an obligation to inform NatWest of that fact as soon as he became  aware  
his details had been compromised;
-during the period of the disputed transactions, Mr O logged  onto online banking a 
number of times.  I think he would have  probably  seen  the decreasing balance on his 
account  even if the transactions  were not showing;
-Mr O says he reported the transactions to NatWest on the following day just after 
8.30 am after he had carried out a balance enquiry at an ATM.  The  call to NatWest 
was not made until later in the afternoon  and the data from NatWest  shows no 
balance enquiry that morning.
So, in the circumstances, I dont think Mr O gives a credible or plausible  explanation as to 
what has happened here.  I think it is more likely than not that he made or authorised  these 
transactions himself.   Either  way, NatWest has not acted unfairly in holding  him liable.
I have also seen nothing  to suggest  that NatWest has provided a poor service.   
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 March  2020.
