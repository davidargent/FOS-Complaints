K821x#15complaint
Miss K says Harvey & Thompson Limited (H&T) lent to her irresponsibly. She says that the 
lending was unfair. 
background
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be partially upheld. H&T disagreed with the 
adjudicators opinion. The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Miss Ks complaint should be upheld  in part. A 
copy of the background to the complaint  and my provisional findings, are attached and form 
part of this final decision. 
H&T, and Miss K, received my provisional decision.  And no one had anything  to add after 
theyd seen it.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
H&T, and Miss K, didnt  raise any new points after receiving my provisional decision.  So Ive 
reached the same conclusions I reached before, for the same reasons.
putting things right  what H&T needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss K paid on loans 2 to 20 (or from the borrowing 
taken on 1 August  2009;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 2 to 4 from Miss Ks credit file;
the number  of loans taken from 5 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  5 to 20 should be removed from Miss Ks 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires H&T to take off tax from this interest. H&T must give 
Miss K a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Miss Ks complaint.
Harvey & Thompson Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 November 2019.

This complaint is about  19 payday  loans  and one instalment loan H&T provided to Miss K between 
June 2009 and April 2012. Ive attached a table  at the end of this decision which contains some of the 
information H&T provided about the loans. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. H&T disagreed with the adjudicators opinion so the 
complaint has been passed  to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to provisionally decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints 
about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry  practice - on 
our website. 
H&T needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this means  
that it should  have carried out reasonable checks to make sure Miss K could repay  the loans in a 
sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that H&T should fairly and reasonably have  done more to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments  being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an 
indication a consumer  could sustainably  make  their repayments. The customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to 
borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows  that a lender should realise, or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments  sustainably if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Miss Ks complaint. Ive provisionally decided  to uphold Miss Ks complaint  in 
part and have  explained why below.
Miss K didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion  about loan 1. Because  of this I dont think  there is 
any ongoing  disagreement about this loan. So I wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But it 
was part of the borrowing relationship Miss K had with H&T. So it is something I will take into account  
when considering the other  loans she took.
H&T has provided some detail about the checks it usually  made before lending.  Unfortunately, due to 
the time that has passed,  it has been unable to provide any detail about the checks  it made before  
lending to Miss K. Whilst this is not unreasonable, Ive had to assess  this complaint on the information  
I have. That said, I think Ive been  able to reach a fair outcome. 
Ref: DRN57041614As our adjudicator  explained, a proportionate check for loans 2 to 4 would most likely  have shown that 
Miss K was having problems managing her money. Ive explained why below.
The information Ive been provided shows that Miss K was earning around £1,000 a month.  She 
borrowed £350 for loan 1 which  was a fairly high proportion of this income. Miss K asked H&T not to 
cash the cheques she had provided in the first two months and she paid a fee to do this. This 
indicates to me that Miss K might  not have  had the funds to make  the loan repayments. 
Before Miss K repaid loan 1 she borrowed a further £200. She then borrowed another £50 a few 
weeks after this. I think by loan 2 it wouldve been clear that it was unlikely that Miss K would  be able 
to sustainably repay around two thirds of her income  in the near future.  It would be reasonable to 
assume that Miss K had some  expenditure  and the loan repayments  are a very high proportion  of her 
income in any event.  
I think  that H&T wouldve  found out this information if it had made  reasonable  checks. And I think  H&T 
wouldve seen Miss K was unlikely to have been able repay the loans in a sustainable way. So I think 
that it shouldnt have given  loans  2 to 4 to Miss K and I think shes lost out as a result of this. So Im 
upholding Miss Ks complaint about loans 2 to 4. 
I havent recreated  individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans  5 to 20 because I dont think  
that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of H&Ts lending history with Miss K, 
with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which  H&T should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so H&T should have  realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ks case, I think that this point  was reached by loan 5. I 
say this because:
up to loan 5 the amounts Miss K was borrowing  had been generally  very high in relation to 
her income, and going forward Miss K remained in debt to H&T without any significant  breaks 
Miss K wasnt always able to fully repay her earlier loans before new ones were approved. 
There were many  times when she still had significant amounts owing from earlier loans when 
she was given  a new loan. For example  when she took loans 5, 6 and 7 she was still making 
repayments to the instalment loan she started in September 2009
whilst  I think the repayments are intended to be flexible, Miss K needed to extend  the loans 
frequently. I think doing this consistently over a long period of time showed  she was having  
longer term financial problems 
H&T ought to have  realised it was more  likely than not Miss K was having  to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying her previous  loan was leaving  in her finances and that Miss Ks 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed H&T.  Loan 20 was taken out 
just under three years after Miss Ks first. And it was for a larger amount. Miss K had paid 
large amounts of interest to, in effect;  service a debt to H&T over an extended period
I think  that Miss K lost out because  H&T continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Miss Ks indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period of time
the sheer number of loans  (loans and extensions) were likely  to have had negative 
implications on Miss Ks ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market for 
these high-cost loans
So Im also upholding the complaint about loans  5 to 20 and H&T should put things right.

loans 1 to 3 and 5 to 20 were made by Miss K providing cheques  of either  £100 or £50 in 
return for cash of less than the cheque face value 
these  would be either  cashed around a month later or extended for a fee. 
the end dates  are when the last tranche of the lending was repaid. But in some cases  Miss K 
repaid the loans in part at an earlier time.  I havent  put this information  on the table
