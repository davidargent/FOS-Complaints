The complaint
E is unhappy that ClearBank Limited (ClearBank) has not refunded it after its directors 
were the victim of a safe account scam.
What happened
The details are well known to both parties and were set out in the investigators view, so I 
wont repeat them here in detail. But in summary, one of Es directors was contacted from a 
scammer purporting to be contacting her about an account held with a different bank. Both 
her and the other director of E were convinced to allow the scammer to transfer funds to 
ClearBank which were then transferred on to the scammer. The following payments were 
made.

I issued a provisional decision on 9 November 2023 in which I said the following:
Ive provisionally considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It is not in dispute that the payments in question were authorised. The directors of E were 
duped by scammers into allowing the transferring of funds into fake safe accounts. I 
therefore accept that this was an authorised payment, even through E was the victim of a 
sophisticated scam. So, although the directors of E did not intend the money to go to the 
fraudsters, under the Payment Services Regulations 2017, and the terms and conditions of 
his account, the directors of E are presumed liable for the loss in the first instance.
However, taking into account the law, regulators rules and guidance, relevant codes of 
practice and what I consider to have been good industry practice at the time, I consider 
ClearBank should fairly and reasonably have been monitoring accounts and any payments 
made or received. The purpose of which is to counter various risks, including money 
laundering, the financing of terrorism, and fraud and scams.
Clearbank was required to have systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or 
other signs that might indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (among other things). 
This is particularly so, given the large increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent 
years, which banks are generally more familiar with than the average customer.
In some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, financial business should 
take additional steps, or make additional checks, before processing a payment. In some 
cases, financial business will need to decline to make a payment altogether, to help protect 
customers from the possibility of financial harm. In this case, I need to consider whether 
ClearBank acted fairly and reasonably when the transfers were made, or whether it could 
and should have done more before processing them.I appreciate the first transfer was to a new payee, but similar and greater value transfers 
were made from this account in the past - including £80,000 a month prior. There is a 
balance to be struck between identifying payments that could potentially be fraudulent and 
minimising disruption to legitimate payments. However, I do feel that by transaction 10, the 
third large payment of £22,000 which was made on the same day as other smaller 
transactions, ought to have caused ClearBank concern. The evidence indicates that it 
shouldve done more to protect E when this payment was made. I think there were indicators 
that a scam was occurring  meaning ClearBank missed an opportunity to step in and 
question the payment before it left the account. Ill explain why.
Transaction 10 was the third  quite large - payment to a new payee within a short period of 
time. I think this activity was unusual. The activity that took place on Es account had the 
hallmarks of a scam and is exactly the type of suspicious account activity that ClearBank 
should be on the look-out for.
So, I do think the nature of the transaction was unusual and out of character compared to 
the usual account activity. I therefore think ClearBank ought fairly and reasonably to have 
made enquiries about the purpose of the £22,000 payment before it processed it.
Ive thought about what would most likely have happened, had ClearBank intervened at this 
point. I think it is likely that the directors of E would have explained that they were 
transferring funds to a safe account due to fraud on their account held via a different 
provider. I also think its likely if ClearBank had contacted the directors of E, they wouldve 
revealed that they had downloaded remote access software to allow a representative of the 
bank to do this for them  as theyd been instructed to do. Given this, in the circumstances of 
this case, I think it more likely than not ClearBank would have known by this point that a 
scam was indeed taking place and the scam could have been stopped at this point.
Should the directors of E bear some responsibility for the overall loss?
Ive also considered whether the directors of E should also bear some responsibility for the 
overall losses. In reaching this conclusion, Ive had regard to the scene that was set by the 
fraudsters and the impact I believe this reasonably had on the directors of E when acting in 
the moment. I accept that receiving a call purporting to be from their bank using what 
appeared to be the correct phone number would have been convincing to the directors of E. 
So, I can understand why they would be concerned and fell victim to the pressure of acting 
quickly.
That said though, once the scammer started talking about other bank accounts with the 
directors of Es and asking them to login to other accounts, they held with different providers 
I think that they should have become more suspicious. After all, no legitimate bank would 
know what accounts a customer has with other banks, nor is there any plausible reason why 
a legitimate bank would ask to remotely access an account a customer holds with different 
institutions. Also, from their testimony, it seems as if the scammer was repeatedly asking 
them to authorise payments being made from a different bank, which again would seem a 
highly unusual thing for a bank to ask for. In my view, although I have a great deal of 
sympathy for the Directors of E, and I recognise that fraudsters use fear and pressure to get 
people to do something they wouldnt usually do, I also think in this case, there were aspects 
of the communication that were clear signs that the person they were speaking to may not 
have been from where he claimed.I have thought carefully about what realistically the directors of E were reasonably expected 
to do in such a situation - bearing in mind the pressure of the situation they would have been 
under in the moment of the call like this. But by the time they were sharing login details from 
different banks with someone pretending to be from one bank, I think there were enough red 
flags and time to have reflected and questioned whether they should keep providing the 
person they were speaking to with further information about their accounts. Also, I note there 
were reasonably large gaps between the calls with the scammer and the directors of E, that 
gave them time to reflect on what they were being asked to do  or to contact ClearBank to 
check whether the unusual requests being received were legitimate or not.
I therefore do feel it is appropriate to reduce the amount of redress the business has to pay 
to E by 50%.
Did ClearBank do enough to recover Mr As funds?
Ive also thought about whether ClearBank took reasonable steps to recover the funds, once 
it was made aware of a scam. From what I can see I am satisfied that it attempted to recover 
the funds from the beneficiary banks as soon as it was made aware of the scam and it 
recovered what funds were still available. I also note that ClearBank is not signed up to the 
Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM). So I dont think that it needed to do more in 
relation to this.
Putting things right
In this instance the total loss to E from the account with ClearBank was £172,900. After I 
think ClearBank should have intervened there were transactions of £121,400. The other 
bank has already refunded £92,974. So, the amount not already refunded to E is £28,426. I 
further note that £19,376.41 was recovered by ClearBank, so the outstanding loss I think 
that ClearBank is liable for is £9,049.59 I then think that a 50% reduction should apply to 
this, for the reasons already outlined above.
I note that the investigator calculated this differently, as she deducted the 50% from the 
transactions that should have been prevented. But our usual approach is to deduct the 50% 
from the redress due.
I note the comments of Es representative that it believes that the calculation of what should 
be refunded should be based on how much of the funds sent on were funds already held in 
the account and how much were funds from the other bank. And that a refund from the other 
bank should not be used to offset funds that originated from funds already held in the 
ClearBank account. I have carefully considered this but overall, I think it only fair to calculate 
how much loss I think that ClearBank are liable for and deduct from this all refunds received 
as this is in line with what I would usually recommend if money had been recovered as part 
of a scam. I dont think it fair to ClearBank not to apply the entire amount recovered because 
it was refunded by a different bank when, all the funds that went into the account from the 
different bank were sent to the scammer so it was all part of the same overall loss.
Finally I can see that ClearBank made an offer of £75 to reflect delays when the scam was 
first reported. I think this is appropriate given the overall circumstances of this complaints. As 
the delays do not seem to have caused an actual financial loss.
I therefore provisionally require ClearBank to:Refund 50% of £9,049.59;
Pay E 8% simple interest, per year, on this amount from the date of each payment to 
date of settlement (less any tax lawfully deductible); and
Pay £75 to reflect the distress caused by delays when the scam was first reported.
In response to my provisional decision ClearBank agreed with my proposed redress, the 
representative of E did respond and raised a number of points these include
ClearBank should have intervened earlier than transaction 10
There was no large transaction of £80,000 the month prior to the transactions in 
question
The calculation I have used for the redress is incorrect
ClearBank should have recovered more than the £19,376.41 it recovered
There should not be a reduction of 50% for contributary negligence
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reconsidered everything, including the responses to my provisional decision, I still 
think that the outcome proposed in my provisional decision is fair and reasonable. I will 
explain why. 
Firstly. I should say that I have already considered and addressed points 1,3,4 and 5 in my 
provisional decision, but I will address them again briefly. 
In relation to points 1 and 2, I remain of the opinion that ClearBank should not have 
intervened until transaction 10. I note that the representative of E disputes the £80,000 
payment made from the account previously, but it does show up on the statements that I 
have been provided with. A payment for £80,000 debits and is recredited on the same day in 
February 2022. That said, given that this occurred on the same day, there is a possibility that 
it may have been some sort of bank error. But even if this payment did not occur the 
payments into the account in November 2021 show that large transactions were made on 
this account. This is a company account, and such an account would usually attract larger 
transactions than a personal account. Also, given the balance of the account, I think that 
there needed to be a larger number of outgoing payments before to prompt an intervention 
from ClearBank. In this case I think, albeit on balance, that transaction 10 would have been 
a suitable place for an intervention.
In relation to point 3 I have already explained my calculation for redress. I think that 
ClearBank should only refund what it was liable for loss wise, minus any money that was 
recovered. By this I mean only the payments that I believe ClearBank are liable for made by 
E out of this account to the beneficiary bank of the scammer, less any funds recovered. 
I note that E does not want the amount that ClearBank be liable for be reduced by the 
amount refunded by the other provider. They have suggested that E should get a refund of 
the original balance of the account (before the transfers into the account) minus the amount recovered by ClearBank. But this does not take into consideration the transactions that took 
place before I think ClearBank should have intervened that I dont think that it is liable for. E 
seems to argue that some of the money that was sent to the scammer prior to the 
intervention point should not reduce the amount that ClearBank is liable for because some of 
the funds sent prior to the intervention point were from the money sent into the account. But 
as there was already a balance of the account in excess of those transactions, I dont think 
that I could reasonably say this.
The funds paid into the account from the account held from another provider are not a loss 
suffered by E it is a loss suffered by the other account which was held on a personal basis 
and not by E. So it should be removed from the total amount sent from this account and in 
any event even were it Es loss it has already been refunded so should be deducted from the 
total loss. Therefore, the amount sent £172,900 should be reduced by £92,974. If I did this 
the loss to E from this account is £79,926 and the payments made before I think ClearBank 
should have intervened should be deducted from this loss which totals £51,500. This is 
because ClearBank is not liable for these payments. This amount £28,426 should be 
reduced by the amount recovered by ClearBank which is £19,376.41 and this (with the 50% 
reduction) is the same amount that I recommended. So I am not minded to change the 
amount that E should receive.
In relation to point 4, I can see that ClearBank did chase the beneficiary bank on the same 
day that the transactions were reported as scam. I dont think a delay was caused by 
ClearBank or that it could have acted any sooner. 
In relation to point 5, there is not much that I can already add to what I said in my provisional 
decision. I recognise that scammers rely on pressure and scare tactics and I appreciate that 
such manipulative behaviour can cause people to do something they wouldnt normally do. 
But even in such circumstances, I dont think that E should have thought it reasonable that a 
legitimate financial service provider in the UK would need the login details for their accounts 
held with other banks or ask them to login to said accounts. There was also enough time for 
E to have contacted the banks in question between the phone calls and when the 
transactions started. So I think that there should be a 50% deduction as E was partially 
responsible for its own loss
So, I uphold this complaint in part.
Putting things right
I therefore require ClearBank to:
Refund 50% of £9,049.59;
Pay E 8% simple interest, per year, on this amount from the date of each payment to 
date of settlement (less any tax lawfully deductible); and
Pay £75 to reflect the delays when the scam was first reported.My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and ClearBank Limited should pay E the 
redress outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask E and E to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 January 2024.
