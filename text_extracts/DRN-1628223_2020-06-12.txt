The complaint
Mr M says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr M says Sunny should have known the loans were unaffordable. He had to borrow 
further to repay the loans and got into a spiral of debt.
What happened
This complaint is about 61 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr M between November 
2016 and September 2018. Mr Ms borrowing history for the first 15 loans is as follows:

Mr M continued to borrow a further 46 loans between March 2017 and September 2018. The 
amounts borrowed ranged between £50 and £600.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ms complaint and thought the loans from loan nine 
onwards shouldnt have been given because Mr Ms borrowing suggested he was 
persistently reliant upon this type of credit. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to pay redress for loans 38 onwards. We put Sunnys offer to 
Mr M, but he didnt want to accept it.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr M didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to eight shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr M had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ms case, like the adjudicator, I think that this point 
was reached by loan nine. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his loans
sustainably. Mr M had taken out nine loans within two months. So Sunny ought to
have realised it was more likely than not Mr M was having to borrow further to cover
the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ms
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ms first loan was for £400 and loan nine was for £500.  At this point Sunny ought
to have known that Mr M was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his
income but to meet an ongoing need.
Mr M was regularly provided with a new loan within days or weeks of settling a
previous one. As examples;
oLoan 14 was taken the same day loan 12 was repaid and was for a larger
amount.
oLoan 53 was taken the same days as loans 47 and 48 were repaid.
oLoan 59 was taken the day after loan 58 was repaid.
I think this behaviour makes clear that the borrowing was unsustainable for Mr M and he was 
persistently reliant on this type of credit. 
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 61 was
taken out 22 months after Mr Ms first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr M had paidlarge amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan nine 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to
have had negative implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about nine to 61 and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr M paid on nine to 61;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from nine onwards means any information recorded about
them is adverse. So, all of the entries about loans nine to 61 should be removed from
Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 July 2020.
