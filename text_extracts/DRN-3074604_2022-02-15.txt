The complaint
Mr C has complained about how National Westminster Bank Plc (trading as NatWest) has 
dealt with his claim in relation to a boiler purchased on his credit card. 
What happened
In November 2019 Mr C paid £2,300 for a replacement boiler and installation. The Job 
Description on his invoice lists the boiler together with the following needed to install the 
boiler:
Standard flue with extension 
two channel programmer 
filter 
inhibitor 
system cleaner
Mr C paid an initial deposit of £100 on 22 November and then a further payment of £2,200 
on 30 November. Both payments were made using his NatWest credit card. 
Mr C has said that following the installation his radiators werent heating. Hes said the 
problem occurred as soon as the engineers left and that his radiators were working prior to 
this with his previous boiler. Mr C has provided notes of his contact with the supplier and has 
said he had a conversation with a manager on 3 December where the manager suggested 
additional work that was needed. The supplier came out to correct the problem on 
5 December. However, around two weeks after this, Mr C says only some of the radiators 
were heating and this problem continued intermittently. 
On 3 December Mr C contacted NatWest to try and recover the amount paid. NatWest 
requested further information from Mr C. This included a copy of the invoice, evidence that 
he had tried to resolve this issue directly with the supplier and evidence to show that he 
made the goods (in this case the boiler) available for the supplier to collect. Around a month 
later NatWest also requested an independent report detailing the fault with the boiler.    
Following NatWests request there were a number of exchanges between Mr C and NatWest 
as this information was gathered. Mr C has also raised that he is unhappy with how NatWest 
progressed his claim during this time. 
NatWest didnt raise a chargeback request on Mr Cs behalf. It said that this was because, 
whilst Mr C had provided a copy of an independent report he had commissioned, it wasnt 
legible. NatWest said it requested another copy of the report which was legible but this 
wasnt provided. So NatWest felt it didnt have enough evidence to pursue the chargeback. 
NatWest also said that the time Mr C took to gather the relevant information meant he was 
outside the 120 day time limit to raise the chargeback. NatWest also rejected Mr Cs claim 
under Section 75 (s75) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (CCA) as it argued Mr C hadnt 
evidenced there had been a breach of contract or misrepresentation. NatWest did accept 
there were delays in issuing its response to Mr Cs complaint. Due to this, it offered £25 to 
compensate Mr C for the delay.  
Mr C was unhappy with how NatWest had handled his claim and subsequent complaint 
about this, so he referred his complaint to our service. One of our investigators considered 
his complaint but didnt uphold it. He also felt there wasnt enough evidence to show a fault 
with the boiler, so he didnt think a chargeback was likely to be successful and didnt think 
NatWest had unfairly declined Mr Cs s75 claim. Mr C was unhappy with the investigators 
assessment, particularly given how he felt NatWest had treated him while his claim was 
ongoing.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not going to uphold this complaint. Ill explain why below.
Chargeback 
Mr C asked NatWest to raise a chargeback on his behalf to recover the amount paid to the 
supplier. A chargeback is a dispute resolution scheme administrated by the card network. 
The scheme sets out various rules which need to be complied with and whilst NatWest has 
discretion about whether or not to raise a chargeback, Id consider it to be good industry 
practice for NatWest to do so, but only where there is a reasonable prospect of success. 
Prior to raising a chargeback, Mr C also needed to demonstrate that hed first exhausted 
attempts to try and resolve the issues with the supplier direct.
Mr C has provided a handwritten timeline of events to NatWest detailing the attempts made 
to rectify the issue with the supplier. Mr Cs notes detail who he spoke to and when. It also 
provides a summary of what was discussed. From this I can see Mr C spoke to a manager at 
the supplier on 3 December 2019 and there was some discussion about additional work the 
manager felt could be needed. The supplier returned around two days later to rectify the 
problems and Mr C has said that after this visit the problems continued. 
I think its clear Mr C made efforts to get the issues rectified with the supplier. Ive noted that 
Mr C raised these issues with NatWest around two days before the supplier came out to 
rectify the issues. However, as this didnt resolve the issue, I dont think this makes a 
difference. And so I think Mr C has provided enough detail to persuade me that he attempted 
to rectify the issue with the supplier directly. 
As Ive explained above NatWest didnt raise a chargeback on Mr Cs behalf because it felt it 
didnt have a reasonable prospect of success. Looking at the relevant chargeback rules 
(which applied at the time) I can see that NatWest wouldve needed to select a reason code 
for the chargeback and I think the relevant reason code wouldve been Goods or services 
were either not as described or defective. In this section it details that although optional, 
evidence should be provided to support the cardholders version of events. In this case this 
would be evidence from Mr C that the boiler and/or installation were defective/faulty.  
Mr C provided NatWest with a copy of an independent report which has been dated 
6 December 2019. I can see from Mr Cs contact notes, which NatWest has provided, that 
this report was received by NatWest on 3 February 2020. However, NatWest wasnt able to 
read the copy of the report provided and having also reviewed it, I agree it isnt legible. I 
understand a number of requests were made by NatWest to Mr C to obtain a copy which 
was legible. Looking at the contact notes I can see NatWest initially requested this on 
9 March and then 19 March 2020 and when Mr C called NatWest on 26 May 2020 for an 
update, this was again requested. Mr C has said another copy of the report was 
subsequently sent to NatWest, but NatWest has maintained it doesnt have a legible copy of 
the report. Our service has also requested a legible copy of the report from Mr C which 
hasnt been provided. And without a legible copy of the report there is limited evidence of 
what the fault was or how it was caused. Particularly as the Completion Certificate, Final Inspection Form and Pre-inspection Checklist completed by the supplier suggest the boiler 
was fitted correctly and was working at the time of installation.
Ive noted that Mr C did have discussions with the supplier on 3 December about additional 
work that might be needed. However, it doesnt appear the manager inspected the boiler 
before reaching those conclusions (as Mr Cs notes suggest this was a telephone 
conversation) and Mr C disputes that this work was needed. So I dont think this helps 
determine what the fault was and even if it did, it doesnt demonstrate that the fault was 
caused by the supplier (resulting in a breach of contract).  
So taking all of this into consideration, without evidence that the fault was caused by the 
boiler and/or the installation, I think it was reasonable for NatWest to conclude Mr C didnt 
have a reasonable prospect of success with his chargeback request. 
Ive also considered NatWests additional point that Mr C was out of time to raise a 
chargeback request. NatWest is correct that Mr C had 120 days from when he discovered 
the fault to raise a chargeback request. I have noted that NatWest didnt request an 
independent report until almost a month after Mr C initially contacted NatWest. Its also not 
clear if Mr C was made aware of the time limits. However, I dont this makes a difference. I 
say this because NatWest has said it didnt receive a legible copy of the report (despite 
requests) nor has Mr C provided a copy to our service upon request. So Im not satisfied that 
even if Mr C knew about the deadline and there was no delay in NatWest requesting the 
information, that Mr C wouldve still provided this information in time. And so I dont think 
NatWest acted unfairly in not raising a chargeback request.
Section 75 Claim
Section 75 CCA makes the provider of credit (NatWest in this case) equally liable where 
there is a case of misrepresentation or breach of contract by the supplier of the goods or 
services. For a s75 claim there are a number of different criteria which need to be met. 
Having looked at Mr Cs claim, I think he does meet the criteria to make a s.75 claim. In 
particular, I can see Mr C contracted with the supplier to purchase and install the boiler. Mr C 
paid the supplier directly using his credit card and the amount is within the relevant financial 
limits. 
As explained above, Mr C has argued that there were problems immediately after the boiler 
installation. Hes said that not all of the radiators were heating and that this problem 
continued intermittently. So Mr C is arguing that the boiler wasnt of satisfactory quality and/ 
or the work carried out to install it wasnt carried out with reasonable care and skill. The 
Consumer Rights Act 2015 implies terms to this effect into a contract for goods or services 
(or digital content). So if Mr C could demonstrate these arguments, hed be able to show that 
the supplier breached the contract.
As explained above, Mr C has provided a copy of an independent engineers report 
completed on his new boiler after it was installed by the supplier, however it is illegible. 
NatWest made a number of requests for a legible copy but has maintained a legible copy 
wasnt provided. Mr Cs notes say he sent NatWest another copy on 27 May 2020, but 
despite requests from our service, a legible copy hasnt been provided. I also understand 
that one of our investigators tried to contact the company who completed the report, but was 
unable to gain another copy. So I dont know what information was recorded in this report or 
whether or not it evidences a breach of contract. 
As detailed above, I have considered Mr Cs notes of the conversation which took place with 
a manager for the supplier on 3 December. However, as Ive explained, Mr Cs notes dont 
suggest the manager inspected the boiler before suggesting work to be completed so I can 
place limited weight on whether this work did need completing or not. And even if I accept 
this work was needed, without an independent report, I dont know if the additional work was 
needed as a result of the supplier breaching the contract.  Mr C has said hes taken a number of steps to try to rectify the issue hes experienced with 
the boiler and so our service has asked for details of any issues found and the steps taken to 
rectify them. Mr C has said he took out an emergency cover policy and a boiler maintenance 
contract (both with different companies to the supplier). Hes said the boiler maintenance 
company has completed inspections on the boiler and he provided a copy of an inspection 
report from January 2021. However, having reviewed this document, I cant see that it 
provides any details on the ongoing fault Mr C has described or a potential cause of this. 
This report demonstrates that the boiler had passed the various checks completed and was 
working. Mr C has also said an emergency engineer from a local company came out to fix 
the boiler fault. However, hes said he paid them in cash and wasnt given any information 
about the work which was completed.  
Ive carefully considered everything Mr C has told us about the problems hes experienced 
and the steps hes taken to rectify them. I dont doubt Mr C has experienced these problems 
and I appreciate that this will have been distressing for Mr C and his family. However, in 
order to uphold his complaint Id need to be satisfied that the problems were caused by the 
boiler and/or the installation of it, resulting in a breach of contract. And Ive seen nothing to 
conclusively show what the problem was or the cause of it. So because of this Im unable to 
say theres been a breach of contract or that NatWest acted unfairly in not upholding his 
claim. 
Delays in progressing Mr Cs claim 
Mr C has also raised a number of concerns about how NatWest progressed his claim. Hes 
said he repeatedly had to chase NatWest and he found the whole process very distressing 
and stressful. 
Ive reviewed Mr Cs timeline of events together with NatWests contact notes with Mr C. 
Given the amount of contact between the parties I dont intend to set this out in full here. 
However, whilst I can see a number of delays, I think both parties bear some responsibility 
for this. Ill explain why below.
The main delays in progressing Mr Cs claim are down to gathering the required evidence. 
Having reviewed both NatWests and Mr Cs timelines of events, I can see NatWest caused 
delays in not requesting all the required information at once. However, equally some of the 
delays were caused by NatWest waiting on information from Mr C. I can also see that some 
of the evidence which NatWest asked for was either missing or incomplete from the 
information Mr C sent. This therefore resulted in further requests and delays. In particular, as 
Ive explained above, Mr C sent a copy of the engineers report which NatWest couldnt read. 
NatWest chased for a legible copy several times, but has said one wasnt provided. NatWest 
also chased for proof that Mr C had made the goods available for the supplier to collect 
which wasnt initially provided. 
Taking everything into consideration, I dont doubt that having problems with his heating and 
the length of time it was taking to resolve matters was causing Mr C distress. However, I 
cant conclude that NatWest unfairly delayed his claim and that Mr C should be 
compensated for this when theres insufficient evidence NatWest caused significant delays. 
Im also not satisfied that even if NatWest had done everything right this wouldve materially 
impacted how long his claim took given Mr Cs actions. So Im currently not recommending 
NatWest do anything more in relation to this.
As Ive detailed above, NatWest did delay in providing a response letter to Mr Cs complaint 
(the complaint that was subsequently made when his claim was unsuccessful) and has 
offered him £25 for this. This seems fair in the circumstances and Im not going to direct 
NatWest to do anything further. My final decision
For the reasons above, Im not upholding Mr Cs complaint about National Westminster Bank 
Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2022.
