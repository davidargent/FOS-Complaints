The complaint
Mr M complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his current, loan and 
credit card accounts without reason.  
Mr M says NatWests actions have caused him substantive distress and inconvenience.    
What happened
In September 2020, following an internal review, NatWest closed Mr Ms accounts. NatWest 
say it gave Mr M seven days notice of this. M says he didnt get any such notice. 
Mr M says if he was given enough notice of closure, he would have switched his accounts 
and transferred any balances. Mr M says his credit rating has been affected as a result. 
Mr M complained to this service. One of our investigators looked into the matter, and they 
found:
- NatWests review of Mr Ms account, and subsequent block, was in line with its legal 
and regulatory obligations
- NatWest didnt apply its terms fairly by closing Mr Ms accounts with seven days 
notice. Fair Notice would have been to give Mr M 60 days notice
- There wasnt enough evidence to show NatWest had sent the notice to close letter
- NatWest didnt do anything wrong by not giving a reason for closing Mr Ms accounts 
- Mr M relied on his personal loans and credits cards for essential living costs. So the 
impact of these being closed would have been harshly felt
- Had NatWest given Mr M 60 days notice there were no guarantees he would have 
found a new bank willing to accept his overdraft and credit card balances. So Mr M 
would likely not have suffered any detriment had NatWest given him 60 days notice. 
To put things right, our investigator recommended NatWest pay £200 compensation for the 
distress and inconvenience caused to Mr M.  
Mr M finds £200 compensation paltry considering the distress and inconvenience he has 
suffered. He argues his credit rating has been affected. 
The matter has now been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Account review
Banks in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their 
legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of an 
existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to restrict, or in some 
cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
So, because of this, Im satisfied NatWest didnt do anything wrong when it reviewed, and 
blocked, Mr Ms accounts. 
Account closure
A bank is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with a bank. 
But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the terms 
and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account, which NatWest and M had to comply with, say it 
could close the account by giving it at least 60 days notice. And in certain circumstances it 
can close an account immediately or with less notice. 
Having looked at the information given to me by NatWest, Im not persuaded it was entitled 
to close the accounts in the way it has done. Im under no obligation that Im aware of to 
disclose the reasons NatWest took the actions it did. But given the information Ive seen, I 
think NatWest ought to have given Mr M sixty days notice as opposed to the seven it says it 
gave.   
For NatWest to have closed the accounts in the way it has, I would expect to see stronger 
evidence than it has provided. 
Mr M argues that if he had been given more notice, he could have avoided any detriment by 
switching the account, transferring the credit card balances and taking other loans to cover 
the ones he had with NatWest. Im persuaded having sixty days to change its banking 
arrangements would have helped Mr M and alleviated his distress.  
So I think Mr M would have suffered less detriment had NatWest given it 60 days notice 
instead of the seven it says it did. 
Mr M says he has suffered substantive distress and inconvenience, and his credit rating has 
been adversely affected by NatWests actions. 
NatWest have given me information which shows Mr Ms personal loans were permitted to 
stay active if Mr M continued to meet his payment obligations. And if he did this no adverse 
credit information would be recorded against him. So I dont think NatWest have acted 
unfairly or unreasonably here. 
NatWests records show Mr Ms credit card accounts defaulted in early 2021. So I dont think 
NatWests decision to close the accounts with seven days notice would have made that 
much difference to this happening, given it wasnt till three, or four months later, that Mr M 
defaulted. Its also not uncommon for credit card providers, when choosing to terminate a 
relationship, to ask for a balance to be paid on demand. 
But its likely 60 days notice would have helped Mr M with potentially switching his bank 
accounts. 
Mr M says it never received NatWests notice of closure letter. NatWest have given me a template of the letter it says was sent and a screenshot from its system to show it was. I 
dont need to make a finding on whether the letter was sent as Ive already said NatWest 
should have given Mr M 60 days notice. 
So, lastly, I need to weigh up what I think is fair compensation for what NatWest has done 
wrong. Having done that, I think £200 compensation is fair for the distress and 
inconvenience caused to Mr M. 
Id like to assure Mr M in coming to this decision, Ive weighed up that NatWest was 
obligated to carry out its review and that closing Mr Ms account was something it fairly did  
but it should have done so by giving him more notice. So this award reflects the distress and 
inconvenience of Mr M having been given 60 days notice.  
For the reasons Ive explained above, NatWest should also remove any adverse credit 
markers if it applied any against Mr M for his current accounts in September, October and 
November 2020. This would mean, to a large extent, Mr M isnt prejudiced by NatWest 
giving it seven days notice instead of sixty days.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to put things right as 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 January 2022.
