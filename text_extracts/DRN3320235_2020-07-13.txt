K822xcomplaint
Miss D complains about the way that Vauxhall Finance plc has dealt with the settlement of a 
conditional sale agreement under  which a car had been supplied to her.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus  on giving the reasons for 
my decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Vauxhall Finance  accepts that it gave the wrong  settlement figure to Miss Ds 
insurers after her car was stolen;
the insurer paid the settlement amount to Vauxhall Finance which  left an outstanding 
balance on her account  and it then made  a further  payment  to Miss D;
Vauxhall Finance  accepts that it should have given Miss D longer to pay the 
outstanding balance on her account  and shouldnt have defaulted her account - its 
now agreed a repayment  plan with her, waived a late payment fee and agreed to 
remove the default from her credit  file;
the adjudicator  thought that the outcome reached was correct but it failed to take into 
account Miss Ds circumstances and the difficulty shed gone through so he 
recommended that it should also pay her £300 compensation; 
Vauxhall Finance  accepted that recommendation and Miss D says that the final 
outcome is as it should have  been and shes  happy to make payments monthly until 
her balance  is settled   but she doesnt  feel that £300 reflects the amount of her 
distress and inconvenience;
she has described the distress and inconvenience  thats  shes been caused - and I 
sympathise with her for all of the difficulties that shes  experienced;
Ive considered the evidence that shes provided  in detail but, having looked at all of 
the circumstances of this complaint,  I agree with the adjudicator  that £300 is fair and 
reasonable compensation for the distress  and inconvenience that shes been caused 
 and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Vauxhall 
Finance to pay her a higher  amount  of compensation; and
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Vauxhall Finance to pay £300 to Miss D 
to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused  (but if 
shed prefer that amount  to be credited against  the outstanding balance  that she 
owes, I suggest that she asks it to do that).
my final decision
Ref: DRN33202352So my decision is that I uphold Miss Ds complaint in part and I order Vauxhall Finance plc to 
pay her £300 to compensate her for the distress  and inconvenience that shes  been caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 August 2020.
