Mr D later complained about these  loans. Our adjudicator  upheld  the complaint and thought  
loan 4 onwards  shouldnt  have been given to Mr D. Uncle  Buck disagreed  and the complaint 
has now been passed to me to deal with.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Uncle Buck  had to assess Mr Ds applications  for borrowing to check if he could afford  to pay 
back the amounts  hed borrowed  without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which 
was proportionate to the circumstances.  Uncle Bucks checks  could have taken into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments 
and Mr Ds income and expenditure. With this in mind, I think  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
Ref: DRN95549592But certain factors might  suggest  Uncle Buck should  have done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr D. These factors include:
Mr D having a low income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr D having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr D coming  back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr D.
Uncle Buck  was required to establish whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether he technically had enough  money  to make his repayments.  Having enough  
money to make the repayments could of course  be an indicator that Mr D was able to repay 
his loans sustainably.  But it doesnt  automatically  follow that this is the case. The FCAs 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made 
without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have  realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude  those  repayments  are 
unsustainable.
Ive considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Ds complaint.
I think Uncle Bucks  checks were  proportionate  for loans 1 to 3. These  loans were for small 
amounts relative  to Mr Ds declared income  and Ive not seen evidence Uncle Buck  was 
aware of anything which might have  meant  hed struggle to repay them. Based on the 
information Mr D provided about  his income  and expenditure, these loans appeared to be 
affordable and so I dont  find Uncle  Buck was wrong  to grant  them.
As our adjudicator explained, at the time Mr D applied for loan 4 he had told Uncle  Buck he 
had an income of £1,700 per month and expenditure of £1,452 per month, which meant  he 
had £248 available to meet any other commitments,  such as his prospective repayments to 
Uncle Buck.  Given Mr Ds largest expected loan 4 repayment was higher  than this, at 
£269.90, I find it surprising that it agreed to give him this loan.  After  all, Uncle Buck  could 
see the repayments were  not affordable.
Our adjudicator also noted that Mr D was spending significant amounts of money   up to 
£1,500 per month  on online betting sites.  This was almost all of his income. While I 
appreciate Uncle Bucks point that there  were  limited ways  for it to become aware of this, I 
think by the time Mr D had taken  loan 5 it should  have  been concerned  enough about  Mr Ds 
borrowing history to be far more thorough in its checks.
 
Ref: DRN95549593Mr D had been unable  to repay  loans  3 and 4 on time and was given extensions to repay 
what he owed  once  on loan 3 and twice  on loan 4. Whilst Mr D did provide reasons for 
needing the extensions,  he had also now taken five loans in about six months, and in my 
view such a pattern was beginning to suggest an underlying, longer-term financial problem. 
Indeed, Uncle Buck appears to have  been  concerned enough to ask Mr D to send  in a bank 
statement to support his loan 5 application. The next day however Uncle  Buck changed its 
mind and decided  it didnt need to see a bank statement after all. This seems to have been a 
missed opportunity  and I think it would in fact have  been proportionate  for Uncle  Buck to 
have reviewed Mr Ds bank statements at this time. Had it done so I think  it would have 
discovered Mr D was struggling to manage his finances due to the amount of online betting 
going through his account,  and was not in a position  to take out loans. 
Mr Ds situation did not substantially improve after this point, so it follows  that I dont think  
Uncle Buck  should  have  given Mr D loan 5, or any of his subsequent  loans.  I think  it was 
irresponsible for it to have  done so.
putting things right
Uncle Buck  shouldnt have given Mr D loans 4 to 11, so its not right that he should have had 
to pay interest, fees or charges on these, or have them affect  his credit file in a negative  
way. And because Uncle Buck should have  concluded  it was irresponsible to lend to Mr D 
from loan 5 onwards,  I dont think its fair that these loans should  impact his credit  file at all. 
So to put things right I direct Uncle Buck  to:
A)Add together the amount Mr D has paid in interest, fees and charges on loans 4 to 
11.
B)Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  considered as part of A, 
calculated from the date Mr D originally made the payments to the date the complaint 
is settled.
C)Pay the total of A plus B to Mr D.
D)Remove any negative  information relating to loan 4 from Mr Ds credit  file.
E)Remove loans 5 to 11 from Mr Ds credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take tax off this interest. Uncle  Buck must 
give Mr D a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off, if Mr D asks for one.
Ref: DRN95549594my final decision
I uphold Mr Ds complaint  and direct Uncle Buck Finance LLP to take the actions set out in 
the putting things  right section above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 April 2019.
