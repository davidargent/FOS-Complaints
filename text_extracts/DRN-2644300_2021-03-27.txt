The complaint
Miss O complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) declined her request for a 
refund. Miss O wants PayPal to refund her money.   
  
What happened
Miss O used her PayPal account to send a payment of £3,827 for the purchase of items. A 
few weeks later, Miss O raised a claim with PayPal on the basis she hadnt received the 
items. PayPal asked the seller to provide item shipping information to confirm delivery to 
Miss O. The seller provided this and PayPal said it met their delivery requirements. 
PayPal then made enquiries with the courier company who delivered the items. PayPal said 
the courier company told them the items with the tracking number in question was sent to 
Miss Os address. They said this met their delivery requirements so the claim was closed. 
Miss O complained to PayPal and they said they had acted in line with the User Agreement 
and their policies. PayPal offered £300 credit as a courtesy for any inconvenience caused. 
Our investigator looked into things for Miss O. She thought PayPal hadnt acted fairly in 
declining Miss Os claim for a refund. Miss O agreed with the investigators view, but PayPal 
disagreed so the matter has come to me for a decision.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold the complaint. I think PayPal do need to refund the 
payment to Miss O and Ill explain why below. 
I understand disputes will often arise in online platforms designed for buying and selling 
goods. Its therefore important for PayPal, being a payment platform, to have policies in 
place to help resolve those disputes. PayPal does have such policies, but what Ive 
considered here is whether PayPal have applied their policy fairly when dealing with the 
claim. 
Miss O has made a claim to PayPal for non-receipt of the items she paid for. So, Ive looked 
into this in more detail and the sections of the policy which cover this. The PayPal Buyer 
Protection section of the policy says a buyer may be eligible for a refund. It says, when 
applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection entitles a buyer to reimbursement for the full purchase 
price of the item. It also says, PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether a claim 
qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection. The policy says, one of the types of claim where 
PayPal Buyer Protection may apply, is a situation where a buyer doesnt receive the item 
from a seller  this is referred to as an Item Not Received claim. The policy goes further and 
says:
Item Not Received claims 
Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not 
Received claim, if: 
The seller has provided proof of delivery. 
If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find 
in favour of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not 
receive the goods.   
PayPal have provided information which shows the shipping address which was provided to 
the seller as well as a tracking reference from the seller which they say confirms the parcel 
was delivered to the correct address. I havent been provided with any document from 
PayPal which shows the parcel was delivered to Miss Os address. Ive looked at the 
tracking reference provided by PayPal and this matches the tracking reference provided by 
Miss O. And, the tracking information provided by Miss O shows that the item under this 
tracking reference has been delivered. So, I agree the information shows a delivery has 
taken place. 
Im not persuaded however the information shows that the item under the tracking reference 
has been delivered to Miss O. The policy says PayPal may find in the sellers favour for a 
non-receipt claim if they can present evidence which shows they delivered the goods to 
you. Miss O has provided a missed delivery card from the courier company which says they 
tried to deliver a parcel at 5.28pm on 18 September. The card has been marked to say the 
courier company will try again the next business day. There is then tracking information from 
the courier company which shows the parcel was delivered on 18 September at 5.29pm and 
it was received by DRIVER RELEASE and left at Other. 
Ive looked at the courier companys website and can see a missed delivery card is left at an 
address if the courier has missed the intended recipient of the parcel. The information on the 
website says the card will then be completed by the courier to let a customer know whats 
happened. There are boxes which can be ticked to say the parcel has been left with a 
Neighbour/Other or that the parcel can be collected. In this case, I can see the box has 
been marked to say the courier company will try again the next business day. The tracking 
information however shows conflicting information and says the parcel was delivered. The 
card has been left at 5.28pm and the tracking information says the parcel was delivered at 
5.29pm. 
So, taking this into account Ive considered whether its possible the card was left but then 
one minute later the parcel was delivered to Miss O. I think this is unlikely because the 
tracking information doesnt suggest Miss O has signed for the parcel  and I wouldve 
expected this even if she had taken delivery of it a minute after the card was left. Its unclear 
what it means when the tracking reference refers to the parcel being received by driver 
release. Its also unclear what it means when it refers to the parcel being left at other. The 
only other reference I have seen to the term other is in the missed delivery card which 
refers to neighbour/other. So it might well suggest the parcel was left with someone other 
than Miss O. The important point here though is that both of these parts of the tracking 
information dont suggest the parcel was delivered to Miss Os address.    
PayPal say that the item was delivered and also refer to a telephone call with the courier 
company during which theyre told the parcel was delivered to the correct address. Based on 
what Ive said above, if a parcel has been delivered, on the balance of probabilities, I think 
its more likely than not, that it wasnt delivered to Miss O. 
Theres nothing in the tracking information which specifically links the parcel to Miss O. For 
instance, it doesnt show her name or address. Miss O has told us there was a buzzer entry system to her property so a courier wouldnt have been able to gain access into the building 
without being given entry. And, this is why the card was left in her buzzer.  
PayPal say they have acted within the terms of their User Agreement by declining the claim. 
But, for the reasons above, I dont think the information provided by PayPal proves the 
parcel was delivered to Miss Os address. So I dont think its fair that PayPal decided the 
claim in the sellers favour. For these reasons, I think PayPal should refund the payment 
made by Miss O.
PayPal have already offered Miss O a credit of £300, which they say was made as a gesture 
and without any admission of liability. PayPal say Miss O declined this offer. Ive set out what 
I think PayPal need to do to put things right for Miss O so I will leave PayPal to consider 
whether they still wish to offer Miss O a credit of £300.     
Putting things right
Ive taken the view that PayPal have acted unfairly in deciding the claim in the sellers favour 
and have been unreasonable in the way in which theyve applied their PayPal Buyer 
Protection policy. So, PayPal should refund the payment made by Miss O for this transaction 
together with 8% interest per year simple from the date she paid the funds, until theyre 
reimbursed. I think its reasonable for simple interest to be added to the refund amount as 
Miss O has been without these funds for this time. 
  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must refund 
the payment Miss O has made for this transaction together with simple interest on this 
amount at the rate of 8% a year* from the date the funds were paid until the date of 
settlement. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to take off tax from this 
interest. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must give Miss O a certificate showing how much 
tax its taken off if she asks for one.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss O to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 April 2021.
