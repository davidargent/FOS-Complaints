K821x#15complaint
Miss S has complained  that AvantCredit of UK LLC lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss S was given a loan of £1,000 by AvantCredit in May 2015. The loan was due to be 
repaid in 48 monthly instalments of around  £54. If the loan ran to term, the total amount
repayable including interest  was just over £2,639. I understand  the loan remains 
outstanding.
One of our adjudicators has looked into the complaint. He thought  AvantCredit shouldnt  
have provided  Miss S with the loan. AvantCredit  disagreed with the adjudicators 
assessment. So the complaint has been passed  to me to resolve.
When AvantCredit disagreed with the adjudicators opinion,  it also told us that Miss S had 
taken two other loans.  Ive not seen any further information about  these  other loans, so my 
decision deals solely with the £1,000 loan that Miss S took from AvantCredit in May 2015  
with loan number  105629. 
Its not clear to me whether Miss S has complained  or intends to complain  to AvantCredit 
about any of her other loans. But if she does raise a complaint with AvantCredit about  those 
other loans,  then it would  be dealt with as a separate  matter.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to considering unaffordable and irresponsible  lending complaints  
on our website - including the key relevant rules, guidance, good  industry  practice and law. 
And Ive considered this approach when deciding Miss Ss complaint.
AvantCredit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend to Miss S 
irresponsibly. I think there are key questions I need  to consider in order to decide  whats  fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this particular  complaint:
Did AvantCredit carry out reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that 
Miss S was in a position  to sustainably repay  the loan? If not, what would reasonable 
and proportionate checks have shown at the time? Did AvantCredit make  a fair 
lending decision?
Did AvantCredit act unfairly or unreasonably towards Miss S in some other way?
AvantCredit was required to carry out a borrower focussed assessment or affordability  
check. The checks had to be borrower  focussed  so AvantCredit had to think  about 
whether repaying  the loan sustainably would cause  difficulties or adverse consequences  for 
Miss S. AvantCredit had to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy  itself 
that Miss S would be able repay the loan sustainably. There  was no set list of checks that 
AvantCredit had to do, but it could take into account  a number of different things such  as the 
loan amount, the length of the loan term, the repayment amounts, and the borrowers  overall 
financial circumstances.
Ref: DRN33616492In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have  
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); and
the longer  the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit  is 
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make  payments for an extended  
period); 
AvantCredit was required to establish  whether Miss S could sustainably  repay  her loan  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesn't automatically follow  this is the case. This 
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all the evidence, arguments  and information Ive seen about this
matter and what it means for Miss S.
AvantCredit asked  Miss S for information  about her income and expenditure and it acquired 
a credit report which AvantCredit says it used to identify  any pre-existing debt obligations. 
On the face of it, Miss S appears to have  had sufficient disposable income to afford the loan.
But I think AvantCredit ought reasonably to have been aware  from its checks  that some of 
the information that Miss S had provided in her application was somewhat at odds with 
information in her credit report. 
Miss Ss application data indicated her monthly expenses  totalled £1,275  but this figure  
doesnt appear to have  included her total monthly payments towards her existing credit 
commitments. AvantCredit was aware that the purpose of Miss Ss loan was debt 
consolidation. The Call Report showed  that Miss S had a total debt balance  of over £27,000, 
not including  a mortgage; that she had opened  6 short term loan accounts in the previous 3 
months, 11 short term loan accounts in the previous 6 months and she had 3 active short 
term loan accounts.  The report also indicated that Miss S had total monthly payments on her 
accounts of £1,345. 
AvantCredit says that as Miss Ss loan was for debt consolidation, her monthly  repayments  
would have been reduced and it thinks her loan was affordable. 
But Miss S was taking  a loan for £1,000  - given the level of her overall  indebtedness,  I think  
AvantCredit ought reasonably to have realised  that any debt consolidation was likely to be 
limited. I havent seen anything which suggests  the lender  asked Miss S to clarify what  
impact this limited debt consolidation would have  on her monthly outgoings.  I think  in the 
circumstances AvantCredit ought  to have  realised from its checks that Miss Ss financial 
Ref: DRN33616493position might not have  been made clear in her application and that she might have 
underestimated some of her outgoings. I would have  expected  AvantCredit  to want to obtain 
a thorough understanding of Miss Ss true financial position - to satisfy itself that she could 
sustainably meet her loan repayments  over the extended loan term. I think that AvantCredit  
ought reasonably  to have realised that in order for its checks to be reasonable and 
proportionate, in the circumstances, it needed to look further into Miss S financial position  
for example by asking to see her bank statements.
Miss S has provided us with copies of her bank statements for the months leading up to her 
loan application  so I can determine what better checks might have shown AvantCredit at that 
time. And I have considered this information in light of what  Ive set out above. 
Of course,  different checks  might show different things. But I think  if AvantCredit had carried 
out what I consider  to be proportionate checks, I think  its likely it would have discovered 
more about Miss Ss financial  position. In particular  I think it more likely than not that 
AvantCredit would have realised that in March and April Miss S was having significant 
difficulties managing her finances and that she was spending a considerable amount in 
regular betting  transactions,  as well as borrowing from several  other short-term lenders. 
As Ive already  explained, AvantCredit  was required to establish  whether Miss S could 
sustainably make her loan repayments over the extended loan term. Overall, I think  if 
AvantCredit had carried out proportionate  checks on Miss Ss finances it ought reasonably to 
have realised that she was having  problems managing her finances  and that she would most 
likely need  to borrow elsewhere to repay her loan from AvantCredit. I would have expected 
AvantCredit to realise that it was unlikely that Miss S would be able to sustainably repay her 
loan. So it ought  reasonably to have concluded  that it was not appropriate to lend to her.
Did AvantCredit act unfairly or unreasonably towards Miss S in some other way?
Miss S feels that AvantCredit did not treated her sympathetically when she experienced 
difficulties repaying  her loan. AvantCredit  says that it arranged a reduced  payment plan and 
that interest  was frozen whilst that plan was in place. I understand that a Notice  of Arrears 
was sent to Miss S, but AvantCredit says it cannot prevent legally required notices from 
being issued to a borrower.
I understand why, in Miss Ss circumstances, she has found the situation difficult,  but  I dont 
think that AvantCredit has treated her unfairly or unsympathetically  when she found herself 
unable to repay the loan as planned.  However, I dont that Miss S should have been 
provided with the loan,  so AvantCredit should put things right for her.
Putting things  right 
I understand that Miss Ss loan may still be outstanding.  If AvantCredit  has sold the 
outstanding debt it should buy it back from the third party, if its able to do so, and then take 
the following  steps. If AvantCredit isnt able to buy the debt back  then it should liaise with the 
new debt owner to achieve the results outlined  below.
I think its fair and reasonable for Miss S to repay  the principal  amount that she borrowed, 
because shes had the benefit of that lending. But she has paid interest  and charges on a 
loan that shouldnt have been provided  to her. So AvantCredit should:
Ref: DRN33616494Remove all interest, fees and charges  from the loan and treat all the payments 
Miss S made as payments towards the capital. 
If reworking Miss Ss loan account results in her having effectively made 
payments above the original capital borrowed, then AvantCredit should  refund 
these overpayments  with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments,  
from the date the overpayments would  have arisen, to the date of settlement*. 
If reworking the account leaves an amount of capital  still to be paid, then 
AvantCredit should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss S, 
bearing in mind its obligation  to treat her positively and sympathetically in these 
discussions.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Ss credit  file in relation  to the 
loan, once the capital has been repaid.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to deduct tax from this interest. AvantCredit 
should give Miss S a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if she asks for one.
my final decision
Having considered all the evidence provided to me and reflecting  on what  is most likely to 
have happened  in the circumstances, I uphold Miss Ss complaint and direct AvantCredit of 
UK LLC to put things  right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 January 2021.
