K821x#15complaint
Mrs A says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) gave her loans that she couldnt 
afford to repay. 
background
This complaint is about 7 payday loans QuickQuid provided to Mrs A between  March 2010 
and May 2012.  A summary  of Mrs As lending history, based on the information  provided by

Our adjudicator upheld  Mrs As complaint and thought that loans 2 - 7 shouldnt have been 
given because the repayment  for loan 2 represented  a significant portion of Mrs As declared  
income, and this wouldve led QuickQuid to also not providing any of the remaining loans. 
And from loan 4, the pattern of lending in itself shouldve alerted QuickQuid to the fact that 
Mrs A was persistently borrowing from QuickQuid.  
QuickQuid disagreed with the adjudicators findings  so the case  has been passed to me for a 
final decision.
 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs A 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN32369002the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I also think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid  was required to 
establish whether  Mrs A could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs As complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, proportionate checks for loans 2 and 3 would most likely  have  
shown:
Mrs As loan repayment represented a significant proportion  of her monthly income. 
In these circumstances, there  was a significant risk that Mrs A wouldnt have been 
able to repay loan 2 without undue difficulty or borrowing further. I dont think  that 
QuickQuid could  reasonably have believed  that Mrs A would be able to make the 
payment over two pay periods  bearing  in mind shed failed to repay a lower amount 
for loan one under similar arrangements, without her needing  to borrow  again  a few 
days later.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mrs A, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid  should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs As case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 4. I say this because:
From  loan 4 onwards  Mrs A was provided  with a new loan regularly on the same day 
as settling a previous  one. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised  it was more likely 
than not Mrs A was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying her previous 
loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mrs As indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
By this stage, Mrs A was into her eleventh month of owing QuickQuid money.  In my 
view, Mrs As loan history up until this point  was in itself a clear  demonstration  of her 
inability to settle her loans over the life of the credit agreement.
Mrs A wasnt making any real inroads into what she owed  QuickQuid and her 
indebtedness was being prolonged for an extended  period of time. Loan seven was 
provided 26 months after Mrs As first loan. And it was more than 50% bigger than 
the amount of Mrs As first loan.  
Ref: DRN32369003Over  the 15 month period from loan 4 to loan 7, there were only 3 days when  Mrs A 
was not indebted to QuickQuid. Mr A had paid large  amounts  of interest too, so in 
effect, serviced a debt to QuickQuid over an extended period.
I think that Mrs A lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan four 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs As indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mrs As ability  to access  mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market  for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 2 - 7 and QuickQuid should put things right, 
as detailed below.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs A paid on loans 2 - 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 2 and 3 from Mrs As credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 4 - 7 should be removed from 
Mrs As credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet UK LCC to take off tax from this interest. 
CashEuroNet UK LCC must give Mrs A a certificate  showing how much tax its taken  off if 
she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs As complaint. 
CashEuroNet UK LCC should pay Mrs A compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 September 2019.
