The complaint
Mr and Mrs L complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for a timeshare trial membership. Theyre being represented in their complaint by 
an adviser.
What happened
Mr and Mrs L entered into a trial membership agreement in April 2018 for the right to reserve 
five holiday weeks within the following three years with a timeshare company. The price of 
the trail membership was £4,395 which they paid using a loan from Shawbrook Bank. They 
signed a fixed sum loan agreement for that amount which they agreed to repay by 12 
monthly instalments of £366.25.
They asked to cancel the loan agreement in May 2018 but the 14 day withdrawal period had 
ended. They complained to Shawbrook Bank in February 2020 that they werent taken 
through the loan, there was an unfair relationship between them and Shawbrook Bank and 
the timeshare company wasnt authorised to be a credit broker. Shawbrook Bank said that 
Mr and Mrs L were provided with sufficient information to make a reasoned decision and 
sufficient time in which to make it. It said that theyd signed a holiday application, a 
compliance statement and the loan agreement and theyd been given a withdrawal form. It 
also said that the timeshare company was authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority to 
carry out credit broking.
Mr and Mrs L werent satisfied with its response so complained to this service and their 
representative provided a letter setting out the detailed reasons for their complaint. Our 
investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that 
Shawbrook Bank had acted unfairly when it decided not to uphold their claim and she 
believed that it was unlikely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair debtor  
creditor relationship.
Mr and Mrs Ls representative says that Mr and Mrs L dont accept our investigators 
recommendations and intend to provide further materials and twice asked for more time to 
provide that information, which was granted. The second date that their representative 
requested and by which it said that the information would be provided passed more than 
eight weeks ago and no further information has been received.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr and Mrs Ls complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the timeshare 
company and that Shawbrook Banks response to their claim under section 75 wasnt 
fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Ls claim 
under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr and Mrs L entered into a trial membership agreement with the timeshare company 
in April 2018 for the right to reserve five holiday weeks within the following three 
years  and they also signed the trial membership agreement conditions, a 
declaration about their understanding of what had been agreed, and a nine page 
information form about the trial membership (which included information about their 
right to withdraw from the agreement - which they also signed);
the trial membership agreement said, immediately above their signatures, that they 
agreed:  to be bound by this Agreement and the Membership Agreement 
Conditions as stated overleaf and the Trial Membership Regulations, Rules of 
Occupation of the Club and ancillary documents  and acknowledge receipt of the 
Information Statement ;
the declaration about their understanding of what had been agreed set out 17 bullet 
points, the first of which said: We understand that we have entered into an 
Agreement for the purchase of a Trial Membership and have received a copy of our 
agreement together with its terms and conditions; and included other information 
about what had been agreed;
both the trial membership agreement conditions and the information form contained 
information about their right to withdraw from the agreement and they had signed 
both documents on the pages where that information was set out  including the 
standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given  and they had agreed 
that: The consumer has the right to withdraw from this contract without giving any 
reason within 14 calendar days from the conclusion of the contract ;
Mr and Mr L also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank to 
pay for the trail membership and, immediately above their signatures, it said This is 
a Credit Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you 
want to be legally bound by its terms; and their right to withdraw from the loan 
agreement was clearly set out;
Mr and Mrs L asked to cancel the loan agreement in May 2018, about six weeks after 
theyd signed it, but by then the 14 day withdrawal period had ended  they said at 
that time that they were not made aware that this loan was for a timeshare;
the loan agreement said that the goods and services being purchased were 
timeshare weeks and I consider that it was clear enough from the trial membership 
agreement and the other documents that theyd signed that they were buying the 
right to reserve five holiday weeks within the following three years; 
Mr and Mrs L have described their concerns about the way that the trial membership 
was sold to them but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
they were unduly pressured into entering into the trial membership agreement or the 
loan agreement, or that the timeshare company used unacceptable commercial 
practices against them - they didnt exercise their right to withdraw from the 
agreements and they didnt complain to Shawbrook Bank or Barclays Partner 
Finance about those issues until February 2020  nearly two years after theyd 
signed the agreements;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of the trial membership agreement by the timeshare company or that Mr and Mrs L 
were induced into entering into the trail membership agreement by a misrepresentation made by the timeshare company  and nor am I persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the loan agreement was mis-sold to them;
Mr and Mrs L say that there was an unfair relationship between them and Shawbrook 
Bank - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a 
creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr and Mrs L and Shawbrook Bank in these circumstances and 
I consider it be unlikely that a court would find that the relationship was unfair;
Mr and Mrs L say that the timeshare company acted as an unauthorised broker  but 
I understand that the timeshare company held the required authorisation at the time 
of the sale so Im not persuaded that it acted as an unauthorised broker when the 
loan was arranged;
I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to Mr and Mrs L claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that it has acted incorrectly; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Shawbrook Bank to refund to Mr and Mrs L any of the money that theyve paid for the 
trial membership, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L and Mr L to 
accept or reject my decision before 9 June 2022.
