The complaint
Mr and Mrs P complain that OSL Financial Consultancy Limited trading as MortgageKey 
made errors and caused delays with their mortgage. They say this put their sale and 
purchase at risk, delayed completion and increased their costs. They ask for compensation 
for financial loss and distress.
 
What happened
Mr and Mrs P contacted MortgageKey in early September 2020 for mortgage advice. Mr and 
Mrs P say they were initially happy with MortgageKey. But once their application was passed 
to a case handler its service was poor and it caused delays.
Mr and Mrs P say they wanted to complete their sale and purchase in late October 2020, but 
due to errors by MortgageKey they didnt have a mortgage offer in time for this. They agreed 
a new completion date of 18 December 2020. Their solicitor didnt receive a mortgage offer 
until 17 December 2020, and this contained errors which meant it had to be re-issued. Mr 
and Mrs P say their purchaser was threatening to back out so they went ahead with their 
sale. They had to move into a hotel until their purchase completed on 23 December 2020.
Mr and Mrs P say they have accommodation and other additional costs of about £1,400. 
They say MortgageKeys service was poor and caused them inconvenience and distress. 
MortgageKey said while it wasnt responsible for the delays it offered to waive its brokers fee 
of £1,495 as a matter of goodwill and, after the complaint came to us, offered to pay £100 
compensation. 
I sent a provisional decision to the parties setting out why I thought the offer made by 
MortgageKey was fair. 
Mr and Mrs P didnt agree. Mrs P said MortgageKey were aware of their initial moving date 
of 23 October. She said the level of stress this caused hadnt been taken into account  
including have to provide information again and again. She didnt agree that MortgageKey 
chased them for documents  she said they provided the information asked for despite it 
already being provided.  
Mrs P said they received horrendous service and the mortgage only completed because 
their solicitor contacted the lender directly. She said they had no contact with MortgageKey 
after 17 December. Mrs P said call recordings would show how unprofessional and 
unsatisfactory the entire process was.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs Ps mortgage application took much longer than theyd hoped. They were 
worried their sale and purchase would fall through. They had to chase their application and 
this caused them considerable inconvenience. And the gap between their sale and purchase 
completing meant they incurred additional costs of about £1,400.
Mrs P has said how stressful this was, and theres no doubt this caused Mr and Mrs P worry 
and inconvenience. But before deciding what compensation (if any) is fair and reasonable, I 
need to decide whether all or some of these delays were due to errors by MortgageKey.
I should explain that where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I reach 
my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to 
have happened in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
While Mr and Mrs P say they told MortgageKey at the outset that they wanted to move on 23 
October, I havent seen evidence to support this. I appreciate that Mr and Mrs P feel strongly 
about this, but the earliest record Ive seen of them telling MortgageKey this was a few days 
before 23 October. Without evidence MortgageKey knew Mr and Mrs P wanted to move on 
23 October I cant fairly say it made an error by not telling them at the outset this wasnt 
possible.
Having read through MortgageKeys records I can see it was chasing Mr and Mrs P for the 
documents it needed to provide to the lender into early October 2020. For instance, it didnt 
have Mrs Ps payslips in an accessible form and was still chasing Mr and Mrs P for bank 
statements in early October. The lender then asked for further information and documents 
before passing the application to its underwriters.
On 20 October Mr P told MortgageKey theyd changed solicitor and MortgageKey checked 
that the solicitor was on the lenders panel (which it was). On the same day, the lender 
passed the application to its underwriters. Mrs P told MortgageKey they were unhappy that 
five weeks had passed  which she considered to be extreme  and they didnt have a 
mortgage offer. But I cant see that any delays up to this point were caused by MortgageKey. 
In late October the lender raised queries about discrepancies in the information and 
evidence provided and asked for further documents related to Mr and Mrs Ps income, 
existing credit commitments and source of deposit. While Mrs P was upset about this, I dont 
think MortgageKey made an error here. It was simply responding to requests from the 
lender.
In mid-late November 2020 the lender said the application failed affordability, but it would 
review this once it received further information. The lender instructed a valuation in early 
December. On 14 December 2020 the lender told MortgageKey it was ready to issue a 
mortgage offer. Unfortunately, the solicitor was unable to access the offer through the 
lenders portal.
When the solicitor received the offer, it had the wrong purchase price, meaning the lender 
had to re-issue the offer. There was also an issue in that Mr and Mrs Ps solicitor wasnt 
aware that the application was made on the basis Mr and Mrs P would receive a gifted 
deposit and repay some of their debts. In fact, they were selling two properties which would 
provide enough funds for their purchase deposit and the debts they were to repay.
MortgageKey said it used the purchase price given to it by Mr and Mrs P, and it used this 
amount consistently in the documents it issued. I dont think I can fairly find that 
MortgageKey made an error without seeing evidence that Mr and Mrs P gave it the correct 
amount.MortgageKeys records suggest it contacted Mr and Mrs P promptly when the lender asked 
for information. And that it chased the lender on a regular basis. And while there was poor 
communication between the various parties here, based on the available evidence I dont 
think I can fairly find that MortgageKey was solely or primarily responsible for this.
However, there were examples of poor service by MortgageKey. Its not clear that it told Mr 
and Mrs P at the start of the process that the lender they applied to was taking longer to 
process applications at that time than usual. It did explain this in late October, and that the 
lenders timescales were 5-6 days to review the case each time information was provided.
Mrs P asked for updates on a 48-hour basis, which MortgageKey didnt always provide. And 
Mr and Mrs P say MortgageKey was at times rude and dismissive and asked for information 
theyd already provided. Mrs P said listening to call recordings would provide a clear picture 
of what happened. Unfortunately, MortgageKey no longer has recordings of these calls. Mr 
and Mrs P say they were unable to get in contact with MortgageKey in late December to sort 
out problems with the mortgage offer. I can appreciate how frustrating that was when they 
needed to complete their mortgage for their property purchase. 
MortgageKey offered to waive its brokers fee of £1,495 and, after the complaint came to us, 
agreed to pay another £100 compensation for Mr and Mrs Ps upset and inconvenience. I 
appreciate that this was a stressful experience for Mr and Mrs P over several months. They 
started the process in September and completed their purchase only a couple of days before 
the Christmas holidays. However, I must fairly take into account that I dont think 
MortgageKey is responsible for all of the delays and problems, or that it was only due to 
errors by MortgageKey that Mr and Mrs Ps purchase didnt complete on 18 December. I 
should also say that we wouldnt usually find it fair to require a broker to refund its fee when 
it has provided the agreed service to its customer, as MortgageKey did here. In the 
circumstances, I think MortgageKeys offer to waive its brokers fee and pay £100 
compensation is fair and reasonable. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. I order OSL Financial Consultancy Limited 
trading as MortgageKey to pay £100 to Mr and Mrs P, in addition to waiving its brokers fee.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P and Mr P to 
accept or reject my decision before 4 February 2022.
