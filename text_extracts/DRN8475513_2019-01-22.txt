K822xcomplaint
Mr and Mrs T complain  about an Enterprise Financial  Guarantee  (EFG) loan provided by 
National Westminster Bank Plc. They ask that NatWest writes off the balance. 
background 
Mr and Mrs T took out an EFG loan in 2010.  They say NatWest  misled them about the terms 
of the loan, harassed and threatened them when trying to recover  the loan and gave them 
incorrect information about the amount they owed. Mr and Mrs T raised complaints with 
NatWest in 2012, 2016 and in 2017. 
Ive previously sent a decision  to the parties saying this service  isnt able to look into the 
aspects of Mr and Mrs Ts complaint  contained in NatWests response letters of 2012 and 
2016. We can look into their other  complaints. 
When NatWest responded to Mr and Mrs Ts complaint in 2017 it accepted it had made 
errors. It sent a final response letter to the wrong  address  in 2012 and gave Mr and Mrs T 
incorrect information about the loan balance. It offered £250 compensation. 
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She said NatWest  
gave Mr and Mrs T inconsistent information  about the amount  they owed and at one point 
told them  their accounts were closed. But it sent letters in September  2015 and March 2016 
which clearly explained  why a balance was still due. NatWest confirmed this in its final 
response letter in 2017. The adjudicator said the £250 compensation offered by NatWest  
was fair and reasonable compensation for the inconvenience its mistakes caused. 
Mr and Mrs T didnt  agree. They said the £250 was for all NatWests wrongdoings and isnt 
enough. They said NatWest had given further  misleading information when it suggested their 
business had been sold. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
NatWest wrote to Mr and Mrs T in September 2015, March 2016  and November 2016  about 
the amount they owed, stating a different  amount  each time. Mr and Mrs T contacted  
NatWest in September 2015 and it told them  incorrectly   that their accounts were closed. 
I can understand why Mr and Mrs T are upset about this.
However, Ive also taken into account  that the figures given by NatWest varied by a relatively 
small amount (about £100) as compared to the debt owed (about £12,000).  The letters  
explained that the debt was owed. 
I can understand the unclear information  about the amount owed caused Mr and Mrs T 
upset and inconvenience. I think its right that NatWest offered compensation for this and for 
sending its 2012  final response letter to the wrong address. But I dont think  its fair and

offer of £250 compensation is fair and reasonable.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint as I find the compensation offered by 
National Westminster Bank Plc is fair and reasonable  in the circumstances.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs T to 
accept or reject my decision  before  22 February  2019.
