Miss N complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) gave her loans 
that she couldnt afford to repay.  
background
Miss N was given 10 loans by Sunny between May 2015 and July 2018. Each of the loans 
was repayable in six monthly instalments. The loans were taken in two distinct chains, with 
Miss N having up to three loans open at any time.  Miss N has repaid all the loans. A 
summary of Miss Ns borrowing from Sunny is as follows;

Miss Ns complaint has been  assessed by one of our adjudicators. He thought that the 
checks Sunny had done before agreeing the first five loans had been sufficient in the first 
chain. But he thought more checks should  have been done before loan 6 was provided. For 
the second loan chain  he though Sunny had carried out sufficient checks  for loans 7 to 10. 
He asked Sunny to pay Miss N some compensation with regards to loan 6 only.
Sunny has not accepted the adjudicators  findings.  So, as the complaint hasnt been 
resolved informally, it has been  passed  to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last 
stage of our process.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Miss N 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN15560632But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss N could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means Miss Ns complaint.
Each of the loans  given to Miss N needed  to be repaid in six monthly instalments. So the 
amounts that Miss N needed  to repay each month were smaller  than if shed taken a normal 
payday loan. But of course she was committing to making those repayments over a far 
longer period. And on many  occasions Miss N had more than one loan open at the same 
time.
Miss N agreed to repay  her loans in monthly  instalments.  So the amounts she needed to pay 
each month  were much less than if shed taken a normal payday loan. However I have noted 
that the amounts she was borrowing at any one time were  steadily increasing. She was 
making more than 1 repayment at any one time and her loans were overlapping. I think all 
these things might have indicated to Sunny that Miss N was facing some pressure on her 
finances. But on balance,  when it agreed to give the first five loans to Miss N, I dont think  it 
wouldve been proportionate for Sunny to ask her for the amount of information that would 
be needed to show the lending was unsustainable. So I dont  think  Sunny was wrong to give 
the first five loans to Miss N.
Ref: DRN15560633But looking  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss N I think  by loan 6 the 
lender should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise  
harmful. And so Sunny  should have realised  that it shouldnt provide this loan. It was       
Miss Ns sixth in around 13 months. The amount she was borrowing was steadily increasing, 
loan repayments  were overlapping and she wasnt making any inroads into the amount she 
owed the lender. Miss N had paid a considerable amount of interest to Sunny by this stage 
to effectively service a debt that extended  over a 13 month period. So I dont think Sunny 
should have lent this loan (loan  6) to Miss N.
Miss N took out loan 7 on 12 December 2017.  Whilst I would still expect Sunny to have 
regard of its record of its previous dealings with Miss N, it would be reasonable and 
proportionate to regard loan 7 as the start of a separate chain of lending.  I say this because 
Miss Ns seventh loan with Sunny came well over a year after shed repaid loan 6. I can see 
that the monthly repayment amounts were modest  compared to Miss Ns disposable income 
and on this occasion she didnt overlap her repayments. She also paid each of these 4 loans 
instalments on time and has repaid  each  one either  before or on the date of settlement.  So 
when I consider these  points, on balance, for the last four loans (loans 7-10) I dont  think it 
wouldve been proportionate for Sunny to ask for the amount of information that would be 
needed to show  the lending for these loans were  unsustainable.
In conclusion I uphold  Miss Ns complaint regarding loan 6. I think  this loan unfairly  
prolonged Miss Ns indebtedness by allowing her to take expensive credit  intended for short-
term use over an extended period of time.  So Sunny should  put things right. 
putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Miss N the loan that she took on xx (loan 
6). So for this loan Sunny should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Miss N on the loan. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Ns credit  file in relation to the loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss N a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Miss Ns complaint and direct Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things  right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss N to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 November  2019.
