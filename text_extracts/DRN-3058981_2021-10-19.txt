The complaint
Mr H complains that Oplo CF Limited, trading as 1st Stop Car Finance Limited, has 
terminated the hire purchase agreement under which a used car was supplied to him and 
has repossessed the car.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr H under a hire purchase agreement with 1st Stop Car Finance 
that he signed in March 2018. He says that he lost his job in 2018 and missed payments but 
a payment arrangement of £60 each week was agreed in November 2018. There continued 
to be issues with Mr Hs payments and a payment arrangement of £30 each week was 
agreed in October 2018 but his payment issues continued. 
Options including a default, selling the car and settling or terminating the agreement were 
discussed in January 2020 and a one month hold was put on his payments to give him 
breathing space but 1st Stop Car Finance sent him a notice of default. He didnt take the 
action required in the default notice so 1st Stop Finance sent him a termination letter in 
March 2020. The agreement was terminated and the car was repossessed in July 2020.
Mr H complained to 1st Stop Car Finance in October 2020 but it said that it had no choice but 
to repossess the car and that it was unable to amend his credit file as it was reporting the 
correct data. It said that the arrears on his account were £2,553.72 and that the gross 
outstanding balance was £7,948.90. Mr H wasnt satisfied with its response so complained 
to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He described the 
attempts that 1st Stop Car Finance had made to discuss the situation with Mr H and he didnt 
think that it had acted unreasonably by repossessing the car.
Mr H has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that he lost his job in May 2018, he asked about returning the car, he didnt receive the 
letters that were sent to him and the information that hes been sent by 1st Stop Car Finance 
has been corrupted.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the car that was supplied to Mr H had a price of £6,499 and he signed the hire 
purchase agreement, made an advance payment of £99 and agreed to make 59 
monthly payments of £208.22 and a final payment of £383.02;
1st Stop Car Finances system notes record in detail the contact that it has had with 
Mr H about his hire purchase agreement, including the attempts that it has made to 
contact him and the issues with his payments;
the first payment due under the agreement in March 2018 wasnt made and Mr H told 
it about his new job in October 2018  although he discussed his circumstances with 
1st Stop Car Finance in detail in May 2018, theres no reference to him losing his job 
at that time;
there have been frequent issues with the payments due from Mr H and 1st Stop Car 
Finance has agreed reduced payment arrangements with him because of the 
financial difficulties that hes described;
the system notes show that Mr H called 1st Stop Car Finance in January 2020 to 
discuss his arrears and his options  he was given a settlement figure, a default and 
termination were discussed, and he explained the personal difficulties that he was 
experiencing  a one month hold was put on his payments to give him breathing 
space;
1st Stop Car Finance sent him a notice of default five days after that call  I dont 
consider that it was fair or reasonable for it to send him a notice of default at that time 
as it had agreed to give him breathing space and to put a hold on his payments  I 
consider that it should have at least waited until the breathing space had ended 
before sending him the default notice;
the default notice was sent using the correct address for Mr H but he didnt respond 
to it and didnt take the actions required by the default notice  I consider it to be 
more likely than not that the default notice was sent to Mr H even if he didnt receive 
it and that 1st Stop Car Finance had complied with the requirement to send him a 
notice of default;
I consider it to be more likely than not that Mr H wouldnt have responded to the 
default notice if it had been sent to him after the breathing space had ended and 
that his agreement would have been terminated and the car repossessed so I dont 
consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require 1st Stop Car Finance to 
take any action because it sent the notice of default to Mr H earlier than I consider 
that it should have;
Mr Hs account was then defaulted and he was sent a termination letter  he says 
that he didnt receive it and has described the difficulties that hes been caused by 
the government imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic  but 1st Stop Car 
Finances system notes show that it has unsuccessfully tried to contact Mr H by 
phone, text and e-mail in addition to the letters that it sent to him;
the car was then repossessed from Mr H in July 2020 and was sold at auction and 
the sale proceeds were applied to his account;
I consider that 1st Stop Car Finance has responded to Mr Hs financial difficulties 
positively and sympathetically  as it was required to do  and Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that 1st Stop Car Finance acted incorrectly when it 
terminated Mr Hs agreement and repossessed the car;
the car has been sold so cant be returned to Mr H, his agreement has been 
terminated and I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require 1st Stop Car Finance to reinstate the agreement;
1st Stop Car Finance is required to record true and accurate information about Mr Hs 
payment history on his credit file  Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that it has recorded untrue or inaccurate information on his credit file or that it 
has calculated the outstanding balance of his account incorrectly; and
I sympathise with Mr H for his financial difficulties and the other issues that hes 
described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require 1st Stop 
Car Finance to remove any of the adverse information that its recorded on his credit file, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
I suggest that Mr H contacts 1st Stop Car Finance to try to agree an affordable repayment 
arrangement for the amount that he owes to it. If he doesnt do so, I consider it to be likely 
that it will take further action to recover that amount from him (to the extent that its legally 
entitled to do so). Its required to continue to respond to his financial difficulties positively and 
sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2021.
