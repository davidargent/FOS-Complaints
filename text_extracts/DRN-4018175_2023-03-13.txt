The complaint
Y is unhappy National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) blocked and closed its account,
withholding the money contained within it for months. It is also unhappy NatWest defaulted
its Bounce Back Loan (BBL) and used the right of set off to repay this from its business
account.
Mr C is the director of Y, so I may refer to him throughout my decision as hes brought the
complaint on behalf of Y.
What happened
Ys account was restricted by NatWest on 17 February 2021 meaning it couldnt use the
account or access the money contained within it.
Mr C tried contacting NatWest to find out what was happening with the account, but NatWest
didnt return his calls and when he went into branch, it wouldnt provide him with any
explanation as to why it had blocked Ys account or when it would complete its review.
Mr C says Y couldnt trade without access to this account and as a result it has lost
thousands of pounds and was charged for non-use of its card machine. NatWest also
charged missed payment fees throughout the period the account was blocked as Ys regular
payments couldnt debit.
In addition, Mr C has told us that he was arrested in July 2021 and had his house and
business premises raided. He was released without charge but feels NatWest is responsible
for this.
On 9 August 2021 NatWest sent Y notice that it was closing its account with immediate
effect. It then sent a cheque for the closing balance on 2 September 2021. NatWest had
used the right of set off  using money from Ys business account - to repay a BBL Y had
taken out in June 2020. So, the cheque balance was minus this amount.
Y didnt receive the closing amount until March 2022 because it wasnt able to cash the
cheque NatWest had sent. This was because Y had changed its name and no longer had an
account that could accept cheques. Mr C says he wrote to NatWest to tell it this sometime
after he received the cheque but didnt receive a response. He then notified our service of
this in November 2021, at which point we asked NatWest to send the payment electronically.
A form was sent to Mr C in December 2021, which he returned to NatWest in March 2022.
The money was then transferred to Y.
NatWest has explained it was entitled to block and close Ys account and use the right of set
off to claw back the BBL. Its said it did this in line with its processes and the terms and
conditions of the accounts. However, following our involvement it gave Mr C the benefit of
the doubt in terms of the customer service hed received and offered £200 in recognition of
the failed call backs and delay in registering Ys complaint. It also agreed to refund the
missed payment fees accrued during the block totalling £348.
Our investigator partially upheld the complaint. He said that NatWest hadnt made an error in
blocking or closing the account and was entitled to use the right of set off to claw back the
BBL. He did however believe NatWest could have released the remaining money in the
account sooner and felt 8% interest should be awarded from 1 April 2021 to 2 September
2021. He was also satisfied the £200 compensation and refund of missed payment fees was
fair in the circumstances.
Mr C, on behalf of Y, disagreed. He said the £200 didnt even cover the fees Y had been
charged by its card machine provider, let alone the fact NatWest got him arrested and Y
couldnt trade, meaning it lost thousands of pounds. Mr C also says he wants the BBL funds
back which he says NatWest stole from Ys account.
Because Mr C, on behalf of Y, disagreed, it has been passed to me to decide. 
What I provisionally decided  and why
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 6 
March 2023. I provide a copy of my findings from that decision below:
NatWest has a wide range of legal and regulatory obligations it must meet when providing
account services to its customers. These obligations are ongoing so dont just apply at
account opening stage. To comply with these obligations, it may need to review accounts
and the activity taking place on them. Sometimes these reviews will lead to the accounts
being blocked and closed. If NatWest didnt do this, it could risk serious sanction.
With this in mind and from what Ive seen, Im satisfied in the circumstances NatWest was
entitled to block and close Ys account and did this in line with the terms and conditions.
NatWest isnt under any obligation to reveal to a customer why it blocked an account. This
information is often commercially sensitive. So, as understandably frustrating as it was for Mr 
C to not know why NatWest had blocked the account, I dont think it did anything wrong in
not communicating its reasons to Mr C at the time of the block, or since. And it wouldnt be
appropriate for me to share this with him either.
NatWest also chose to cancel the BBL and deducted the balance of the loan, plus interest,
from Ys business account. Given what Ive seen, I think this was also reasonable in the
circumstances, so I wont be asking NatWest to return this money to Y.
Although NatWest is entitled to block a customers account and review it, we would expect
this to be done in a timely manner. So, Ive looked at whether NatWest caused any delays
between when the block was applied to when the account was closed, and the cheque sent
for the balance. Whilst the investigator concluded NatWest should have released the funds 
in Ys account in April 2021 (minus the BBL amount that was deducted) and therefore should
pay 8% interest on this amount, Im not in agreement. Im satisfied from what Ive seen that
on the whole NatWest didnt cause any significant delays. It could have potentially sent the
cheque sooner  as it was, the closure letter was sent on 9 August 2021, but the cheque
wasnt issued until 2 September 2021. However, Y wouldnt have been able to cash the
cheque regardless because of its name change and access to a bank account, so I dont
think this delay caused any loss. I therefore cant agree interest should be paid.
It did then take another six months for Y to receive the money. However, from what Ive seen
Im unable to conclude this delay was caused by NatWest. It issued the cheque in the name
attached to the account and cant be held responsible for Y not being able to cash this. Im
satisfied it offered an alternative in December 2021 once it became aware of the issue and
acted upon the instruction once it received the funds release form in March 2022. So, whilst I
appreciate the significant impact the block had on Y and its ability to trade, I wont be askingNatWest to compensate it for this.
I am however pleased to see NatWest has offered to refund the unpaid fees Y incurred
during the course of the block. This is fair and reasonable given it was the block that
prevented the payments from being made, resulting in the fees. I do also think NatWest
should pay 8% simple interest on this amount to cover the fact Y lost the use of these funds
between the date it received the money in March 2022 to date of settlement.
NatWest has also offered to pay Y £200 for the service it provided in not calling Mr C back
on occasions and not logging Ys complaint in the first instance. I think this is sufficient for
these issues, especially when considering that there would have been little, if anything,
NatWest would have been able to discuss with Mr C at the time. And whilst I appreciate Mr
C was arrested and blames NatWest for this, it isnt for me to comment on the actions of the
police.
NatWest responded to the provisional decision saying it had no further comments. 
Mr C, on behalf of Y, responded and explained he didnt agree with the provisional decision. 
He feels we havent acted impartially as the compensation figure reached is the same as 
what NatWest offered from the start. He says we are just agreeing with NatWest. He went 
onto say NatWest had him arrested with no evidence of what he was supposed to have 
done. He says he will seek legal advice as what happened wasnt right. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Mr Cs disappointment that I dont believe more compensation should be paid. I 
can assure him we are an impartial service and Ive considered everything both he and 
NatWest have told me in equal measure. And as I explained in my provisional decision, Im 
satisfied NatWest was entitled to take the actions it did in closing Ys account, as well as 
withholding the money as long as it did and using the right of set off to claim back the BBL. 
This is what caused much of the inconvenience faced by Y. So, whilst I appreciate Mr Cs 
strength of feeling on the matter, as no error was made, I wont be directing NatWest to 
compensate Y for this. The £200 is for the customer service issues and Im still satisfied this 
is sufficient for that. 
As mentioned previously, I cant comment on the actions of the police in arresting Mr C. 
To conclude, as NatWest or Mr C havent provided me with any new information that 
persuades me to change the conclusions reached in my provisional decision, the outcome 
remains the same. 
 
Putting things right
In order to settle the complaint, I direct NatWest to:
Pay £200 compensation.
Refund the missed payment fees totalling £348.
Pay 8% simple interest on the £348 from 15 March 2022 when the funds were
released to date of settlement.My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold Ys complaint against National Westminster
Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 April 2023.
