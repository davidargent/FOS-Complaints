The complaint
Mr L complains about a £20 fee for a chargeback request with PrePay Technologies Limited 
(PrePay).
What happened
Mr L wanted to raise a chargeback on his PrePay account but was told there would be a £20 
administration fee. So, Mr L complained to PrePay. 
PrePay investigated the complaint but didnt uphold it. PrePay said it was listed in its terms 
and conditions Mr L signed up to that the fee would need to be paid when any request was 
made. PrePay went on to say that it was unlikely the chargeback wouldve been successful if 
it was raised, as there was evidence that the item had been delivered to the address Mr L 
gave when he placed the order. Mr L remained unhappy, so he bought a complaint to our 
service.  
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Our 
investigator found it was clear in Mr Ls terms and conditions of his account that the £20 fee 
would be payable on the request of a chargeback. 
Mr L didnt agree with the investigators view. So, the complaints been passed to me for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator, for largely the same 
reasons. Ill explain why. 
When Mr L asked PrePay to raise a chargeback, he was told it would cost a £20 
administration fee. I can see this is listed in the terms and conditions that Mr L signed up to 
when he opened the account. So, Im satisfied PrePay hasnt acted unfairly when its told Mr 
L that he will be charged a fee. 
PrePay also managed Mr Ls expectations regarding the success of the chargeback. PrePay 
had already heard from the business that the item had been ordered from and it had been 
delivered to the correct address. This gave Mr L the option to consider if he wanted to go 
ahead with the chargeback and pay the fee, knowing that it was unlikely the chargeback 
would be successful.
I find it fair that PrePay managed Mr Ls expectations around the chances of the chargeback 
being successful. Although its not compulsory for a business to raise a chargeback, and its 
common for businesses to refuse if it thinks it wont be successful, PrePay told Mr L that it 
was still happy to raise the request if he wanted to. 
A PrePay advisor explained on a telephone call with Mr L that the £20 is a fee that it must 
pay, so this is passed on to the customer. PrePay also explained that as its not a 
conventional bank, it does charge for some of its services that others may not. Prepay went 
on to explain that these charges are made clear when the account was opened, and Mr L 
had decided to open the account on that basis.  
In summary, although its clear Mr L was unhappy to pay the £20 administration fee for 
raising the chargeback, I havent found PrePay have acted unfairly or done anything wrong 
when it said it was payable. The charges are clear in the terms and conditions of the 
account, and these are what Mr L signed up to. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2022.
