K822xcomplaint
Miss P is unhappy with how Bank  of Scotland plc trading as Intelligent Finance (IF)  has 
handled her mortgage account.
background
Miss P has a repayment  mortgage with IF. In 2009  she started to get mortgage contributions 
from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), and Miss P just had to make up the 
difference between  the sum paid and her contractual  monthly payment (CMP).
I wont go into all the issues and correspondence theres been over the years  as its been 
lengthy and protracted. Weve previously  considered  two complaints brought by Miss P 
about her mortgage:
In 2012 an ombudsman colleague issued  a final decision  rejecting Miss Ps complaint. 
He summarised that complaint as [Miss P] complains that she has had to make 
unnecessary payments  to Intelligent Finance (IF) as a reserve  has built up on her 
mortgage account that could be used instead.  She wants the money  she has paid 
returned to her.
In 2016 an adjudicator  said she didnt think Miss Ps second complaint should be 
upheld. She summarised that complaint as  youre under the impression that 
Intelligent Finance is receiving more  money from the Department of Working (sic) 
Pension (DWP)  than what its entitled to. You believe  these payments belong  to you and 
want them to be treated accordingly.  Youve  also said that Intelligent Finance  is 
registering you as in arrears despite  you maintaining  your payment arrangement, and 
applying charges to your account.
Since then Miss P has been  concerned there have been other mistakes,  such as still being 
charged interest on amounts overpaid  (either  by DWP or Miss P); that is, Miss P thinks IF is 
charging interest on a higher balance than she actually  owes.  Shes also mentioned, 
amongst others,  a lack of communication,  when  in the month the CMP is due, and whether  
she is paying in advance or in arrears.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Miss Ps complaint. Miss P didnt agree and so its been  
passed to me to decide.
I would like to apologise to both parties for the time its taken to have this final decision 
issued. On my part that was because I needed to cross reference  complex  mortgage  
transactions going back many years, and also to ensure Id fully got to the bottom  of all the 
elements Miss P is concerned about. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Miss P has set out her account in 
considerable detail. I trust she wont take it as a discourtesy that Ive condensed her 
complaint in the way that I have.  Ours  is an informal dispute resolution service, and Ive 
concentrated on what I consider to be the crux of the complaint.
Ref: DRN32887092I dont doubt that this is very important for Miss P but although Ive read and considered the 
whole file Ill keep  my comments to what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any specific  
point its not because Ive not considered  it but because I dont think I need  to comment  on it 
in order to reach the right outcome. This service  is impartial between, and independent  from, 
consumers and businesses. What this means  is that we dont represent either party,  and I 
dont act under eithers instructions or take directions on how a complaint will be looked at.
I can only look at whats happened  since we dealt with Miss Ps last complaint about  her 
mortgage (so thats from 2016) as any actions before then were covered in our previous 
considerations so it wouldnt  be appropriate  for us to look at those matters  again now.  
It appears a lot of the confusion here is down to the format  of the mortgage statements. I 
understand Miss P is concerned her overpayments are sitting in a separate account  and 
arent being accounted for when the interest  is calculated. I can reassure her thats not the 
case. The overpayments have been taken  into account  in the interest  calculations,  theyre  
ring fenced but thats very different from not being accounted for.
I can fully understand  why Miss P has been confused by all the transactions  on her 
mortgage statements  showing  overpayments being credited and reversed off. I found  them 
confusing and I look at different  mortgage  statements every day, which  is why I asked IF to 
provide a detailed transaction  history  showing everything on one spreadsheet. Having cross 
referenced that to the other information provided  Im satisfied the full amount of each 
payment received (including any overpayment) is being taken into account - from the date 
each payment was made - when the interest is calculated.  This means  Miss P hasnt been  
left with a higher debt and therefore higher  monthly interest charges as she believes.
If Miss P wants to draw  down the overpayments  shes made  herself I understand IF has said 
she can apply to do so, but that will be an application rather  than an automatic process. This 
is because if Miss P draws  down any overpayment she will, in effect, be borrowing that 
money back again (as at the moment shes repaid that part and is paying interest on her 
lower borrowing amount).  If she borrows that money  back  the mortgage amount she owes 
will increase,  and so will her CMP, which  means  IF has to check  that Miss P can afford the 
higher CMP.
I understand Miss P thinks IF should  allow her to draw down the DWP overpayments - or 
that it should use them to allow her to underpay for a few months  - but shes said if she 
cant do so then IF should take those overpayments into account in the interest calculations. 
It wouldnt be appropriate for me order IF to allow Miss P to draw  down  the DWP 
overpayments  or use them to allow her to underpay her CMP - as thats  a matter for its 
commercial discretion. As Ive explained, those  overpayments are already being  taken into 
account in the interest calculations - that is, Miss P is being charged  less interest than she 
would have been had those overpayments  not been made  so theres  nothing  I need to 
order IF to do here.
Whilst the DWP was making  contributions towards Miss Ps mortgage IF kept the mortgage  
account under review.  It moved any built up overpayments  around  notionally to cover  any 
payment shortfall  on the payment due date to ensure Miss P didnt incur  arrears fees and so 
her credit reference file was unaffected. But that was a concession it put in place whilst the 
DWP was contributing. As the DWP no longer contributes towards  the mortgage IF has said 
it wont be carrying out those manual  reviews  any more, and Im satisfied that it doesnt have 
to. Miss P thinks  the manual reviews werent  always  carried  out, but Im satisfied they were 
carried out even  if they werent  visible to her. Had the manual reviews  not been  completed 
Ref: DRN32887093then there  would have been arrears fees charged and Miss Ps credit reference file would 
show any missed,  late or short payments.
Miss Ps payment due date is the 15th of the month,  and IF says if she wants  to change that 
then she can ask to do so. Miss P says she pays at the end of one month, for the month  
ahead; eg she says she pays the CMP due on 15th April on 30th March. But thats  not the 
case, and this goes to the heart of the complaint. Miss P may think  thats  the pattern she is 
following, but due to missed payments over the years she is, in fact, a month behind;  eg the 
CMP due on 15th April shes not paying until 30th April (or sometimes  this might  even run into 
the start of the month after,  in this example May). 
Our adjudicator can provide Miss P with a full spreadsheet  to show this if she would like a 
copy, but a short extract is attached below. The key dates here are when Miss P changed 
from paying mid-month (in November 2015) to the end of the month (in December 2015). So 
the payment on 18th November was for November, therefore the payment on 30 December 
must be for December (so is the start of Miss P paying in arrears). If that payment was the 
start of Miss P paying in advance as she thinks, then she missed Decembers payment 
entirely which shes not allowed to just do. 
There were double payments made in some months  but they werent large  enough to bring 
the account to the point Miss P would be paying  in advance. Ive moved the first payment in 
each double payment to cover the month before as in each case  that had been  missed.

Ive included a snapshot  below of the payments Miss P made from 15th August  2015 until 
15th September 2018. Again,  Ive moved some  payments made at the beginning of a month  
to cover the month  before  if that payment had been missed, and this shows there are two 
payments missing entirely - which Ive highlighted - and that Miss P was paying in arrears  for 
most of the time. As Ive said, our adjudicator can provide a full copy of the spreadsheet 
showing the mortgage transactions if Miss P asks for it and shes not already seen it.

IF has apologised for not responding to Miss Ps letters and offered £50 compensation for its 
oversight. That seems fair. I understand Miss P has cashed the cheque so I dont order  IF to 
do anything further  to resolve  that issue. Miss P has said that because IF didnt respond she 
didnt know how much and when the final DWP  payment would be, or how much she needed 
to pay going forward.  Ive had regard for this but Im not persuaded by it. The CMP didnt  
change as a result of the DWP stopping its payments, and Miss P had previously  been  
notified what the CMP was so it was a simple matter  of her now needing to meet that 
Ref: DRN32887095amount in full herself, rather than just part of it. The CMP  only altered as a result of changes 
in the variable rate and  at that time  that had last happened in December 2017 with the 
payment change taking effect from January 2018.  So that revised  CMP of £397.88 is what 
Miss P needed to pay each month once the DWP  stopped contributing to her mortgage.
I understand Miss P asked IF how much the last DWP contribution would be and when it 
would be paid but thats information IF wouldnt have known. The party Miss P needed to 
ask for that information was the DWP itself. IF had no control over what it would  receive and 
when and wouldnt know months in advance (when  Miss P asked  it) what  that would be. 
That said,  IF should  have replied to Miss P to tell her it didnt know, but that oversight was 
covered by IFs apology  and payment of £50 compensation Ive set out above.
IF agreed to use some of the overpayment  balance to cover  Miss Ps May 2018 payment. 
This means  thered be no arrears fees and Miss Ps credit reference  file wouldnt show a 
missed payment for that month. That seems fair and Im satisfied thats  all IF needs  to do. 
Going forward Miss P needs  to pay the CMP in full and on time if she wants to avoid arrears 
fees and adverse information being  recorded  on her credit file. 
If Miss P wants to change  her payment due date then she can contact IF to discuss that. 
However she needs to be aware that a change in payment due date is likely to mean a 
higher payment will need to be made  in the month its changed,  or that two payments will 
need to be made closer  together  than normal. Miss P wont be able to go six weeks (for 
example) between payments and then pay the existing CMP, as that would mean shed 
missed a monthly payment so will be in arrears.
Its not possible for us to carry  out a detailed  or forensic audit of an account history.  Its open 
to Miss P to ask a suitably  qualified independent  accountant to do that for her. That would 
have to be at her expense, though if an error  were found to her detriment she could include 
the costs of finding it in any complaint that followed.  Miss P has said IF should pay for the 
audit, but thats  not how it works.  Miss P would  be the one bringing the complaint therefore 
she needs to provide  the evidence to support  her complaint, and the costs for doing  that are 
Miss Ps to bear. That said, Ive looked at the transaction history  and the comments  on both 
sides, and having  done so I cant see any mistakes. Im also satisfied the overpayments 
have been taken into account as at the dates  they were made in the interest calculations.
Having considered everything  Im satisfied IF is administering Miss Ps mortgage correctly. 
For that reason  Im satisfied it hasnt done  anything wrong here.  I would ask that, unless 
Miss P obtains a forensic audit of the account  as Ive explained above, that she looks 
forward rather than trying to seek explanations  of what are complex mortgage calculations.  
This decision can only consider the issues IF dealt with originally. IF responded to further  
complaint points Miss P raised  by way of a final response letter  dated  13 December 2018. 
Those complaint  points  cant be dealt with in this decision as they were new points raised   
and responded  to by IF  after our adjudicator had issued her view on the original complaint. 
If Miss P feels the December 2018  final response letter doesnt deal with her concerns and 
shed like us to look at it, then Id ask that she let us know in her response  to this final 
decision and a new complaint can then be opened  to deal with those new issues (subject to 
our usual rules).
Ref: DRN32887096my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint in the sense Im satisfied IFs offer to use some of the 
overpayment balance  to cover Miss Ps May 2018 payment is fair in the circumstances. I 
make no other order or award. 
My final decision concludes this services consideration of the complaint, which  means well 
not be engaging in any further consideration or discussion of the merits of it. Under  the rules 
of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept or reject my 
decision before  17 June 2019.
