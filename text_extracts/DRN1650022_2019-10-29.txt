K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that British Gas Insurance Limited is responsible for poor service in 
connection with a home emergency insurance  policy.
background
Mr G owned two flats in the same building and rented  them to tenants.  His complaint relates  
to one of those flats (the flat).
Mr G had British Gas boiler and controls  cover. The risk address didnt give the number of 
the flat  it just referred to the second  floor of the building. British  Gas has sent us a 
renewal letter from July 2017 with a policy number  ending  in 3908. It shows  that Mr G was 
paying the yearly  premium by monthly instalments.
The policy covered an annual service and - subject to a fixed fee or policy excess  of £99.00  
 repairs to the boiler and controls.
Where I refer to British Gas I refer to the insurance  company of that name  and I include 
engineers and others for whose  actions  I hold that company responsible.
Mr G booked an annual service for 23 November 2017. But neither he nor his tenant 
answered the door when British Gas arrived. Mr G says that was because the appointment 
wasnt until later that day.
In January 2018, there was a leak  from a radiator pipe - causing damage to a neighbours 
flat below. Mr G complained that British Gas negligence had caused the leak and the 
damage. He complained that British Gas should pay for the damage and for a new boiler.
British Gas visited in February 2018.  British Gas visited again on 8 April 2018.
In a final response letter in May 2018 British  Gas denied responsibility for the leak. It said it 
hadnt fixed the boiler on 8 April 2018  and would waive the invoice  for the excess of £99.00.
British Gas accepted delay  in responding to the complaint. It sent Mr G a cheque  for 
£150.00.
Mr G has sent us an invoice from an independent engineer  showing that he capped off the 
gas supply to the boiler on 4 August 2018.
Mr G has sent us an invoice from another engineer showing that on 11 September  2018 he 
installed a new boiler at a cost of £2,400.00. Mr G brought his complaint to us on 30 
September 2018.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator didnt  recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He acknowledged a 
possibility that British Gas did arrive early on 23 November 2017.  But the investigator 
thought that  by contacting Mr G on 29 November 2017, 13 December 2017, 27 December
2017 and 10 January  2018 - British  Gas had taken enough steps to try and arrange another 
appointment to service  Mr Gs boiler.
The investigator didnt  think that British Gas made  a mistake that caused Mr Gs radiator 
pipe to leak. The investigator said that British  Gas shouldve responded to Mr G sooner.
Ref: DRN16500222But he thought  £150.00 was fair in putting  this right.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr G 
and to British  Gas on 10 October  2019. I summarise my findings:
Because of the lack of technical engineering evidence, I didnt find it fair and 
reasonable to hold British Gas responsible for the leak or its consequences.
I found that poor communication by British Gas caused Mr G distress and 
inconvenience.
I didnt find that £150.00  went far enough  to compensate for this. Keeping  in mind the 
cold weather and the need to deal with an unhappy  tenant, I was minded to find 
£250.00 fair and reasonable.
Subject to any further information from Mr G or from British Gas, my provisional  decision 
was that I was minded to uphold this complaint  in part. I intended  to direct British  Gas 
Insurance Limited to pay Mr G (in addition to its cheque for £150.00) a further £100.00 for 
distress and inconvenience.
Mr G disagrees  with the provisional decision.  He says, in summary, that:
British Gas uses a database  for insured properties which  didnt allow him to specify  
the flat number. 
Neither he nor the tenant received a call on 23 November 2017. From the address 
they hold on record  the engineer simply didnt know what  flat to ring at the main 
entrance. 
British Gas never sent an email on 29 November 2017, 13 December 2017, 27 
December 2017 or a letter  on 10 January 2018  asking  him to arrange a visit. 
An ordinary system  runs a pressure  of approximately 1-1.5 bar.
He reported  a pressure of 3.5 bars on 2 and 11 February 2018.  Any engineer would 
conclude that no system can bear that pressure  and certain  parts of the system have 
to leak pressure.
On 11 February 2018 British Gas said the boiler  was repairable, yet only 6 days  later 
the boiler was experiencing a pressure far higher than normal. 
The boiler was turning  off every day for lack of pressure. 
British Gas wasnt suggesting a final remedy, even if not covered. 
A sequence of events  shows  British Gas was negligent
British gas didnt  provide engineering evidence.
Ref: DRN16500223The tenant stopped paying  for the rent in April 2018. Mr G lost over £12,000 (3 
months of rental income).
British Gas provided no feedback for a number of months. 
British Gas doesnt provide a price to solve the issue, be it a full replacement  of the 
boiler or a smaller intervention. 
The flat was no longer eligible for a gas safety  certificate.
He claims  £2,400.00 for boiler  replacement, £7,140.00 for repair of the neighbours 
flat and £12,000.00 for lack of rental  income, a total of £ 21,540.00. 
British Gas disagrees with the provisional  decision.  It says, in summary,  that the £150.00 
already offered fairly  recognises the inconvenience  caused to Mr G and the suggested 
additional £100.00 isnt fair in the circumstances. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The policy covered an annual service. It also covered boiler repairs. The policy  didnt cover  
central heating radiator pipes.
Its records show (by way of Code  5) that British Gas had been advising Mr G since
2016 that he had an old boiler and he should consider getting a new and more efficient one.
The records  also show that British  Gas did an annual service visit on 13 January 2017.
British Gas visited for the purpose of doing an annual service on 23 November 2017. Mr G 
hasnt provided  enough  evidence that British Gas left the building before the time of the 
appointment.
Mr G knew  and complained  within a week that British Gas hadnt  done the annual 
service. So  whether  or not he received its reminders  he knew he needed to re-book an 
annual service.
Mr G complained that he couldnt  book a service online. But he quoted  a policy  number 
ending in 8302 which I think was for his other flat.
Later he sent us a more recent  screenshot  showing  that he could book online a service for 
that policy number  but not for his home.  But Im not persuaded that he couldnt book a 
service for the flat in late 2017 or early 2018.
In any event he couldve telephoned to make an appointment for a service.  And if he was 
concerned about  the functioning  of the boiler  high pressure for example  then he couldve 
called for a repair visit.
As I understand it, Mr G believes that the missed annual service caused   or failed to 
prevent - a build-up of boiler pressure which in turn caused a central  heating  radiator pipe to 
leak and cause damage.
Ref: DRN16500224But he hasnt provided enough evidence from an engineer.  So I dont think  he can show any 
of the following:
that the boiler pressure was too high in November 2017;
 that British Gas shouldve noticed that issue on an annual  service;
that British Gas shouldve adjusted or repaired the boiler;
that it was high boiler pressure that caused  the radiator pipe to leak.
Because of the lack of technical engineering evidence, I dont find it fair and reasonable to 
hold British Gas responsible for the leak or its consequences.
British Gas visited the flat on 13 February 2018.  Its records show  that it recharged the 
expansion vessel, repaired  a leak under  the boiler and vented the radiators. I dont  see that 
as evidence that high boiler pressure since November 2017  had caused the leak.  British Gas 
also did the annual  service.
Mr G had to pay a £99.00 excess. And I see no basis on which  it would be would be fair to 
direct British Gas to waive it.
Notwithstanding that Mr G had quoted one of his other policy numbers when he complained 
in February 2018,  British  Gas shouldve investigated  and sent its final response  within  eight 
weeks. But there was a delay.
On 8 April 2018  British Gas visited again.  It said the boiler was blocked and Mr G needed a 
new one. But I dont  think British Gas has explained  why it didnt repair  the boiler in April 
2018.
Mr G has recently  shown  us a letter dated  April 2018 by which the tenant  asked  to vacate 
the flat. But he hasnt shown that this was because of British  Gas. So I dont find it fair and 
reasonable to direct  British Gas to compensate Mr G for loss of rent.
British Gas failed  to respond to Mr Gs emails until 21 May 2018. It still didnt explain why it 
hadnt repaired the boiler in April 2018.  So I accept Mr Gs complaint that British  Gas 
stopped giving him service but didnt  explain  why. I dont doubt that the failure  to 
communicate left him feeling abandoned.
Mr G said he would  stop paying his instalments. So I find it likely that the policy  came  to an 
end on or before the renewal date of 7 July 2018.
On 4 August  2018 Mr Gs engineer capped  off the boiler for safety  reasons. But I dont think  
it had been working.  And I dont think theres  enough evidence  that had been  unsafe in 
February or April 2018.
Mr G got a new boiler installed on about 11 September 2018. But I find it likely that hed 
needed a new boiler for some years. So I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct British  
Gas to compensate  him for the cost of that.
Ref: DRN16500225And Mr Gs claim for actuarial loss isnt a type of loss I recognise. I think its based  on 
punishing the business for what mightve happened. I only look at compensation for what 
actually happened.
Ive found that poor communication by British  Gas caused Mr G distress  and inconvenience.
I dont find that £150.00  went far enough  to compensate for this. Keeping  in mind the cold 
weather and the need to deal with an unhappy tenant, I find £250.00  fair and reasonable.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct British Gas Insurance Limited to pay Mr G (in addition to its cheque for £150.00) a 
further £100.00 for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 November  2019.
