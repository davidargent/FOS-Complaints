Mr Os complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. She thought Cash4unow 
wasnt wrong to give the first six loans to Mr O. But she didnt think the remaining loans 
should have been agreed. So, she asked Cash4unow to pay Mr O some compensation.
Cash4unow doesnt agree with our adjudicators view. So, as the complaint hasnt been 
resolved informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide. This is the last 
stage of our process. If Mr O accepts my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Cash4unow needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr 
O could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Cash4unow should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Cash4unow was required to establish 
whether Mr O could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and then latterly The Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) defines sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Os complaint.Cash4unow did a number of checks before it lent to Mr O. It asked him for details of his 
income and his normal expenditure.
The repayments that Mr O had agreed to make on his first four loans were relatively modest 
compared to the disposable income that hed declared to Cash4unow. So given these 
repayment amounts, what was apparent about Mr Os circumstances at the time, and his 
borrowing history with the lender, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for Cash4unow 
to ask him for the amount of information that would be needed to show the lending was 
unsustainable before agreeing the first four loans. 
I think by the time Mr O asked for loan 5, that Cash4unow should have realised that it 
couldnt safely rely on the information he was providing about his finances. I think it should 
have taken steps at that time to independently verify Mr Os true financial position. We asked 
Mr O, through his representatives, for copies of his bank statements so we could see what 
better checks would have shown Cash4unow but we have not received these. So, I have not 
been able to see what Cash4unow would have seen if it had carried out better checks when 
it agreed to this loan or loan 6. So, I cant say that Cash4unow was wrong to give loan 5 or 
6. 
But looking at the overall pattern of Cash4unows lending history with Mr O I think by loan 7 
the lender should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful. And so Cash4unow should have realised that it shouldnt provide any further loans. 
I say this because:
By the time Mr O asked for loan 7, it would have been clear to Cash4unow that he 
wasnt making any inroads to the amount he owed it. The overall capital that he owed 
at this point had stayed the same and he had been borrowing from it for around 10 
months.
When Mr O applied for loan 7, he had repaid 6 loans with Cash4unow and taken out 
further loans within a short period of time. 
At this point a pattern was clearly emerging. Cash4unow ought to have realised that 
it was more likely than not Mr O was borrowing further to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loans were leaving in his finances. And because the overall amount he was 
borrowing wasnt decreasing his indebtedness was not sustainable.
I think that Mr O lost out because:
Agreeing further credit after this point had the effect of unfairly prolonging his 
indebtedness by continuing to allow him to take expensive credit intended for short-
term use over an extended period of time.
This was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Os ability to access 
mainstream credit and so keep him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So I dont think Cash4unow should have agreed to lend to Mr O from loan 7 onwards. 
Cash4unow needs to pay Mr O some compensation.Putting things right
I dont think Cash4unow should have agreed to lend to Mr O from loan 7 onwards. So, for 
these loans Cash4unow should;
refund all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans 7 to 20;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number of loans taken from 7 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 7 to 20 should be removed from Mr Os 
credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash4unow to take off tax from this interest. Cash4unow 
must give Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Mr Os complaint and direct Novaloans Ltd to put 
things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 September 2020.
