The complaint
Mr F complains that Clydesdale Bank plc, trading as Virgin Money, wont refund to him the 
money that he paid to a debt recovery company. 
What happened
Mr F was owed money by a third party and entered into a contract with a debt recovery 
company in November 2018 for it to provide him with services relating to a single debt 
referral. He paid the debt recovery company £7,560 using his Virgin Money credit card. 
He claimed a refund of that amount from Virgin Money under section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974 but it said that it was unable to see where the debt recovery company had 
breached its contract or misrepresented the sale of the service. Mr F wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that it was 
difficult to conclude that there had been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
debt recovery company so she didnt think that Virgin Money had acted unfairly in rejecting 
Mr Fs claim. 
Mr F has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He has explained why 
he strongly feels that the debt recovery company was obliged to provide him with an update 
on the service it was providing. He says that the second and last visit by the debt recovery 
company to the third partys premises was in February 2019 and he continued to receive 
monthly payments directly from the third party up to and including July 2019, even after all 
communication with the debt recovery company had ceased in April 2019. He says that the 
third party didnt go into liquidation until sometime later and, if hed been told that the debt 
recovery company was no longer providing a service and pursuing the third party on his 
behalf, he could have explored alternative avenues to recover the debt. He says that he 
vehemently refutes the suggestion that the debt recovery company has not misrepresented 
its service.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract by the supplier or if theres been 
a misrepresentation by the supplier which induced the consumer to enter into the 
contract;
to be able to uphold Mr Fs complaint about Virgin Money, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the debt recovery company 
and that Virgin Moneys response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or 
reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Fs claim under section 75 
as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr F entered into a contract with the debt recovery company in November 2018 for it 
to  provide a recovery service in relation to the individual debt  that he was 
owed by a third party  the contract doesnt describe in any more detail the service 
that was to be provided and doesnt describe the outcome that would be achieved;
the contract said that the debt recovery company was under no obligation to provide 
interim written reports and that it would  provide updates on the case where an 
update is required to be given;
the debt recovery company visited the third party at least twice and provided reports 
which said, amongst other things, that the third party had a payment plan with Mr F 
and had agreed to pay him £500 each month;
its clear that Mr F expected the debt recovery company to do more to recover the 
debt from the third party and is frustrated that hes only received the payments under 
the payment plan;
I sympathise with Mr F for that and understand the frustration that he feels, but he 
agreed the contract with the debt recovery company and I consider that the terms of 
that contract are not clear enough to show what it was agreed that the debt recovery 
company would do;
its clear that there were discussions between Mr F and the debt recovery company 
about the services that were to be provided but Ive seen no evidence to clearly show 
what was agreed between them;
the debt recovery company hasnt recovered any more money for Mr F than was 
agreed under the payment plan and he says that it didnt provide him with any further 
updates about the debt after April 2019  but I can only uphold his complaint about 
Virgin Money if Im satisfied that theres been a breach of contract by the debt 
recovery company or if theres been a misrepresentation by the debt recovery 
company which induced him to enter into the contract;
this is a finely balance complaint but, having considered all of the information 
provided by Mr F and Virgin Money, Im not persuaded that the actions (or inactions) 
of the debt recovery company are enough to constitute a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation in these circumstances; 
I consider that Virgin Moneys response to Mr Fs claim has been fair and 
reasonable; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require to Virgin Money to refund 
to Mr F all, or any part, of the money that he paid to the debt recovery company, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2021.
