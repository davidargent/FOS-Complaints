K821x#15complaint
Mr W has complained about a loan taken with Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 
Money. Mr W says the loan was unaffordable.
background
Mr W took out a loan with 118 118 Money in January 2018,  the loan was for £1,500  to be 
repaid over a term of 18 months. The monthly  instalment payments were £161.11 and over 
the term, Mr W was due to repay  £2,899.98.
Mr W started  having problems repaying  the loan around July 2018 and theres  an 
outstanding balance on the loan.  Mr W complained to 118 118 Money,  but it didnt uphold his 
complaint. 118 118 Money said that it carried out checks and it made Mr W aware of the 
terms of the loan and he confirmed he could  afford  the loan.
Unhappy with 118 118 Moneys  response,  Mr W referred his complaint to this service where 
it was looked at by one of our adjudicators. Our adjudicator thought that 118 118 Money 
didnt do enough  before lending to Mr W and had 118 118 Money carried out proportionate 
checks, its likely to have  found that Mr W couldnt  afford the loan. And so, she 
recommended that Mr Ws complaint should be upheld as 118 118 Money shouldnt have 
lent to him.
118 118 Money didnt respond  to the assessment  and as the complaint remains unresolved, 
it was passed  to an ombudsman for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before lending money to a consumer, a lender should take proportionate steps to 
understand whether the consumer will be able to repay what theyre borrowing in a 
sustainable manner  without it adversely impacting  on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves didnt  set out compulsory  checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key thing was that any checks  needed to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including things such as how much was being lent and when what 
was being borrowed  was due to be repaid. 
118 118 Money says it checked Mr Ws income and expenditure before agreeing to lend. It 
also said it searched his credit file and carried  out a welcome call with Mr W to go through  
the terms of the loan and get confirmation  from Mr W that he could afford the loan. And 
based on these  checks, it thought it reasonable to lend to Mr W.
Ref: DRN20520302Were 118 118 Moneys checks proportionate?
Having looked  at the information 118 118 Money obtained, I think the results of its checks  
should have prompted it to do more.  The information  provided  shows that Mr Ws declared 
income was £1,450 and his monthly  living costs including things like food, utilities and rent 
was around £490.  Mr W declared  £350  as repayments towards credit card and that he was 
married and didnt  declare  any dependents.
118 118 Moneys search into Mr Ws credit file showed that he had a total credit balance  of 
around £14,973, £945 of this was the outstanding  balance  on his credit card.  The credit file 
also showed that Mr W had exceeded  his credit  card limit of £900 and his balance  to limit 
ratio was 104%.
I think it was clear from the credit search that Mr W had expenses towards other loans but 
didnt declare these.  Ive listened to 118 118 Moneys welcome call with Mr W, and the 
information he declared about  his finances werent  discussed and neither were the results of 
118 118 Moneys credit file search.
118 118 Money needed to check that Mr W could sustainably repay the loan over the term 
and not just that it was likely  to get its money back from Mr W. And based  on what  it found, I 
think it should have  wanted to get a better understanding of Mr Ws financial circumstances 
including verifying  some of the information Mr W provided. As 118 118 Money didnt do this, 
I dont think its checks were  proportionate.
What would proportionate checks likely have shown?
I appreciate that Mr W told 118 118 Money  that he was taking out this loan to consolidate his 
debts, but I think from its checks 118 118 Money should reasonably have known that even 
with the funds from this loan, Mr W would still had outstanding  credit  commitments.
Mr W has provided his bank  statements  from the time of the loan and I know  that different 
checks may show different things  but in the absence of further information from 118 118 
Money about Mr Ws circumstances at the time,  I think its reasonable to place weight on the 
evidence of his actual circumstances at the time.
Mr Ws bank statements  show  his income was around £ 1,550  which included child benefit 
and he was borrowing  from at least five other  payday and high cost credit  lenders.  Mr Ws 
monthly living costs including things like rent, food, utilities and some of his regular credit 
commitments were  around £1,302  I havent taken into account all his regular credit  
commitments including credit cards and other loans here. 
I think with proportionate checks, 118 118 Money  is likely to have found that Mr W had 
dependents and that his monthly expenses outweighed his income Mr W couldnt 
sustainably afford to make the repayment of £161.11 towards this loan.
In the circumstances, 118 118 Money  should  reasonably have been  aware of that Mr W 
couldnt afford the loan and as a responsible  lender shouldnt have lent to him. So, 118 118 
Money needs to put things right.
Putting things  right  what  118 118 Money need to do
To put things right for Mr W, 118 118 Money should:
Ref: DRN20520303remove all interest and charges applied to the loan,
treat all payments Mr W has made as payments towards the capital  amount of £1,500 ,
if after doing  the above, theres a surplus then it should add interest at 8% per year 
simple from the date the payments  were  made  to the date of settlement;
if theres still a balance outstanding, it should  agree  a suitable payment plan with Mr W 
to repay the outstanding balance,
remove any adverse information about this loan recorded on Mr Ws credit  file as a 
result.
HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money  to take off tax from this interest.  118 118 
Money must  give Mr W a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold Mr Ws complaint and require  Madison  CF UK Limited  
to put things right as set out above.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 October  2020.
