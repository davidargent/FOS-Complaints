K821x#15complaint
Mrs R complained about a number of loans she took out through  a company called PDL 
Finance Limited,  trading  at the time as Mr Lender. Mrs R says she was lent to irresponsibly 
and the loans caused her financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Mr Lender throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mrs R took out 11 loans from Mr Lender between  February  2014 and 
June 2018. Ive enclosed a summary  of Mrs Rs borrowing with Mr Lender,  based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  2 onwards. Mr Lender didnt agree with the adjudicators view 
but it did make a different offer to settle  the complaint.  This wasnt accepted by Mrs R so its 
therefore come to me for an ombudsmans  final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mrs Rs 
complaint.
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mrs R could repay the loans she was given in a sustainable manner. These checks  ought  to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amount being lent, the total 
repayment amount  and the consumers income  and expenditure.  
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Mr Lender should  have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So Mr Lender  was required to establish  
Ref: DRN97044882whether Mrs R could sustainably repay her loans, not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the re-payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  that Mrs R 
could sustainably make  her repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the 
case. This is because  the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being without undue  
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loan number 1 ought not to be 
upheld as it appeared affordable. Ive looked carefully at this and taken note of Mrs Rs 
declared income at around the time. Ive also looked  at what she said about her monthly 
expenditure. 
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which Mr Lender most likely carried  out appear to 
have been proportionate  for loan 1. And I think these levels  of checks,  together with the 
income and expenditure details provided  by Mrs R, would  have  made this particular  loan 
appear affordable.  I therefore dont uphold this part of her complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan 2 onwards, the situation  was different. Mrs R applied 
for this loan directly  after repaying loan 1 and the amount she borrowed increased quite a 
bit. Theres also evidence  Mrs R had found  loan 1 quite challenging. Mrs R declared  her net 
income (after tax) as around £1,200 per month and she also provided  details about her main 
items of expenditure which amounted to at least £750 per month. Given  that the single 
repayment on loan 2 was £600  without any interest and charges applied, I think its obvious 
the lending was already  unsustainable. In short, the lending represented such  a large  
proportion of her disposable income  as to leave  her no room to manoeuvre. 
For loan numbers 3 and 4, I think the situation was largely the same.  Loan  3, for example, 
was again taken out directly after the previous loan and where  challenges were  again 
apparent in her paying that previous loan off. Loan 3 had also increased in size again and 
although on this occasion it was payable  over 6 instalments,  rather  than 1, the interest and 
charges were so high as to attract high monthly  instalments which  I think  Mrs R would have 
again found very hard to meet. Loan  4 may have had certain differences  to the others, but by 
this time I think its clear that Mrs R wasnt  making any in-roads into reducing her debt. I 
think it was therefore  irresponsible  to lend her loans 2, 3 and 4 for the above reasons. 
In addition to all this, I think an emerging pattern  of repeated lending from the point of loan 5 
onwards in this case was also becoming  very clear. This pattern should  have  caused  Mr 
Lender to see that Mrs R wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term cash-flow 
problems; she was borrowing regularly, to address shortfalls in her income  and to meet  an 
ongoing need. Mrs R was having  to consistently take out high interest, short-term lending  
over a sustained period  and the indebtedness caused by this type of borrowing was harmful,  
in my view.  Mr Lender should  have seen this and ought to have realised Mrs R was at risk of 
not managing  to repay the loans sustainably and was in financial difficulties. 
So Im also upholding  this complaint  in respect  of loans  5 - 11. For these  Mr Lender 
repeatedly lent to Mrs R in an unsustainable  manner  because:
Ref: DRN97044883 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mrs R borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost  loans
Ive looked at everything Mr Lender has provided us with and its response  to what  our 
adjudicator said.  However, I dont  think it provided  any substantive arguments as to why it 
thought it had done the right thing.  So Im partially upholding Mrs Rs complaint.
putting things right
In order to put things  right for Mrs R, Mr Lender should:
A.refund  all interest and charges Mrs R paid on loans 2 - 11;
B.pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
C.pay Mrs R the total of A plus B;
D.remove any adverse information  Mr Lender has recorded on Mrs Rs credit file in 
relation to loans  2, 3 and 4;
E.the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 - 11 should be completely 
removed from Mrs Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mrs R a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mrs Rs complaint and I direct PDL Finance Limited,  trading  as it was as Mr Lender, 
to put things right for Mrs R as set out above. Under  the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman 
Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or reject my decision before 13 March 2020.
