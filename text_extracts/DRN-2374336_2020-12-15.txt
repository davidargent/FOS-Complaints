The complaint
Mrs H complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
FirstRand Bank Limited, trading as MotoNovo Finance, wasnt of satisfactory quality. Shes 
being helped with her complaint by a representative.
What happened
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mrs H 
and to MotoNovo Finance on 25 September 2020. In my provisional decision I said that I 
agreed with the investigator that this complaint should be upheld but I considered that 
MotoNovo Finance should do more to put things right for these reasons:
the car was supplied to Mrs H under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo 
Finance that she electronically signed in October 2018;
MotoNovo Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs H - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mrs H was about three years old, had been driven for 
39,839 miles and had a price of £12,000;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mrs H says that she returned the car to the dealer a few weeks after it was supplied 
to her because of a knocking noise from its engine, a strong smell of fuel from 
under the bonnet and excessive fuel consumption and that she was told that a loose 
pipe or hose was rectified  but she says that the knocking noise and fuel smell were 
still present;
the dealer has stopped trading and another garage dealt with some issues with the 
car in April 2019 when the cars mileage was recorded as 45,522;
the car broke down in July 2019 and the recovery report said: removed fuel pump 
fuse before towing as serious risk of fire as fuel leaking from no 1 injector and 
recorded the cars mileage as 48,715;
the car was taken to a different garage which sent an e-mail to Mrs H which said that 
the fuel leak was from a fuel injector seal and some repairs were made to the car;
Mrs H complained to MotoNovo Finance in July 2019 and it arranged for the car to be 
inspected by an independent expert in August 2019  the report said that the cars 
mileage was 48,715 and concluded that:  previous repairs carried out have not 
been successful. The vehicle should not be returned to service use in this condition 
to any degree as this is a potential fire hazard due to the severity of the fuel 
contamination and leakage  On the balance of probability the reported faults would 
have not been developing at the point of finance inception although are due to failed 
repairs;
MotoNovo Finance didnt uphold Mrs Hs complaint so she complained to this 
service;
our investigator considered that the car wasnt sufficiently durable and she 
recommended that Mrs H should be able to reject the car and that MotoNovo 
Finance should: end the agreement; collect the car; refund Mrs Hs deposit with 
interest; refund five monthly payments to her; and pay her £300 for the distress and 
inconvenience caused;
MotoNovo Finance has provided further information from the independent expert 
which says: We do not consider that the repairs carried out to the head would have 
had caused the failure of the fuel injector seals; and it says that Mrs H was able to 
cover considerable mileage since the inception of the finance which indicates that the 
car was fit for purpose at the point of sale, and that the current faults were neither 
present or developing at the point of sale, nor the result of failed repairs;
Mrs Hs representative says that Mrs H has been without the proper use of the car 
since the repairs in March 2019 so should be refunded eight monthly payments and 
shes been caused extreme inconvenience, financial distress and anxiety so the 
compensation for her distress and inconvenience should be above £500;
Mrs H says that she first complained to dealer about fuel issues a few weeks after 
the car was supplied to her and that the repair wasnt effective;
when the car broke down in July 2019 it had a fuel leak and the independent report 
referred to severe fuel contamination and leakage;
although Mrs H was able to use the car to drive nearly 9,000 miles between October 
2018 and July 2019 and that the independent expert says that the issues are the 
result of failed repairs, I consider it to be more likely than not that the fuel leak was 
present or developing when the car was supplied to Mrs H and that the car wasnt as 
durable as it was reasonable for her to expect it to be;
for those reasons I consider it to be more likely than not that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs H and that it would be fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances for her to be able to reject the car;
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for MotoNovo 
Finance to end the hire purchase agreement and to arrange for the car to be 
collected from Mrs H  both at no cost to her;
the agreement shows that Mrs H paid a deposit of £1,000 and part-exchanged a car 
which was given a value of £2,600 - I find that it would be fair and reasonable for 
MotoNovo Finance to refund those amounts to Mrs H, with interest;
Mrs H hasnt used the car since July 2019 and I find that it would be fair and 
reasonable for MotoNovo Finance to refund to her all of the monthly payments that 
shes made under the agreement since the beginning of that month (with interest)  I 
consider that it can keep the other payments that shes made as payment for the use 
that shes had from the car;
these events have clearly caused Mrs H distress and inconvenience and I 
sympathise with her for the issues that shes experienced and which have been 
described by her representative - but I agree with the investigator that £300 is fair 
and reasonable compensation for that distress and inconvenience and Im not 
persuaded that a higher award of compensation is justified in these circumstances - 
so I find that MotoNovo Finance should also pay her £300 compensation; and
I also consider that it should remove all information about the agreement from 
Mrs Hs credit file.So subject to any further representations by Mrs H or MotoNovo Finance, my provisional 
decision was that I was minded to uphold this complaint.
Mrs H has made some additional points that shes asked me to consider but has accepted 
my provisional decision. MotoNovo Finance hasnt responded to my provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
That includes the additional points that Mrs H has made  but Im not persuaded that I 
should change my provisional decision.
Putting things right
I find that that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Mrs H to be able to 
reject the car and for MotoNovo Finance to take the actions described in my provisional 
decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Hs complaint and I order FirstRand Bank Limited, trading as 
MotoNovo Finance, to:
1. End the hire purchase agreement and arrange for the car to be collected from Mrs H 
 both at no cost to her. 
2. Refund to Mrs H the deposit that she paid for the car and the value of the car that 
she part-exchanged.
3. Refund to Mrs H the monthly payments that shes made under the agreement since 
the beginning of July 2019.
4. Pay interest on the amounts at 2 and 3 above at an annual rate of 8% simple from 
the date of each payment to the date of settlement.
5. Remove any information about the agreement that its recorded on Mrs Hs credit file.
6. Pay £300 to Mrs H to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that shes 
been caused.
HM Revenue & Customs requires MotoNovo Finance to deduct tax from the interest 
payment referred to at 4 above. MotoNovo Finance must give Mrs H a certificate showing 
how much tax its deducted if she asks it for one. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 January 2021.
