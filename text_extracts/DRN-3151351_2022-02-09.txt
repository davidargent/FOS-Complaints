The complaint
Mr M complains that Ageas Insurance Limited mishandled his claim on a motor insurance 
policy.
Where I refer to Ageas, I include claims-handlers, engineers and others insofar as I hold 
Ageas responsible for their acts or omissions. 
What happened
The subject matter of Mr Ms claim and complaint is a hatchback car first registered in 2019.
For the year from February 2021, Mr M had the car insured on a comprehensive policy with 
Ageas.
Unfortunately, on 30 September 2021, his car was involved in a serious accident. Ageas 
said the car was a total loss in category B.
Ageas said the pre-accident value of the car was £9,350.00. Mr M asked for a re-evaluation. 
Ageas treated that as a complaint.
Ageas increased the valuation to £10,560.00. By a final response dated 19 October 2021, 
Ageas said its final valuation was £10,855.00.
Unhappy with that, Mr M brought his complaint to us within a few days.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Ageas had offered Mr M a fair and reasonable settlement. 
Mr M disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says, in summary, that:
£10,855.00 didnt reflect the market value of the car  or a like-for-like replacement.
The valuation should be at the top end of the range of trade guide valuations. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Ageas policy covered Mr Ms car up to its market value.
We expect an insurer assessing a market value to refer to retail prices in the trade guides.
These guides are based on extensive nationwide research of likely selling prices. 
We place less weight on advertisements as they contain asking prices that are often 
negotiated downwards.
Ive noted the make, model, age, good condition and below-average mileage of Mr Ms car 
before the accident in September 2021.
For a car like Mr Ms, Ive seen retail prices in the trade guides as follows:
Glasss £10,560.00
Cazana £11,313.00
CAP £11,550.00
I consider that to be a fairly narrow range of values. And Ageas final offer of £10,855.00 is 
within that range. So I dont find that Ageas treated Mr M unfairly. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Ageas Insurance Limited to do any more in response to this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2022.
