The complaint
Mr T complains about how Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited trading as Audi 
Financial Services (VWFS) administered and manged his request to voluntary 
terminate his hire purchase agreement (agreement) with it.
What happened
In September 2017 Mr T entered into an agreement with VWFS for a new car costing
£48,757.80. Everything else being equal Mr T undertook to make an advance payment of
£2,410.28, 48 monthly payments of £560.00 followed by a final payment of £26,111.25 
 making a total repayable of £55,410.53 at an APR of 4.6%.
On 9 November 2020 Mr T called VWFS to enquire about voluntary terminating the 
agreement. In this call VWFS confirmed to Mr T that there would be a voluntary 
termination shortfall of £4,570.48 that would need to be paid. Mr T advised VWFS that he 
thought that there wouldnt be anything to pay in this respect.
On 27 November 2020 Mr T called VWFS to say that it was his understanding that he 
wouldnt be liable to an excess mileage charge on voluntary termination. VWFS confirmed 
in this call that it didnt agree this was the case (and this was something Mr T could 
complain about at a later date) and to confirm (for a second time) that there would be a 
voluntary termination shortfall of £4,570.48 that would need to be paid.
On 4 December 2020 VWFS received Mr Ts request for the voluntary termination of 
the agreement. This was received after Mr T had been advised twice that a shortfall of
£4,570.48 was payable and before he had been advised of anything to the contrary.
On 7 December 2020 VWFS wrote to Mr T to say the agreement had now been 
terminated and to say (in error) that there was no voluntary termination shortfall to be 
paid.
On 16 December 2020 VWFS wrote to Mr T to seek payment of £922.81 in respect 
of excess mileage.
On 6 January 2021 VWFS sent Mr T an annual statement in respect of his agreement. 
This had recorded an outstanding balance  in arrears  of £4,010.48 (£4,570.48 less 
£560.00).
On 1 February 2021 VWFS sent Mr T a letter advising him that his agreement was in 
arrears of £4,933.29 (£4,010.48 plus £922.81).
On 9 February 2021 Mr T contacted VWFS about having received the arrears letter dated 1 
February 2021 from it. VWFS says this call got disconnected.
On 24 February 2021 VWFS issued Mr T with a final response letter (FRL). Under cover 
of this FRL VWFS said that it stood by the £922.81 excess mileage charge but didnt 
comment on the £4,010.48 voluntary termination shortfall.
On 26 February 2021 Mr T contacted VWFS for a second time about having received the 
arrears letter dated 1 February 2021 from it. VWFS took Mr Ts dissatisfaction about 
receiving the arrears letter dated 1 February 2021 to be about the excess mileage charge 
(of £922.81) only and not about the excess milage charge (of £922.81) and the voluntary 
termination shortfall (of £4,010.48). During this call VWFS said a hold would be put on any 
arrears contact.
During a call on 10 March 2021 VWFS advised Mr T (again) that a hold would be put on 
any arrears contact. Mr T understood this hold was in respect of the excess milage charge 
(of £922.81) and the voluntary termination shortfall (of £4,010.48) where as VWFS 
understood it was in respect of the excess mileage charge (of £922.81) only.
On 25 March 2021 Mr T sent VWFS an email. VWFS responded to this email to say 
(again) that a hold would be put on any arrears contact. Mr T understood this hold was in 
respect of the excess milage charge (of £922.81) and the voluntary termination shortfall (of 
£4,010.48) where as VWFS understood it was in respect of the excess mileage charge (of 
£922.81) only.
On 12 November 2021 and having realised VWFS had been reporting arrears of 
£4,010.48 with third party credit reference agencies for some time, Mr T complained to 
VWFS.
On 25 November 2021 VWFS issued Mr T with a (second) FRL. Under cover of this 
FRL VWFS said:
a voluntary termination shortfall remained payable
it was prepared to reduce the voluntary termination shortfall sum being sought of
£4,010.48 by £750 to £3,260.48 if accepted within one month
due to the misunderstanding on its part in February and March 2021, as about 
what Mr T was complaining about, it would remove all adverse information 
recorded with third party credit reference agencies since December 2020
it wouldnt report any adverse information to third party credit reference agencies 
for another three months, thus allowing Mr T time to pay the reduced sum of 
£3,260.48
On 30 November 2021, and unhappy with VWFS (second) FRL, Mr T referred his 
complaint to our service.
In December 2021 VWFS confirmed to our service that it was prepared to waive the 
excess mileage charge of £922.81 and to stand by its FRL offer to reduce Mr Ts voluntary 
termination shortfall of 4,010.48 by £750.00 to £3,260.48. It also said it would be happy to 
enter into an arrangement to pay with Mr T if he couldnt afford to pay it £3,260.48 in one 
go.
In March 2022 Mr T advised our service that VWFS had started to report adverse 
information in respect of his agreement to third party credit reference agencies, this being 
after the three month moratorium  offered under cover of VWFS (second) FRL  had 
come to an end.
On 4 May 2022 VWFS sent Mr T an annual statement in respect of his agreement. This 
had recorded an outstanding balance  in arrears  of £4,010.48.
Mr Ts complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that VWFSs offer was fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and it need do nothing 
further to compensate Mr T.
Mr T didnt agree and so his complaint was passed to me for review and decision. I issued 
a provisional decision on this case in June 2022. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Mr T has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed 
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their 
entirety. However, I trust that Mr T will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I 
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, 
as a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The 
purpose of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
VWFS has agreed to waive the excess mileage charge of £922.81, details of which have 
never been reported to third party credit reference agencies. So other than confirming I 
think this is a fair and reasonable thing for VWFS to do, and have to do, I make no further 
comment or finding on this point.
Under the terms of the agreement Mr T had the right to voluntary terminate (everything 
else being equal) on paying £27,700.76. At the time of voluntary termination Mr T had paid
£23,690.28 (£2,410.28 plus £21,280 [38 monthly payments of £560]) a shortfall of 
£4,010.48 (£27,700.76 less £23,690.28). And in my view this is something Mr T should 
have been aware of.
But even if I wasnt of the above view, Im satisfied that when Mr T had committed to 
the voluntary termination of the agreement he would have understood, or should have 
understood, that regardless of his view to the contrary VWFS would be seeking a 
further £4,570.48 or £4,010.48 from him. And in coming to this view I can confirm that, 
amongst other things, Ive had regard to what was discussed between Mr T and VWFS 
in the two calls made in November 2020.
So, in summary, Im satisfied that VWFS is entitled to seek recovery of a 
voluntary termination shortfall from Mr T.
I accept, as does VWFS, that for most of 2021 Mr T would have been under the impression 
that the collection of the voluntary termination shortfall was on hold and no adverse 
information in respect of the same would be reported to third party credit reference 
agencies. But this isnt what happened.
Now Mr T should be fairly compensated for this, but that doesnt mean its appropriate for 
me to direct VWFS to write of the whole voluntary termination shortfall balance. As I say 
above, a shortfall balance is due to VWFS from Mr T and has always been due.
Now Mr T says he is prepared to settle his voluntary termination shortfall balance (with all 
adverse information in respect of the same being removed from third party credit reference 
agencies) by paying VWFS £3,000. But in my view VWFS offer to reduce the voluntary 
termination shortfall balance by £750 and to remove any adverse information recorded 
with third party credit reference agencies for the period December 2020 to early 2022 is 
both fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and it need do nothing further in this 
respect.................................................................................................................................................

VWFS responded to say it had nothing further to add.
Mr T responded to say [he] would abide by any final decision made by the Ombudsman 
Service whether [he] agreed or not [and on receipt from VWFS of] a final bill with 
payment details [he would] settle the matter. However, he said (in summary):
he wanted to reiterate, whether foreseeable or not, the substantial impact on 
his personal life and financial position VWFS administration and 
management of his voluntary termination request had caused
he was assured, at the point of sale, no excess mileage charge would be 
applied in the event of voluntary termination
on four previous occasions he had voluntary terminated agreements with no 
excess mileage being charged
had our service not taken approximately seven months to reach a decision on 
his complaint, there would have been less (or even no) impact on his credit 
rating
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given what both parties have said in response to my provisional findings I can confirm 
that see no reason to depart from them and I now confirm them as final.
However, for the sake of completeness, I would add that regardless of how long Mr Ts 
complaint has been with our service he could have paid the sum being sought from him by 
VWFS before the end of the three month moratorium granted to him by it and then 
amended his complaint to our service from one looking for a waiver to one looking for a 
refund. This course of action would have ensured Mr T ended up with no adverse 
information being reported by VWFS to third party credit reference agencies.
My final decision
My final decision is that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited trading as 
Audi Financial Services, to the extent it hasnt already done so, must:
waive the excess milage charge of £922.81 and ensure nothing in this 
respect is recorded with third party credit reference agencies
waive £750 of the voluntary termination shortfall charge
ensure any arrears recorded with third party credit reference agencies in 
respect of the voluntary termination shortfall is recorded as being in respect of 
the sum of £3,260.48, not £4,010.48
ensure no arrears are recorded with third party credit reference agencies in 
respect of the voluntary termination shortfall for the months it agreed (under 
cover of its (second) FRL) to remove or agreed not to report.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2022.
