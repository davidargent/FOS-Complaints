The complaint
Mr S complains that St Andrews Insurance Plc (St Andrews) delayed payment of interest 
payments related to his home insurance claim.
What happened
Mr S claimed for flood damage to his home in December 2015. I understand that there was 
extensive damage and that Mr S didnt return to his home until June 2017. While most of his 
claim has been resolved, this complaint relates to St Andrews handling of two particular 
invoices for items Mr S purchased as part of his claim.
Mr S said he supplied an invoice for £24,490.80 to St Andrews on 3 May 2017. He also said 
he supplied an invoice for £1,548.00 on 30 June 2017. But he said he didnt receive the 
correct interest payments from St Andrews for these purchases. So he complained. 
In its final response letter dated 14 May 2019, St Andrews said that itd received and 
processed (on 15 November 2018) the invoices Mr S sent on 10 November 2018. But a 
systems error meant that the invoices hadnt been paid until 12 January 2019. St Andrews 
said it paid the interest required on the amounts invoiced over the period from 15 November 
2018 to 13 May 2019. The end date of this period reflected the date of St Andrews final 
response. Mr S was unhappy with this response, so he brought his complaint to this service. 
Our investigator didnt think the complaint should be upheld. He wasnt persuaded that Mr S 
had provided the disputed invoices earlier than November 2018. And he felt that St Andrews 
had put things right when itd paid 8% simple interest from 15 November 2018 to 13 May 
2019, plus £25 compensation for its error.
Unfortunately, Mr S didnt receive our investigators view for several months. A new 
investigator made sure he had a copy of the original view. Mr S didnt agree with it. So the 
new investigator reviewed his case.    
The new investigator didnt think the complaint should be upheld. He noted that the evidence 
didnt show that Mr S had provided an invoice for £1,548 to either St Andrews or this 
service. Although he said he could see that an invoice for £1,199 had been provided. He felt 
that as there was no evidence that Mr S had provided an invoice for £1,548, it was 
reasonable for St Andrews to query the discrepancy. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, this complaint has come to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not going to uphold it. Ill explain why.
Theres no dispute that St Andrews made a mistake. It acknowledged it shouldve paid the 
outstanding invoices after it received them on 15 November 2018. It said that due to a 
system error the payment wasnt processed until 12 January 2019. What is in dispute is 
whether the compensation St Andrews has paid is fair and reasonable under the 
circumstances. Its paid 8% simple interest from 15 November 2018 until 13 May 2019 plus 
£25 compensation.
There are two remaining points of disagreement between Mr S and St Andrews:
1. The period over which interest on any money owed should be paid to Mr S.
2. The amount on which interest should be paid.
For 1., Mr S considers that interest should be paid from the point he sent St Andrews details 
about the money it owed him up to now. So he considers that the quotations  not invoices - 
he first sent to St Andrews in 2017 shouldve been accepted. St Andrews view is that 
interest should only be paid from the point at which an invoice is received.
For 2., Mr S considers that the quotation he sent in for £1,548 for the purchase of a 
microwave and a fridge/freezer should be covered in full. As should the quotation he sent in 
totalling £24,490.80. St Andrews believe that it acted fairly when it used the actual invoices 
received. These were for £1,199 and £24,490.80, which totals £25,689,80. It used this total 
as the basis for its interest calculation. 
The period over which interest should be paid
From the evidence Ive seen, St Andrews told Mr S on several occasions that handwritten 
notes and quotations werent acceptable when claiming refunds. It told him it needed actual 
invoices showing what hed actually paid before it could refund him. 
Mr Ss claim was complex and there were many cash settlements over its course. These 
were only ever paid on receipt of actual invoices. I can see that Mr S submitted many 
quotations for the repairs and replacements that he needed. But I note that in circumstances 
like these, its usual business practice for insurers to only reimburse customers when theyve 
received evidence that a payment has been made. This is even more important when large 
sums are involved. As a service, we think this is fair and reasonable.
I acknowledge that Mr S doesnt agree that actual invoices should be required. He felt that 
hed shown proof through his postage receipts that hed sent the required information many 
times. But, while I dont dispute that Mr S sent quotations and handwritten notes to St 
Andrews, I dont agree that these shouldve been accepted. And Im satisfied that St 
Andrews made its position very clear on this point over the course of Mr Ss claim.
St Andrews has evidenced that it received the required invoices on 15 November 2018. It 
paid the £25,689.80 - the money these invoices showed it owed Mr S - on 12 January 2019. 
Therefore it wouldve owed Mr S interest on the money hed been deprived of over the 
period from 15 November 2018 to 12 January 2019. But it actually paid interest for a longer 
period than that. It paid interest up to 13 May 2019, rather than 12 January 2019. So Im 
satisfied that St Andrews did more than it needed to to put things right here. 
The amount on which interest should be paid
Mr S felt that hed provided proof that hed paid £1,548 to a supplier. Hed sent a quotation 
dated 18 April 2017 containing this figure. But St Andrews said it didnt ever receive an 
invoice for £1,548. 
Mr S also felt that hed provided proof that hed paid £24,490.80 to a supplier in 2017. Hed provided a further quotation dated 2 May 2017 with handwritten notes which stated this 
figure.
But from what Ive seen, St Andrews only received the required invoices on 15 November 
2018, despite chasing Mr S for them many times. These invoices were for £24,490.80 and 
£1,199, not £1,548. This totals £25,689.80. St Andrews paid Mr S this amount on 12 
January 2019. St Andrews also calculated interest on this amount. Im satisfied that this is 
correct.
Ive not seen an invoice for £1,548. And Im satisfied that St Andrews has paid interest on all 
the amounts for which it received invoices. So I dont agree with Mr S that St Andrews got 
the amount on which interest should be paid wrong. 
I also note that St Andrews has said that it will consider any further invoices Mr S might 
provide, which I think is fair. Overall, Im satisfied that St Andrews has taken reasonable 
steps to put things right. And I wont be asking it to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 October 2021.
