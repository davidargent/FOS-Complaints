K821x#15Complaint
Mrs B complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) gave her loans 
irresponsibly. She says that she was in a debt spiral  and the loans werent affordable. She 
believes Sunny  shouldve carried out better checks and it wouldve seen this and not lent to 
her.
Background
This complaint relates to 29 loans given by Sunny to Mrs B between  2015 and 2018. Ive 
included a table  at the end of this decision that contains a summary of the loans.
These were  instalment loans, repayable over terms of between  four and twelve months.  
Most of the loans  were repaid, with the exception of four loans against which sums remain  
outstanding.
Having reviewed its files Sunny  acknowledges that Mrs B wasnt using some of the loans  for 
short term purposes and, after shed been  borrowing from it for 12 months, considers its 
possible that she may have started to become dependent upon short term credit.  So it 
offered to partially  uphold her complaint and to offer redress  in relation to all borrowings from 
loan 8 onwards.  
Our adjudicator therefore considered Mrs Bs complaint in relation to loans one to seven  
inclusive. She didnt think Sunny had been unfair  in providing the first five loans, but felt that 
it shouldnt have given  loans six and seven to Mrs B.
Sunny didnt agree with our adjudicator and so the complaint  has been passed to me for a 
decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind I think that less thorough  checks might be reasonable and proportionate  in 
the early stages of a lending relationship.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
Ref: DRN42899462the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think its important for me to start by saying that Sunny  was required to establish whether 
Mrs B could sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that 
this is the case.  This is because the FCAs Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. 
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Bs complaint.
As Sunny has already  acknowledged that it shouldnt have given loans 8 to 29 to Mrs B, and 
its offer of redress is in line with what this service wouldve required in upholding the 
complaint, my assessment will focus  solely upon  loans one to seven inclusive.
Sunny has told us about the checks it carried out before lending  to Mrs B. Before agreeing  to 
each loan it asked  her for details of her income,  normal expenditure and any outstanding  
short term loan agreements. It also carried out checks with a credit reference  agency. Ive 
looked at the summary of the Sunnys credit checks and these dont show any information  
that I think would likely  have given it cause to be concerned.
Mrs B declared her monthly income to be £1,516,  and her monthly expenditure to be 
between £1,143 and £1,332 at the time of loans one to seven.
Loans one to five
I think that, given the circumstances of this case, the checks Sunny  carried out in relation to 
loans one to five were  reasonable and adequate.  Whilst some of the loans over-lapped, the 
combined monthly repayments due to Sunny didnt represent a significant proportion  of 
Mrs Bs monthly income. And, given these  were the first loans  between  the parties,  I dont 
think it wouldve been proportionate to expect  Sunny  to have asked  Mrs B for any more 
information at that stage.
Loans six and seven
Ref: DRN42899463Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs B, with a view to
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen from this pattern
alone, that further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Bs case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because Mrs Bs pattern  of regular re-borrowing and holding  multiple loans 
at the same  time was firmly established  by this point. Mrs B has been  borrowing consistently 
from Sunny  for over eight months, without any breaks. 
I think that Sunny ought to have realised  it was more likely  than not Mrs B was having  to 
borrow further to cover  the hole in her finances  that was created by repaying her previous 
loans.
Sunny responded to our adjudicator and disagreed  with her opinion to uphold  Mrs Bs 
complaint in relation to loans 6 and 7. Its rationale  for this was that:
each loan was for only £100;
the required repayments represented only 2% of Mrs Bs monthly income;
the availability  of multiple loans at the same  time is a feature of its product which 
provides its customers with flexibility. It took into account the aggregate repayments 
when assessing  affordability for Mrs B.
Whilst I do acknowledge Sunnys comments I remain of the view that the over-arching  
pattern of borrowing shouldve alerted it to the fact that Mrs B was struggling  to manage her 
finances. As such,  I share  our adjudicators  view that Sunny was wrong to provide these two 
loans.
Ref: DRN42899464My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and require Elevate Credit 
International Limited (trading as Sunny) to:
1.Refund all interest  and charges Mrs B paid from Loan 6 onwards;
2.Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
3.Write  off any unpaid interest accrued against loans 25, 27, 28 and 29;
4.Apply the refund to repay the outstanding principal balances,  paying the remainder to 
Mrs B.
5.The number of loans  taken from loan six means that any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries from Loan  6 onwards should be removed  from Mrs Bs 
credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs B a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept
or reject my decision before 30 October  2019.
