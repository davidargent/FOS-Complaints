K821x#15complaint
Miss B says PDL Finance  Limited  (PDL, trading as Mr Lender) lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I sent Miss B and PDL my provisional decision on this complaint on 12 December 2019. A 
copy of my provisional decision is attached and forms  part of this final decision.
I asked both parties to let me know if they had anything to add. Both Miss B and PDL 
responded and confirmed  they had nothing to add in response  to my provisional decision.
The case  has now been returned to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party had anything new to add, my final decision is the same as my provisional  
decision, for the same reasons and I am upholding Miss Bs complaint in part.
putting things right
PDL should:
refund  the interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 8, 9 and 10
add to the refund interest at 8% simple per year, from when Miss B paid the interest 
and charges, until the date of settlement
remove loans 8 to 10 from Miss Bs credit history
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires PDL to take off tax from this interest.  PDL must  give Miss B a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN05535832my final decision
I uphold Miss Bs complaint in part. PDL Finance  Limited should put things  right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 February  2020.

An adjudicator considered the complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part, in respect of loans 8 
to 12. PDL didnt agree  with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
PDL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this means  
that it should  have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss B could repay the loans  in a 
sustainable manner. These checks could take into account  a number of different things,  such as how 
much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that PDL should  fairly and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN05535834I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that PDL was required to establish  whether  Miss B 
could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable  on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Miss Bs complaint.
I think  PDL carried out proportionate checks before approving some of the loans it agreed for Miss B. 
Loans 1 to 4 varied in the amounts lent, there was no clear pattern  of harmful borrowing and the 
repayments did not look unaffordable based on Miss Bs declared income and expenditure. At this 
early stage of the lending relationship, I dont  think  PDL had good reason  not to rely on the 
information provided  by Miss B. These loans  all appear to have been affordable based on PDLs 
proportionate checks and so I do not intend to uphold 
Miss Bs complaint  in respect of these loans.
But by the time of loans 5 and 6, Miss B had been borrowing without break  for a long time, bearing in 
mind the short-term purpose of this type of credit   with only very short  breaks  between  repaying one 
loan and taking another. This is strongly suggestive of Miss B having had difficulty repaying the loans 
in a sustainable manner. So I think PDL ought to have reacted to this and asked Miss B for some 
further evidence of her income and expenditure  which  it didnt do. Having said this, I havent seen 
any proof of Miss Bs income and expenditure at this time, so cannot  make a finding on whether better 
checks wouldve shown  these loans were  unaffordable.  So Im not planning  to uphold  the complaint  
about loans 5 and 6.
Between loans 6 and 7 Miss B didnt borrow from PDL for about  five months. So it wouldnt have been 
unreasonable for PDL to think a new short-term need to borrow had arisen after a period where there 
had been no need for Miss B to borrow   and that loan 7 wasnt  part of a long chain of unsustainable 
borrowing. Loan 7 was also for less than Miss B had typically borrowed for loans  1 to 6. So I dont 
think PDL was wrong to have agreed this loan.
But when Miss B returned again for loans  8 to 10, I think PDL ought  to have realised  it was likely Miss 
B was borrowing in a way which wasnt sustainable because:
Miss B had taken  out six loans in about  seven  months between August 2014  and March 
2015, which  indicated   but perhaps didnt demonstrate entirely  that Miss B may have had 
to borrow again because repaying  the loans had left her with a shortfall.
But when Miss B repeated this pattern  by taking out loans 8 to 10 in quick succession, there 
was a much clearer  indication  that repaying  PDLs  lending was likely to have left Miss B with 
a monthly shortfall  in her income.
For loans 8 and 10 the amounts Miss B borrowed also increased. PDL ought to have known 
that Miss B was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but to meet  
an ongoing need.
Overall, this second period of borrowing (loans  7 to 10) lasted for about a year, unfairly 
extending Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing her to take expensive  credit intended for short-
term use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN05535835So I dont think PDL acted fairly by approving  loans 8 to 10 and I plan to uphold Miss Bs complaint  
about these loans.
I do not think  that loans 11 and 12 formed part of this same  chain of unsustainable lending. These 
loans were much smaller than loan 10 and there were breaks of five months between  loans 10 and 11 
and then again between  11 and 12. I dont  think  PDLs decision to approve these  loans was unfair. So 
Im not planning to uphold the complaint about  them.
putting things  right
I plan to tell PDL to:
refund the interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 8, 9 and 10
add to the refund interest at 8% simple per year, from when Miss B paid the interest and 
charges, until the date of settlement
remove loans 8 to 10 from Miss Bs credit history
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires PDL to take off tax from this interest.  PDL must  give Miss B a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my provisional  decision
I plan to uphold the complaint in part and to tell PDL Finance Limited to put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
