K820x#14complaint
Mrs W complains about issues shes experienced with an integrated television bed 
purchased with finance from Caversham Finance Limited (trading as BrightHouse).
background
In December 2016 Mrs W was supplied with a television bed and entered  into a finance  
agreement with BrightHouse.
In August  2018  Mrs W reported a fault with the bed. An engineer  inspected  the bed and 
found the HDMI cable  was damaged. The engineers  report said the bed would need  to be 
sent away for repair.
In late August 2018 BrightHouse attempted to collect the bed to take it away  for repair.  It 
offered to provide Mrs W with a loan television whilst the television bed was being fixed. 
Mrs W didnt want the bed sent away for repair. She said the television was working  but that 
the mechanism  which allows  the television to go up and down which  wasnt working,  
possibly due to the cables  being twisted.
BrightHouse wasnt able to repair the fault because it no longer held the right parts. It said 
the whole  unit needed to be replaced but that it no longer stocked television beds so it 
couldnt offer a replacement.
BrightHouse therefore  offered  Mrs W the following  options:
Mrs W could  arrange for an independent company to repair the television  and 
BrightHouse would  cover  the costs
Mrs W could  have a reduction  on her weekly payments under the finance agreement  
to reflect  the fact that the television wasnt functioning correctly
Mrs W could  choose a different bed from the store and keep the television
Mrs W could  return the television bed to the store and terminate the agreement
BrightHouse also offered to transfer ownership  of the bed to Mrs W with no need for her to 
make any further payments under the agreement. At the time of the offer, Mrs W had 70 
weeks left to run under  the agreement, meaning  that BrightHouse would have written  off 
Â£1,719.20.
Mrs W rejected  all of the offers. She wanted a full refund of all payments made under the 
agreement.
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. She said BrightHouse had made reasonable 
attempts to fix the issue but had been  unable to do so. She didnt think  it was reasonable for 
Mrs W to receive  a full refund because shed had some benefit from the television bed for 
approximately 2 years  before the issue arose. The investigator thought the offer made by 
BrightHouse to transfer ownership of the bed and write off the balance was fair and 
reasonable and said she wouldnt ask BrightHouse  to do more than this.
Mrs W didnt agree. She said there was no point in her choosing a new bed and keeping the 
television because it was too small to put on the wall. She said she hadnt refused to allow

made her worried that the bed would be damaged if it was taken away.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs W first experienced problems with the bed in August  2018  which  was approximately 20 
months after the point  of supply. Theres nothing to suggest that there were any issues  with 
the bed prior to this. Its also worth pointing out that the issues  only relate to the television 
mechanism, and not to the bed itself or the mattress.
Based on what Ive seen  the issue appears to be with the cables. Initially BrightHouse  
suggested sending  the bed away for repair. Mrs W and BrightHouse  have  a different version 
of events as to why this didnt happen.  
Mrs W says that BrightHouse  warned her that the bed might be damaged if it was sent away.  
BrightHouse has said that it arranged to collect the bed for repair but Mrs W refused. 
I cant be certain of exactly what was discussed regarding the repair  of the bed but I dont 
think BrightHouse would  have gone to the trouble of arranging to collect  the bed if it hadnt  
been prepared  to try and repair the fault.  
When it became clear that the bed couldnt  be repaired, BrightHouse  offered Mrs W several 
options. Ive set out these options above and I think all of them were reasonable. But in 
particular, I think the option to transfer  ownership  of the bed and write off the balance due 
under the agreement was very fair.
I appreciate that Mrs W wants BrightHouse to refund her 90% of the payments shes  made.  
But I dont think it would  be reasonable to ask BrightHouse to do this because Mrs W has 
had fair use of the television  bed for a significant  period of time. And despite the television 
mechanism being  broken,  Mrs W is still able to use the bed.
On balance, BrightHouse  has offered  to repair the fault, which is what I would expect it to do. 
When the fault couldnt be repaired, BrightHouse offered several  options  all of which I think  
were fair and reasonable. Because of this I wont be asking BrightHouse  to do anything 
further.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 January 2020.
