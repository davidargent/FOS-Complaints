The complaint
Mr and Mrs W complain that GE Money Consumer Lending Limited has rejected the claim 
that theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs W entered into an acquisition agreement in November 2001 to buy some holiday 
club membership points from a timeshare company. The purchase price of the points was 
£13,328 from which a trade-in value of £6,800 was deducted so the balance due from them 
was £6,528. Mr and W also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a lender that is 
now part of GE Money Consumer Lending for a loan of £6,528 to pay the balance due to the 
timeshare company. They agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £114.11 to the 
lender.
Mr and Mrs Ws representative made a claim to GE Money Consumer Lending in October 
2017 under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the timeshare was mis-
sold, Mr and Mrs Ws implied rights were breached, the contracts were contrary to law and 
that the timeshare was misrepresented. GE Money Consumer Lending said that the debtor- 
creditor-supplier relationship required for a claim under section 75 didnt exist in these 
arrangements, that insufficient particulars of the misrepresentation had been provided and 
that the claim was time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980. Mr and Mrs W werent satisfied 
with its response so a complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ws complaint should be upheld. He 
didnt think that GE Money Consumer Lending had acted unfairly when it said that it wasnt 
going to look into their misrepresentation claim any further. He also considered their claim 
under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act but thought that it was unlikely that a court 
would find that there was an unfair relationship between the lender and Mr and Mrs W.
Mr and Mrs Ws representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It has provided a detailed response to our investigators 
recommendation and says, in summary and amongst other things, that Mr and Mrs Ws 
claim isnt time-barred because the representations only became misrepresentations when 
the falsity became known and the claim was made within three years of that happening. It 
also says that the company of which the timeshare company is a wholly owned subsidiary 
has gone into administration. It has also referred to an overseas court ruling about the 
corporate structure of the group of companies that included the timeshare company and 
which referred to its fraudulent spirit.
GE Money says that this service doesnt have jurisdiction over the complaint as the loan 
originated before it became responsible for Consumer Credit Act loans and that section 
140A wasnt raised by the consumer or its representative in the letter of claim and wasnt 
included in its response.
I issued a provisional decision which read as follows:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Ws complaint shouldnt be 
upheld but for these reasons:
GE Money Consumer Lending says that this service doesnt have jurisdiction to 
consider Mr and Mrs Ws complaint  but their complaint is that it turned down the 
section 75 claim that theyd made to it and they referred their complaint about its 
response to that claim to this service within six years of that happening;
exercising a creditors rights and duties under a credit agreement is a regulated 
activity - the fixed sum loan agreement is a credit agreement and I consider that GE 
Money Consumer Lendings response to Mr and Mrs Ws claim under section 75 was 
a regulated activity so I find that this service does have jurisdiction to consider their 
complaint - but I also need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to their 
claim;
the claim letter that was sent to GE Money Consumer Lending by Mr and Mrs Ws 
representative in October 2017 made clear that it was a section 75 claim and said 
that it was instructed by Mr and Mrs W  to make a claim against you, pursuant to 
Section 75 and/or Section 75(a) of The Consumer Credit Act 1974;
Im not determining the outcome of their section 75 claim in this decision as only a 
court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not GE Money 
Consumer Lendings response to their claim was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Ws claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented to 
them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them - 
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, GE Money Consumer Lending 
would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the 
time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
The time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr and Mrs W could have made a claim to the timeshare company or 
the lender about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into buying the 
timeshare in November 2001 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations 
would have been made to them and any loss would have been incurred as that was 
when they also entered into the loan agreement with the lender;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the timeshare 
company or the lender  but a claim wasnt made to GE Money Consumer Lending 
under section 75 until October 2017, nearly sixteen years later which was outside of 
the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that their section 75 claim is now time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Ws representative says that Mr and Mrs Ws claim to GE Money 
Consumer Lending was made within three years of them becoming aware that there 
had been misrepresentations by the timeshare company  but when they had the 
knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist them for the purposes of the Limitation Act 
 the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are extended where a 
claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I 
dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr and Mrs Ws claims;
Mr and Mrs Ws representative has referred to an overseas court ruling about the 
corporate structure of the group of companies that included the timeshare company 
and which referred to its fraudulent spirit and, in some circumstances, the time 
limits in which a claim can be made are postponed under section 32 of the Limitation 
Act if a misrepresentation is fraudulently made;
section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been 
deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the 
debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have 
been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a 
breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
I dont consider that Mr and Mrs W have set out what the false statements of fact 
were that they say could amount to fraudulent misrepresentations and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a deliberate 
concealment of any relevant information in these circumstances - I consider that 
many of the things that Mr and Mrs W say werent right ought reasonably to have 
been known to them at the time of the sale - so I dont consider that section 32 is 
applicable in these circumstances;
the company of which the timeshare company is a wholly owned subsidiary has gone 
into administration but its my understanding that the timeshare company continues 
to operate and that the holiday club membership was available to Mr and Mrs W on 
the terms and conditions set out in the acquisition agreement;
our investigator also considered Mr and Mrs Ws claims under section 140A  section 
140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay
any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an 
unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
I consider that a claim under section 140A wasnt included in the claim that was 
made by Mr and Mrs Ws representative in October 2017 and GE Money Consumer 
Lendings response to it made it clear that it was responding to their section 75 claim;
as I dont consider that Mr and Mrs W or their representative made a claim to GE 
Money Consumer Lending under section 140A, I find that I cant consider their 
complaint about its response to a claim under section 140A in this decision;
if they now wish to make a claim to GE Money Consumer Lending about an unfair 
relationship been the lender and Mr and Mrs W, they should first complain to GE 
Money Consumer Lending about that issue and then, if theyre not satisfied with its 
response, they may be able to make a complaint to this service;the loan was made to Mr and Mrs W in November 2001 and they had agreed to 
make 120 monthly repayments so the agreement would have been expected to have 
ended in November 2011  but GE Money Consumer Lendings December 2017 
response to the section 75 claim said that it hadnt been able to find an account for 
the loan which would be understandable if the loan had ended more than six years 
before then;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Ive seen no other evidence to show when the loan ended but, if it ended before 
October 2011, any claim under section 140A would now be time-barred;
Mr and Mrs W entered into another fixed sum loan agreement with GE Money 
Consumer Lending in October 2007 to pay for a holiday ownership product from the 
timeshare company  but their claim to GE Money Consumer Lending only referred
to the loan that was made to them in November 2001 so Ive not considered the 
October 2007 loan in this decision;
GE Money Consumer Lending issued a substantive response to Mr and Mrs Ws 
claim in December 2017 and I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it to apply 
the provisions of the Limitation Act in response to that claim - Im not persuaded that 
the outcome that it reached was unfair or unreasonable in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs W for the issues that theyve had with their timeshare 
and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require GE Money Consumer Lending 
to refund to them any of the money that they paid under the loan agreement, to pay 
them any compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
The business has not responded and the representative said the case had been taken over 
by another firm. We sent a copy of my provisional decision to the new representative and 
have not received a reply
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has commented on my provisional I have no reason to alter it and so it 
stands as set out above.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W and Mrs W 
to accept or reject my decision before 23 February 2023.
