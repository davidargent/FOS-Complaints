K820x#14complaint
This complaint is about a mortgage which, until recently, Mr and Mrs D held with NRAM 
Limited. They sold their home  in 2019,  paying  off most the mortgage balance.  But the 
resulting shortfall,  they say, is because of excessive charges that have caused  the balance  
to increase substantially  beyond  what they originally borrowed.
background
The mortgage started in July 2005,  when Mr and Mrs D borrowed £68,695,  including  fees. A 
further advance  of £7,500  followed in 2006. Both loans were  initially on a capital repayment 
basis, but were converted to interest-only  in 2008.  Also, during this period, Mr and Mrs D fell 
behind with their payments, causing  arrears to build up. Those  arrears  were later capitalised.
In 2019 Mr and Mrs D complained to NRAM  after they put their house up for sale and 
realised the outstanding mortgage balance was in the region of £87,000, more  than the 
selling price of the house. They said this was due to unfair charges added  by NRAM. The 
sale went through, but theyve been  left owing NRAM  about £15,000, which  theyre now 
paying under  an agreed payment plan.
Our investigator explained that when it came  to the arrears  charges, he could only look at 
those which  had been levied since March 2013.  These, he said, had been applied  fairly, and 
all but one  a £54 field agent fee  had already  been refunded.  As for the growth in the 
balance, the investigator looked further  back than March 2013, and attributed  the growth in 
the mortgage balance to the arrears that had been  capitalised back  in 2008.
Mr and Mrs D asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman. They werent  
happy that weve restricted our consideration of the complaint in the way we have. In a 
jurisdiction decision dated 18 June 2020, I confirmed that on all aspects of the complaint our 
rules only allowed us consider events since  March  2013.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached broadly the 
same conclusion as the investigator,  and for the same overall reasons. 
The annual statements clearly reveal that the increase in the mortgage balance about  which  
Mr and D are complaining took place long before March 2013.  The investigator put this down  
to the capitalisation of arrears in 2008. That does  look to be the case, albeit  whether  that 
was done correctly and fairly isnt something  I can consider, due to the time limit on my 
remit.
As to the question  of charges, only one item (a field agent fee of £54) was added to the 
mortgage account after March 2013.  As it had already been refunded before the mortgage 
was repaid, I dont  need to make any finding on whether it was fairly applied  or not.

I dont uphold this complaint.  Under  the rules of the Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im 
required to ask Mr and Mrs D to accept  or reject  my decision  before 6 August 2020.
