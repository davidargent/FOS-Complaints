The complaint
Mr P complains that he was told by Moneybarn No. 1 Limited (Moneybarn) that after 
voluntary terminating his conditional sale agreement (agreement) any proceeds it received 
on the sale of the car would be used to reduce the sum he owed under that voluntary 
termination.
What happened
In May 2019 Mr P entered into an agreement with Moneybarn for the acquisition of a used 
car costing £7,873. Everything else being equal Mr P agreed to make 59 monthly payments 
of £241.59  making a total sum repayable of £14,253.81 at an APR of 30.4%.
Under the terms of the agreement Mr P had the right at any time to repay the amount still 
owed to Moneybarn (reduced in certain circumstances by an early settlement rebate) and to 
take legal ownership the car. He also had the right to return the car, with nothing further to 
pay, where he had paid Moneybarn  or was prepared to pay Moneybarn  £7,126.91, this 
being 50% of the total sum repayable under the agreement of £14,253.81.
On 27 August 2019 Mr P requested from Moneybarn an early settlement figure.
On 30 August 2019 Moneybarn sent Mr P a letter titled Your options for ending your 
agreement with us early. Under cover of this letter Moneybarn said Mr P had the option of 
voluntary terminating the agreement and returning the car to it together with £6,402.14  this 
being £7,126.91 (50% of £14,253.81 payable under the agreement) less £724.77 (3 monthly 
payments of £241.59). It also said that Mr P could settle the agreement in full and take legal 
ownership of the car by paying it £8,149.15  this being £14,253.81 (the full sum payable 
under the agreement) less £724.77 (3 monthly payments of £241.59) less £5,379.89 (early 
settlement rebate).
On 16 September 2019 Moneybarn sent Mr P a letter titled Your options for ending your 
agreement with us early. Under cover of this letter Moneybarn said Mr P had the option of 
voluntary terminating the agreement and returning the car to it together with £6,160.55  this 
being £7,126.91 (50% of £14,253.81 payable under the agreement) less £966.36 (4 monthly 
payments of £241.59). It also said that Mr P could settle the agreement in full and take legal 
ownership of the car by paying it £8,006.71  this being £14,253.81 (the full sum payable 
under the agreement) less £966.36 (4 monthly payments of £241.59) less £5,280.74 (early 
settlement rebate).
Mr P decided to voluntary terminate the agreement, rather than settle it and take legal 
ownership of the car. Following his decision to do so Moneybarn (on 18 October 2019) 
invoiced him £6,350.54  this being £7,126.91 (50% of £14,253.81 payable under the 
agreement) less £966.36 (4 monthly payments of £241.59) less 1p rounding plus a £190 
collection fee.
This complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that Mr P, 
on the balance of probabilities, hadnt been misadvised about what he would ultimately owe 
Moneybarn after he voluntary terminated the agreement. 
He also came to the view that Mr P hadnt been prejudiced in not being given the opportunity 
by Moneybarn to voluntary surrender the car because this option wouldnt have been to his 
advantage, or benefit.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First, I would like to point out Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my 
comments on what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point, its not 
because Ive failed to take it on board and think about it but because I dont think I need to 
comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right outcome. 
Secondly, I would add that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or 
contradictory, as some of its here, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
Mr P says that he was advised by Moneybarn that after the car had been sold the net 
proceeds of that sale would be applied to reduce the sum he owed following voluntary 
termination.
Its unfortunate that the relevant call recordings are no longer available, but this isnt 
surprising given the passage of time. But based on the system notes provided by 
Moneybarn, and given what Mr P says he was advised would be very unusual, Im simply 
not persuaded that he was misled, or misadvised, as he submits. In other words, Im 
satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr P wasnt advised that the sum he owed, 
after voluntary terminating the agreement, would be reduced by the proceeds of the car sale.
For the sake of completeness I would also add that like the investigator Im not persuaded 
that had Mr P been advised he also had the option to voluntary surrender the car he would 
have exercised this option on the grounds that it wouldnt have been to his advantage, or 
benefit.
For the sake of completeness Ive also considered whether Moneybarn could and should 
have brought any other options to Mr Ps attention other than full settlement, voluntary 
settlement and voluntary surrender, such as selling the car privately, or part-exchanging it. 
But even if I was to conclude that Moneybarn could and should have done this, its my view 
Mr P could and should have realised that these were options that were possibly open to him 
and therefore he hasnt been prejudiced by them not being brought specifically to his 
attention.
I appreciate Mr P will be disappointed by my decision, but taking everything into account I 
dont think he was misled as he submits and that he wasnt prejudiced in not being advised 
of the option of voluntary surrender.My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2021.
