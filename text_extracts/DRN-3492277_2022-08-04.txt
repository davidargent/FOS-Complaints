The complaint
Mr A complained about his claim for a new windscreen under his motor policy with 
Advantage Insurance Company Limited.
What happened
Mr As windscreen cracked in April 2021, so he made a claim to Advantage. It instructed its 
windscreen agent to repair Mr As windscreen. 
But unfortunately, the windscreen repair agent wanted to fit the wrong tint of glass. Mr As 
car had a 70% tint, but the agent could only fit a 75% tint. Mr A made several calls and 
eventually the correct tint percentage was fitted by a main dealer. 
Mr A also complaint that the agents operative had scratched his bonnet and that he didnt 
follow Covid safety guidance. Advantage waived the £85 excess as compensation for the 
bonnet scratches but otherwise it didnt think its windscreen agent had done anything wrong. 
Mr A remained unhappy, so he brought his complaint to us. He felt he should have been 
given a hire car for the duration of his windscreen repair. He also didnt think Advantage had 
paid him enough compensation. 
The investigator upheld his complaint and felt given the circumstances Advantage should 
pay him a further £150 compensation. Advantage agreed but Mr A didnt, so his complaint 
has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
