K822xcomplaint
Mrs W complains that NewDay  Ltd acted irresponsibly in giving her a credit card and then 
increasing its limit twice within nine months.
background 
I issued my provisional decision on this case on 20 December 2018.  A copy of it is attached  
and it forms part of this final decision. The full background to the complaint is set out in my 
provisional decision and as such I wont reiterate it here.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I was planning to uphold  the complaint in part and 
ask NewDay to refund some interest  and charges  with the addition  of 8% interest.  I asked 
Mrs W and NewDay  to let me know if there  was anything  else they wanted me to consider.
NewDay said it agreed to refund  the charges and interest but pointed out that the account  
had been placed on hold since  June  2016  and no interest or charges had been applied from 
that date. It calculated the amount  Mrs W had incurred for the months  after the credit limit 
was increased to £1,050 and up to the point the account was placed  on hold and agreed to 
pay the sum of £88.59. 
Mrs W asked  if the redress  including the refund of her cash advance fees. But when she was 
told it didnt she said she accepted the findings.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay has said that  after the credit limit was increased  interest and charges were only 
applied for two months before  a hold was placed  on the account. So Ive looked at the 
statements. And these  indicate that NewDays calculation  about the amount of charges and 
interest applied  to the account after the increase in the limit is correct.  But I cant see that 
NewDay has taken into account  the simple interest  I asked it to add to this figure from the 
date the charges and interest  were  applied to the date of settlement. 
So in addition to the refund of interest  and charges, I require  NewDay  to recalculate  the 
redress, in line with what I said in my provisional decision.  It should  provide a full breakdown  
to Mrs W of how it arrived at the final figure.
But overall, I see no reason to change my provisional findings. Im therefore  upholding 
Mrs Ws complaint  in part for the same reasons given in my provisional decision.
my final decision
I uphold Mrs Ws complaint  against NewDay Ltd in part and require it to:
refund  the interest and any charges incurred on any balance above  £450 after it 
increased the card limit to £1,050;
pay Mrs W simple interest* of 8% per year from the date the charges were  incurred  
to the date of settlement.
Ref: DRN93314252*HMRC requires  NewDay to take off tax from this amount before its paid to Mrs W.
NewDay must give Mrs W a certificate of tax deducted if she asks for one.
NewDay should also provide Mrs W with a full breakdown of how it calculated the 
redress.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.

complaint
Mrs W complains  that NewDay Ltd acted irresponsibly  in giving her a credit card and then increasing  
its limit twice within nine months.
background
Mrs W opened  a Marbles credit card account  with NewDay in June 2015 and was given a credit limit 
of £250. In October  the credit limit was raised  to £450. And in December 2015 Mrs W requested 
another increase  but this was declined. However, in March  2016, NewDay offered Mrs W an increase  
to £1,050. Mrs W continued  to make some payments  to NewDay  but was issued with a notice in July 
2016 advising  her of two missed payments.  She agreed a payment plan and no further interest and 
charges were applied. Other notices  were  issued for missed payments  in September  and November  
2016 and January and March 2017.
By April 2017  Mrs W had engaged  a debt management company to deal with her outstanding debts 
after which she paid off the outstanding card balance with NewDay. 
Mrs W complained that NewDay had acted irresponsibly  in giving  her the credit card.  And in offering  
increases to her card limit. She said she had lots of debt at the time of her application, was suffering  
with mental health issues and had a gambling  addiction. She also said NewDay was the only creditor 
who wouldnt  accept a lower settlement figure from the third party who arranged  her debt 
management plan. 
NewDay didnt agree  and said it offered credit based on the checks  it carried out as well as what it 
knew about Mrs C at the time. It said it believed it had lent responsibly.  One of our investigators 
looked into the complaint  and thought NewDay acted reasonably in giving
Mrs W the credit  card and by giving  the credit limit increases. She also said NewDay  wasnt obliged  to 
accept any offer of settlement that may have been put to it by a third party on 
Mrs Ws behalf.   
Mrs W didnt  agree. She said she had over £50,000 of debt when she took out the card and many of 
the repayments she made  were from the proceeds of her gambling. As a resolution  couldnt be found 
the case  has been passed  to me for a decision. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. 
The UK cards-  best practices  for credit card limit increases guidance says that card issuers should  
take an active  approach  to ensure responsible lending.   But I should  explain  that there isnt a list of 
specific checks a lender should do when  deciding whether to give credit.  That said,  I would  expect a 
lender to carry out checks which are proportionate to the amount  of credit being offered. Typical  
checks can include (but are not limited to) information obtained from credit reference agencies  and  
other factors such as asking about the consumers income and outgoings, any credit history with it 
and the lenders own internal  credit  scoring.
In this case, looking  at what information NewDay considered, I dont  think its decision  to lend the 
initial line of credit was irresponsible. I think the checks were proportionate to the amount borrowed. 
Looking at Mrs Ws credit card application I can see NewDay asked about  her income and the amount 
of unsecured lending she held. Ive also seen the monthly statements for another  card Mrs W held 
with NewDay,  and I dont think the management of that card showed  that NewDay shouldnt have  lent 
further  especially as it has pointed out that it often provides  credit to people who might not otherwise 
get a credit card. 
Ref: DRN93314254So I cant say that NewDay should have declined  the initial application. 
Im also satisfied that NewDay carried out proportionate checks before  it increased the limit in October 
2015. This was a relatively small increase which might have given Mrs W the chance to manage her 
credit better  and not incur over limit fees. The month before the increase shed made a payment 
greater than the minimum required, And NewDay has provided information it obtained  from the credit 
reference agencies  which suggests she didnt  have any arrears, defaults or delinquent debts. So I 
think NewDay  acted fairly in offering Mrs W a higher limit at this point.
But I dont think that was the case with the final increase. This time the increase was over £500 more 
than shed previously had. And after the October 2015 increase Mrs W immediately  exhausted the 
new amount  of credit  shed  been given. And over the next four months she generally  made  only 
minimum payments  and incurred three default fees and a number of cash advance  fees. Indeed 
NewDay rejected her application for another increase in December 2015 because of the account 
management. So Im not satisfied Mrs W was managing well with the £450  new credit  limit to the 
extent that NewDay should have provided more  credit at that time.
I can see NewDay  increased  Mrs Ws credit limit the month  after shed managed to pay off most  of the 
outstanding balance on the card. But I dont think that was sufficient reason for NewDay to give 
another increase.  
The UK cards-  best practice guidance also says of Unsolicited Credit Limit Increases  Risk 
Indicators..potential examples include evidence of
paying  the minimum payment over an extended period
a significant increase in overall outstanding balances over time
instances of exceeding credit limits
making use of cash advances
I think  these signs, which were all evident on Mrs Ws account by this time,  were things that NewDay 
should have noted when its reviewed Mrs Ws account before offering further increases. I dont think it 
was responsible for NewDay to have based its decision to lend further, on Mrs Ws ability to repay her 
outstanding card balance on one occasion.  
Mrs W has said she made the payment as a result  of money she won from gambling.  Shes  also said 
at that time she was suffering from mental health issues, a gambling addiction and was on maternity 
leave from her job. And its clear from the credit card statements that most of the transactions  were  
related to gambling sites.  Although we wouldnt expect NewDay to look at Mrs Ws statements in 
detail or tell her what  to spend her money on  if it had carried out proportionate enquiries  before it 
increased the limit by over £500, I think it would  have learnt of the challenges Mrs W faced  in 
repaying her debts and that she wasnt in a position to take on more  credit and so it wouldnt have lent 
to her. So I think New Day needs to do something to put things right here.
I note Mrs W has asked  why NewDay were the only one of her creditors not to accept a reduced 
payment from her when she wanted to settle her debts using a third party. When a consumer is in 
financial hardship  a lender  is required to treat those circumstances positively  and sympathetically. But 
that doesnt mean  its required to accept a reduced settlement. The lender can consider  a range of 
options which  could include reducing/suspending  interest or accepting lower monthly  payments  for 
example. So although  Ive said that NewDay didnt act responsibly when it increased Mrs Ws card 
limit for the third time,  I dont think  its for me to tell NewDay what it should accept in settlement of an 
outstanding debt. Thats entirely a matter for NewDay  to consider. I understand that Mrs W has since 
repaid the credit card so I wont be asking NewDay to take any further action here.
Ref: DRN93314255my provisional  decision
For these  reasons, my provisional  decision  is that I uphold Mrs Ws complaint in part, and that 
NewDay Limited should:  
refund the interest and any charges incurred on any balance above £450 after it increased the 
card limit to £1,050.
pay Mrs W simple  interest* of 8% per year from the date the charges were incurred to the 
date of settlement.
*HMRC requires NewDay  to take off tax from this amount before its paid to Mrs W.
NewDay must give Mrs W a certificate of tax deducted if she asks for one.
