The complaint
Mr H complains that National Westminster Bank plc didnt act fairly or compassionately when 
it refused to write off outstanding balances on his accounts.
Mr H acts in his own capacity and also as the personal representative for the estate of the 
late Mrs H.
What happened
Mr H and his late wife, Mrs H, had several accounts with NatWest. They experienced 
financial difficulties from around 2000. Mr H says they had been good customers of NatWest 
for many years prior to this and they agreed a repayment plan with NatWest which they have 
complied with for the past twenty years.
Mr and Mrs H contacted NatWest in 2019. At this stage, there were three accounts, a joint 
loan account, a joint current account and a credit card account in Mr Hs sole name. It 
appears that the balances from the two joint accounts were combined. The combined 
balance on the joint accounts was approximately £5700 and the balance on the credit card 
account was just over £2000. 
Mr H says they asked NatWest to write off these outstanding debts and provided it with the 
information it requested to support their request. They had also approached other creditors 
with the same request. Mr H says most of the other creditors agreed to the request. But 
NatWest refused to do so. 
Mr H says NatWest has not acted fairly or compassionately nor properly considered the 
information provided to it. He also says NatWest cashed in on the fact that other creditors 
had written off debts. So, he complained to NatWest.
NatWest investigated the complaint. It said it wouldnt agree to the request to write off the 
debt. It said it had taken into account the fact that Mr and Mrs H owned their own home. It 
also said theyd indicated they had surplus income of £30 per month. It said it would agree to 
reduce the monthly payments from £7.99 per month to £4.00 per month. It also said they 
should maintain this monthly payment but could contact its Vulnerable Customer Team if 
they had any queries. 
Mr H and his late wife were not satisfied with this response. They wrote again to NatWest. 
But, Natwest didnt change its position. It said they hadnt met its acceptance criteria. So, 
Mr and Mrs H complained to our service.
Our investigator looked into the complaint. He said wed expect NatWest to have treated Mr 
and Mrs H sympathetically and positively given their circumstances. But he said that didnt 
require NatWest to have to write off the outstanding balances. It was a matter for NatWest, 
and not our service, to exercise its own commercial judgement when deciding whether to 
write off a debt. He also said NatWest had subsequently agreed to accept payments totalling 
£2.99 per month which he thought was fair and reasonable. 
Mr H and his late wife didnt agree. They said all of the other creditors had written off their 
debts. They also said that, given their age and the number of years required to clear the 
debt, it wasnt a judicious decision for NatWest to ask them to make repayments of £2.99 per 
month. But our investigator didnt change his view. He said we couldnt instruct NatWest to 
write off the debt.
Sadly, Mrs H has passed away whilst this complaint was being investigated by our service. 
So, the complaint is being progressed by Mr H in his own capacity and as the personal 
representative of Mrs Hs estate.
Because Mr H doesnt agree with what our investigator said, the complaint has been passed 
to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
At the outset I want to express my sincere condolences to Mr H on the death of his wife. I 
am sure this has been a very sad and difficult time for him.
I can see that Mr H has provided evidence of his age and financial circumstances. 
The financial difficulties hes experienced first arose in or around 2000. From that time, he 
and his late wife were paying down the debt owed to NatWest in line with an agreed 
repayment plan. I can also see that Mr H has been getting advice from the Citizens Advice 
Bureau.
In July 2019, Mr H and his late wife wrote to NatWest asking it to write off the debts they 
owed to it. And, they provided several items of information to support their request. That 
included an account of their income and expenditure. I can see that this indicated they had 
approximately £30 per month of income which was available to pay off debts owed to all 
their creditors. It also set out proposed pro rata payments to a number of creditors. 
The proposed repayments to NatWest, set out on the income and expenditure information, 
was £2.19 per month for the combined joint accounts and £0.80 for the credit card account 
in Mr Hs sole name  being £2.99 in total. 
Mr H says NatWest has cashed in on the fact that the other creditors listed on the 
document agreed to write off their debts. 
But, having considered the matter, Im satisfied that is not the case. NatWest agreed, from 
September 2019, to accept total monthly payments of £2.99, which is what Mr H and his late 
wife had indicated was affordable. It hasnt increased that amount despite the fact that many 
of the other creditors dont require any of the proposed repayments set out on the income 
and expenditure calculation. 
I agree with our investigator that when Mr H and his late wife contacted NatWest about their 
circumstances, wed expect it to treat them positively and sympathetically. But that doesnt 
mean wed expect it to write off their debts. 
Mr H says NatWest told him he didnt meet its acceptance criteria to write off the debts. He 
says NatWest hasnt set out what the acceptance criteria is. And he says hes provided it 
with all the information it requested. Ive considered what Mr H has said here. I agree that the letter of 3 September 2019 doesnt 
define what the acceptance criteria is. But that letter was summarising the content of the 
previous letter dated 14 August 2019. In that letter NatWest set out a number of things that 
itd considered before making the decision not to write off the debts. This included the fact 
that Mr and Mrs H were homeowners, there was surplus monthly income of £30 and the 
outstanding balance amount. So, taking those factors into account, it had decided not to 
write off the debts.
Ive also considered the other actions NatWest has taken in this case. I can see it hasnt 
been applying any fees or interest to the accounts for some time. It hasnt initiated any form 
of legal action to seek to recover the outstanding amounts. And, it has also shown a 
willingness to review the repayments that are required to be paid under the repayment plan. 
I think these actions have been positive and sympathetic.
Mr H says that NatWest has shown a preparedness to off load debts to others. Hes referred 
to the credit card account which he says was managed by a third party for many years but 
returned to NatWest when it was impractical to manage the repayment offer that had been 
made.
I can see that the credit card debt was managed by a third party. The debt had not been sold 
to that third party. And in those circumstances, NatWest was able to bring the account back 
under its own administration so that its Specialist Support Team could manage it. I think that 
was fair and reasonable. 
When Mr H wrote to NatWest in July 2019, he indicated the amount he could afford to repay. 
That amount was £2.99 per month. As mentioned above, NatWest has agreed to accept this 
amount. Mr H is correct when he says it will take a very long time to repay the outstanding 
debt, based on this monthly repayment. And, Ive noted what he says about the 
judiciousness of NatWests actions, given his age. 
In these circumstances, Mr H thinks it would be fairer and more compassionate simply to 
write off the debt. But, as our investigator said, it isnt for our service to interfere in a decision 
which NatWest is entitled to make. Nor, can we require it to take the same action as other 
creditors have taken.
So, having considered everything here, Im satisfied that NatWest has acted fairly and 
reasonably. Even though Mr H wanted NatWest to write off the debt, it has agreed instead to 
accept reduced monthly repayments. And, based on the income and expenditure information 
he provided to NatWest, it is the case that Mr H agreed he could afford this level of monthly 
repayment. 
I know that Mr Hs circumstances have changed as a result of the recent death of his wife. 
NatWest says Mr H can speak to its Specialist Support Team to discuss his changed 
circumstances and it will be able to consider whether the proposed repayments remain 
affordable or if they need to be amended. I think thats fair and reasonable.
I know this will come as a disappointment to Mr H. But, having considered everything here, I 
think NatWest has acted fairly and reasonably. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above I do not uphold this complaint about National Westminster 
Bank plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H, in his own capacity and as the representative of the estate of Mrs H, to accept or reject my decision 
before 15 December 2020.
