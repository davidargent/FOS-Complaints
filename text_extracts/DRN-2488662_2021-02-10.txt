The complaint
Mr B is unhappy with how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) are dealing with his 
debts.
What happened
 Mr B has an overdraft and loan with NatWest, both of which are in arrears. 
This service has previously dealt with a complaint about the affordability of each product 
when they were granted to Mr B. It was decided the overdraft increases were affordable but 
additional checks could have been made by NatWest at the time the loan was taken out to 
determine its affordability for Mr B. In settlement of that complaint, NatWest agreed to 
remove the interest and charges associated with the loan account.
Due to his ill health, Mr B had previously been referred to the specialist support team (SST) 
within NatWest in order to help arrange a suitable repayment plan for the debts. But, as they 
were unable to reach an agreement, NatWests normal debt management process was 
resumed, and his debt was passed over to a third party to collect.  The investigator also 
decided NatWest should return the debt to the SST and a further attempt should be made to 
help Mr B reach an acceptable repayment plan now the interest and charges had been 
removed from the loan account. 
This complaint focusses on what happened from that point on. 
The debts were referred back to the SST in December 2019. However, after not being able 
to reach a suitable repayment plan with Mr B, and with no further payments being made by 
Mr B towards his debts, around September 2020 NatWest indicated it was preparing to 
again follow its normal process to recover the debt. 
Mr B complains his debts werent sent back to the SST in a timely manner and he was sent 
letters demanding the repayment of the debts. He also complains he has sent letters to the 
SST and hasnt received a response. He wants to be returned to the position he would have 
been in before NatWest caused him problems however, he hasnt been specific as to what 
point he believes this to be. 
NatWest responded and said it implemented the recommendations from the last complaint 
with this service. The SST have been trying to arrange a repayment plan, but Mr B hasnt co-
operated with it. It put forward a £1 a month repayment plan but this wasnt accepted. 
NatWest confirmed it hadnt received any of correspondence Mr B mentions he sent. 
Our investigator looked at the complaint. She told Mr B she was satisfied his accounts were 
referred back to the SST and the interest and charges had been refunded to the loan as 
directed. She did identify while the account was in the process of being moved back to the 
SST a letter was sent to Mr B which would have caused him confusion and so she 
recommended NatWest pay £150 compensation for this. However, she thought NatWest had 
acted reasonably in how it had been attempting to contact Mr B to arrange a payment plan 
and its offer accepting £1 a month was also reasonable.  She didnt intend to interfere with 
how NatWest was proposing to pursue the debt moving forward. 
Mr B didnt agree and asked for the complaint to be looked at by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In order to help me understand this complaint further, Ive listened to the call Mr B had with 
NatWest in April 2020.
In that call, Mr B focusses on what has happened previously.  Mr B has said he wants to be 
put in the position he would have been in before NatWest caused him problems. He feels 
NatWests original debt collection actions hampered his recovery from his heart attack and it 
changed his account and removed benefits from it that were useful to him.  He holds 
NatWest responsible for the fact he will be unlikely to work again in the future. He said he 
wants NatWest to sincerely apologise, take responsibility and put forward a solution as to 
how they will make the matter right. 
During the call the adviser suggests a £1 a month repayment plan but Mr B says he isnt in a 
position to be held liable for any of the debt due to his limited income. He wants to take 
advice before agreeing to anything and primarily, he wants to hear from NatWest first before 
discussing how the matter can move forward.
Having listened to the call, I think its important to stress here that I wont be relooking at the 
complaints this service has already considered. Those complaints have found that NatWest 
acted correctly in how it took his loan repayments from his current account and the changes 
NatWest made to the accounts it offered, wasnt something this service would get involved 
in. 
They also concluded Mr Bs debts had previously been referred to the SST but having not 
received any information, NatWest was forced to start its normal debt recovery process. It 
was determined the overdraft was affordable for Mr B and although further affordability 
checks could have been made for the loan, Mr B had received benefit of the funds and 
therefore they are owed to NatWest. 
The resolution from those complaints was that NatWest should repay any interest and 
charges incurred on the loan and moved both debts back to the SST so they could again try 
to reach an acceptable repayment plan with Mr B.  Which NatWest did.
I have therefore looked at what has happened since the last complaint.  
NatWest has attempted to contact Mr B many times to obtain information to help it work with 
him to reach an acceptable payment plan. I appreciate Mr B has said he has sent 
information to NatWest about his income and expenditure, but he was told in April that 
information hasnt been received. I cant see that Mr B has made further attempts to ensure 
NatWest has the information it needs. And, because it didnt have the required information, I 
dont think it was unreasonable of NatWest to continue contacting Mr B.
I also understand, even without the information, NatWest offered Mr B the opportunity to 
enter into a £1 a month payment plan for his debts, however Mr B has refused this. I think 
this was a reasonable offer for NatWest to make.
Having reviewed everything, I dont think NatWest has acted unreasonably in how it has tried to engage with Mr B to reach a suitable repayment plan for his debts. As no arrangement 
has been reached and Mr B has not made any payments towards his debts in the meantime, 
I dont think NatWest is acting unreasonably now by looking to pursue the repayment of the 
debts through its usual channels.  
I understand Mr B is in ill health and he holds NatWest responsible for the position he finds 
himself in however going forward he will need to co-operate with NatWest (or any other 
party) and engage with them to arrange a suitable repayment plan for the debts.
As the investigator identified, a letter was sent to Mr B while the debts were being 
transferred back to the SST. I do agree this would have caused Mr B some concern and I 
think £150 compensation is a fair and reasonable amount for NatWest to pay Mr B to 
recognise this. 
Putting things right
 NatWest should pay Mr B £150 compensation.
My final decision
 I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr B £150 
compensation.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 March 2021.
