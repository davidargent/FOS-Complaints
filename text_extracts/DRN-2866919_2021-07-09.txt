The complaint
Mr W complains Santander UK Plc reduced his overdraft limit without warning. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known by both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
Mr W has made several complaints about Santander, to be clear I am only considering the 
complaint outlined above in this decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
The terms and conditions of Mr Ws account say that Santander can change the 
available limit, and when doing so, it must give 30 days notice of any change. 
 
Santander wrote to Mr W on 20 July 2020 to let him know his overdraft limit was to 
be reduced on 1 September 2020. As it gave more than 30 days notice to Mr W of 
the change, I dont think it has done anything wrong here.
Mr W has said he didnt get the letter. Ive looked at a copy of the letter and can see it 
was correctly addressed.  I cant hold Santander responsible for any failings of the 
delivery service used. I simply need to be satisfied Santander sent a letter to Mr W, 
which I am. 
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ws complaint against Santander UK Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 August 2021.
