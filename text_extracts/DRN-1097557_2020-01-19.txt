Complaint
This complaint is about a credit card payment protection insurance (PPI) policy taken out in 
2001. Mr C says Bank of Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) mis-sold him the PPI. 
What Ive decided and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding this case.
Ive decided the policy wasnt mis-sold because:
Mr Cs credit agreement had a section for additional services. There was a box that 
could be ticked if Mr C wanted PPI, or which could be left blank if he didnt want it. 
The box was ticked and Mr C signed the agreement to confirm his choices. So I think 
that Halifax made it clear Mr C didnt have to take out PPI and that he chose to take it 
 though I can understand why he might not remember this after so long.
 
Halifax recommended the PPI to Mr C, so it had to check that the policy was right for 
him  and based on what Ive seen of his circumstances at the time, I think that it 
was. For example, it looks like Mr C was eligible for the cover and wasnt affected by 
any of its main exclusions or limitations. While he had sick pay through work and 
some savings, the PPI offered him more comprehensive cover and wouldve paid out 
on top of his existing benefits. And it meant he could effectively protect his savings 
and use them for other things. So it looks like the policy couldve been useful for 
Mr C.
 
Its possible the information Halifax gave Mr C about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. The question, then, is whether I think better information was likely to 
have changed his mind. Here, it looks like Mr C chose to take out the policy, which 
indicates he wanted this type of cover. As I said above, it doesnt look like he was 
affected by any of the exclusions to or limits on the PPI, and it could have been 
useful for Mr C in case something went wrong. And so I dont think better information 
about the PPI was likely to have put him off taking it out. 
 
This means I dont think the PPI was mis-sold. So Halifax doesnt need to refund everything 
Mr C paid for it. But Halifax has already offered to give Mr C back some of the cost of the 
PPI. I understand Halifax has already paid this to Mr C. I dont think it needs to do anything 
more.
My final decisionI dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 February 2020.
