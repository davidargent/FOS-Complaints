K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to him. 
background
Between March  2016 and September 2018,  Mr W borrowed 44 loans from Sunny. His full 
lending history is set out in the appendix to this decision. But for ease of reference, I have 
set out the first eight loans below:

Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be upheld in respect of loans 6 to 44. At that 
point, she thought it should  have  been  clear to Sunny that the pattern of borrowing itself 
meant that Sunny should have realised the lending  was not sustainable. 
Sunny disagreed with that view.  It said that the relatively low amount of interest Mr W paid 
on his loans indicated  that his indebtedness  was not increasing to an unsustainable level.  It 
did not consider  that Mr W was in financial difficulty. Nevertheless, it agreed that it should 
not have agreed  loans  33 to 44 and offered to settle the complaint on that basis. It later 
amended that offer and offered to settle the complaint in respect of loans 26 to 44. 
Mr W did not respond to Sunnys latest offer. As the offer was not in line with what  was 
recommended by our adjudicator, the matter has come to me to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. There may even come  a point where the lending  
history and pattern  of lending itself clearly demonstrates  that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN29871552I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
I can see that Mr W didnt disagree with what our adjudicator said in respect of loans 1 to 5. 
So I havent considered further whether Sunny  lent those loans irresponsibly. I have kept 
them in mind though when looking at the rest of Mr Ws complaint. 
Ive considered the overall pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing if there was a 
point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. If that was the case,  Sunny should have realised  that it was wrong  to  
provide any further  loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I agree with our adjudicator that this 
point was reached by loan 6. By now, Sunny would have seen that Mr W had rapidly re-
borrowed after repaying loans 2 and 4. I can also see that he repaid loans 3 and 4 on the 
same day, before taking out loan 5 the following day. 
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr W had taken out 6 loans within 3 months So Sunny ought to have realised it 
was most likely that Mr W was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances.   
I appreciate that Sunny  argued  the low interest Mr W paid on his loans indicated  that his 
loan repayments  were sustainable.  But I think the point here is not how much interest Mr W 
paid, but his reliance  on short-term lending. If he was paying off one loan and then taking 
another very shortly afterwards, it indicates he struggled to repay the previous loan. And 
thats because  he was having  to borrow more very soon afterwards. 
In any event, Mr W only paid a small  amount  of interest because he repaid the loan early. 
Sunny cant rely on the low amount  of interest  Mr W paid because  if the loan had run to 
term, Mr W would have paid a lot more. 
Im satisfied that by loan 6, Sunny ought  to have known  that Mr W was not likely borrowing 
to meet  a temporary shortfall  in their income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed. Loan 44 was taken out two 
years months after Mr Ws first. It was for half of the amount. Mr W had paid large amounts 
of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
Ref: DRN29871553I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 44 and Sunny should put things right.  I 
appreciate that in its response to our adjudicator, Sunny said that interest  wasnt  charged on 
some of its loans. Clearly where  Mr W did not pay any interest or charges, there will be 
nothing for Sunny to refund on those loans. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 6 to 44; 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 44 should be removed from Mr 
Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited must  comply  with the above  putting things right section. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 April 2020.
