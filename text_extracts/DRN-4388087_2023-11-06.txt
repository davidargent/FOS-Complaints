The complaint
Miss C complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Miss C had two credit cards from NewDay, an Aqua card and a Marbles card. The Aqua 
card was opened in November 2015; the Aqua card was opened in December 2017. Limit 
increases were made as follows:
Aqua card:
Date Event Limit
(November 2015 Account opened £250**)
(July 2016 Limit increase £450**)
August 2020 Limit increase £1,400
(May 2021 Limit increase £2,900*)
(September 2021 Limit increase £3,800*)
*NewDay upheld Miss Cs complaint re these increases.
**Considered out of jurisdiction.
Marbles card:
Date Event Limit
December 2017 Account opened £300
March 2018 Limit increase £700
October 2018 Limit increase £1,400
January 2020 Limit decrease £700
July 2020 Limit increase £1,200
October 2020 Limit increase £2,700
(May 2021 Limit increase £4,200*)
*NewDay upheld Miss Cs complaint re this increase.
Miss C complained. She said NewDay didnt make sufficient checks. She had a lot of debts, 
including payday loans, at the time. She couldnt afford the credit from NewDay  and if 
theyd done the proper checks, they wouldnt have lent her the money or increased the 
limits. She said NewDay had agreed the increases from May 2021 were wrong and had 
refunded interest so they should do the same for the earlier increases.
NewDay said theyd completed sufficient credit checks for the issue of the cards in the first 
place and for the subsequent increases. 
For the Aqua card, NewDay said:
- Miss C said she had an income of £23,000 (gross) per annum, had no access to 
other income, and had unsecured debts of £700.
- She had no defaults or payday loans and no accounts were in arrears.
- So, the card was issued with a limit of £250.
- On the limit increases, Miss C was given the option to opt out of the offered 
increases but didnt.
- The checks theyd carried out included the conduct of her Aqua account to date; 
conduct of other NewDay accounts; internal and external payment plans; payday 
loan history. Based on the checks carried out at the time, they agreed to lend the 
money and said the checks were sufficient.
- But given Miss Cs circumstances that shed told NewDay about - they agreed to 
uphold her complaint from May 2021, and refunded the interest based on the 
increased borrowing from then on. Interest of £492.53 was refunded.
For the Marbles card, NewDay said:
- Miss C said she had an income of £22,500 per annum, had no access to other 
income and had unsecured debts of £3,900.
- NewDay said they carried out the same checks as for the Aqua card (above) and 
issued the card with a limit of £300.
- NewDay said that for the limit increases, the same checks were carried out as for the 
Aqua card (above), with the same results. Therefore they said the increases were 
justified.
- But given Miss Cs circumstances that shed told NewDay about - they agreed to 
uphold her complaint from May 2021, and refunded the interest based on the 
increased borrowing from then on. Interest and fees of £274.67 was refunded.
Miss C brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said the issue of the Aqua card in 
November 2015 and the first limit increase (July 2016) were out of jurisdiction  as they 
occurred more than six years before Miss C referred her complaint to us. Miss C accepted 
this and we agreed to look at the limit increase on the Aqua card in August 2020 (£1,400); 
and the issue of the Marbles card in December 2017 and the subsequent limit increases.
She said that NewDay carried out sufficient and proportionate checks for all the lending 
decisions  up to May 2021. She said NewDay shouldve looked at Miss Cs circumstances 
with effect from the October 2018 increases, but didnt. But if NewDay hadve done so  they wouldve found that Miss C could afford the increased borrowing, based on what her bank 
account statements showed. She didnt look at what happened in May 2021 and thereafter  
as NewDay had upheld Miss Cs complaint about those.
Miss C didnt agree. She said that NewDay must have seen she had more than £25,000 of 
other debts at the time, and the payments to these was £700-800 per month, which wasnt 
affordable. Added to the payments to NewDay (£300), it was clear she couldnt afford the 
NewDay debts. She asked that an ombudsman look at her complaint.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In deciding whether a customer was provided with unaffordable credit or provided with credit 
irresponsibly, we need to understand:
Whether the lender completed reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that the borrower would be able to repay any credit in a sustainable way?
If reasonable and proportionate checks were completed, did the lender make a 
fair lending decision bearing in mind the information gathered and what the lender 
knew about the borrowers circumstances?
If reasonable and proportionate checks werent completed, would reasonable and 
proportionate checks more likely than not have shown that the borrower was more 
likely than not unable to sustainably repay what they were being lent?
Was there a point where the lender ought reasonably to have realised it was 
increasing the borrowers indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful and so shouldnt have provided further credit?
Did the lender act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
And, these considerations must be borne in mind at the time of each of the increases in 
credit limit. The checks need to be more thorough the lower a customers income and the 
higher the amount to be repaid.
So, I have looked at what happened here with this guidance in mind.
Lending decisions  December 2017 and March 2018:
I can see Miss C declared an income of around £1,500 per month. Ive seen the information 
NewDay reviewed  there was no adverse credit information (e.g. defaults, late payments, 
arrears). NewDay could see Miss C had around £4,000 of other unsecured debts, which was 
low. And  Miss C was making the payments to the NewDay cards each month, without any 
missed payments. There werent any over limit situations. So  as I see it, there was nothing 
to concern NewDay in making these lending decisions.
Lending decisions  October 2018 (£1,400); July 2020 (£1,200); August 2020 (£1,400); 
October 2020 (£2,700):
These are the important increases in the context of Miss Cs complaint. I reviewed the 
information and checks NewDay undertook at the time of the increases. I can see that:
- Miss C had made the payments to her NewDay cards every month, with no missed 
payments.- There had been no over limit occurrences.
- All her other external debts were being repaid, with no arrears or missed payments.
- There was no legal action taking place on her other debts.
So  I can see that NewDay concluded that Miss C was managing her finances satisfactorily.
Miss C has argued that she had a lot of other debts  and this shouldve caused NewDay not 
to lend her more money. I looked at this. NewDay could see that Miss C had other 
unsecured debts of £25,000 between July 2020 and October 2020. There were ten other 
debt accounts. So -  on the face of it, this seems a lot  when Miss C earnt around £1,500 
per month. As our investigator said, given this borrowing, NewDay shouldve made more 
inquiries  such as looking at her bank statements.
So  to see what NewDay wouldve seen - I looked at Miss Cs bank statements for the 
period of the increases. For October 2018 - I can only see the repayments to a large bank 
loan and to two credit cards (totalling £509 per month). For July 2020 to October 2020, I can 
see the same bank loan payments and two other credit cards being repaid  (totalling around 
£670 per month). I couldnt see any other payments  for example, to payday loan 
companies. 
Miss C sent to us her credit report, and this shows two payday loans were paid off by June 
2018. So  those payments wouldve stopped. There was one other loan of £4,000 taken out 
in October 2016  which was being paid on time (but the payments for this arent shown on 
Miss Cs bank statement).
It looks as if the largest loan at the time was the bank loan  which I think wouldve had a 
balance of around £20,000 in October 2020  so that was the largest part of the other debts 
figure (of £25,000) shown. And  it looks like the other loan of £4,000 was the other main 
part of the other debts figure. 
But  I can only go on the evidence I have been presented with  and these debts were 
being paid on time. And  Miss C was making the payments to the NewDay credit cards 
every month, without fail. So  even if NewDay had looked into her financial situation more 
closely, Im persuaded that they wouldve concluded that it was reasonable to lend the 
additional money to Miss C.
Miss C has argued that as NewDay have upheld her complaint about the increases in May 
2021 and thereafter, then it follows that the earlier increases were also irresponsible. But 
here, Im not party to why NewDay upheld the later increases, and I dont think it follows that 
the earlier ones must have also been wrong  I can only make a decision based on the 
information I can see, and which Ive reviewed.
Therefore, while I know Miss C will be disappointed by my decision, Im not asking NewDay 
to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 December 2023.
