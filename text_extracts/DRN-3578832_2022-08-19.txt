The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) have unfairly placed a 
limitation on his account that is stopping him from withdrawing funds. 
What happened
Mr B has held an account with PayPal for five years, and it has a balance of around Â£90. 
In June 2020 PayPal placed a limitation on the account and as part of this the funds in the 
account were restricted. Mr B wasnt happy with this so he raised a complaint. 
Mr B didnt think it was fair for PayPal to limit the account and restrict access to his funds, 
especially without an explanation. He wanted PayPal to remove the limitation and allow him 
to withdraw the funds in the account. 
Mr B said he has provided PayPal with all of the information it requested and this was good 
enough for the five years hes had his account. Mr B has reservations about providing his 
photographic identification online due to security concerns. 
PayPal said it limited Mr Bs account fairly, and in line with its user agreement which Mr B 
agreed to when he opened his account. PayPal said the photographic identification was 
required as part of its standard procedure when Mr B reached an internal receiving limit. And 
since Mr B didnt provide the identification PayPal was unable to remove the limitation. 
Mr B was unhappy and so our investigator looked into things for him. He said he thought 
PayPal had acted in line with its user agreement. And without Mr Bs photographic 
identification PayPal was unable to complete the checks its required to do in order to meet 
its regulatory obligations. So he didnt think they had done anything wrong and didnt uphold 
the complaint. 
Mr B wasnt satisfied with the investigators view and so the complaint has been passed to 
me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint. Ive focused my comments on what I think 
is relevant. If I havent commented on any specific point its because I dont believe it affects 
what I think is the right outcome. 
I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr B. Ive got no doubt of the 
inconvenience having a limitation on his account has been. And I recognise it was more 
frustrating for him as he feels he has provided PayPal with the information it requires, and 
hes had his account for a number of years. So I can see why Mr B would look at the actions 
taken by PayPal and think they were unfair. But for me to agree PayPal have acted unfairly I 
would need to be satisfied it acted outside of the user agreement. Or that it had no justifiable 
reason to limit Mr Bs account in the first place. And in these circumstances I cant say this 
was the case. 
Financial businesses in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain action in order to 
meet legal and regulatory obligations. Businesses are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing relationship. That sometimes means regulated firms need to 
restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customer accounts. 
Ive seen evidence provided by PayPal which shows it limited Mr Bs account when he 
reached a receiving limit on his account. PayPals standard procedure when this happens is 
to obtain the customers identification. PayPal requested Mr Bs identification in order to lift 
the limitation but Mr B refused to provide it. Mr B has said he has security concerns about 
providing the identification online. But PayPal is an online service and so I cant say its 
unreasonable for it to make the request.
 
Mr B has said he doesnt think the identification checks are secure because he could provide 
any photograph and PayPal would be unable to check whether it is actually a photograph of 
him. But PayPal have told us it requires a government issued document such as a driving 
licence, or passport.
Ive looked at whether PayPal has acted within the terms of the user agreement when 
limiting the account and restricting access to Mr Bs funds. The user agreement explains that 
PayPal, may also limit your PayPal account in order to comply with applicable law. It goes 
on to say once the information requested is provided the limitation can be removed. And 
since Mr B hasnt provided the information PayPal is unable to remove the limitation. So I 
think PayPal acted within the user agreement here. 
Mr B has said the account has been running for the last five years and now suddenly PayPal 
want a copy of his identification. The user agreement stipulates there are certain times when 
further information about customers is required as part of its anti-money laundering checks, 
identification checks, or regulatory obligations. And this is the case here. 
I have looked at the circumstances of this complaint as a whole. But in order to uphold Mr 
Bs complaint I would need to see PayPal acted outside its user agreement. This is because 
Mr B agreed to the terms when he signed up to PayPal. But PayPal have within the terms of 
the user agreement. So I cant say it has done something wrong. 
I understand this isnt the outcome Mr B was hoping for. And I recognise it doesnt re-instate 
access to the account. But I hope it goes some way to providing assurances that the actions 
PayPal have taken are fair and within the terms of the user agreement. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & 
Cie, SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 September 2022.
