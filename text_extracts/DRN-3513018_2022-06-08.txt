The complaint
Mr M complains that Shawbrook Bank Limited (Shawbrook) has rejected the claim he 
made under sections 56, 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the Act) in 
relation to a solar panel system he says was misrepresented to him by the supplier.
Mr M is represented by a claims management company (the CMC).
Background
In or around March 2016, Mr M was contacted by a representative of a company Ill call P 
to talk about purchasing a solar panel system (the system) to be installed at his home. 
After being visited by a representative of P, Mr M decided to purchase the system and 
finance it through a 15 year fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook. The system was 
subsequently installed.
In October 2020 the CMC made a claim to Shawbrook on Mr Ms behalf under section 75 of 
the Act. The CMC said that, following a cold call, P had made a number of representations 
about the system that had turned out not to be true, and it was these misrepresentations that 
had induced Mr M to enter into the contract with P. The CMC said the following 
misrepresentations had been made:
the total cost of the system was documented as £8,595 to mislead Mr M, as when the 
interest was added the total cost was actually £16,608.60;
the system would generate free electricity;
the system would be self-funding within the term of the loan;
the feed in tariff (FIT) and savings on his electricity bills would provide enough 
income to cover the monthly loan payments from the outset; and
the system would not require maintenance (but in fact the inverter would have to be 
replaced during the systems 25 year lifespan, at a cost of £1,000).
Shawbrook said that it didnt agree the system had been misrepresented to Mr M or that 
there were any other reasons for the claim to be upheld.
One of our adjudicators looked into what had happened. Having considered all the 
information and evidence provided, our adjudicator didnt think that P had misrepresented 
the system to Mr M and found no reason to uphold the complaint.
The CMC didnt agree with the adjudicators view. It said that it would take the system 18 
years to pay for itself, which would mean that Mr M would still be out of pocket at the end of 
the 15 year loan term. It was unlikely that he would have agreed to that unless he was 
misled.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the case has been passed to me for review.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I do not uphold it. I will explain why.
Relevant considerations
When considering whats fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account relevant law 
and regulations, relevant regulatory rules, guidance and standards and codes of practice, 
and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant 
time. In this case the relevant law includes sections 56 and 75 of the Act.
Section 75 provides protection for consumers for goods or services bought using credit. As 
Mr M paid for the system with a fixed sum loan agreement, Shawbrook agrees that section 
75 applies to this transaction. This means that Mr M could claim against Shawbrook (the 
creditor) for any misrepresentation or breach of contract by P in the same way he could have 
claimed against P (the supplier). So Ive taken section 75 into account when deciding what is 
fair in the circumstances of this case.
Section 56 is also relevant. This is because it says that any negotiations between Mr M and 
P, as the supplier, are deemed to have been conducted by P as an agent of Shawbrook.
Section 140A is about unequal relationships between the parties to a credit agreement. In 
this case, the CMC relies on the alleged misrepresentation of the system.
For the purpose of this decision Ive used the definition of a misrepresentation as an untrue 
statement of fact or law made by one party (or his agent) to a second party which induces 
that second party to enter the contract, thereby causing him loss.
What happened?
If there is a dispute about what happened, I must decide on the balance of probabilities  
that is, what I consider to have been most likely to have happened, given the evidence that 
is available and the wider surrounding circumstances.
Mr M says that during a sales meeting he was told that the system would be entirely self-
financing and come at no additional cost.
There are several documents that have been provided by both parties. These include the 
credit agreement and solar quote, titled Your Personal Solar Quotation. Ive considered 
these, along with Mr Ms testimony and recollection of the sales meeting, to decide on 
balance what is most likely to have happened.
The quote is a detailed document that sets out key information about the system, the 
expected performance, financial benefits and technical information. P, via Shawbrook, has 
told this service that this formed a central part of the sales process and the representative of 
P would have discussed this in detail with Mr M, explaining any benefits of the system, prior 
to him agreeing to enter into the contract. 
Having thought carefully about the available evidence, Im satisfied that on balance the 
quote did form a central part of the sales process and therefore accept that the salesperson 
went through it during the meeting. So, Ive taken this into account, along with Mr Ms 
version of events, when considering if there have been any untrue statements of fact.The credit agreement sets out the amount being borrowed (i.e. the cash price of the system), 
the interest to be charged, the total amount payable, the term of the loan and the contractual 
monthly repayments.
Cost of the system
On balance, Im satisfied that Mr M was told that the overall cost of the system was 
£16,608.60. The credit agreement makes it clear that the cash price of the system is £8,595. 
It sets out a clear breakdown of the deposit, the amount of credit provided, the total charge 
for credit, the monthly payments, and the total amount repayable, £16,608.60.
Having considered all the evidence, including Mr Ms recollections, Im satisfied that they 
were told that there would be a monthly loan repayment due. The quote makes this clear, as 
set out in the table below. Overall, Im satisfied that the two documents, the quote and the 
credit agreement, made it clear that it would cost Mr M more than the cash price as he had 
decided to pay for it with an interest-bearing loan.
FIT payments and savings
Mr M has said that he was told his monthly loan repayments would be covered, or self-
funded by the FIT payments and the savings on his energy bills. Ive considered the quote 
that was provided by P as well as Mr Ms recollections of his meeting with Ps representative 
to decide what is most likely to have been said.
The system analysis page of the quote sets out the estimated income Mr M could expect to 
receive by way of FIT payments from the system. This is split out into the expected FIT 
payments in the first year and the expected average income over 20 years. The FIT scheme 
only provides payments for a 20-year period.
The first of these tables states that Mr M could expect to receive a total FIT income in year 
one of £240.16. The quote then goes on to look at the electricity savings Mr M could expect 
from the system. The expected year one electricity savings is £411.52 and, when taking into 
account the optional extras chosen by Mr M, the combined income and savings in year one 
is shown as £1,043.36. This is shown in a table titled Putting it all together.
Theres another section headed Repayments with three tables showing repayments over 
60 months, 120 months and 180 months. Ive focused on the table for 180 months as this is 
the length of the loan that Mr M entered into with Shawbrook. This table shows the loan as 
repayable in 180 monthly payments of £90.77. (This is incorrect; the loan agreement gives 
the correct monthly figure of £92.27, but the difference  £1.50  is too small to affect the 
following observations.) For each year of the 15 year loan it shows the expected grand total 
return from the system. It then averages that figure over 12 months, and subtracts the 
monthly loan repayment of £90.77, to give an average difference between the monthly return 
from the system and the monthly loan repayment in each year.
This calculation gives a positive figure for every year of the loan except the first, which is 
negative, meaning that the system would make enough money to cover the loan payments 
in the second and subsequent years. The shortfall in the first year is only £3.82 a month. If 
the correct repayment figure of £92.27 had been used, the correct shortfall of £5.32 a month 
would have been shown; over the first year this amounts to a shortfall of about £63. In the 
second year, the system would still have provided enough money to cover the loan 
payments.
I am therefore satisfied that Mr M was told that the system would pay for the monthly loan 
repayments, except for a very modest shortfall in the first year.Self-funding
Ill now consider whether Mr M was told that the system would be self-funding in terms of 
paying for its total cost.
The Key Facts page of the quote has a graph detailing the estimated performance over 30 
years. This shows that it would take 7 years for the overall benefits that Mr M could expect to 
receive to match the cash price of the system.
A later page of the quote has a table detailing the estimated performance of the system over 
30 years. This also shows that during year 7 the overall benefits that Mr M could expect to 
receive would reach the cash price of the system.
(The same table also shows that the total amount payable under the loan agreement, 
£16,608, would be reached by the end of year 12, although that amount is not shown in the 
quote but only in the loan agreement.)
As Ive set out above, Im satisfied that P told Mr M that the system would pay for its cash 
price in 7 years, and for the loan in about 12 years, as supported by the graph and the table 
above, which were included in the quote. If that were an untrue statement of fact, and Im 
satisfied that this was what induced him to enter into the contract, and he subsequently 
suffered a loss, then that could amount to a misrepresentation.
The CMC says it is untrue, because it will actually take 18 years for the system to pay for 
itself. So Ive gone on to consider the performance of the system and whether this is in line 
with the contract between P and Mr M.
Performance
The MCS certificate and quote set out that the system is expected to produce 3,524 kWh a 
year. I have looked at Mr Ms FIT statements and can see that his system, on average, has 
generated 3,319 kWh a year. This is slightly less than estimated by P at the point of sale, so 
Im satisfied that the system is performing as expected, in terms of energy generation, if not 
financially. So the reason Mr M has not seen the expected financial returns is not because 
the system is defective, but for some other cause.
I have also looked at the assumptions used by P, including the self-consumption rate, 
expected annual increase in utility prices (EPR) and expected annual RPI inflation increase. 
I am satisfied that Ps method for calculating these is fair and reasonable.
P used Office of National Statistics (ONS) data between 2006 and 2015 to calculate the 
utility price and RPI inflation. I have looked at the actual yearly increases between 2016 and 
2020, and the increases have been lower than predicted by P at the point of sale, and I think 
this explains why Mr M hasnt been receiving the financial returns he may have been 
expecting from the solar panels. Since actual energy prices have been lower than the 
modelling predicted, the savings achieved through the energy generated by the system have 
been correspondingly lower.
As I have explained, the assumptions used by P were based on the information available 
from the ONS at the time. And based on this, I dont consider it unreasonable for P to have 
used them as the basis for calculating the potential financial income Mr M could have 
expected to receive from the system. So, whilst I can appreciate that the returns may not 
have been as high as estimated at the point of sale, Im not persuaded that this was due to 
unreasonable assumptions being used by P at the time Mr M entered into the contract.
The inverter
I dont think it is likely that the salesman would have told Mrs J that the system would require 
no maintenance over its estimated lifespan of 25 years. It is possible that the salesman did 
not tell her during the meeting that the inverter would need to be replaced, but that is not the 
same thing as a misrepresentation.
I also note that the quote says, in a section titled Inverter:
The Inverter is the one part of PV system that has a higher chance of failure and may require 
your attention within the 25 years.
So I dont uphold this complaint point.
Summary
Having carefully considered the evidence provided by all parties in this complaint, Im
satisfied that there were no untrue statements of fact made by P that induced Mr M to enter 
into the contract for the system, and I have found no other reason to uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2022.
