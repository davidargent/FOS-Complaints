Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Js complaint in part and thought the loans from loan 2 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Mr Lender  didnt  agree,  and instead made an offer to Mr J 
regarding loans 6-8. 
Mr J didnt accept Mr Lenders  offer so the complaint has been  passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to make a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr J 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN09950112the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because The Office of Fair Trading  and the FCAs Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate Mr 
Lender needed to do more when  it approved  loan 1. This was the first time Mr J had 
approached Mr Lender for a loan and the repayment  would have seemed affordable based 
on what Mr J had told it. So I dont think Mr Lender was wrong to give this loan to Mr J.
However I dont think Mr Lender carried out proportionate checks  for loan 2. I say this 
because the amount he had asked for had leapt up to over double the amount of his first 
loan. And the amount he had to repay  for this loan was for a significant amount  compared to 
his declared income.  So I think  Mr Lender should  have, at this point carried  out a complete 
review of Mr Js finances. 
Had Mr Lender done  so, I think it would most likely have  made  a different lending decision 
about this loan and for all of the loans  took out by Mr J going forward.  I say this because Mr 
Lender would have seen with better checks that there were clear  signs  that Mr J was 
struggling to manage  his money. At the same  time as applying for loan 2, Mr J had taken out 
short-term high cost credit  from three other  lenders. So it was most  likely he was just 
borrowing to pay off other loans. And there  were  frequent gambling transactions on bank 
statements that Mr J has provided to our service  further indicating it was likely he had wider  
financial problems. 
It follows that I dont think Mr Lender  should  have given  loan 2 and every loan agreed after 
this point to Mr J.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of Mr Lenders  lending history with Mr J, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender  should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Mr Lender should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Ref: DRN09950113Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached at loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point Mr Lender  ought  to have realised  Mr J was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr J had taken  out seven loans within 7 months. I think  it was 
more likely than not Mr J had to borrow further  to cover  the hole repaying his 
previous loan(s) was leaving in his finances and that Mr Js indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr J wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Mr Lender.  Mr Lender 
ought to have known that Mr J was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall 
in his income but to meet an ongoing  need.  Mr J had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect; service  a debt to Mr Lender over an extended period.
I think this pattern of lending should have alerted Mr Lender to the likelihood  that Mr J 
was having problems managing his money. I think that Mr Lender shouldve  been 
concerned that Mr J might  be borrowing elsewhere to repay its loans, again 
increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Mr J lost out because Mr Lender continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
The number of loans  was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Js ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Js complaint from loans 2 onwards  and because  of this, Mr Lender 
should put things right. 
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 2 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 2 to 6 from Mr Js credit file
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse, so all entries about  loans 7 and 8 should be removed from Mr 
Js credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest.  Mr Lender must  give 
Mr J a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN09950114my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Js complaint. PDL Finance  Limited  
(trading as Mr Lender) should pay Mr J compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 January 2020.
