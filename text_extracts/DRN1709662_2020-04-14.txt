Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ls complaint  about  loans 7 onwards and felt these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr L could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN17096622the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr L, with a view to seeing  if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because at this point Sunny ought  to have realised  Mr L was not managing  
to repay  his loans  sustainably.  Mr L had taken out six loans within nine months  and even 
though he paid off all these loans early,  Mr L was in debt almost  every month throughout this 
period. Often  taking  out new a loan shortly after paying off an earlier loan. I have identified 
some gaps in the lending  - between paying off loan 5 and taking out loan 6 and between 
paying off loan 6 and taking out loan 7  but I dont  think these gaps are significant  enough  
to break  the chain  of lending. 
I also dont think Mr L was making any real inroad to the amount he owed Sunny,  his first 
loan was for £250 and loan 7 was for £400.  The amounts borrowed fluctuated during Mr Ls 
lending history, but later in the lending chain, certainly after loan 7, Mr L was borrowing more  
regularly, and this borrowing  continued to range between £200 and £400. So, it seemed he 
was reliant on this type of borrowing and his financial  situation  was not improving. 
I think by loan 7 Sunny ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Mr L was becoming  
reliant short time lending and having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances.  It also shouldve realised that Mr Ls indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably and that he was paying large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, 
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
I think that Mr L lost out because Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
Ref: DRN17096623these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr L borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 7 onwards and Sunny should put things right as 
set out below.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 7 - 29;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  7 - 29 should be removed from 
Mr Ls credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as outlined above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 May 2020.
