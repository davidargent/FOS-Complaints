The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc provided misleading information about 
their Student Bank Account on their website. He is also unhappy with the service he 
received. 
What happened
The detailed background to this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide 
a very brief overview here. In summary Mr M opened a student bank account with NatWest 
as he feels their website implied he could have an overdraft facility immediately. He later 
learned that there needed to be a period of account usage before he could apply for an 
overdraft. Mr M complained about this and asked NatWest to close his account. 
NatWest closed the account. They accepted their website couldve been clearer and that 
inconvenience had been caused to Mr M as a result of this and the account opening 
process. So, they sent him a cheque for £140. Mr M initially accepted this. But he says he 
later found he was refused student accounts with a number of other banks. He believes this 
was due to the credit searches NatWest had made. He also says this had a huge impact on 
him. He had no account into which to pay his cheque or student finances. 
NatWest maintained their position and explained that they had asked the Credit Reference 
Agencies (CRAs) to remove the searches they made in relation to Mr Ms account opening. 
The matter was referred to our service and one of our investigators thought NatWest didnt 
need to do anything further. Mr M disagrees and so the complaint has come to me for a 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator and for very similar reasons. Let me explain 
why. 
I cant tell NatWest to change their website. The complaint handler accepted that things 
could have been made clearer and said that feedback would be passed on. So, what Ive 
considered here is the impact of this, as NatWest agreed that Mr M wouldnt have opened 
his account, had he known the full details at the time.  
NatWest followed Mr Ms instructions to close his account. If this left Mr M without a UK bank 
account, I dont think it would be fair to hold NatWest responsible for the consequences of 
this. Mr M said he was unable to open a student account elsewhere and Ive no reason to 
doubt his testimony. But banks will consider a range of factors when making a decision 
about opening an account. There may well have been other reasons why each bank 
declined to open a student account for Mr M. And in any case, Im not persuaded Mr M 
would have been unable to open any kind of bank account. So even though a student account might have been preferable for him, many of the issues he experienced might have 
been mitigated had he opened a basic account (either with NatWest or elsewhere).
Conducting credit checks is also a standard practice when opening a bank account. I think it 
was fair for NatWest to make these checks in the first place. Im not persuaded NatWest 
performed more checks than was necessary in the circumstances. Im also satisfied that 
NatWest promptly sent requests to the CRAs to have the records of any searches theyd 
made removed when Mr M complained. I appreciate Mr M isnt happy with the time it took for 
this to be reflected on the reports, but this isnt something I think NatWest are responsible for 
or could control. And I can see that they chased this for confirmation following our services 
involvement in this complaint. I think that is fair. 
NatWest have accepted that Mr Ms customer journey hadnt gone as smoothly as they 
would have liked. This included Mr M having to make numerous phone calls and go into 
branch on more than one occasion. To make up for this NatWest offered Mr M £140 which 
was intended to compensate him for the costs hed incurred and the trouble and upset hed 
experienced. 
Ive thought carefully about this, and looking at everything as a whole, I think this is a fair 
amount of compensation. I know Mr M has said that he thinks £1,000 would be more 
suitable and that it would be suitably punitive to NatWest. Our role isnt to punish a 
business for making a mistake or errors. And in the circumstances of this complaint, I think 
the £140 already offered is fair, so Im not going to tell NatWest to increase this or that they 
need to do anything further to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 June 2020.
