The complaint
Mr H is unhappy with the way hes been treated by ActiveQuote Limited.  
What happened
The background to this complaint is set out in my provisional decision. In summary, Mr H is 
unhappy because ActiveQuote didnt tell his insurer everything about his medical history. 
The insurer ended up withdrawing cover. This was an income protection policy from which 
hed been receiving regular benefit for several years. The insurer asked Mr H to repay the 
money he owed because he should not have been offered the policy to begin with. 
It also came to light that Mr H had forgotten to share other ailments hed suffered, 
specifically, neck and back pain. And so, I decided that both ActiveQuote and Mr H had 
made errors here. Mr H wanted ActiveQuote to repay the benefit hed received from the 
insurer, but for those reasons, I didnt think that was fair. I recommended ActiveQuote pay 
Mr H £350 for the overall trouble and upset caused by not sharing with the insurer all the 
information he told it.
Mr H accepted this, but ActiveQuote didnt. And so, its for me to make a final decision.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
ActiveQuote hasnt raised any new arguments for me to consider. It stands by its original 
submissions  which I didnt think were persuasive enough in that it hadnt made a mistake. 
The error here was that ActiveQuote didnt tell the insurer about Mr Hs shoulder problems. 
The reason it didnt do this was because the advisor Mr H initially spoke with didnt pick up 
on that point, despite it being raised during the call. 
So, because there were no new arguments for me to consider, my provisional findings still 
stand. ActiveQuote should now pay Mr H £350 compensation for the overall trouble and 
upset caused.   
My final decision
ActiveQuote Limited must now pay Mr h £350 compensation for the overall trouble and upset 
caused.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 May 2021.
