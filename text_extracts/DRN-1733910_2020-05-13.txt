The complaint
Mr J has complained about the way National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) has used 
the compensation it offered to pay him to settle his complaint about the mis-sale of payment 
protection insurance (PPI).
What happened
Mr J took out a credit card with NatWest and also took out PPI alongside it to protect his 
repayments.
In 2010 Mr J entered into an individual voluntary agreement (IVA) as he wasnt able to pay 
all of his debts when they fell due. He was discharged from the IVA in 2015, so he couldnt 
be chased by his creditors for the debts he had listed when he entered into the IVA.
Mr J complained to NatWest that hed been mis-sold PPI and it made an offer to settle his 
complaint. It offered compensation of £5,828.74. But NatWest said Mr J still owed it 
£9,252.53 when he was discharged from his IVA. So it used the compensation to reduce the 
amount of money it said Mr J still owed.
Mr J says that he should have this PPI compensation paid directly to him. He says, as hes 
come out of his IVA, his debts have been written off and he doesnt owe NatWest anything.
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought it was fair for NatWest to use 
the compensation to reduce Mr Js debt. But Mr J didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman 
to look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has agreed to work out this compensation in the same way as if Id found it had 
mis-sold PPI, so I dont need to look at how PPI came to be sold to Mr J. But I do need to 
consider whether NatWest offer is fair.
I think the offer is fair and Id like to explain why.
Id expect that when a business has mis-sold PPI, it puts things right by putting the 
consumer as far as possible in the position they wouldve been in if they hadnt taken out the 
PPI. Id expect a business to remove from the credit card account the charges for PPI, any 
interest paid on the charges and any further charges caused by the PPI.
If, when these PPI costs are taken off, someone paid more than they needed to clear their 
balance Id expect a business to pay interest on the extra amount for the time they are out of 
pocket at the rate of 8% a year simple interest.
NatWest has worked out that, if Mr J didnt owe anything, hed get back £5,828.74. This is 
made up of £3,413.06 for the PPI premiums that were added to the account and £1,238.67 in interest caused by those premiums being on the account. Also, a further £305.13 is 
included for charges that were caused by the PPI and interest caused on the account by 
those charges. 
At times when Mr J cleared his balance, which occurred on occasions prior to April 2006, as 
I indicated above, he should get 8% simple interest on amounts he was out of pocket. 
NatWest has worked out this compensatory interest as £871.88 after income tax has been 
deducted and paid to HM Revenue and Customs. 
Mr J isnt saying the amount offered is wrong, so I now need to consider whether NatWest 
can use the compensation to reduce the debt it says he still owes.
We usually say a business can use a consumers compensation to reduce their debts if the 
debt is on the account that PPI was sold alongside. Here I can see that the PPI was sold 
with the same account that went into arrears, so I think NatWest can use the compensation 
to reduce the debt.
Mr J has said that he settled his debt with NatWest as part of his IVA in 2015 and it accepted 
a partial payment in full and final settlement. Ive seen that NatWest was paid just over 
£2,000 during Mr Js IVA, but this still left a balance outstanding. So I dont think Mr J fully 
paid off his debts during his IVA.
When Mr J entered into an IVA, the debts he owed werent cancelled. And they werent 
cancelled when he was discharged in 2015  but by law he couldnt be chased for the debts. 
The debt he has with NatWest still exists and some of it is for PPI premiums (and interest) 
that Mr J never paid, as he borrowed this money on his credit card. So I think its fair for 
NatWest to use the compensation to reduce his debts, otherwise hed be getting a refund of 
PPI premiums (and interest) he didnt actually pay in the first place.
Ive also thought about when Mr J had PPI  it was before he entered into the IVA. But at 
that point he shouldnt have had PPI in his card account balance, so he wouldve owed 
NatWest something, but it wouldve been less. 
NatWest has to put Mr J in the position he wouldve been in if hed never had the PPI on his 
account. He owed over £11,000 in total when he entered into his IVA, so the PPI was only 
responsible for part of his debt on the credit card. I think its fair to assume Mr J wouldve still 
entered his IVA if he hadnt had the PPI. So I think he wouldve entered into the IVA with a 
smaller debt and, at the end, NatWest couldnt chase him for this smaller debt.
This is the position NatWest has put Mr J in now by removing the PPI. And after that is done 
the debt remaining unpaid is for £3,410.42.
Mr J has indicated that NatWest cannot come after him for money he owed once the IVA 
was completed. And that is correct in that NatWest cannot proactively take action against 
Mr J for any money that remained unpaid on completion of the IVA. 
But here NatWest hasnt actively taken any action against Mr J. It has used the PPI 
compensation it owed him to set off against a debt that is dormant but that he owed the 
business. Both debts relate to the same account and part of the debt Mr J owed to NatWest 
was for PPI he never actually paid. So it is fair to set one debt against the other in these 
circumstances.
Mr J has also raised issues about the PPI causing interest and charges. But as I have 
explained earlier all charges and interest caused directly by the PPI being in his credit card 
balance are included in the calculation and being refunded.In his submissions to this service Mr J suggests that he paid NatWest £5,828.74 for the PPI. 
But as Ive explained that is not the case. He only actually ever paid back to NatWest a small 
amount of the cost of the PPI premiums and interest. The rest of the PPI cost remained in 
the balance of the account and formed part of his unpaid debt.
Taking all these factors into account I think what NatWest has done with the compensation is 
fair.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above I think National Westminster Bank Plcs offer is fair and what it 
has done with the compensation is also fair so I dont direct it to do anything further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 June 2020.
