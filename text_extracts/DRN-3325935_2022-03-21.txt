The complaint
Mr C complains that the fee waiver on a Platinum Account (PA) which he has held since 
2004 has been removed by Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds).
What happened
The details of this case are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again here. 
The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C has not been paying a fee for the benefits of his PA for many years as he has kept his 
account balance above the level set by Lloyds for the fee to be waived. 
I can see that Mr C is very disappointed and not happy that after so many years Lloyds has 
removed the fee waiver. Mr C feels that he had an agreement with Lloyds, and it has broken 
that agreement.
Ive considered this matter very carefully, and I can understand the argument he makes 
when in his last letter he compared his agreement with Lloyds to one within his own family.
However, Ive looked at the agreement Mr C has had with Lloyds since 2004 and it does 
provide for either party to change or terminate the agreement.
So, in my view Lloyds was entitled to change the agreement for commercial reasons if it 
provided Mr C with appropriate notice and gave him the option of downgrading or closing the 
account.
And I think Lloyds did. I say this because it sent Mr C a letter notifying him of the change two 
months in advance and the letter clearly provides the options I referred to above.
So, although I know Mr C will be disappointed with my response, in my view, Lloyds hasnt 
done anything wrong in this matter.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 April 2022.
