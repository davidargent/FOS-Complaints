K821x#15Complaint
Mrs M complains Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to her 
irresponsibly.

some of the information  weve  received  from Sunny about these loans  in the table  below.

16 £350 04/11/2017 18/01/2018*
* the repayment dates for loans 15 and 16 reflect the date Sunny sold the outstanding 
balances to a third party. 
In our latest  assessment an adjudicator didnt think Sunny was wrong to have  granted the 
first three instalment loans. But he thought the remaining instalment loans (loans 4 to 16) 
shouldnt have been given. 
Mrs M appears  to agree with the latest adjudicators view. Sunny hasnt responded. But, 
Sunny has accepted that something may have  gone  wrong  when it provided loans 6 to 16. 
So, in line with the adjudicators recommendation, it agreed to calculate whether any refund 
of interest would be payable for these loans and to update Mrs Ms credit file. 
Sunny said that no refund  would be payable  because the outstanding principal for loans 15 
and 16 exceeded  the interest  due on loans 6 to 14. Mrs M disagreed.  She said that her 
outstanding balances with Sunny had been cleared  through her Debt Relief  Order (DRO).  
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed  to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ref: DRN40592172Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mrs M doesnt  appear to disagree with our adjudicators findings that Sunny wasnt wrong to 
lend the first three  loans. It seems therefore  that this lending isnt in dispute and so I no 
longer think that I need to make a finding about it. 
Ive also not considered whether Sunny should  have lent loans 6 to 16 as it has already 
agreed it shouldnt.  So instead, this decision will focus on whether Sunny did anything wrong 
when it lent loans 4 and 5 as well as what I think Sunny should do to put things right,  taking 
into account, the impact  of Mrs Ms DRO. 
For the lending  that remains in dispute, Sunny had to assess  it to check if Mrs M could afford 
to pay back the amounts  hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way 
which was proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could have  taken into 
account a number of different things, such as how much  was being lent, the size of the 
repayments and Mrs Ms income  and expenditure. With this in mind, I think in the early 
stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mrs M. These  factors include:
Mrs M having a low income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet  a higher repayment from a particular  level of income);  
Mrs M having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting  the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mrs M coming  back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mrs M.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mrs M could  sustainably repay his instalment loans 
 not just whether he technically had enough money  to make his repayments. Having 
enough money to make  the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mrs M was able 
to repay  his loans  sustainably.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. The 
Financial Conduct  Authoritys (the industry  regulatory)  says in the Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC) states payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and in particular, made  on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and 
without having  to borrow to make  them.  If a lender realises, or ought reasonably  to have 
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, 
then it follows that it should  conclude those  repayments are unsustainable.
Ref: DRN40592173Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mrs Ms complaint.
loans 4 and 5
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 4 would most likely  have shown  
Sunny that: 
Mrs M had an outstanding short-term loan with another lender that needed to be 
repaid; 
the first three loans  were still running  and the highest repayment that Mrs M needed 
to make was around three times that when loan 1 was taken and
Mrs M was making payments to a debt collection  agency.
In my view, given these  circumstances, there  was a significant risk that Mrs M wouldnt have 
been able to repay this loan without undue difficulty or borrowing  further.  I also dont think 
that Sunny could  reasonably have  believed that Mrs M would be able to make  the 
repayments over the term of the loan considering that she had several loans running 
concurrently. This presented a significant  risk that Mrs M wouldnt be able to repay this loan,  
or any later loans without  undue difficulty.
what should Sunny do to put things right for loans 4 to 16?  
As Ive explained, Sunny  has agreed that loans 6 to 16 shouldnt have been  lent for the 
reasons explained by the adjudicator. So, it has offered to refund the interest on loans 6 to 
14 (the loans where Mrs M paid more than the principal) together with 8% simple interest. 
Sunny says Mrs M didnt  pay more  than the principal  for loans 15 and 16 so no refund of 
interest is due for those  loans. Sunny has also said that the refund of interest for loans 6 to 
14 is less than the outstanding principal for loans 15 and 16. And therefore  overall  no 
payment would be due to Mrs M as it is fair to offset outstanding principal against the refund 
for loans  6 to 14. To be clear, Sunny also needs  to refund the interest  on loans 4 and 5 as 
Ive found these shouldnt have been lent.
Mrs M has said that she cleared all her outstanding balances with Sunny through her DRO. 
Based on the information provided to us by Sunny, Mrs M appears  to have paid at least 
£171.27 to Sunny towards repayment of loan 15 (£600) and nothing towards loan 16 (£350). 
Sunny then sold the outstanding balances to a third party  in January 2018. It isnt clear  
whether further  repayments were then made to the third party. 
I understand Mrs M was then approved for a DRO on 13 February 2019 which  appears  to 
have included qualifying  debts in connection with loans 15 and 16. The DRO appears to 
have concluded  successfully on 13 February  2020   at which point any debts included  within  
the DRO are written off. What this means is that there is no longer an outstanding debt for 
Mrs M to pay in connection with loans  15 and 16. However, it doesnt mean that Mrs M 
actually paid all the principal for these loans. 
And when  thinking  about  what Sunny has to do to put things right, we have to consider what 
is fair and reasonable. So, I think its fair that Sunny can recover any principal  written  off for 
loans 15 and 16 after the debt was sold in January  2018 when  calculating  whether any 
Ref: DRN40592174refund is due to Mrs M (with the refund  now including loans 4 and 5). For it to do this it may 
need to liaise with the third party who purchased  the debt. 
As I agree with the adjudicator that loans 4 and 5 shouldnt  have been lent, Sunny should 
also remove any adverse  information about these loans from the credit file. This is in 
addition to removing  adverse information about  loans 6 to 12 and any information about 
loans 13 to 16 which Sunny has already agreed  to do in line with the adjudicators  
recommendation.  
Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mrs M paid on loans  4 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
I understand that as a result of the DRO, there is currently  no outstanding balance 
due for loans 15 and 16. But, we consider it fair and reasonable that Sunny can 
recover any principal that was written off. So it should  treat all repayments made by 
Mrs M (to both Sunny and the third party) as if they went towards the principal sum 
for these loans. 
If Mrs M had already paid enough to both Sunny and the third party to have repaid 
the principal she borrowed then any overpayment should be refunded  to Mrs M. To 
this overpayment 8% simple interest a year should be added from the date of the 
overpayment became due to the date of settlement*;
If however, after doing  the above, there wouldve still been an outstanding  principal  
balance due for loans 15 and 16 then Sunny can use the refund due for loans 4 to 14 
to offset this sum. And then any surplus  paid to Mrs M. 
If however, the refund is not enough  to offset  the outstanding balance,  then as a 
result of the DRO Sunny is not in a position  to recover any remaining balance. 
remove any negative information  from Mrs Ms credit file about loans 4 to 12;
the number  of loans taken from 13 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  loans  13 to 16 should be removed from 
Mrs Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mrs M a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN40592175My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mrs Ms complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mrs M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 July 2020.
