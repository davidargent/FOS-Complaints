The complaint
Mr M complains that Bank of Ireland (UK) plc wont reimburse him for the cost of some 
repairs to his car.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr M used his Bank of Ireland credit card in December 2017 to pay £1,000 towards 
the cost of a car  he says that the car cost £29,000 (he paid the other £28,000 by 
other means), had been driven for about 9,000 miles and had four years and two 
months remaining on the original five year manufacturers warranty;
he had some issues with the car in October 2018 and it was serviced in November 
2018 when its mileage was 20,085, for which he paid £290.84, and a possible battery 
issue was identified but he says that it was a mis-diagnosis;
he says that the car started going into limp mode in December 2019 and it was 
serviced later that month when its mileage was 38,073 but that it was still going into 
limp mode and the engine management warning light came on so he took the car to 
another garage and paid it £583.80 for some repairs and that the car was then 
working fine;
he claimed a refund from Bank of Ireland under section 75 of the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974 of the £583.80 that hed paid for the repairs - but he wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service;
our investigator didn't think that there had been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the seller of the car, she said that Bank of Ireland was unable to 
consider the actions of the servicing garage because it had no connection with it and 
she didnt consider that Bank of Ireland had provided poor service to Mr M  so she 
couldnt say that Bank of Ireland should refund any of the payment that Mr M had 
made for the repairs;
Mr M says that there was a component failure within six years which is proved by the 
report from the garage that he paid for the repairs and the repair should have been 
covered by the warranty which is a breach of contract;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ms complaint about Bank of Ireland, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the seller of the car and 
that Bank of Irelands response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or 
reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ms claim under section 75 
as only a court would be able to do that;
the breach of contract for which Mr M would be able to claim in these circumstances 
is that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was sold to him  Ive not seen 
the sale documents but Mr M says that the car had been driven for 9,000 miles at 
that time and he was able to drive it for about ten months without reporting any 
issues with it - and when it was serviced in November 2018 he says that its mileage 
was 20,085 so hed been able to drive about 11,000 miles in it;
he was then able to drive the car for more than a year before the further issues to 
which hes referred and he says that the cars mileage was then 38,073  so in two 
years hed been able to drive the car for about 29,000 miles;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that there were any faults 
with the car when it was sold to Mr M or that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality at 
that time;
Mr M says that the repairs should have been covered under the cars warranty  but 
the warranty was provided by the manufacturer (not by the seller of the car) and Ive 
not seen enough evidence to persuade me that theres been a breach of the warranty 
 but, even if there had been, that wouldnt be something for which the seller of the 
car would be responsible;
Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
seller of the car - and I dont consider that Bank of Irelands response to his claim 
under section 75 has been unfair or unreasonable in the circumstances or that the 
service that its provided to Mr M has fallen below the standard of service that I 
consider that it was reasonable for him to expect; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Bank of Ireland to refund to Mr M the £583.80 that hes claimed, to pay him any other 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2021.
