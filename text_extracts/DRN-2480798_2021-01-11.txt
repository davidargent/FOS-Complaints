The complaint
Miss W says PDL Finance Limited  trading as Mr Lender - irresponsibly lent to her.
 
What happened
This complaint is about eight instalment loans Mr Lender provided to Miss W between 
August 2015 and December 2017. Miss Ws borrowing history is as follows:
Mr Lender upheld Miss Ws complaint about loans 5 and 6 and made an offer in line with our 
approach on these two loans. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ws complaint and thought along with loans 5 and 6, 
Miss W shouldnt have been given loan 4 because proportionate checks would have shown 
Miss W was struggling to manage her money. But the adjudicator didnt uphold Miss Ws 
complaint about loans 7 and 8 because they believed a new chain of borrowing had started 
due to the gap of seven months between loans 6 and 7. 
Mr Lender disagreed because it said it carried out the appropriate level of checks. 
Miss W responded and said all the other lenders shed borrowed from had upheld her 
complaints in full. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it was passed to me for a final decision. I 
issued my provisional decision in December 2020. In summary I said:
I agreed with the adjudicators assessment on loans 1 to 4. That being I didnt uphold 
Miss Ws complaint about loans 1 to 3 but I did uphold the complaint about loan 4. 
I considered that the offer Mr Lender had made in relation to loans 5 and 6 was in 
line with our approach so I didnt think it needed to do any more than it had.
I explained that given the length of time Miss W had been a customer of Mr Lender, I 
didnt consider the gap of 7 months between loans 6 and 7 to be a significant one so 
I also upheld Miss Ws complaint about loans 7 and 8. 
I asked everyone to provide anything further they wanted me to consider before I issued my 
final decision. Both parties replied. Miss W accepted the provisional decision. Mr Lender 
responded with further points about loans 4, 7 and 8. The main points were that Miss W had

What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed everything again, my decision remains the same  I am upholding Miss Ws 
complaint about loans 4 to 8. Ill explain why.
Overall, although Mr Lender responded with a number of points, it didnt provide any new 
information for me to consider. But I have noted its comments about the fact Miss W didnt 
provide all the information about her outgoings when she was asked during her application 
for loan 4. However, as I explained in my provisional decision, I think at the point in the 
lending relationship Miss W was at with loan 4, Mr Lender ought to have been looking to 
build a clearer picture about what she was telling it.  So, the fact Miss W didnt give an 
accurate reflection would have been highlighted to Mr Lender had it done proportionate 
checks. 
I appreciate Mr Lender considers the seven-month gap in the borrowing chain a significant 
one. But having thought about this I cant agree. When deciding whether there is a gap or 
not, we dont just consider this purely on the length of time, we also take into consideration 
other factors. As explained in my provisional decision, I think the time she had been a 
customer of Mr Lender, plus the fact her financial circumstances were the same at loan 7 as 
they were at loan 6 and she was asking to borrow the exact same amount, was enough for 
me not to consider the gap to be a significant one. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Mr Lender should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it stopped lending to Miss W from loan 4, as Im satisfied it ought 
to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Miss W may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Miss W in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Miss W would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Mr Lenders liability in this case for what 
Im satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.As such, Mr Lender should do the following:
refund all interest and charges Miss W paid on loans 4, 7 and 8 (and loans 5 and 6 if 
it hasnt done so already);
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 to 8 from Miss Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender must give Miss W a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
I partially uphold Miss Ws complaint.  PDL Finance Limited should put things right as set out 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 February 2021.
