K822xcomplaint
S, a charity,  is complaining that Barclays Bank UK PLC has incorrectly  calculated  a Loyalty 
Reward discount on its charges.
background 
In September  2018, Barclays wrote to S to explain it was changing the charitys Community  
Account tariff from free banking to one of its standard  price  plans  from November 2018.  It 
said the change  was being  made as Ss annual debit turnover was more  than £100,000.
S complained to Barclays. It said it had been  a customer of the bank since 1984 and had 
always had free banking. It said it had never been  told that there was a limit on turnover to 
receive free banking  and would have operated its accounts differently had it been aware. 
That complaint has been dealt with separately, but I felt it was useful  to include this 
information as context for the complaint to be considered here. 
Barclays offers a Loyalty  Reward under which it discounts charges depending on the annual 
credit turnover and the length of time the account  has been open   Barclays  calls this 
tenure. Ss account with Barclays has been open  more than 15 years   so it falls into the 
highest bracket for the Loyalty  Reward  in terms of tenure. For accounts  in that bracket  where 
the annual credit turnover is between £100,000 and £249,999.99, Barclays  reduces its 
charges by 20%. For accounts with an annual  credit turnover of £250,000 to £499,999.99, 
the reduction is 25%. 
When dealing with follow up correspondence  from Ss first complaint about charges, 
Barclays said on 29 October 2018, that as Ss turnover has increased, your Loyalty Reward 
has also increased from 20%-25%, so you will essentially receive 25% discount on all 
charges ongoing. S has complained that when charges were levied, a discount  of only 20% 
was applied. 
Barclays responded to this complaint  on 14 January 2019 saying that the 20% discount was 
correct because Ss turnover amounted to approximately  £246,000 for 2018 compared to 
£309,000 for 2017. In order to receive  the 25% discount, Ss turnover would have needed to 
be £250,000 or more.  Barclays  said the discount  applied was correct. 
S didnt  agree and referred its complaint  to us. One of our adjudicators looked into it. She 
said the terms of the Loyalty Reward say that the bank will calculate  the tenure  and annual  
credit turnover at the end of each charging  period  which  may result  in a change in 
percentage applied without notice.  She said Barclays had provided a screen shot which  
showed Ss credit turnover to December 2018 was £246,000  down from £309,785 the 
previous year. Therefore,  she said, S didnt reach £250,000 annual credit turnover to receive  
the 25% discount. She felt the email from Barclays explaining S would get a 25% discount 
was based on the turnover it had seen at the time.  
As part of this complaint, S had raised  a concern  about charges levied for the provision of 
statements. Im pleased  to say that point has been  resolved  so Ill not comment further on 
that. But S didnt  accept  our adjudicators conclusion regarding the Loyalty Reward  discount,  
so that the complaint has been  passed to me for a final decision.

Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having considered  all that S and Barclays  
have provided, I have reached the same conclusion  as our adjudicator and for the same 
reasons.
Ss treasurer  has said hed like to speak  to me about the complaint. But I dont think  this will 
assist me in reaching  my decision as I already have enough information available from the 
parties to allow  me to do so. S has provided detailed evidence  and submissions to support 
its complaint.
The terms around the Loyalty Reward are clear about the amount of discount applicable 
depending on the tenure  and annual credit turnover  of the account.  S had been a customer 
for more than 15 years so was entitled  to the highest  level of discount available  for tenure. In 
2017, its turnover  had been  between  £250,000  and £400,000, so it would have been entitled  
for a discount of 25% had charges been applied at that time. 
But the bank only decided to implement its charging  tariff towards  the end of 2018  (although  
it had been part of its terms and conditions for some time). In October 2018, when Barclays 
said Ss turnover would entitle it to a 25% discount, it appeared likely that the turnover would  
again exceed £250,000.  But in fact the annual credit turnover fell just short of that at 
£246,000, so I cant reasonably say it was wrong of Barclays to only allow  a 20% discount.  
That is, after all, the terms on which Barclays  offers  a discount. 
While I have a great  deal of empathy for S in that it is a charity  which  provides an excellent 
service to its community and enjoyed free banking for many years, it is for Barclays  to 
determine the basis on which it wishes to provide its service. I cant  reasonably say that 
Barclays must refund charges or allow a further  discount than the terms for the account  
allow. In any event,  S has told me it has now transferred its accounts to another  bank which  
will allow it free banking.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Ss complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 July 2019.
