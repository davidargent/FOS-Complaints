K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs G complain that Bank  of Scotland  Plc (trading as Halifax) recorded an incorrect 
mortgage balance  and start date on their online account.
background
In 2008, Mr and Mrs G took out a repayment mortgage with Halifax of £265,000  plus fees 
over a term of 18 years. 
In 2009, Mr and Mrs G took out additional borrowing on an interest only basis  with Halifax  of 
£78,000 plus fees over a term of 17 years.
Mr and Mrs G said that their online  account shows confusing and incorrect  information  about 
her mortgage. She said that the starting balance showing online was £263,690, not 
£265,000 as Halifax said or £256,000 as Mrs G remembers.  
Mr and Mrs G said that the online account  shows staring balance of the interest only element 
as £64,688 when both they and Halifax said this part of the balance was £78,000. They also 
said that the start date of that part of the loan should be 13 February 2009, not 1 March 2009  
as recorded online.
Mr and Mrs G said that Halifax told them that the incorrect information was due to a system 
change in 2013  yet they say that they have  a print out from 2015/16  showing different  
information.
The investigator didnt  think the complaint should  be upheld.
Mr and Mrs G didnt accept what the investigator  said. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There has been a lot of confusion around Mr and Mrs Gs mortgage over a number of years. 
I wont be revisiting any previous complaint or any other matters that may have come up 
during the course of this complaint. Im only looking at the complaint Mr and Mrs G have 
brought here  that is Halifax has recorded  incorrect information about  their mortgage online.
I understand that in March/April 2018 following a previous  complaint, Halifax  carried out a 
reconstruction of Mr and Mrs Gs mortgage. I dont think  the fact that Mr and Mrs G have 
evidence from before 2018 showing  that the account  operated  differently means the account 
isnt operating correctly  now. Any information  from before March 2018 will show the previous  
position of the account  before it was reconstructed.  So I dont think any evidence  that Mr and 
Mrs G have from before 2018 is going to help their complaint. 
Ive looked carefully  at the information  presented  by both Mr and Mrs G and Halifax. In view 
of everything that has happened I can understand why Mr and Mrs G might not accept that 
the mortgage is operating as it should be. But after considering what we have,  I am not 
persuaded that there has been a mistake by Halifax  here.  
Ref: DRN55633872Halifax has provided evidence to show that it has calculated the main mortgage  based on a 
starting balance of £265,000. It has also shown that the starting balance of the additional 
interest only borrowing  was £78,000.  I havent  been given any evidence  to show  that the 
way Halifax reconstructed the account  in 2018 or allocated payments was wrong. 
Further, I dont consider the evidence we have shows that there was an additional balance of 
around £64,000 that Halifax  has mistakenly  added to Mr and Mrs Gs mortgage.  The 
evidence we have  shows that at some  point the £78,000 additional borrowing was split into 
two sub accounts.  And I cant  see that has caused  Mr and Mrs G any financial loss. 
In addition to the reconstruction  in 2018, there was a further adjustment  to the mortgage in 
2019. So although statements issued before that will show the account  looking different, it 
doesnt follow there has been  a mistake.
Overall, Halifax  has provided detailed breakdowns of the main mortgage and additional 
borrowing. I havent been shown 
In regard to the star date of the additional  borrowing, the print out from 2019 shows it as 1 
March 2009. That is in line with the evidence Halifax has provided to show  when interest  
was applied to the additional  borrowing.  Although  the offer is dated 13 February 2009, it 
does not follow that is the date the mortgage  completed on that date. In my experience it 
would be unusual to do so. In any event, I cant see that has caused Mr and Mrs G a 
financial loss.
While I understand Mr and Mrs G want reassurance that their mortgage is in order, I dont 
consider the evidence we have supports there  has been an error by Halifax  or that it has 
treated them  unfairly or unreasonably.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs G to 
accept or reject my decision  before  19 August 2021.
