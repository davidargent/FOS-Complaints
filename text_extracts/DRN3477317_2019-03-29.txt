K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that MEM Consumer  Finance  Limited (trading  as Payday UK) gave him 
loans that he couldnt afford to repay.
background
Mr M took out four short term loans with Payday UK. These  are:
Loan Date amount repayment Repayment date
1 14 May 2013 £100 £129.95 13 June 2013
2 14 June 2013 £160 £207.92 18 July 2013
3 25 July 2013 £200 £259.90 22 August 2013
4 22 August 2013 £500 £649.75 10 May 2018
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Ms complaint be not upheld.  He said in his view that 
Payday UK should have carried out a full review of all of Mr Ms loans. He drew  this 
conclusion because although he wasnt able to see the credit check results he felt it was 
more likely than not that Payday UK would have seen Mr Ms short term lending, that he has 
seen on a recent credit check. 
Our adjudicator also concluded that even  though  Payday  UK should have carried  out these 
further checks, he couldnt  tell what it would have found as Mr M hasnt been able to provide 
any bank statements from the time.  So he couldnt  safely conclude  that the loans were 
unaffordable.
I issued a provisional decision in this complaint on 22 February 2019 also not upholding     
Mr Ms complaint. Within the decision I made  the following findings:
I thought Payday UK had carried out proportionate checks for loans 1-3 based  on the 
monthly repayment of the loans and what Mr M had declared to them about his income 
and expenditure.
I then went on to say Payday UK didnt  carry out sufficient checks for loan 4, but I hadnt  
been able to conclude whether proportionate  checks would have  found  that Mr M 
couldnt afford  to repay it. This is because Mr M was unable  to supply any further  
information about his finances  at the time loan 4 was granted.
 I didnt uphold  Mr Ms complaint  and didnt require Payday UK to do anything.
Both parties  have been sent my provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Payday UK confirmed  on 27 February 2019 that it had received the provisional decision and 
said it had nothing further to add.
Mr M has not responded to my provisional decision.
Ref: DRN34773172As I have not received any further comments, I dont  need to depart from my findings. So I 
do not uphold  Mr Ms complaint.
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 April 2019.
