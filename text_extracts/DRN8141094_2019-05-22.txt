K820x#14complaint
Ms O complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wrongly  declined  to give her a 
mortgage due to errors made by its surveyor. And she says that it should return the valuation  
fees she paid.
background
Ms O applied for a mortgage with NatWest. And NatWest commissioned a valuation  of the 
property. But the valuer's report stated that the property was not suitable security  because of 
the construction type. So NatWest declined to mortgage the property.
Ms O complained to NatWest. She said that the information on the valuation  report was 
incorrect. But NatWest didn't uphold her complaint.  It said, in summary:
There is always a risk that a valuation  will reveal something untoward  which  means that 
either the customer or lender might not want to go ahead  with the purchase;
The valuation that was carried out was for mortgage purposes only.  It was not a detailed  
report on the condition  of the property  and was intended for bank use only;
Ms O had requested  further details of the construction  and this had been confirmed by 
the valuer. As the valuation  was purely for mortgage purposes  the valuer was not obliged  
to provide any further information. If Ms O wanted further information she would  need  to 
obtain a specialist report, but this was not something  NatWest could assist her with;
Ms O had stated that the valuer  had suggested  she use google  to find answers,  it was 
sorry Ms O was offended by this comment,  this was not the valuer's intention;
The mortgage adviser was not qualified to answer queries in relation to the construction 
of the property. NatWest  relies on the opinion of a suitably qualified professional.
As the application  was no longer proceeding the product  fee of £995 had been refunded.
our adjudicators view
Our adjudicator felt that NatWest had dealt fairly with Ms O's complaint. She said,  in 
summary:
The surveyor carrying out the mortgage  valuation had noted that the construction  was of 
a particular type. And NatWest's criteria stipulated that NatWest wouldn't lend on any 
properties with that type of construction. So she didn't think NatWest made an error by 
declining the application;
She'd asked  if NatWest had an appeals process and whether the decision could be 
overturned if Ms O were to get a more in-depth  survey. But NatWest had confirmed it 
didn't have an appeals process  for this sort of situation. So it therefore  wouldn't be able 
to accept any further valuations;
NatWest had refunded the product fee of £995, which she felt was reasonable and fair 
as the application did not continue.
Ref: DRN81410942Ms O didn't  agree with the adjudicator's conclusions. She said in particular that the survey  
charge has not been reimbursed despite  the survey being extremely inaccurate.
my provisional decision
I issued my provisional decision to both parties on 12 April 2019. I said,  in summary:
Id seen a copy  of the mortgage illustration produced for Ms O in July 2018. This set out 
the costs to be paid as part of the mortgage application. The costs  included an admin fee 
for the valuation of £75, and a valuation  fee of £123.
The mortgage illustration made  it clear  that the administration  fee of £75 was refundable 
where the application was declined. NatWest didnt refund  this fee to Ms O initially,  but 
had now confirmed it would do so.
The mortgage illustration also stated that the valuation fee of £123 was not refundable 
where the application was declined as a result  of the valuation  report.  NatWest  had said 
that it declined  Ms Os application as a result of the valuation report. The report stated 
that the property  was of a particular construction type. And NatWests  internal criteria 
stated that it wouldnt  lend on properties  of that construction. So I didnt think  that 
NatWest was required to refund the valuation fee under the terms of the documentation.
However, I wasnt persuaded that NatWest had treated Ms O fairly in the circumstances 
of this case. I noted that Ms O obtained copies of two further  surveys  which  indicated  
that the property  was of traditional  construction. She forwarded  these surveys to 
NatWest, but NatWest didnt appear  to have considered  the evidence  provided to it.
I appreciated that NatWest didnt operate an appeals process. But it was under a duty to 
treat its customers reasonably. I noted that one of the surveys Ms O sent to NatWest 
was produced by a chartered surveyor. And my provisional view was that NatWest  
should have considered  the additional  information Ms O provided  and take steps to 
satisfy itself that its valuer had not made an error.
I was minded to find that Ms O had been caused  trouble and upset by NatWests  failure 
to consider the additional information  she provided as well as its failure to refund the 
administration fee until prompted by this service. And my provisional view was that 
NatWest should  pay Ms O £150 compensation, in addition  to refunding the 
administration fee of £75.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms O and NatWest have both responded to my provisional decision.
NatWest says that it would only rely on the information produced  by one of its appointed 
surveyors. In the event that the customer produced information that disputed the valuation  
report findings it says it would advise the customer to contact  RICS.  And it says it is not 
qualified enough  in this area to challenge its own appointed  surveyor.
Ref: DRN81410943Ms O says that I didnt  mention that NatWest said that it required proof that the survey  was 
incorrect but then ignored the evidence that she provided. She says that it took her a 
considerable amount of time and stress to get this information, and if NatWest  had given  her 
more information  about why the mortgage  had been  declined she would have been able to 
get the information much sooner and wouldnt have had to tell her neighbours that she was 
buying her home.
Ive considered what both Ms O and NatWest have to say. But, having done so, Ive not 
been persuaded to change my decision. For the reasons set out in my provisional decision 
Im satisfied that NatWest  should have taken further  steps following receipt of the evidence  
from a qualified chartered surveyor. And, although I appreciate that Ms O was caused 
trouble and upset,  Im satisfied that my provisional  decision  to award  her £150 compensation 
took this into account.
As Ive not been persuaded to change my provisional decision I confirm  it here.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. I order National Westminster Bank Plc to 
pay Ms O £150 compensation, and to refund the administration fee of £75 if it has not 
already done so.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 June  2019.
