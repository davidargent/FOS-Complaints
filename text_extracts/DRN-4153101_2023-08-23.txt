DRN-4153101
The complaint
Mr M complains that Metro Bank PLC (trading as RateSetter) is holding him liable for a loan 
he says he did not consent to.
Mr M has a representative in this matter.
What happened
The circumstances of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them 
all again here in detail.  But I will provide an overview of events below.
In summary, in October 2022, Mr M says scammers coerced him into providing his personal 
information so they could take out a £12,000 RateSetter loan in his name without his 
consent.  Mr M argues that because this loan was taken out fraudulently, RateSetter should 
not hold him liable for it.  He also argues that he is a vulnerable person; and that the loan 
should not have been approved as it was unaffordable.
RateSetter refused to write-off the loan but, said it would waive the fees and interest.  
Unhappy with this, Mr M raised a complaint which he referred to our Service.
One of our investigators considered the complaint and did not uphold it.  As Mr M disagrees 
with the investigators findings, this matter has been passed to me to make a decision.
What I have decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would like to say at the outset that I have summarised this complaint in far less detail than 
the parties involved.  I want to stress that no discourtesy is intended by this.  If there is a 
submission I have not addressed, it is not because I have ignored the point.  It is simply 
because my findings focus on what I consider to be the central issues in this complaint.
The first point I need to consider in this matter is  whether Mr M consented to the loan in 
question?
Based on the evidence before me, I can see that prior to the approval of the loan, RateSetter 
sent an email to Mr Ms email address asking about the purpose of the loan.  I can see that 
RateSetter received a response from Mr Ms email address stating, in short, that the purpose 
of the loan was for a new car.  Thereafter, RateSetter says the loan was approved and Mr M 
logged into his online portal and accepted the loan agreement.  In Mr Ms submissions, 
amongst other things, he accepts that he received an email from RateSetter which contained 
a link to,   authorise the loan and deposit funds.  This is the link Mr M accepts he clicked-
through.
Whilst Mr M may not have filled in the loan application himself, I am satisfied  based on the 
above  that he had knowledge of the loan and took the required steps to ensure it was 
approved.  Therefore, I am satisfied that Mr M consented to the RateSetter loan.
Mr M argues that the scammers pressured and manipulated him to do what he did (set out 
above).  Whilst this may well be the case, it would not be fair of me in the circumstances to 
direct that RateSetter write-off the loan for this reason.  I say this because I cannot see any 
evidence which suggests that RateSetter was aware that Mr M was being coerced at the 
time the loan was taken out.  In fact, it had received an email from Mr Ms email address 
providing a reason for the loan (see above).  Mr M says he would like RateSetter to consider 
the fact that he is a vulnerable person.  However, again, I cannot see any evidence to 
suggest RateSetter was aware of this at the time.  So, I cannot rely on this as a reason to 
say RateSetter should write-off the loan.
 
With the above in mind, I am satisfied that it is fair and reasonable for RateSetter to hold Mr 
M liable for the loan under the associated agreement, as he consented to it.
Mr M argues that RateSetter should not have approved the loan as it was unaffordable, so, 
he should not be held liable for it.  Whilst I acknowledge this point, it is not necessary for me 
to make a finding on it for two reasons.
First, RateSetter has said it will waive the fees and interest on the loan and only pursue Mr 
M for the outstanding principal sum of the loan.  Therefore, even if I found that the loan was 
unaffordable and should not have been approved, I would only direct that RateSetter refund 
Mr M the interest and fees on the amount irresponsibly lent.  But, as RateSetter has agreed 
to waive these  I do not need to take this point further.
Secondly, it is not disputed that Mr M transferred out some or all of the loan funds to a third-
party.  So, even if I found that the loan was unaffordable and should not have been approved 
 it does not follow that Mr M should not be held liable for it.  I say this because even if 
RateSetter erred in approving the loan, this does not negate the fact that it was processed 
and the loan funds were credited to Mr Ms bank account, which he then transferred out to a 
third-party.  Ultimately, some or all of the loan funds have been spent, so whilst it may be the 
case that RateSetter should not have approved the loan  it is fair that it should be entitled to 
pursue Mr M for the principal sum of the loan if it so wishes.
Finally, I can see Mr M has made reference to the Contingent Reimbursement Model.  
However, this code does not apply in the circumstances of Mr Ms complaint against 
RateSetter.
Taking all the above points together, I find that Mr M consented to the £12,000 RateSetter 
loan.  It follows that I find it is fair and reasonable for RateSetter to hold Mr M liable for the 
loan under the associated agreement.  RateSetter has said it will waive the fees and interest 
on the loan.  So, I expect RateSetter to do this if it has not done so already; and only pursue 
Mr M for the outstanding principal sum of the loan if it so wishes.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 September 2023.
