The complaint
Mr D complains about difficulties making a payment via NewDay Ltd trading as Pulses app. 
Mr D also complains that NewDay unfairly recorded Query Markers (Q markers) on his credit 
file when he raised a complaint.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. I said: 
On 16 April 2023 NewDay issued a monthly credit card statement to Mr D that said he had 
an outstanding balance of £301.19 and that a minimum payment of £5 was due by 11 May 
2023. On 17 April 2023 Mr D made a payment of £301.19, clearing the outstanding balance 
in full. Mr D continued to use his credit card for everyday spending.
On 8 May 2023 Mr D attempted to make a manual payment via NewDays app. But Mr Ds 
explained that the app appeared to have a technical problem that meant he couldnt make 
the payment. Mr D went on to contact NewDay and raised a complaint. Mr Ds told us he 
received an acknowledgement text from NewDay on 9 May 2023 confirming his complaint 
had been raised. On 11 May 2023 Mr D received notification from a business that provides 
access to his credit file that his credit score had dropped. Mr Ds payment was received by 
NewDay on 24 May 2023.
When Mr D checked his credit report he found NewDay had added a Q marker for the month 
of May 2023. Mr D went on to complain to NewDay about its use of the Q marker. Mr D also 
asked a credit reference agency to challenge the Q marker with NewDay and apply a Notice 
of Correction to his credit file.
NewDay continued to report the Q marker in June 2023 while it was investigating Mr Ds 
complaint. A final response was issued on 6 July 2023. NewDay said it hadnt identified any 
known issues with its payment systems on 8 May 2023 that impacted other customers. But 
NewDay accepted Mr D hadnt been able to use its app and offered him £85 to apologise for 
the distress and inconvenience caused. NewDay added that its obliged to report accurate 
information on Mr Ds credit file which is why it recorded the Q marker to show hed raised a 
dispute. NewDay said the Q marker should be removed from Mr Ds credit file by 10 July
2023.
Mr D referred his complaint to this service. Within Mr Ds submissions he provided evidence 
that NewDays Q marker continued to be recorded on his credit file in August 2023, despite 
its promise to delete it made in the final response. An investigator looked at Mr Ds complaint 
but wasnt persuaded NewDay had acted unfairly. Mr D asked to appeal and explained his 
view is that NewDay had unfairly applied the Q marker which had led to a clear reduction in 
his credit score. As Mr D asked to appeal, his complaint has been passed to me to make a 
decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware Ive summarised the events surrounding this complaint in less detail than the 
parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by my approach which reflects the informal 
nature of this service. I want to assure all parties Ive read and considered everything on file. 
Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every point raised to fairly reach my decision. And if 
I dont comment on something, its not because I havent considered it. Its because Ive 
focused on what I think are the key issues. My approach is in line with the rules we operate 
under.
Mr Ds case falls broadly into two parts, so Ill look at each in turn. Mr Ds explained he 
wanted to make a manual payment on 8 May 2023 and tried to use the NewDay app. But 
despite making multiple attempts, he was unable to do so. NewDay has supplied systems 
evidence that shows the number of attempts Mr D made to make his payment. And I can see 
NewDays final response advises this was likely an isolated incident that only affected Mr D. 
NewDay apologised to Mr D and offered £85 for the distress and inconvenience caused. I 
can understand why Mr D was frustrated his payments didnt go through. But Im satisfied 
NewDays offer of £85 fairly reflects the difficulties he experienced when trying to make 
payments, so Im not telling NewDay to take any further action in relation to this aspect of Mr 
Ds complaint.
Our investigator asked NewDay to confirm the basis on which it applies the Q marker to a 
customers credit file. NewDays case manager said I can confirm we apply query markers 
to a customers credit file every time a complaint is raised, regardless of the complaint type. 
In addition, in its original file submission, NewDay said the Q marker is reported to ensure 
other lenders are aware that the information recorded on a customers credit file may not be 
correct while the complaint is on-going. In my view, the use of the Q marker following receipt 
of Mr Ds complaint was unreasonable. Ill explain why.
The Steering Committee on Reciprocity (SCOR) is a forum made up of representatives from 
the credit industry, including the credit reference agencies. SCOR gives guidance in its 
Principles of Reciprocity. The main thrust of the Principles of Reciprocity is that data is 
shared only for the prevention of over-commitment, bad debt, fraud and money laundering 
and to support debt recovery, debtor tracing or to avoid irresponsible lending. But here, 
NewDays confirmed it reported a Q marker to reflect the fact Mr D raised a complaint about 
its app. I cant see that the grounds NewDay has cited fall within the guidance provided by 
SCOR or bear any relevance to how payments were made.
As Ive noted above, Mr D had already made his contractual monthly payment when he 
cleared the full outstanding balance on 17 April 2023. So whilst Mr D was complaining about 
NewDays app and difficulties making a payment, it had no bearing on his obligations under 
the credit agreement or the way his account had been handled. I see no fair reason for 
reporting a complaint of that nature to the credit reference agencies.
During the investigation, Mr D provided evidence that showed the Q marker was being 
reported as late as August 2023, a month after NewDay said it would remove the entry. Its 
not clear why the Q marker continued to be recorded. But given NewDay had issued its final 
response to Mr Ds complaint and agreed to remove it by 10 July 2023, Im satisfied it 
shouldnt have still been reported. Ive factored this into how I think Mr Ds complaint should 
be resolved.
I invited both parties to respond with any additional comments or information they wanted 
me to consider before I made my final decision. Mr D responded and confirmed he was 
willing to accept. NewDay responded and said its used of the Q marker was in line with guidance provided by 
one of the three main credit reference agencies. Experian quoted a section that reads 
Where a query exists on an account, for example a merchandise complaint or a dispute 
over a defaulted account, the record should be flagged with the letter Q for the term of the 
query. NewDay says its systems are unable to differentiate between an administrative 
complaint and financial issue which means it reports all complaints with a Q on the 
customers credit file. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Ive set out above, NewDay quoted guidance it says was provided by one of the main 
credit reference agencies. I note the guidance gives some examples concerning the types of 
events that could lead to the use of a Q marker on a consumers credit file. But neither of the 
examples provided in the quoted guidance reflect Mr Ds complaint which was administrative 
in nature following a problem he experienced using NewDays app. And theres nothing in 
the quoted section that says NewDay should record a Q marker every time a customer 
raises a complaint. 
As I said in the provisional decision, Mr Ds payments were maintained in line with his credit 
agreement while he complained. There was no dispute with a retailer and Mr Ds complaint 
didnt relate to a defaulted account or anything he mayve done outside of the terms and 
conditions of his credit card. I dont see how the Q marker NewDay recorded on Mr Ds 
credit file falls in line with the guidance it quoted in response to my provisional decision. 
NewDays explained both during the investigation and in response to my provisional decision 
that it applies the Q marker whenever a customer makes a complaint. And NewDays 
explained that its systems cant tell the difference between a complaint that is administrative 
in nature and one that relates to financial issues  so all are reported with a Q marker. As a 
service we cant tell NewDay how to operate. We consider complaints on an individual basis. 
So Im only going to talk about how the policy of applying a Q marker when Mr D 
complained, regardless of the issue, is fair in his circumstances. 
I remain of the view that by recording a Q marker against Mr Ds credit file for raising what is 
a complaint that has nothing to do with any financial issue, merchant or card dispute or his 
obligations under the credit agreement NewDay has treated him unfairly. Mr Ds provided 
evidence from his credit file that the Q marker led to a reduction in his credit score. So whilst 
NewDay claims the Q marker is neutral, thats not Mr Ds experience. In my view, Mr D 
ought to be in a position to make a complaint about his account with NewDay without fear 
the issue being unnecessarily reported on his credit file. There will be circumstances where 
its appropriate for NewDay to use the Q marker. But Im satisfied that by applying a blanket 
policy in reporting the complaint Mr D made NewDays failed to treat him fairly. 
In my provisional decision I also noted that NewDay hadnt removed the Q marker from Mr 
Ds credit file in line with promises made in its final response. I note no response from 
NewDay on this point was made.  
Ive considered everything Mr D and NewDay have said when bringing the complaint and in 
response to my provisional decision. Having done so, I still think Mr Ds complaint should be 
upheld, for the same reasons. My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ds complaint and direct NewDay Ltd trading as Pulse to 
settle as follows: 
- If it hasnt done so already, ensure the Q markers reported from May 2023 onwards 
are removed from Mr Ds credit file
- Pay Mr D an additional £200 for the distress and inconvenience caused, taking the 
total award to £285 (less any compensation already paid)
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 January 2024.
