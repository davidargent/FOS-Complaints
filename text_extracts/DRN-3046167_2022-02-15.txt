The complaint
Miss T complains that NewDay Ltd, trading as Argos Classic Credit Card (NewDay), failed 
to carry out appropriate affordability checks before approving credit, and subsequent credit 
limit increases.
What happened
 Between 2011 and 2019 Miss T applied for and was accepted for five credit cards trading 
under separate names with NewDay. During this time the credit limits on these cards were 
regularly Increased.
Card AA1  Miss T took this card out in March 2011. In January 2017 the limit was 
increased to £1,050 from £300. In August the limit was raised to £1,950 and in 
January 2018 to £2,850.
Card MS  Miss T took this card out in May 2017. The credit limit started at £450. In 
December 2017 the limit was increased to £1,450, in April 2018 to £2,450 and in 
August 2018 to £3,200. Miss T requested for the limit to be increased to £3,500 
multiple times in 2019 but this was declined.
Card AN  Miss T applied for this card and was accepted in March 2019. The credit 
limit was £500. In July 2019 this limit was increased to £600 and in September 2019 
to £1,600. In November 2019 and August 2020 Miss T requested for the limit to be 
increased to £2,000 but this was declined.
Card AS  The fourth card was taken out in October 2019. The starting credit limit 
was £300. In February 2020 the limit was increased to £1,300. In May 2020 Miss T 
requested for the limit to be increased to £1,500 but this was declined.
Card AA2  Miss T applied for this fifth credit card in September 2020. The initial 
credit limit was £250.
Miss T found herself in some financial difficulty and in December 2020 she complained to 
NewDay. She said appropriate affordability checks hadnt been completed and NewDay 
hadnt lent responsibly
In its final response NewDay accepted that it shouldnt have approved the credit limit 
increase from 300 to £1,050 in January 2017. It also accepted it should not have opened the 
AA2 account in September 2020. With regards to the other credit card applications and 
credit limit increases NewDay said it was satisfied that each credit limit was provided to Miss 
T correctly and adequate checks had been completed to ensure these were affordable.
Miss T didnt agree and brought her complaint to this service. Our investigator concluded 
that with respect to the initial credit card, AA1, which Miss T applied for in March 2011, our 
service could not consider the merits of this account opening. In this case the complaint had 
been brought to our service outside of the time limit set in the financial conduct authority 
(FCA) Handbook DISP 2.8.2 R. Miss T accepted this.
Our investigator concluded that NewDay hadnt carried out sufficient checks before 
approving the other cards and the subsequent limit increases that were applied to these 
accounts. She also concluded that the credit limit increases applied to her AA1 account in 
August 2017 and January 2018 were irresponsible. She said offering Miss T additional 
borrowing and the later increases clearly contributed to her financial problems. She 
recommended the refund of all interest and charges applied to Card MS, Card AN, and Card 
AS, and that all interest and charges should be refunded that had been applied to her AA1 
account since August 2017 until the account was repaid.
NewDay didnt agree with these conclusions and asked for a final decision from an 
ombudsman. NewDay made several comments and, where appropriate, I have responded to 
them below. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I dont believe NewDay carried out appropriate, reasonable, and 
proportionate affordability checks when Miss T applied for three of her credit cards and when 
credit limit increases were applied to her accounts.
Miss T has complained about the initial credit card, AA1, which she opened in March 2011. 
As our investigator has explained our service is unable to look at this account opening, but 
we are able to look at the others.
NewDay was required to lend responsibly, not just for each individual card but for the 
cumulative credit amount and all the credit limit increases. It had a responsibility to carry out 
appropriate affordability checks, proportionate to the amount Miss T wanted to borrow. 
These checks would normally include the cost of repayment and Miss Ts borrowing history.

has accepted it should not have approved:

NewDay accepted that the credit limit increase from £300 to £1,050 in January 2017 should 
not have been applied, as Miss T had recently been in a repayment plan. It didnt agree that 
Miss T shouldnt have received the two further credit increases in August 2017 and January 
2018 as, it said, by April 2017 Miss T was no longer in a repayment plan. NewDay said this 
was four months before the credit limit increased to £1,950. It went on to say there was no 
data reported to it by the Credit Reference Agencies (CRA) to show Miss T had affordability 
issues before the second and third credit limit increases took place. 
NewDay accepted the first increase shouldnt have happened. So, it follows that the further 
credit limit increases and card applications should not have been accepted or at least should 
have been subject to further affordability checks. Ive looked at Miss Ts credit file in detail. 
During 2015 and 2016 Miss T applied for several short term loans. Between the end of 2016 
and May 2017, when Card MS was taken out Miss T also applied for and was accepted for 
two longer term loans, one short term loan as well as a credit card with different finance 
providers. Between June and January 2018 when the credit limits of both Card AA1 and 
Card MS were further increased Miss T had taken out another longer term loan, a short term 
loan and another credit card with other finance providers. 
This amount of additional credit with so many different credit providers in such a short space 
of time, without significantly paying down the debt, indicates to me that despite her stated 
income of £38,000 Miss T was already heavily reliant on credit. And any further credit from 
NewDay during this time shouldve warranted more affordability checks than were carried 
out. 
NewDay told this service that Miss T was no longer on the repayment plan with another 
lender and she wasnt showing any difficulties with other lenders. It said no data had been 
received regarding pay day loans and she managed her MS account extremely well, with 
only one over-limit fee in July 2019. But the repayment plan only ended one month before 
Card MS was approved and according to her credit file Miss T had taken another credit card 
with a different provider in February 2017. While I understand that late payments and 
exceeding credit limits are indicators that a consumer is having financial difficulty, they are 
not the only signs, and I consider it irresponsible of NewDay to immediately approve a new 
card and the subsequent credit limit increases without further probing of Miss Ts ability to 
pay down the debt.
NewDay has said that the short term loans were not reported to it and were not included in 
the underwriting data, information it sent to this service, so it wasnt aware of these loans at 
the time. But I can see from the underwriting data it was aware of other card accounts.
Card AN and Card AS
Between March 2018 and March 2019 when Miss T applied for Card AN she took out two 
further unsecured loans, two retail credit accounts, another credit card and short term loans 
with other finance providers. It also appears, from her credit file, she entered another debt 
management arrangement. By August 2019 Miss T had taken out a further credit card prior 
to the credit limit for Card AN being increased. 
In its final response NewDay said Miss T had asked for her credit limit on Card MS to be 
increased to £3,500 multiple times in 2019 but was declined on each occasion. 
At the time of her card application for Card AN Miss T had an unsecured debt balance of 
£28,900. She declared her income to be £45,000 with other household income bringing the 
total amount to £70,000. On this basis NewDay said it didnt find the amount of unsecured debt to be excessive. I dont agree. It seems that Miss T wasnt paying down any of the debt, 
it was only increasing. Her MS card credit limit increases were being denied but during the 
same year had two new card applications approved with credit limit increases. 
When she applied for Card AS Miss T declared her income £50,000 with other household 
income on top of that. NewDay told this service that Miss Ts unsecured debt balance had 
risen to £38,500 at the time of her application for Card AS but it found the combined 
household income Miss T declared she had access to was sufficient. Again, I disagree. It 
seems by this time, despite her declared income, Miss T was heavily reliant on credit, was 
only making minimum payments and her balances were not reducing. 
Im satisfied that NewDay should have been more cautious in increasing the amount of credit 
to Miss T during this time. As NewDay declined credit limit increases on Card MS yet still 
approved credit limit increases for Card AN and the application for Card AS it doesnt appear 
that the total cumulative amount of Miss Ts NewDay borrowing along with her significant 
borrowing from other finance providers was subjected to appropriate affordability checks. 
NewDay provided individual underwriting data for each card application but I cant see that 
NewDay looked across the card accounts at Miss Ts account behaviour. 
Im satisfied the credit limit increases applied to Card AA1 in August 2017 and January 2018 
should not have been approved. Im also satisfied NewDay failed to carry out sufficient 
checks before approving Cards MS, AN and AS and the subsequent credit limit increases 
applied to these card accounts.
Putting things right
 To put things right NewDay must:
refund Miss T all the interest and charges that were applied to the MS (ending 5677), 
AN (ending 2693) and AS (ending 2070) credit card accounts, since they were 
approved; 
refund Miss T all the interest and charges that were applied to her AA1 (ending 1521) 
account since August 2017 until it was repaid.
Refunds can be applied to reduce any outstanding balance.
In the event of a surplus balance, NewDay should pay this directly to Miss T and add 
8% interest from the date the accounts move into a positive balance to the date of 
the settlement.  
Any adverse information, which has arisen following the MS, AN and AS credit card 
accounts to be removed from Miss Ts credit file completely.
Any adverse information, which has arisen following the AA1 credit card account 
from January 2017, to be removed from Miss Ts credit file completely.  
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and instruct NewDay Ltd trading as Argos 
Classic Credit Card to put things right as set out above.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2022.
