The complaint
Mr R is unhappy with the way National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) treated him when 
he reported an ATM fraud. 
What happened
Mr R was the victim of an ATM fraud which he reported straight away. He says that when he 
reported what happened to NatWest, he was made feel like a criminal and that hed done 
something wrong. 
Because of this Mr R complained to the CEO of NatWest. Following this complaint, NatWest 
refunded the amount that had been stolen, apologised, and paid Mr R £100 compensation, 
specifically for the distress and inconvenience its fraud team had caused. NatWest said it 
had shared details of Mr Rs poor experience with the relevant members of that specific 
team. 
However, Mr R remained unhappy and he complained to our service. He says £100 is an 
insult after how NatWest made him feel.  He says he would like an appropriate level of 
compensation. 
An investigator looked at the complaint and said NatWest had done enough to put things 
right for Mr R. 
Mr R doesnt agree, and hes asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding it. Ill explain why.
Please note, this complaint is solely about the level of compensation awarded following the 
actions of NatWest. I will not be commenting on the alleged fraud that took place in this final 
decision. 
As a service we'll consider whether compensation is appropriate in each case. Well ask 
about what happened, and the impact it had on a consumers life. We can make a money 
award to put right any financial losses. We can also make a money award for distress, 
inconvenience, pain and suffering and damage to reputation. This allows us to put right the 
emotional or practical impact of a businesss mistake.
We don't compensate for the impact of events that were outside of the business's control. 
So, in a situation where a fraud has taken place, the event itself can be distressing. But we 
wouldn't ask a business to pay compensation for the impact of the fraud. However, if the 
subsequent investigation wasn't handled properly, we might consider compensation for the 
extra upset this caused. Typically, an apology or small monetary award of less than £100 will 
fairly compensate a one-off incident or an issue that gets dealt with relatively swiftly. 
In this specific instance, Mr R says that when he reported the theft, NatWest made him feel 
like a criminal. He says NatWest refused to reimburse him, advising him that it doesnt cover 
ATM fraud. He says he was told to go to the police. Mr R says it was only on the advice of 
the police that he wrote to the CEO of NatWest about what had happened.
NatWest says that it dealt with Mr Rs complaint immediately. It apologised and was 
empathetic in its response to the theft. It explained why Mr R wasnt contacted at the time of 
the withdrawal, and it advised it would feedback to the individuals that Mr R dealt with when 
he first reported the money had been stolen. NatWest paid Mr R £100 in compensation for 
the distress caused by its fraud team when he called them. 
Ive listened to the calls Mr R made to NatWest to report the theft. In the first call Mr R was 
asked to describe what happened and he was asked a number of questions like do you 
think there couldve been a device on the ATM and do you suspect something fraudulent 
happened. The agent in the first point of contact call said that he wasnt seeing anything on 
his screen to suspect a fraudulent activity took place. 
Mr R was then put through to the fraud department. Again, Mr R was asked to explain what 
happened, and he explained again about his card being swallowed and how he later noticed 
£250 was missing. He was asked a number of questions, like whether hed noticed anyone 
else at the machine and or whether hed seen a message on screen.
I do recognise that Mr R got exasperated, possibly because he had to go through everything 
again. The agent did ask Mr R to stop shouting, but I dont think Mr R was shouting. Both 
parties were just talking over each other. I think both sides were exasperated. Mr R because 
he had to tell the whole story again, and the agent, because what had happened wasnt 
clear. 
There were two further calls between the NatWest fraud department and Mr R. The next call 
was mainly to rearrange a call for when Mr R was free. The last call was a lot longer and it 
was in this call that NatWest told Mr R it couldnt refund the amount that had been 
withdrawn. 
Having listened to the calls I wouldnt agree that Mr R was treated like a criminal. Yes, he 
was asked to repeat the story a number of times, and yes, he was asked a number of direct 
questions. But there was nothing accusatory in the way the questions were asked, and in my 
experience the agents who work in fraud departments are expected to ask direct questions. 
Mr R certainly became exasperated, but nobody was accusing him of doing anything 
untoward. All NatWest said was that the transaction looked normal and wouldnt have raised 
any warning signs. It blocked Mr Rs card immediately so as to prevent any further fraudulent 
activity. 
I know Mr R wants more compensation for how he was treated. He says he was just fobbed 
off. I appreciate he felt distressed during the calls with NatWest and I acknowledge Mr R 
was upset and frustrated by what had happened. He was annoyed that NatWest didnt seem 
to believe him. But there were no immediate signs on NatWests system that a fraudulent 
transaction had taken place. And even though Mr R was in a distressful situation, where 
money had been fraudulently taken which meant he was now in an unplanned overdraft, this 
wasnt NatWests fault. And it had to go through due process to make sure a fraud had 
occurred. However, I can see that once NatWest received Mr Rs complaint it apologised immediately 
for its actions, and it acted swiftly. I can see why NatWest awarded Mr R £100. Mr R was 
told he should report this to the police. But he shouldve also been told he could raise a 
complaint with NatWest, and it would investigate further. This was an error and NatWest 
wasnt clear on the next steps Mr R had to take.
I dont think NatWest provided its best service here.  But it acted swiftly and acknowledged it 
hadnt done enough. NatWest also said it had no reason to doubt Mr Rs version of events. 
So, because NatWest acted so swiftly and acknowledged its poor service, I think £100 is a 
fair and reasonable amount of compensation for the distress caused by the fraud 
department. As such Im not upholding this complaint and I wont be asking Nationwide to do 
anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 April 2022.
