K821x#15complaint
Mr P complains that CarCashPoint Limited  (CarCashPoint) unfairly provided him with 
logbook loans. 
background
CarCashPoint provided Mr P with logbook loans as follows:
Loan Date taken Date repaid Number of 
instalmentsLoan amount Weekly 
repayment*
1 30/03/2017 22/09/2017 78 weekly £560.00 £20.11
2 22/09/2017 22/10/2019 78 weekly £556.74 £19.99
3 25/11/2017 22/10/2019 156 weekly £660.00 £17.94
These loans were granted on the basis that Mr P provided CarCashPoint with a bill of sale 
for his car. This meant  that if Mr P didnt make his loan repayments, CarCashPoint  could 
potentially recoup its losses through the sale of the vehicle.
Mr P mainly  complained that CarCashPoint didnt do proper checks  before agreeing  to lend 
to him and so provided these loans irresponsibly. And Mr P was unhappy about the way 
CarCashPoint dealt  with him when he fell into arrears  with his payments and his car was 
repossessed. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mr Ps complaint  and explained  why he thought 
CarCashPoint made an unfair lending decision when providing this loan. He set out the 
steps he said CarCashPoint should  take to put things right.
CarCashPoint didnt  respond so the case comes to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As well as setting out the key rules, regulations and good  industry  practice, weve  explained 
how we handle complaints about  unaffordable and/or irresponsible lending on our website. 
And Ive used this approach to help me decide  Mr Ps complaint.
Having carefully considered everything  Ive been provided with, Im upholding Mr Ps 
complaint. Id like to explain why.
Ive looked at the complaint afresh  and Ive independently reached the same conclusions  
as our adjudicator.  He felt that he hadnt  seen enough to say that CarCashPoint did anything 
wrong when it provided loan 2 to Mr P but our adjudicator set out why he thought it made  
unfair lending  decisions when providing  loans  1 and 3.
Ref: DRN15516092As CarCashPoint  hasnt said it accepts our adjudicators view or taken any steps  to settle  the 
complaint in line with our adjudicators recommendations it looks  like it disagrees with the 
outcome our adjudicator suggested. But as CarCashPoint hasnt responded to our 
adjudicators view, despite  reminders weve sent, I dont know what exactly  it is it disagreed  
with in our adjudicators assessment. 
CarCashPoint will be aware that the rules  and regulations, in place at the time it lent to Mr P, 
required it to establish whether Mr P could sustainably make his loan repayments.  In other 
words, it needed to be satisfied that Mr P could make his repayments without experiencing 
financial difficulty or borrowing further   it wasnt enough just to check whether  the loan 
payments looked  affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
why Im upholding Mr Ps complaint about  loans 1 and 3
Ive seen that Mr Ps bank  statements, which  CarCashPoint reviewed before providing these 
loans, showed  significant online gambling  spending  in the months  leading  up to Mr P 
applying for loans 1 and 3. This accounted for a significant proportion of his take home  pay. 
And it would have also seen that he was borrowing elsewhere  including  using other short 
term/high cost loan providers. So I dont think it was reasonable for CarCashPoint to 
conclude that it was likely Mr P would be able to repay these two loans in a sustainable 
manner.
In these circumstances, I dont think that it was fair and reasonable for CarCashPoint to 
conclude that Mr P would  more likely  than not have been able to make  the payments  to this 
loan without difficulty or borrowing further.  I think  that its decision  to lend in these 
circumstances, having been provided  with the information it saw, wasnt  fair or reasonable.
So, having  carefully considered everything  provided,  I think  that CarCashPoint unfairly 
provided Mr P with these  logbook loans.
why Im not upholding Mr Ps complaint  about loan 2
I think the checks that CarCashPoint carried out before providing this loan were, broadly 
speaking, proportionate bearing in mind the loan term and the amount and Mr Ms payment 
record on loan 1. They didnt show  enough to have prompted a reasonable lender to think 
that the loan wouldnt be sustainable.  Mr Ps bank statements  dont show the same high 
level of spending  on gambling in the months running  up to him taking  out loan 2. So I cant  
fairly say Ive seen  enough to uphold Mr Ps complaint that this loan was irresponsibly 
provided. 
I've taken into account that, in response  to our adjudicators view, Mr P told us that loan 2 
was just a rollover  of loan 1 when  he had changed  vehicles, so the loan had to be moved 
from one registration  number to another. But this makes no difference  to the outcome and 
Im not upholding Mr Ps complaint about  loan 2. 
has CarCashPoint acted unfairly or unreasonably in any other way?
Ive had the benefit of seeing CarCashPoints contact notes and Ive thought carefully about 
what happened when  Mr P had problems making his repayments  from time to time and 
looked at the course of events that resulted in Mr Ps car being  repossessed.  
Ref: DRN15516093It looks like CarCashPoint made  reasonable attempts by phone and email  to communicate 
with Mr P. When  that wasnt successful, it learned that he had left his address only after its 
agent called  at the property. 
When Mr Ps car was repossessed this happened only after I think  its fair to say 
CarCashPoint had shown  reasonable forbearance and allowed Mr P opportunities to avoid 
this outcome. 
I appreciate that it was frustrating for Mr P to discover that when he made  a payment to 
enable him to recover his car, based  on the information CarCashPoint had sent him, this 
was insufficient.  But that seems  to be because he hadnt allowed for the extra interest that 
had accrued to the account  by the time Mr P sent his payment.
Based on all the information I've seen  and been  told, generally, I think  CarCashPoint was 
entitled take the steps it did when Mr P missed making the contractual loan repayments and 
that it tried to work  constructively with Mr P when he had payment problems. I havent seen 
enough to make me think that it acted towards  Mr P in any other way that wasnt  fair and 
reasonable. 
As far as I can see, Mr P seems happy  with what our adjudicator  said and the redress he 
has suggested. So Im not awarding  any additional redress  beyond  taking the steps and 
making the payments I've set out below as I think this is fair in all the circumstances.  
Fair compensation  what  CarCashPoint  needs  to do to put things right  for Mr P
I think it is fair and reasonable for Mr P to repay the principal amounts that he borrowed on 
loans 1 and 3 because he had the benefit  of that lending. But he has had to pay interest 
and charges on loans that shouldnt have been  provided to him.
So I think its fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of Mr Ps complaint  for 
CarCashPoint to put things right by:
 refunding the interest, fees and charges Mr P paid as a result of taking loans 1 and 3
 adding interest at 8% per year simple  on any refunded interest,  fees and charges from the 
date they were paid by Mr P to the date of settlement
 removing any adverse information placed  on Mr Ps credit file in relation to loans 1 and 3.
HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to take off tax from this interest.
CarCashPoint must  give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ps complaint. CarCashPoint Limited should 
put things right in the way set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 June 2021.
