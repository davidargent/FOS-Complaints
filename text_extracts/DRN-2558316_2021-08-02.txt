The complaint
Miss S complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) mismanaged her personal loan 
application.
What happened
Miss S had a personal loan of £7,000  taken out in June 2018. The APR was 7.9%. She 
needed more money and in February 2019 applied for a loan of £12,500. The APR was 
16.9%. On 13 February 2019, the first loan was repaid at a net cost (after interest refund) of 
£6,425.03  and the new loan was drawn. Both loans were for five-year terms.
Miss S complained. Shed realised that the new loan was at a much higher rate than the first 
one. She therefore contacted HSBC immediately and asked that the new loan be put on the 
same interest rate as the old one. In a letter dated 26 April 2019, HSBC agreed that she 
could apply for a new loan and they would agree it at the same, lower rate as on the old loan 
(APR 7.9%). But when she contacted HSBC in June 2019, they said they could no longer do 
that, and instead offered a payment of £2,500 for the difference in interest, plus 
compensation of £1,000. Miss S complained that HSBC hadnt honoured their previous 
agreement, and that their offer wasnt enough. She calculated that the difference was 
£4,655.98, and thats what HSBC should pay. Also, she wanted to know if she still qualified 
for HSBCs cashback offer.
HSBC apologised that their letter of 26 April 2019 didnt state there was a deadline to accept 
their offer to put the new loan at the old rate. But they believed their offer of compensation 
was a good one.
Miss S brought her complaint to our service. Our investigator said HSBC had acted fairly. 
They had acted within the terms and conditions. He agreed that HSBC had agreed to put the 
new loan on the old terms in their letter of 26 April 2019  but Miss S hadnt contacted them 
until 11 June 2019. In all the circumstances, he considered HSBCs offer of £3,500 to be fair. 
He said Miss S still qualified for HSBCs cashback offer.
Miss S asked that her complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that Miss S feels strongly about her complaint. Shes convinced that HSBCs offer 
isnt fair. And  she spent a lot of time on the phone after July 2019 trying to sort things out 
with HSBC  she said she called HSBC more than 40 times.
HSBCs terms and conditions do say that when taking out a new loan, the old loan would be 
cancelled  and the new loan would be at its new rate. They say: Existing customers can 
apply for further lending, and if approved, we will automatically consolidate your existing loan 
with the new loan to provide one monthly repayment. The APR of this new loan could be 
higher than the APR of your existing Personal Loan. So  HSBC didnt have to change the 
rate on the new loan to the lower rate as on the old loan. I therefore think their offer to do this 
at the time was a very reasonable one.
But  having agreed to do this  HSBC confirmed it in their letter dated 26 April 2019. This 
was clear  that they would put the new loan on the same interest rate as the old loan  if 
she applied again. But by the time she contacted them again  on 11 June 2019, HSBC said 
they couldnt do that anymore. I agree that the letter didnt place a deadline on the offer  
and Miss S has, reasonably, said this wasnt fair. But equally, HSBC have tried to put things 
right with their offer to pay the interest difference of £2,500, plus compensation of £1,000.
So  for me, the crux of Miss S complaint is  whether HSBCs offer to resolve her 
complaint is fair, or not. I want to assure Miss S that Ive looked at her complaint and 
considered it in depth. But I do consider HSBCs offer to be fair and reasonable. To do this, I 
have compared the cost of the loan of £12,500 at the old rate of APR 7.9% with the actual 
rate that Miss S is paying  APR 16.9%. This shows that the difference in interest cost is 
£3,428 over the life of the current loan. So that is the about the same as HSBCs offer.
Miss S has also said that she didnt need to borrow as much as £12,500  although Im not 
sure if Im correct in saying that. But, to show this, or assuming she uses HSBCs refund of 
£2,500 to reduce the loan to £10,000, then the difference in interest is less - £2,363. So, in 
that case, HSBCs offer is more than the difference in interest. If Miss S wishes to reduce the 
loan, she would have to contact HSBC to do this  which would need the old loan to be 
closed and a new one opened at the current interest rate in operation now. 
Loan amount Interest rate (APR) Interest payable over 
five years
£12,500 16.9% (existing rate) £6,099
£12,500 7.9% (old rate) £2,671
Difference £3,428
£10,000 16.9% (existing rate) £4,500
£10,000 7.9% (old rate) £2,137
Difference £2,363
Ive looked at whether Miss S would qualify for the cashback offer. The terms and conditions 
of this says she is  if she doesnt repay the loan early. So  if she were to reduce or repay 
the existing loan early, she wouldnt qualify for it. The terms say If you hold a HSBC 
Advance account at the time of opening your loan and the duration of the loan is 60 months 
or less, the cost of the loan will be less as youre entitled to a cashback of 10% of the total 
interest you have paid for the loan at the end of the term.What should you note about the 
loan where it says We will pay a cashback equal to 10% of the total interest charged over 
the duration of the agreement within 10 days from the date you repay the loan as long as 
you have made all your repayments on time and do not repay the loan, or part of it, early. 
Ive considered whether it would be right to ask HSBC to offer the cashback if Miss S were to 
repay the loan early. But I think that HSBCs offer as it stands is a fair one, and it wouldnt be 
right to ask them to do that as well.
Miss S hasnt accepted HSBCs offer, and I believe the new loan of £12,500 is still being 
repaid in line with its original terms and interest rate. So  if Miss S wishes to accept HSBCs 
offer, she should contact them.
I can see that Miss S feels very strongly and she will be disappointed by my decision. But Im 
not going to ask HSBC to do anymore here.My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 August 2021.
