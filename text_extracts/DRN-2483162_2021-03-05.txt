DRN-2483162
The complaint
Mr D complains that MoneyGram International Limited closed his account without giving him 
an explanation. Mr D would like to know why the account was closed and to have his 
account reopened. 
What happened
Mr D had an account with MoneyGram.
After Mr D had trouble accessing his account in August 2019, he contacted MoneyGram who 
told him his account had been closed. They said his account was blocked for security 
reasons.
Mr D complained to MoneyGram. They said they were entitled to review the service they 
provide to any customer. They said they could decline to provide their service if they felt 
uncomfortable doing so.
As Mr D was unhappy with their response he complained to our service.
Mr D says as MoneyGram havent provided reasons for closing his account, he thinks 
theyve made a mistake. He says all his transactions were carried out so there is no 
suspicion on his transactions. He was unhappy he hadnt been given an opportunity to 
provide an explanation.
One of our investigators looked into the complaint. He said MoneyGram were entitled to 
review the account in line with its legal and regulatory obligations and the terms and 
conditions. And they werent obliged to give Mr D reasons for their decision to close the 
account. 
Mr M was unhappy with the view. He said he used the account to send his own money to 
family members. MoneyGram didnt ask for information to validate his income and recipients. 
He still wants an explanation for why his account was closed.
As there was no agreement the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I ve reached the same conclusion as the investigator and I will explain why 
below.
Ill start by setting out some context for the review of Mr Ds account. UK legislation places 
extensive obligations on regulated financial businesses. Financial institutions must establish 
the purpose and intended nature of transactions as well as the origin of funds, and there 
may be penalties if they dont. This applies to both new and existing relationships. These 
obligations override all other obligations. Having looked at the evidence I am satisfied that 
this is what MoneyGram was doing when it reviewed Mr Ds account. 
Mr D has said he uses the account to send his own money to relatives and he would have 
provided evidence of this had MoneyGram asked him to. MoneyGram have always carried 
out his instructions, so he doesnt think there are any suspicious circumstances.
I appreciate Mr D has found this whole episode frustrating, but MoneyGram are entitled to 
carry out reviews of their customers accounts under regulations and the terms of the 
account. So, I cant say MoneyGram has done anything wrong when it reviewed Mr Ds 
account. 
Mr D has said that he wants to know why MoneyGram closed his account. He is concerned 
that they made a mistake in doing so. 
As the investigator explained its generally for financial institutions to decide whether or not 
they want to provide, or to continue to provide, account facilities to any particular customer. 
Unless theres a good reason to do so, this service wont usually say that a financial 
institution must keep a customer or require it to compensate a customer who has had their 
account closed.
I contacted MoneyGram who said that Mr Ds account was closed because of a chargeback. 
I have seen evidence that MoneyGram received a request to reverse a payment from Mr Ds 
account. So, I have gone on to consider if MoneyGram acted fairly in closing Mr Ds account.
I have looked at the terms of the account which Mr D agreed to when he opened his account 
with MoneyGram. 
The terms and conditions which MoneyGram relied on when closing Mr Ds account is 
Section 2.11.(b) which says access to their online profile can be terminated without notice in 
certain circumstances including: 
Your financial institution attempts to charge back a transfer on the basis of a dispute related 
to a transfer
Based on the information provided, Im satisfied that MoneyGram has acted fairly and in line 
with their terms and conditions in reviewing and closing Mr Ds account. As a result, I wont 
be asking MoneyGram to do anything.
In summary, I recognise Mr D has been inconvenienced and feels unhappy about the closing 
of the account. I realise hell be disappointed by my decision, but overall, based on the 
evidence Ive seen, I cant say MoneyGram have acted unreasonably and treated Mr D 
unfairly when they reviewed and closed his account. 
My final decision
My final decision is I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 April 2021.
