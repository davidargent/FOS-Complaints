DRN-2719865
The complaint
Mr H is unhappy AXA Insurance UK Plc registered a fault claim against him which impacted 
his no claims bonus (NCB) and meant his policy premiums increased. 
What happened
The details of the case are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them in full again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
Mr H has made several complaints relating to this claim which are being dealt with under 
different references at this service.  This decision only relates to complaint points outlined 
above.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
Mr H admitted he collided with the rear of a third-party vehicle. The third party made 
a claim for damage. It would be usual in circumstances such as this, for the claim to 
be recorded as fault against Mr H. He admitted responsibility and AXA would have 
been liable to pay for accident related damage to the third-party vehicle to be 
repaired. So, I dont think AXA did anything wrong in recording the claim how it did at 
that time.
A fault claim can impact a no claims discount and be taken into account by an 
insurer when deciding what to charge for a policy. 
AXAs decision on liability has been considered under a different reference at this 
service so I wont comment further on that here. 
For the reasons above, I do not uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Hs complaint against AXA Insurance UK Plc.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2021.
