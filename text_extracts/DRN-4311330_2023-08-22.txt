The complaint
Ms L complains that NewDay Ltd completed a balance transfer from her credit card account 
to another credit card account when she wanted a money transfer.
What happened
In January 2022, Ms L called NewDay and asked if she could make a money transfer to her 
current account as she needed to make a purchase. NewDay explained that, although Ms L 
had done this before, there was no offer for her to do so at this time. NewDay said Ms L 
could increase her card limit as there was an offer available and that she could then 
compete a balance transfer to another credit card account she held. Ms L agreed to this and 
NewDay completed a balance transfer to another of her credit cards.
Ms L later complained to NewDay that she hadnt wanted a balance transfer and that 
NewDay hadnt explained what it had done. Ms L believes that she paid interest on the 
balance on both credit cards. NewDay didnt uphold Ms Ls complaint and said its adviser 
explained to Ms L what was available to her at the time and told her of the charges she 
would incur. NewDay said it thought Ms L was fully aware that the transaction she approved 
was a balance transfer and not a money transfer.
Ms L brought the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service where one of our 
Investigators looked into things. The Investigator thought that NewDay didnt make it clear to 
Ms L what the difference between a balance transfer and a money transfer was. The 
Investigator felt that NewDay should pay Ms L £400 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience caused and refund the balance transfer charge and any interest occurred 
because of the balance transfer.
I reached a significantly different outcome to that of our Investigator, so I issued a provisional 
decision and asked Ms L and NewDay for any further comments. In my provisional decision I 
said I intended saying NewDay didnt do anything significantly wrong. 
Ive received comments from both NewDay and Ms L and Im now in a position to make my 
final decision. NewDay said it had no further comments and I will address the relevant 
comments provided by Ms L in my final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Ms L will be disappointed with my final decision, but Ive decided not to uphold 
the complaint. I will now explain why.
Theres no dispute that NewDay completed the balance transfer to another of Ms Ls credit 
cards, so my decision will focus on whether NewDay reasonably explained to Ms L what it 
would do and whether NewDays explanation was enough for Ms L to make an informed 
decision to proceed. This seems to me to be the crux of Ms Ls complaint as in her 
comments to me Ms L re-affirms her view that NewDay didnt tell her there would be a 
charge for the balance transfer. Ive listened to the telephone call from January 2022 again 
and Im satisfied NewDay specifically told Ms L the charge would be £26.91, and that Ms L 
agreed to this.
During the call in January, Ms L said shed previously used her NewDay card to provide a 
money transfer to her current account and asked NewDay if she could do this again. 
NewDay explained there was no current money transfer offer available on the account. Ms L 
explained she needed the cash to purchase goods, so after reviewing the account NewDay 
said that Ms L was able to increase her credit card limit and that if she wished she could use 
the increase to make a balance transfer to another credit card account. Ms L asked what the 
difference between a money transfer and a balance transfer was. NewDay explained a 
money transfer can only be made to a bank and a balance transfer would transfer money to 
another credit card. Ive seen that the charges and interest applied to a money transfer and 
balance transfer are the same.
Ms L says that NewDay tried to complete the balance transfer to more than one card. I 
accept this is what happened, but Ms L initially asked NewDay to try a balance transfer to 
her current account. NewDay said it would try this, but when it didnt work NewDay again 
explained a balance transfer couldnt be made to a current account. Ms L then provided 
credit card details for the balance transfer to be made and the balance transfer completed to 
the credit card Ms L provided.
Im satisfied NewDay provided Ms L with enough information for her to make an informed 
decision to proceed with a balance transfer. And NewDay made it reasonably clear that a 
money transfer wasnt available to Ms L at this time. In my opinion, having listened to the call 
in January, Im satisfied NewDay told Ms L what the transfer charge was for the balance 
transfer. NewDay also highlighted the current interest rate on Ms Ls credit card account.
Ms L initially said shed been paying interest on the balance transferred and interest on her 
other credit card account  where the balance transferred was sent to. In this case NewDay 
transferred the agreed amount to Ms Ls other credit card on 25 January. Ms L then promptly 
arranged a transfer for the full amount from her other credit card back to her NewDay 
account  I think this supports Ms L had a reasonable understanding of the balance transfer 
process. Ms L now accepts that she paid off the full balance transfer shed taken from her 
NewDay account within a month  and, having reviewed the statements from NewDay I 
havent seen that the balance transfer on this account accrued any interest. So, Im not 
persuaded Ms L was paying interest on the balance transfer to both NewDay and the other 
credit card where the balance transfer was sent to. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive detailed above, Ive decided that NewDay Ltd didnt do anything 
significantly wrong and I havent upheld Ms Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 September 2023.
