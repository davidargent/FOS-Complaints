K820x#14complaint
Mr H repaid his Halifax-branded Bank of Scotland plc mortgage in 2013. When he more 
recently reviewed all the paperwork he was sent after his mortgage account  was closed, he 
had some queries  about it. Mr H noticed  some insurance premiums that he said he hadnt 
agreed to.
background
Mr H took out his first Halifax mortgage in 1976.  In 1998 he took a further advance as he 
was getting divorced and needed  to buy out his wifes interest  in the property.
The mortgage ran to term and was fully repaid in April 2013.
In 2019 Mr H complained  to Halifax.  Hed found  references to insurance in the bundle  of 
papers hed received when his mortgage  was repaid, and he said he never had insurance 
with Halifax.
Although events had taken place so many years  ago and would have fallen outwith our 
jurisdiction, Halifax gave  its consent  to us considering matters.
Our investigator explained to Mr H what the various references to insurance were. Mr H 
didnt agree and so its been passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I trust Mr H wont take it as a discourtesy that Ive condensed his complaint  in the way that 
I have. Ours is an informal dispute  resolution  service, and Ive concentrated on what  
I consider to be the crux of the complaint.
I dont doubt that this is very important for Mr H but although Ive read and considered  the 
whole file Ill keep  my comments to what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any specific  
point its not because Ive not considered  it but because I dont think I need  to comment  on it 
in order to reach the right outcome. This service  is impartial between, and independent  from, 
consumers and businesses. What this means  is that we dont represent either party,  and I 
dont act under eithers instructions or take directions on how a complaint will be looked at or 
what questions should be asked or answered.
I would like to start by reassuring Mr H that a lot of the things he thinks  happened didnt. 
There was no hidden  insurance thats been charged; much  of the complaint seems to have 
come about  due to Mr H conflating various  different things,  which  is entirely understandable 
considering were dealing with events  between 1976  and 2003.
Although Mr H doesnt recall it, he did take out building insurance (otherwise known as 
property insurance) with his mortgage in 1976.  This is shown on the 1976 mortgage offer 
AMOUNT OF PROPERTY INSURANCE  £9500 . 
Until fairly  late on in our process we didnt have much more  information than that until Mr H 
sent us a letter dated 16 March 2020  and within that he enclosed  a picture of his original 
Ref: DRN36444412insurance details.  This comprised a letter to Mr H from the insurer  Halifax used at the time 
dated 14 September 1976 which said
We are proceeding  with the insurance  of your property in accordance with your 
recent instructions.
Sum Insured £9500
The Halifax Building Society will now be advised of the insurance cover  being 
arranged.
As that letter was addressed directly to Mr H at the time then it seems likely that he was 
aware of the building/property insurance  that had been arranged.
The building/property  insurance continued, being renewed each year, until Mr H phoned 
Halifax on 29 September 2003.  The contact  note for that date states Mr H called  to cancel 
from renewal. The renewal date each year was 1 October, so he had cover until 
30 September 2003. That ties in with the earliest  insurance policy  Mr H has sent us for his 
own insurance which started on 1 October  2003.
The paperwork Mr H sent us that hed received in his data subject access request from 
Halifax shows the following relating to the building/property insurance:

28 September 1981 £32.85
30 September 1981 £19,646 £32,85
30 September 1982 £21,082 £35.45
7 October 1982 £35.45
30 September 1983 £22,127 £37.00
30 September 1984 £23,403 £38.60
30 September 1985 £24,733 £43.20
30 September 1986 £25,885 £51.20
30 September 1987 £27,507 £54.50
Ive only listed the insurance transactions up until 1987 as they just continued  in the same  
pattern from then, other than in April 1998  when  a one-off additional  premium  of £14.12 was 
charged because  at that time the building/property sum insured was increased to £59,000. 
That increase came about because a valuation of Mr Hs property was undertaken as part of 
his further advance application  and the surveyor gave £59,000 as the amount the building 
needed to be insured  for in the event it needed  to be entirely  rebuilt.
Mr H would have received the renewal notices, which would  have included  details of what 
the annual premium would be, a few weeks before the renewal dates. Each year the 
premium would be added to Mr Hs mortgage  account and then he could either pay it off as a 
Ref: DRN36444413lump sum (as he did until 1983) or leave them to accrue on the mortgage  account. Leaving 
them on the mortgage account  meant interest  would be charged on them.  
Im satisfied Mr H must have been  aware  of the building/property insurance and received the 
renewal notices as he actively paid  in 1977  the £15.85 premium to his mortgage account 
a week before it was charged to his mortgage.  Mr H also paid his premium early  in 1979 and 
1981, on the due dates  in 1978 and 1980, and soon after the due date in 1982.
Having considered everything, I think its more likely than not that Mr H was aware he had 
this building/property  insurance with Halifaxs chosen insurer  and latterly Halifax - and that 
he chose to keep  renewing it annually until he cancelled it in 2003.
Mr H has queried the mortgage  guarantee policy of £815. This is what  is now known as a 
higher lending charge and previously as a mortgage  indemnity guarantee. Its a fee 
sometimes charged by a lender if the amount of borrowing requested  exceeds  a certain loan 
to value level. The reason for the fee is the extra risk involved to the lender when lending  at 
a higher loan to value level. 
The fee is generally used by the lender to purchase an insurance policy. The policy is 
designed to protect  the lender against a potential  shortfall that the business may incur  if the 
mortgage falls behind, the business has to repossess and sell the property, but the price 
achieved fails to cover the amount  lent in full. The customer pays the fee in order for the 
lender to consent to the mortgage. The one-off fee of £32.60  for the insurance  was debited 
to Mr Hs mortgage account in 1976 when the mortgage started. The only way Mr H could 
have avoided paying that £32.60 one-off fee would have  been to borrow  less than 75% of 
the propertys  value.
If Mr H had any queries about  either the need for the policy,  or how the premium was 
calculated, then he needed to raise those  in 1976. Were unable to tell Mr H any more  than I 
have now due to the fact this happened  over 40 years ago.
I understand Mr H is concerned that a policy was started in 1998,  but that didnt happen. A 
quote for life cover  was included in the mortgage  illustration that was provided  for the further 
advance, but it clearly  states that is for illustrative purposes only.  Mr H then went  on to meet  
with a Halifax adviser the following day when  Mr Hs existing cover with another provider 
was discussed.  A week later Mr H phoned the adviser to confirm he was proceeding with the 
further advance  without life cover. 
If a policy  had been sold to Mr H at that time it wouldnt just have been incorporated into his 
mortgage payments  never to be seen, or mentioned, again. Instead Mr H would have had 
letters automatically sent to him setting out his mortgage payment and his separate  life 
cover, he would have  received a welcome pack for the policy and regular statements setting 
out his cover and ongoing  premiums. Halifax simply had no way of supressing all that 
information and hiding a policy from Mr H as he believes.
Finally, Mr H has queried £10.50% thats  on his 1976 mortgage offer, He says he doesnt 
know why our investigator has assumed the % is correct, rather than the £. Thats  very easy 
to answer. Its because the title immediately above  £10.50% says RATE OF INTEREST 
so it must be 10.50% rather than £10.50 otherwise that wouldnt make  sense with the title of 
the column.
Ref: DRN36444414This can also be checked by running  a £7,335 repayment mortgage with a 25-year term and 
a 10.50% interest rate through a mortgage calculator, and that gives you a monthly payment 
equal to that quoted in the mortgage  offer.
Having carefully considered everything  Im satisfied  the only insurance  policy  Mr H had with 
Halifax (or for the early  years, with Halifaxs preferred insurer)  was his building/property  
insurance that he applied for in 1976  and cancelled in 2003.  Im also satisfied he was aware  
of the policy  as he actively paid the premiums for the first seven years,  and thereafter would 
have received annual renewal packs. 
As Mr H chose  to have that insurance, and the mortgage guarantee policy  was compulsory if 
Mr H wanted to borrow the amount he did, then no refund is due to him.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  Under  the rules of the Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im 
required to ask Mr H to accept or reject  my decision before 21 January 2021.
