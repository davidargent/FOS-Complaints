The complaint
Mr T complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) did not fairly compensate him 
after it mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) alongside a loan. 
What happened
In September 2007, Mr T took out a loan with NatWest. At the same time, he was sold a 
single premium PPI policy for £365. As this was a single premium policy, Mr T borrowed 
extra on top of his loan to pay for it. That means he also had to pay interest on the cost of 
the PPI. 
Sometime later, Mr T complained to NatWest about the sale of PPI. On 26 March 2021, 
NatWest told Mr T that it had upheld his PPI complaint. It initially offered £639.67 to settle 
the complaint. However, in that same letter, NatWest also said that it would arrange for 
payment to be made to Mr T subject to clearance of any arrears he had outstanding on his 
loan. The offer was updated to £641.50 because payment appears to have been made to Mr 
T a little bit after the letter was sent out to him. 
Mr T told us that NatWest only paid him £113.89, instead of the full amount he was 
expecting. He complained to this service. Mr T said that he couldnt understand why he had 
been paid the full amount and that his last account with NatWest had been in 2009. He did 
not recall having an outstanding debt with NatWest. 
In response, NatWest told us that Mr Ts loan was due to run for five years from 2007, but no 
payments were made to the account after 2010. In September 2013, a total of £824.01 was 
written off. 
In 2017, NatWest reduced the outstanding balance of the loan account by £101.05 because 
it had not given Mr T the right documentation in respect of the arrears. NatWest refers to this 
as a NOSIA refund. Once that amount had been deducted, the outstanding balance was 
£722.96. 
Our adjudicator looked at all of this and she thought it was fair for NatWest to keep some of 
the compensation back to reduce the outstanding loan balance. Mr T did not agree with our 
adjudicators view. He didnt think NatWest could keep this money back and he referred our 
adjudicator to the Limitation Act. 
As Mr T did not accept what our adjudicator said, the matter has been passed to me to make 
a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to disappoint Mr T, but Im satisfied it was fair for NatWest to keep some of the 
compensation back to reduce Mr Ts outstanding loan balance. Ill explain why below. 
As the parties agree PPI was mis-sold, I dont need to look at what happened at the point of 
sale. Im just looking at whether NatWest fairly compensated Mr T for that mis-sale. 
Was NatWests calculation fair? 
In deciding whether NatWest offered fair compensation, I would expect it to return Mr T to 
the position he would have been in if PPI had never been sold in the first place. As this was 
a single premium policy, Id expect NatWest to work out the extra Mr T paid each month 
because of the PPI, along with 8% simple interest on each payment from when he paid it 
until the refund is made. 
Ive considered the calculations NatWest sent us at some length. As I said above, the cost of 
the PPI policy was £365. And if the loan had run to term, Mr T would have paid £253.82 in 
interest on the PPI premium. 
However, looking at the information NatWest sent to us, it looks as though Mr T ran into 
some financial difficulties in 2010 and it seems as though the last payment towards the loan 
was made by Mr T in or around August 2010 when there were still two years left to run on 
the loan. It looks as though the PPI policy was cancelled around this time as well. 
As there was an outstanding loan balance, that means part of the PPI premium had not been 
paid for. NatWest calculated that Mr T paid £360.98 for the PPI. When the policy was 
cancelled, a PPI rebate of £62.49 was paid into the loan account. That means there was 
£195.35 left to pay for the PPI policy. 
So, for its starting point, NatWest used the £360.98 Mr T had actually paid for the PPI policy. 
I can see it has calculated net 8% simple interest at £280.52, which I am satisfied was 
calculated in respect of each repayment Mr T made for PPI.  The total PPI refund came to 
£641.50 as set out above. 
On that basis, I am satisfied the way NatWest calculated Mr Ts PPI compensation was fair. 
Was it fair for NatWest to keep some of Mr Ts compensation back? 
As set out above, NatWest kept some of Mr Ts compensation back to repay what it said was 
an outstanding balance on the loan account. 
I know that Mr T said he had no recollection of the debt NatWest says he still owes. I accept 
that what he told us is what he genuinely remembers about his dealings with NatWest. But 
looking at the electronic information thats been provided to us, Im satisfied he took a loan 
out in 2007. Although he made some repayments towards that borrowing, he didnt manage 
to pay it all back in full. 
In 2013, NatWest decided to write off the outstanding debt. What that means in practice is 
that the debt did not go away, NatWest just decided not to take any action to recover it. Mr T 
referred our adjudicator to the provisions in the Limitation Act. But it seems to me that whilst 
this statute may prevent NatWest from taking action in the county court to recover the debt, it 
does not extinguish the debt. It just means NatWest cant go to court to get it back.
In any event, my role in a case like this is to decide whats fair and reasonable. When two 
people  or a person and a business  owe each other money, it seems only fair that they 
each pay what they owe. So in this case, NatWest owes Mr T some money for mis-sold PPI,  
but Mr T still owes NatWest some money from the loan he took out, but didnt pay back in 
full. 
Both of these debts relate to the same loan account, so Im satisfied it is fair for NatWest to 
keep back some of Mr Ts PPI compensation to repay the outstanding balance on his loan 
account. 
Was the amount NatWest kept back fair? 
As I said above, NatWest calculated Mr Ts total compensation to be £641.50. The 
outstanding balance on the account was £722.96. 
NatWest took out the £195.35, which was the amount left in the outstanding balance that 
related to PPI. After that amount was deducted, £527.61 was left outstanding to pay on the 
loan. NatWest deducted that from the £641.50 it owed Mr T. That leaves £113.89, which is the amount that was paid directly to Mr T. It follows that I am satisfied NatWests offer was 
fair. 
I am sorry to disappoint Mr T, but after considering this matter at some length, I havent 
upheld the complaint. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint about National Westminster Bank Plc. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2022.
