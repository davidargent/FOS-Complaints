The complaint
Mr B complains that a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn No. 1 Limited, under 
which a car was supplied to him, was mis-sold to him.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr B under a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn that he 
electronically signed in June 2020. He complained to Moneybarn in October 2020 that he 
couldnt afford the insurance premiums, that hed been pressurised into signing the 
agreement and that he shouldnt have been allowed to enter into it because of his medical 
issues.
It said that it wasnt made aware of any concerns regarding his health or wellbeing until he 
complained to it, he should complain to the dealer about its conduct and it was his 
responsibility to check the maintenance costs of the car, including insurance. He wasnt 
satisfied with its response so complained to this service. He says that he agreed a payment 
holiday with Moneybarn but its recorded missed payments on his credit file and hes 
proposed an amount that he thinks would be fair for him to pay for the car.
Our investigator recommended that his complaint should be upheld in part. He didnt 
consider that the agreement had been mis-sold to Mr B or that Moneybarn needed to agree 
to the proposal that hed made so he said that he should still make his monthly repayments 
of £391.41. He said that Moneybarns system notes appear to support what Mr B had said 
about a three month payment holiday so, unless it could supply further proof that it wasnt 
agreed, he recommended that it should remove the late payment markers and any adverse 
information it had recorded on Mr Bs credit file in relation to this matter. He also said that it 
should pay Mr B £50 compensation for the inconvenience caused. 
Moneybarn has accepted those recommendation but Mr B has asked for his complaint to be 
referred to an ombudsman. He has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst 
other things, that:
he wasnt of sound mind and Moneybarn advised him that he shouldnt have been 
sold the car due to his medical issues;
he was on medication at the time he entered into the agreement but had to stop 
taking it after the payments commenced for the car as he could no longer afford the 
prescriptions;
he was made aware of his options for ending the agreement but his complaint is that 
Moneybarn felt that the agreement was mis-sold so should be null and void;
hes not been able to afford to have the car serviced because of his financial 
difficulties and hes had to use an unplanned overdraft every month to pay for diesel 
for the car; and
his insurance premium for this car is more than £100 more each month than the 
insurance for his previous car and the dealer obtained an inaccurate quote with 
invalid information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
I sympathise with Mr B for the medical issues and financial difficulties that hes 
described and Ive taken them into account, including the medical evidence that hes 
provided;
Mr B electronically signed the conditional sale agreement and his then partner made 
an advance payment of £200 for the car on his behalf and he agreed to make 59 
monthly payments of £391.41 for the car to be supplied to him;
he also electronically signed a document which explained his proposed finance 
agreement in which his net monthly income was confirmed as £2,025.65 and his non-
discretionary monthly expenditure was confirmed to be not more than £1,090.45;
I consider it to be more likely than not that Mr B provided information to the dealer 
about his income and expenditure or that he was aware of the information that it was 
using before he signed the document;
that information showed that he had discretionary monthly expenditure of £935.20 so 
I consider that Moneybarn made proportionate checks about the affordability of the 
credit before Mr B entered into the conditional sale agreement and that it was 
reasonable for it to conclude that he could afford the monthly payment of £391.41 at 
the time that the car was supplied to him;
Mr B went to the dealer with his then partner and Ive seen no evidence to show that 
either the dealer or Moneybarn was made aware of his medical issues at that time or 
that Moneybarn shouldnt have provided credit to him because of those issues  
Moneybarn says that it didnt become aware of his medical issues until he 
complained to it in October 2020;
in June 2020, when Mr B signed the agreement, I dont consider that Moneybarn 
knew, or ought to have known, about his medical issues and I consider that it was fair 
or reasonable for it to provide credit to him at that time  hes now provided evidence 
of his medical issues but hes still bound by the agreement that he signed and those 
medical issues dont mean that Moneybarn is now required to end the agreement;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Moneybarn has agreed 
that the agreement was mis-sold to Mr B or that it should be ended;
Mr B says that the dealer provided him with an insurance quote for the car which was 
based on inaccurate and invalid information  but it was Mr Bs responsibility to 
insure the car and I consider it to be more likely than not that any quote that was 
provided by the dealer was only indicative and was obtained to help him  I dont 
consider that it was required to do that or that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require Moneybarn to accept any responsibility for that quote;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the agreement was mis-
sold to Mr B or that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Moneybarn to 
accept the proposal that Mr B has made for his repayments;
theres no clear evidence to show that Moneybarn had agreed a payment holiday for 
Mr B between October and December 2020 but I can see why he understood from 
the information contained in Moneybarns system notes that he thought that he didnt need to make payments during that period;
our investigator invited Moneybarn to supply further proof that a three month 
payment holiday wasnt agreed  it hasnt done so but has accepted his 
recommendations and has agreed to remove adverse information from Mr Bs credit 
file and to pay him £50 compensation;
Mr B didnt make his monthly payments during that period and Moneybarn has 
recorded missed payments on his credit file;
hes continued not to make payments to Moneybarn since December 2020 and it has 
recorded missed payments on his credit file  although hed complained to 
Moneybarn (and then to this service) he was required to make the monthly payments 
for the car which had been supplied to me; 
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Moneybarn to 
remove any adverse information relating to the monthly payments for October to 
December 2020 that its recorded on Mr Bs credit file (and it has agreed to do so);
I consider that the missed payments that its recorded since then are a true and 
accurate record of his payment history so it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to 
require it to remove the adverse information about those missed payments from his 
credit file;
I suggest that Mr B contacts Moneybarn to discuss his options under the agreement, 
the arrears on his account and his financial difficulties  its required to respond to 
those difficulties positively and sympathetically;
these events will have caused distress and inconvenience for Mr B  and its clear 
that hes angry and has very strongly feelings about this matter  but I find that it 
would be fair and reasonable for Moneybarn to pay him £50 to compensate him for 
that distress and inconvenience and Im not persuaded that compensation of more 
than that amount is justified in these circumstances; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Moneybarn to allow Mr B to return the car and end the conditional sale agreement, to 
pay him any more compensation than the £50 referred to above or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint other than removing the information from his 
credit file.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Moneybarn to remove 
any adverse information relating to the monthly payments for October to December 2020 
that its recorded on Mr Bs credit file. I also find that it should pay him £50 to compensate 
him for the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and I order Moneybarn No. 1 Limited to:
1. Remove any adverse information relating to the monthly payments for October to 
December 2020 that its recorded on Mr Bs credit file.
2. Pay £50 to Mr B to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes 
been caused.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2022. Jarrod Hastings
