The complaint
Miss D complained that PayrNet Limited (PayrNet) restricted and then closed her Pockit 
account and that it has not returned all the funds in it. 
What happened
Miss D held a Pockit account. Pockit Limited is an electronic money agent of PayrNet 
Limited, which in turn issues the Pockit Card, a prepaid card.
In December 2020 PayrNet sought information from Miss D about the source of funds which 
had been credited to her account. It also asked her to provide updated identity documents. 
In the meantime, it restricted her account, so she could not use the payment card.
In July 2021 PayrNet told Miss D that it was closing the account. It said she did not need to 
do anything, as the account balance was nil. Miss D questioned that; she thought she had 
around £500 in the account. PayrNet said that funds in the account had been returned to 
source. In fact, that had not been possible, since the funds had been paid in cash at a 
PayPoint (rather than being transferred from a bank account, for example). They remained 
with PayrNet.
PayrNet asked Miss D to provide her bank account details and a copy of a bank statement 
so that it could return the funds to her. She provided that information in August 2021. 
PayrNet did not however return the funds to her, and the bank account she had then is now 
closed.
Miss D referred the matter to this service. One of our investigators recommended that the 
funds be returned to Miss D. PayrNet said that it had contacted Pockit about the payment, 
but was unable to say when or if it would be made or to explain why it had not been made. 
The case was therefore passed to me so that I could issue a determination which, if 
accepted by Miss D, would be binding on both parties.
On 22 June 2023 I issued a provisional decision. I explained that I was broadly in agreement 
with the investigator about how the matter should be resolved  that is, the funds should be 
returned to Miss D. I thought that PayrNet was within its rights to ask about the source of 
funds and subsequently to close Miss Ds account. I noted however that, although it had said 
that the money would be returned to Miss D, that had not happened. 
I thought however that the investigators recommendation didnt go far enough. I noted that 
Miss D had been deprived of funds for (at the time of my provisional decision) nearly two 
years. She should be compensated for that, by way of an award of interest. I thought too that 
PayrNet should make a further payment of £200, in recognition of the significant 
inconvenience to which Miss D had been put. 
Both PayrNet and Miss D accepted my provisional decision. PayrNet asked that Miss D 
provide details of a bank account to which payment could be made, which she provided.  
Since then, Miss D says she has received two payments  £263.10 on or about 24 August 
2023 and £260 on or about 12 September 2023. I calculate however that the award I 
indicated I would make would have been worth around £730 at the date of my provisional 
decision. Miss D has therefore received about £280 less than PayrNet agreed to pay her and 
which she agreed to accept. 
I have therefore reviewed the case afresh, in part with a view to making a binding decision 
which Miss D can enforce, should that be necessary.     
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I have said, the parties were in agreement about how Miss Ds complaint should be 
resolved. PayrNet has not however done in full what it agreed it to. 
The investigator indicated to PayrNet that, in the circumstances, I would consider increasing 
my award in recognition of the distress and inconvenience caused by the continuing failure 
to resolve this matter. On reflection, I believe that a payment of £300 in respect of this 
aspect of the complaint would be fair. 
I also note that the payments which PayrNet has made have not included any explanation of 
how they have been calculated. In the circumstances, I think Miss D should be provided with 
that, so she can be sure that my award has been paid in full. I will therefore require PayrNet 
to provide calculations in respect of all payments made  including those made on or about 
24 August and 12 September 2023. 
My final decision
For these reasons, my final decision is to uphold Miss Ds complaint. To resolve it in full, 
PayrNet Limited should place Miss D in the position she would have been in if, following my 
provisional decision, it had paid her:
£448.40, the sum held to her credit when her account was closed;
interest on that sum at 8% a year simple from 30 July 2021 (the day on which it said it 
had returned the money) until payment; and 
£300 in recognition of the inconvenience to which Miss D has been put. 
PayrNet Limited should also provide Miss D with calculations showing the payments made, 
including the dates and the interest added. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 November 2023.
