The complaint
Mrs H and Mr I complain about their loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank Limited that they 
used to pay for some holiday club membership points. 
What happened
Mrs H and Mr I entered into an acquisition agreement with a holiday company in October 
2019 to buy some holiday club membership points to upgrade the trial membership that 
theyd bought in June 2019. The price of the points was £16,265 and they entered into a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank for a loan to pay that amount to the holiday 
company  the loan agreement also consolidated the outstanding amount that they owed for 
their trial membership so the total amount of the loan was £20,350. They agreed to make 
180 monthly payments of £235.15 to Shawbrook Bank. 
Mrs H and Mr I wrote to Shawbrook Bank in October 2020 and said that they wanted to 
terminate their loan as the holiday club membership was sold to them in breach of Schedule 
1 of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, that it had been mis-
sold to them under pressure and using misleading information and hard sale tactics. They 
also say that they actually didn't need that product.
Shawbrook Bank said that Mrs H and Mr I were provided with sufficient information and time 
to make a reasoned decision and wouldve been aware of the incentives offered by the 
holiday company. It said that there was no evidence to suggest that they were reluctant to 
accept the recommendations made to them and it was satisfied that they were willing to 
make reasoned decisions based on the information that they received at that time. Mrs H 
and Mr I werent satisfied with its response so they complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. He considered 
their claim under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 but he wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale. He didnt think that the 
contractual terms were likely to be operated unfairly against Mrs H and Mr I, that they agreed 
to the purchase without knowing something that was important to that decision, that the 
holiday companys conduct fell so short of the standard that could have been reasonably 
expected that it made the relationship unfair or that there were any other relevant 
considerations that made the relationship unfair.
Mrs H and Mr I have asked for their complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. They say 
that theyve also made a complaint to this service about the holiday company and that 
Shawbrook Bank has said that it doesnt have a copy of their IDs and it isnt possible to lend 
money to someone without that. They say that there are lots of points of misrepresentation, 
they were told that the membership can be stopped and they were trapped for more than 
eight hours and were forced to sign the documents. They also say that their daughter was 
given an electronic device as an incentive which she signed for  which was unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mrs H and Mr I paid for the holiday club membership points using credit in the form of 
a loan from Shawbrook Bank and, in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs H and Mr Is claims under sections 75 and 
140A in this decision as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering 
whether or not Shawbrook Banks response to their claims was fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances;
Mrs H and Mr I say that theyve also complained to this service about the holiday 
company and theyve provided a separate complaint reference number - but their 
complaint form was about a complaint against Shawbrook Bank, the separate 
complaint reference number is a duplicate of their complaint about Shawbrook Bank 
and isnt active, and Ive not been able to find a complaint by them about the holiday 
company;
if they want to complain about the way that the loan agreement was sold to them by 
the holiday company they would need to complain about that to the holiday company 
and then, if theyre not satisfied with its response, they may be able to make a 
complaint to this service about the holiday company;
Mrs H and Mr I entered into an agreement to buy the points in October 2019 and they 
were also provided with terms and conditions  by signing the acquisition agreement 
Mrs H and Mr I acknowledged that theyd received an information statement which 
would have set out more information about the arrangements for the use of their 
membership  but theyve not provided me with a copy of the information statement;
the holiday company says that Mrs H and Mr I contacted it in January 2020 to book a 
holiday but then, later that month, said that they wanted to cancel their membership 
because theyd not been able to book the hotel they wanted  and that they asked to 
cancel their membership again in March 2020 because they were leaving the UK;
they also entered into the loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank which included their 
right to withdraw from the loan agreement and theyve provided the pre-contract 
credit information and an adequate explanation document that they received;
the loan agreement said that they had the right to withdraw from the loan agreement 
without giving a reason and that the right ended 14 days after the day after the loan 
agreement was executed  the loan agreement also said that they may have the right 
to withdraw from their holiday accommodation contract and that, if they did so, the 
loan agreement would also terminate;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs H and Mr I tried to withdraw from the 
acquisition agreement or the loan agreement within the withdrawal period  and the 
holiday company says that they contacted it to book a holiday in January 2020; 
I can understand Mrs H and Mr I disappointment that they werent able to book the 
holiday that they wanted but Ive seen no evidence to show that the holiday company 
had guaranteed the availability of any accommodation and Im not persuaded that they were entitled to cancel the agreement because the accommodation that they 
wanted to book wasnt available or because they were leaving the UK;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
breached Schedule 1 of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 
2008, that the membership was mis-sold to Mrs H and Mr I or that theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company for which Shawbrook 
Bank would be liable under section 75;
Shawbrook Bank says that a creditworthiness assessment was completed in 
accordance with its regulatory obligations for Mrs H and Mr Is loan application and 
that, from the information it was aware of at the time of their application and the credit 
reference checks it undertook, it considered that the loan was affordable for them;
Ive not been provided with detailed information about the documents that Mrs H and 
Mr I provided to the holiday company but I consider it to be more likely than not that 
they provided the holiday company with enough information to enable it to confirm 
their identities and I dont consider that Shawbrook Bank is required to have copies of 
their IDs;
Ive not been provided with any information to show that the loan wasnt affordable 
for Mrs H and Mr I at the time that it was made to them and Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that Shawbrook Bank acted incorrectly in making 
the loan to them;
Mrs H and Mr I have described the way that the membership was sold to them but 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they were unduly 
pressured into entering into the acquisition agreement or loan agreement in October 
2019, that the holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices against 
them or that it was unfair for it to offer an electronic device as an incentive for them to 
buy the membership points or to ask their daughter to sign for the gift;
Im not persuaded that Mrs H and Mr I have provided enough evidence to show that 
their relationship with Shawbrook Bank was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely 
that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs H and 
Mr I and Shawbrook Bank; 
I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to Mrs H and Mr Is claims under section 
75 and 140A claim was fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mrs H and Mr I for the issues that theyve had with their 
membership and the other difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt 
be fair or reasonable for me to require Shawbrook Bank to refund to them any of the 
money that they paid under the acquisition agreement, to pay them any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs H and Mr Is complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H and Mr I to 
accept or reject my decision before 11 January 2023.
