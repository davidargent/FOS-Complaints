The complaint
Mrs N and Mr N complain that Symmetric Systems Ltd trading as BankSmart (Symmetric)
are unfairly asking them to pay cancellation fees for payment protection insurance (PPI) and
default charge claims.
For ease of reading Ill only refer to Mrs N in my decision.
What happened
Mrs N said she was called around August 2019 and asked whether she wanted to make any
PPI claims. She said shed already done this but said she was persuaded to claim again
before it was too late to make any further PPI claims.
In April 2021, Mrs N said she was asked by Symmetric to complete authorisation forms to
prevent any charges and costs being incurred. Mrs N said she was concerned about what
the charges and costs could be for and said she was dismayed to find she was possibly
going to be asked to pay around £3,000. Mrs N said she asked Symmetric what these costs
were for and was told shed 30 claims with them. She asked for further details and found
there were 14 PPI claims and 14 default charge claims. She complained to Symmetric.
Symmetric said theyd notified Mrs N in April 2019 that the claims shed authorised another
claims management company (CMC) to look into for her and her husband had been
transferred over to them. In August 2019 shed signed their letter of authority (LoA)
authorising them to act on her behalf for both PPI and default charge claims for 14 lenders.
Symmetric said Mrs N had agreed to the other CMCS terms and conditions when she
signed their LoA and letter of engagement (LoE) in 2018. These terms said if she didnt
respond with the information needed to pursue her claims they would consider shed
cancelled her agreement with them and would charge her for the work theyd done. As Mrs
N hadnt returned required documents and had asked them to stop working for her, theyd
cancelled her agreement with them and charged their fee in line with the terms and 
conditions shed agreed. Symmetric asked Mrs N to pay £3,297.90 for the work theyd done
for her. But said if Mrs N settled within 30 days, theyd reduce their fees to £900.
Mrs N wasnt happy with Symmetrics response. She reiterated she didnt know about all the
claims and hadnt authorised Symmetric to make these claims for her. She referred her
complaint to us.
Our investigator said Symmetrics cancellation and breach of contract fees werent justified
where there was no evidence of PPI, or the claim had already been dealt with by the lender.
Neither could they charge their fees for default charge claims as the lenders hadnt been
contacted so there was no likelihood of success. She did detail several charges she said it
was fair for Symmetric to charge. These were for Mrs N failing to return signed LoAs and for
a couple of claims that were still on going. She asked Symmetric to recalculate their fees
based on the terms and conditions Mrs N had agreed to.
Symmetric accepted the investigators outcome and recalculated the fee based on this. They
said the fee would equate to 13.78 hours of work payable at £50 per hour plus VAT, in total
£689.
Mrs N didnt agree as she said she shouldnt have to pay for any work done as she hadnt
authorised Symmetric to do this. She asked for an ombudsman to decide.
I issued a provisional decision in April 2022 that said: 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im currently minded to uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
Were an informal dispute resolution service, acting as an alternative to the courts. This
means were impartial and look at both sides of the story. We dont place more weight on
one sides story because of who they are. We ask questions and weigh up all the information
were given. Where there is a different version of events as is the case here, I will decide
what I think most likely happened. And whether Symmetric has acted fairly and reasonably
in their actions with Mrs N.
Symmetric said Mrs N initially signed up for the services of another CMC. But, in April 2019,
the claims were transferred to Symmetric from the other CMC. Symmetric said they
contacted the other CMCs clients, explained about the transfer and asked them to complete
another LoA. They said the terms of the agreement with the other CMC hadnt changed.
They said they also gave their details should Mrs N need to contact them along with log in
details for their on-line portal. Symmetric has provided a generic copy of the letter they sent
to the former CMCs clients but not the actual copy of the one they sent to Mrs N.
Symmetric has also provided a signed LoA for mis-sold PPI claims, and a signed LoA for
default charge claims in their name as well as signed LoAs and a LoE for the other CMC.
The LoE for the other CMC was signed in January 2018. Symmetric has also shown the
other CMCs signed LoA for a PPI claim for a lender Ill call C solely in Mrs Ns name dated
January 2018. And another signed LoA for a packaged bank account claim for a bank Ill call
L signed by both Mrs N and Mr N in February 2018.
Symmetric LoAs are dated August 2019 and appear to have been pre-populated with a list
of 11 lenders, that include the lenders form the previous CMCs LoAs, C and L. There are 
also handwritten details added about another three lenders. The LoAs show personal details
for Mrs N, with only a single signature in her name. Symmetric havent provided their terms
and conditions as they say the terms and conditions of the previous CMC remained relevant
as Mrs N had a legally binding contract with them.  
Ive looked at the other CMCs terms and conditions about cancellation and these say:
You have the right to cancel this agreement without charge by contacting us within 14 days
of the start of this agreement
And go to say:
Should you decide to cancel the agreement at any stage after this period, you may do so,
however we reserve the right to charge you a reasonable fee based on the work we have
completed at the time of the cancellation. This fee will be based on an hourly rate of £50.
The LoAs were signed in January and February 2018, Symmetic said Mrs N didnt cancel
the agreement until April 2021 so shed cancelled outside of the 14-day cooling off period.
And this meant they could charge the cancellation and breach of contract fees for all the
claims theyd for her.
Symmetric has accepted that some of the cancellation fees charged werent justified andrecalculated the cancellation fees based on the other CMCs terms and conditions, reducing
the fees theyre charging Mrs N to £689. So, in reaching my decision I will consider whether
this fee is fair and reasonable.
The revised charges relate to references 49**20, 49**21, 49**24, 49**25 for lender B,
49**26 for lender N, 49**27 for lender R and 49**28 for lender H. All of these were
lenders were pre-populated on the Symmetric LoA signed in August 2019. And so werent
related to the claims for C and L Mrs N had agreed with the other CMC in 2018.
The letter Symmetric sent in April 2019 said theyd taken over the claims Mrs N had
registered with the other CMC and that they would pursue these claims for her. So, Id
consider the claims that were registered were for C and L only. The terms and conditions
also say that for any successful claim a fee of 39% would be charged. But in July 2018 a fee
cap of 20% plus VAT was introduced.
The Symmetric LoA that was signed in August 2019 was for them to pursue claims, PPI and
default charge for a further 12 lenders. As there werent registered with the other CMC, Id
consider them to be new claims and not a continuation of the existing agreement. And being
a new agreement, I would have expected Symmetric to have asked Mrs N to read and agree
to their terms and conditions (CMCOB 4.2. 8 (3)). Which should have also explained the new
fee structure and the services Symmetric would provide.
And if Mrs N had seen and agreed to Symmetrics terms and conditions, she would have had
the opportunity of a 14 day cooling off period to decide whether she did or didnt want to
pursue the claims. She would also have known what she needed to do to cancel the
agreement and what the consequences of cancelling the agreement would be (CMCOB
4.2.8 (12)). I havent seen any evidence to show Mrs N had seen or agreed to Symmetrics
terms and conditions for these new claims.
As Mrs N had only agreed to the terms and conditions shed seen in January and February
2018, that applied to one PPI claim and one default charge claim, for C and L. I dont
think these terms and conditions can be applied to the new claims begun with Symmetric in
August 2019. And as Mrs N hadnt seen or agreed to Symmetrics terms and conditions when 
the new LoA was signed in August 2019, I dont think Symmetric provided the information
and advice it should have in line with the relevant guidance. So, I dont think Mrs N can be
charged a fee for the cancellation or breach of contract for this agreement as she hadnt
agreed to the terms and conditions that I think would have needed to be applied.
Overall, I dont think Symmetric has treated Mrs N fairly. I dont think its communicated with
her as clearly as they should have done. So, I intend to direct Symmetric to remove all of the
charges theyve asked Mrs N to pay.
Mrs N has said she has been caused a lot of stress and sleepless nights worrying about the
charges that Symmetric were asking her to pay. And I think this must have been a very
distressing time for her, I think Symmetric has caused Mrs N unnecessary trouble and
upset. So, I intend to direct Symmetric to pay her £150 for the trouble and upset that has
been caused.  
Responses to my provisional decision
Mrs N accepted my provisional decision. And I havent been asked to consider any further 
comments or evidence by Symmetrics. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. And ask Symmetric Systems Ltd trading as BankSmart to:waive all cancellation and breach of contract charges; and
pay Mrs N £150 for trouble and upset.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs N and Mr N to 
accept or reject my decision before 2 June 2022.
