K821x#15complaint
Mr K complains that PDL Finance Limited,  trading as Mr Lender, lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr K took out 22 loans  with Mr Lender between April 2014  and December 2017. The amount 
of the loans varied between £200  and £1,500. Mr Lender hasnt been able to provide us with 
the applications or loan agreements but it appears likely that the larger  loans may have been 
instalment loans. Mr K repaid all of the loans he had with Mr Lender. A summary of Mr Ks 
borrowing from Mr Lender is shown as an appendix  to this decision.
Mr K says that every time he repaid a loan he needed to borrow again.  He says that he 
couldnt afford to repay what hed borrowed.  He wants a refund of the interest he paid. 
In response to Mr Ks complaint, Mr Lender  offered  to refund interest Mr K paid in relation to 
loans six to 12. Mr K didnt accept that offer. 
One of our adjudicators assessed  Mr Ks complaint. She noted that Mr Lender  had made  an 
offer in relation to loans  six to 12. The adjudicator said that Mr Lender  shouldnt have given 
Mr K loans two to five or 13-22 either.  She set out what it should do to put matters right. 
Mr Lender disagreed with the adjudicators assessment in part but accepted the 
adjudicators recommendations in relation to loans six to 16. Mr K didnt accept that. 
Mr Lender said:
In relation to loans  two to five, it didnt  agree  that there was a significant risk that 
Mr K wouldnt be able to meet his existing commitment as the loans were in the early  
borrowing history and it carried out an expenditure assessment, which showed Mr K 
could repay  them.
There was a gap of over four months between loan 16 and 17. So, loan 17 was a 
new chain of borrowing which required different checks. Mr K provided bank 
statements, which showed he had no other short-term loans and the repayments  
were affordable. 
In relation to loans  18-22, it asked  Mr K additional questions. His answers showed 
that he wasnt in financial difficulty and the loans  were  affordable.  
As Mr Ks complaint hasnt been resolved  informally, its been passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice, this means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr K 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
Ref: DRN26694982the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr K could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular, the customer  should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint.
Ive noted what  Mr Lender says about  the gap between  Mr K repaying  loan 16 in April 2016 
and taking loan 17 in August 2016. In the particular circumstances here and given the history 
of Mr Ks borrowing with Mr Lender  at that stage, I dont think  that the gap of a little over four 
months between loans 16 and 17 was sufficient  to break the chain of borrowing. Im satisfied 
that its appropriate to look at Mr Ks borrowing as one period between April 2014 and 
August 2018.  
Mr Lender accepted the adjudicators assessment in relation to loans 6 to 16. So, loans 1-5 
and 17-22 remain in dispute. Ill focus on loans 1-5 and 17-22  but in doing so Ill look at the 
whole period of lending.   
I dont think that Mr Lender was wrong to give Mr K loan one. Given  the loan amount, what  
was apparent about Mr Ks circumstances at the time and the fact that this was his first loan 
with Mr Lender, I dont  think it wouldve been proportionate for it to ask Mr K for the amount 
Ref: DRN26694983of information  needed to show  the lending was unsustainable. There  wasnt anything  in the 
information Mr K provided or the information  Mr Lender shouldve  been aware of, which 
meant that Mr Lender should have done  more or refused  to lend to Mr K. 
I think the position changed  by loan two. Mr Lender recorded that Mr Ks income  was £1,200  
and it assessed  his disposable  income as £950.  That means that his usual monthly 
expenditure was £250. I think thats unusually low and very unlikely to have captured  the 
true level of Mr Ks usual  monthly expenditure. The repayment for loan two was in the region 
of £540 and represented a significant proportion of Mr Ks income.  In the circumstances, 
there was a significant risk that Mr K wouldnt have been able to meet  his existing 
commitments without  having to borrow again.  So, I think  its unlikely that Mr K wouldve been 
able to sustainably  meet his repayments for this loan and any subsequent loans. I dont think  
that Mr Lender should have given Mr K loans two to six. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders  lending history with Mr K, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender  should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Mr Lender should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ks case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
seven. I say this because Mr K was often provided  with a new loan on the same day or 
within days or weeks of settling a previous one. So Mr Lender ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr K was having  to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances.  Mr K wasnt making  any real inroads to the 
amount he owed to Mr Lender. Whilst the amounts he borrowed fluctuated, loan 22 was 
taken out over three years and eight months  after Mr Ks first. And it was for a larger amount. 
Mr K had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Mr Lender  over an 
extended period.  As Ive said, Mr Lender accepts  the adjudicators assessment in relation  to 
loans 6-16.  I dont think it should have given Mr K loans 17-22.
Ive looked at the bank  statements Mr K gave to Mr Lender before loan 17. They cover a 14 
day period. They dont alter my view as, by that stage, the pattern of lending, in itself, shows  
that Mr Lender shouldnt have lent further to Mr K.  
Ive noted the additional  questions Mr Lender  says it asked Mr K before  loans  18-22.  I think  
that those questions were  too little, too late. By loan 18, Mr K had been  borrowing from 
Mr Lender for around two and a half years  and the amount  he borrowed had increased 
substantially. I dont  think that Mr Ks answers to Mr Lenders additional questions show  that 
he could repay the borrowing in a sustainable  way. 
I think that Mr K lost out because Mr Lender  continued to provide borrowing from loan seven  
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Mr Ks indebtedness  by 
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time. And, the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative  implications  on Mr Ks 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, in addition to loans two to six, Im also upholding Mr Ks complaint about  loans seven to 
22 and Mr Lender should put things  right.
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans two to 22;
Ref: DRN26694984pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans two to six from Mr Ks credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan seven onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans seven  to 22 should be removed 
from Mr Ks credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender  
must give Mr K a certificate showing how much tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ks complaint in part. PDL Finance Limited, 
trading as Mr Lender, should take the steps Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 August 2019.
