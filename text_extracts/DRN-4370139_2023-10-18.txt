The complaint
R complains that PayrNet blocked its account access which meant it lost a business 
contract. R is represented by its director Mr W.
What happened
Mr W says Rs account was blocked by PayrNet in November 2022. He says the correct 
details, which are saved, were inserted but PayrNet said incorrect details were used. Mr W 
says he tried speaking to PayrNet about the issue but didnt receive any help. He says he 
lost a business contract as a result of what took place and would like compensation for that 
lost contract as well as access to the account.
PayrNet says the account was blocked due to repeated attempts to access it with incorrect 
details. It says it correctly required identification documents from Mr W, but an error code 
was generated which was due to Mr Ws device not having a file upload and camera facility 
available. PayrNet says it cant be held responsible for what took place. It says it will repay 
the account balance which is under Â£1.
Mr W brought the complaint to us, and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought the evidence suggested the problem was caused by Mr Ws device not having the 
facility to upload files and having the camera device open. The investigator thought PayrNet 
had tried to assist Mr W and was entitled to restrict account access in these circumstances.
Mr W doesnt accept that view and says the camera issue or file issue was not mentioned in 
any of the exchanges between him and PayrNet. He disputes that he inserted incorrect login 
information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint.
I have looked carefully at the evidence both sides have provided about the problem and 
confirm to Mr W that I have read all of the information he has provided. I accept there is a 
dispute about what caused the initial account block and so its difficult to attribute any blame 
to either side. I can see PayrNet says there were multiple attempts to log into the account 
with incorrect details and Mr W says his access information is stored by his device. In those 
circumstances I cant fairly find that PayrNet was responsible for incorrectly applying the 
account block.
The key issue is what then took place about attempting to remove the account block. I think 
PayrNet was entitled to ask Mr W for identity evidence in these circumstances and I am sure 
Mr W will appreciate that fraud is a major problem for customers as well as a business. I am 
satisfied having looked through the exchange between the parties that PayrNet did try and 
help Mr W resolve the problem. I appreciate Mr W says he wasnt told what the problem 
was. But Im satisfied PayrNet told him on 16 November 2022 the problem may have been 
with his device settings about the camera and file upload facility and repeated that 
information on 22 and 25 November 2022. So, Im satisfied Mr W was told what the problem 
seemed to be, and I cant fairly hold PayrNet responsible for Mr Ws device settings. 
I appreciate Mr W may have had limited identity documents, but I cant fairly hold PayrNet 
responsible for that. And I can see that an impasse was clearly reached as PayrNet asked 
Mr W for confirmation about his device settings about the camera and file facility, but Mr W 
said the problem was with it. I cant see that Mr W ever provided evidence to PayrNet or us 
about the settings, for example showing they were enabled.
So, Im satisfied overall that PayrNet did try and help Mr W and did explain what it 
considered the problem to be. I can also see that PayrNet has fairly offered to send Mr W 
the relatively small account balance. And I make clear that even if I thought PayrNet had 
made a mistake, I have not seen any evidence that R lost a contract due to an account 
access issue. I make clear to Mr W that the complainant here is R and not him. And I find 
this now brings an end to what we in trying to resolve this dispute informally can do.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask R to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2023.
