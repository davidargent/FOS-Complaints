The outstanding balance figures for loans 20 and 21 may not be up-to-date. This table is not 
reproduced for accuracy, but as a brief summary of the approved loans. 
One of the issues challenged by STFL is Ms Ws Claim Audit Form (the Claim Form) 
completed for her for her representative and sent to STFL as part of the complaint. We have 
a copy too. STFL has said: 
We have compared the income and expenditure figures declared by the customer on 
each of our application forms to those given on the CMCs paperwork and overall the 
amounts differ considerably to give a distorted picture of affordability to those we 
were given at the time of the applications.
One of our adjudicators thought that from loan 5, STFL needed to have verified any 
information provided by Ms W about her income and expenditure before providing any 
further borrowing. Our adjudicator had reviewed some bank statements provided by Ms W 
and did not think that STFL needed to put things right for Ms W for loan 5. 
Our adjudicator did reach the opinion that STFL should have ceased lending to Ms W from 
loan 6 on the basis that Ms W appeared by then to have become reliant on that form of 
lending, and it was unsustainable or otherwise harmful to her  six loans in twelve months 
without any breaks. She thought that STFL should put things right for Ms W for loans 6 to 21.
STFL disagreed but sent no additional evidence. 
Ms W agreed with our adjudicators view.
The complaint remained unresolved and was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
STFL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms W could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. 
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that STFL should 
fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer. 
These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. And I think this is a relevant consideration 
for Ms Ws circumstances. 
STFL was required to establish whether Ms W could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being the ability to repay without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ws complaint.
As Ms W has accepted our adjudicators view then it seems that loans 1 to 5 are no longer in 
dispute. I have not reviewed them. This decision concerns loans 6 onwards. 
The Claim Form 
The issue STFL has raised about the Claim Form is that what Ms W has submitted about her 
financial situation on the Claim Form does not match the information on the loan application 
forms it has for Ms W.  
There are at least two points I say about that  and one is that I think theres been a mistake 
at section C5 and C5a of that Claim Form. It asks about additional income but Ms W seems 
to have added into the section C5, £700 which she then describes as I had to pay a bailiff 
for council tax. That appears to refer to a large expense and not additional income. 
And the other point about the Claim Form information is that it becomes less cogent when 
Ms W has borrowed from STFL for three years because the form asks her for what is 
effectively a snapshot and would not cover a three year span. So we are not clear as to 
which part of her three year STFL relationship it relates.
So, for these reasons I am not satisfied with the Claim Form evidence, neither is STFL and 
so I think that is to be disregarded. Without verification this information does not appear to 
have been reliable. 
Credit search results
I asked our adjudicator to question STFL as to why it had sent to us an example credit 
report which is a redacted report of an anonymous customer, and not linked with Ms W, and 
therefore was of no value when investigating Ms Ws complaint. And I asked for the actual 
credit search results for Ms W, whichsoever years they had them for.
STFL explained that: 
The call credit report is not [Ms Ws] report, it is an example to show you what we 
had access to as we were unable to capture and store credit report details pre 2018.
Attached are the 3 credit reports for [Ms W] from loan 17 to 21 which shows active 
judgments. The level of credit that was offered was based on previous payment 
history and data from her credit reports, [Ms W] was left with a disposable income of 
not less than £110 a week, which would then allow her to pay for judgmentsI replicate the information provided recently by STFL in a table here. I have not included the 
scores as, out of context and with no explanation as to whether these were internal STFL 
calculated scores or the Credit Reference Agency scores then they have little value. CCJ 
refers to County Court Judgments.

STFL has explained that it did things differently when assessing an application for a loan 
from 2014 to August 2018 and then from August 2018 to the present day. 
Pre-August 2018 it has said: A credit status report was also obtained from Call Credit to 
check for CCJs and any other indebtedness to check if the applicant is suffering any 
financial hardship and to validate the expenditure data they have provided.
Post  August 2018 to the present day it has said: We also incorporate data imported from 
the applicants CRA report which we request for every application, this allows us to take into 
account and CCJs and other debts on file.
So, STFL ought to have records from loan 12 for Ms W according to its own explanations but 
I only have them from loan 17. 
Having reviewed the application forms, the one for November 2017 (loan 6) clearly states 
that Ms W had told the agent she had a CCJ and it gave the details of what appears to have 
been that creditor. 
 
STFL knew Ms W had active CCJs from at least November 2017. A CCJ indicates that 
Ms W was not able to sustain a debt and likely had been in arrears for some considerable 
time. For a creditor to pursue a debt to a Judgment suggests that debt was an old one. It 
highlights that Ms W was not able to repay her debt(s) and had difficult managing money.
Im not persuaded that STFLs explanation that her weekly disposable income was enough 
for it to lend to her responsibly when it knew of the CCJs and it thought that having enough 
money to repay the CCJs was a satisfactory creditworthiness assessment outcome. 
Irresponsible lending
I have decided that I agree with our adjudicator that by loan 6 STFL ought to have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so STFL ought to have realised 
that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. I say this because:
up to loan 5 Ms W had been taking loans sequentially, and from loan 6 onwards 
Ms W was provided with a new loan within days of settling a previous one and had 
started to take additional loans before repaying the earlier ones so they were 
overlapping sometimes; and 
the amounts or cumulative amounts were increasing all the time; and 
at the loan 6 application she had declared that she had a judgment debt; and the credit history gives me the clear impression STFL knew her financial situation 
was poor and was declining; and
 
STFL ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms W was having to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Ms Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably; and
Ms W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STFL. The last two 
loans taken on the same day were for a combined total of £1,050 three years after 
her first loan which had been for £100. And her weekly repayments had become just 
under £98 a week whereas her first had been £10 a week; and 
In my view, Ms W had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service an ever increasing 
debt to STFL over an extended period.
I think that Ms W lost out because STFL continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ws indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period and
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Ms Ws 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about loans 6 to 21 and STFL should put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STFL should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms W from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Ms W may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real 
and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Ms W in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Ms W would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFLs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.STFL shouldnt have given Ms W loans 6 to 21. 
If it has sold the outstanding debts STFL should buy these back if its able to do so and then 
take the following steps. 
If STFL is not able to buy the debts back then it should liaise with the new debt owner to 
achieve the results outlined below.
A) STFL should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms W towards interest, fees 
and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything 
STFL has already refunded.
B) STFL should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms W  
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date she originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) STFL should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Ms W as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results in Ms W having made overpayments then STFL should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the 
overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. STFL should then 
refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should be 
used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus then 
the surplus should be paid to Ms W. 
However, if there is still an outstanding balance then STFL should try to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with her. 
STFL shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal STFL has already written-
off.
E) The overall pattern of Ms Ws borrowing for loans 6 to 21 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so STFL should remove these loans entirely from her credit file. 
STFL does not have to remove loans 20 and 21 from Ms Ws credit file until these have been 
repaid, but STFL should still remove any adverse payment information recorded about these 
loans.
If STFL intends to use the refund to reduce an amount Ms W owes, it must do this after tax. 
STFL cannot carry out a set-off unless it owns the debt. 
*HMRC requires STFL to take off tax from this interest. If Ms W asks STFL for a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off, STFL should provide this. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Ws complaint in part and direct that Short Term 
Finance Limited does as I have outlined above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before10 December 2021.
