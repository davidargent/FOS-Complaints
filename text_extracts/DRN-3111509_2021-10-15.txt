The complaint
Miss T has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) did not downgrade 
her packaged bank account to a fee-free account when she requested for it to be, as she 
was going to live abroad.
What happened
 I issued a provisional decision on 30 September 2021, in which I explained that I was 
minded to uphold this complaint. I have included an extract of my provisional decision below.
In NatWests response to Miss Ts complaint in 2017, NatWest accepted that it had failed to 
downgrade Miss Ts account to a fee-free account when she had requested it to do so in 
2014. And it arranged to refund Miss Ts account fees. However, rather than arranging to 
downgrade the account (by removing the fee-paying Platinum aspect of the account) as per 
the previously unactioned instruction, instead NatWest advised Miss T to contact NatWest 
downgrades team to do this. 
I understand this, i.e. asking the accountholder to contact the downgrade team, is NatWests 
standard approach to complaints about mis-sold packaged bank accounts. But in the 
circumstances of this complaint, I dont think that was reasonable. 
Firstly, I note that Miss Ts complaint is not that the packaged account was mis-sold, but was 
actually about NatWests failure to act upon her instruction. And NatWest acknowledged that 
Miss T had previously (in 2014) asked to remove the fee-paying aspect of the account, and it 
accepted that it had failed to act on this instruction. So I think NatWest - in addition to the 
refund of the account fees contained in its 2017 final response letter - shouldve also 
downgraded the account to a fee-free account in 2017  rather than advise Miss T to contact 
NatWest, yet again, to put the request through.
I understand that Miss T didnt receive the response to the complaint, as the UK based 
address for her had not been changed. Its not clear if the failure to change the address was 
because Miss T had not correctly requested for this to happen, or if NatWest had (again) 
failed to act upon an instruction from her. But either way, had NatWest downgraded the 
account in 2017, as I think it shouldve, Miss Ts account would not have continued to accrue 
the Select Platinum account fees since then.
Putting matters right
To put matters right NatWest needs to put Miss T back into the position that she wouldve 
been in had the fee-paying Platinum package been removed from her account in July 2017.
To do this, I currently think that NatWest should rework Miss Ts account from the date of its 
final response letter, so that all Select Platinum account fees that were applied to the 
account are removed  alongside any overdraft charges that would not have been incurred 
had the account been fee-free.
If this leaves the account in a credit balance, then NatWest should remove any adverse 
information that mayve been recorded on Miss Ts credit file. 
Alternatively, if this still leaves an overdrawn balance, then I dont think NatWest needs to 
remove the adverse information, and NatWest should instead arrange for Miss T to repay 
this debt within a reasonable period of time.
If NatWest has sold the debt, then it will need to buy the debt back in order to carry out the 
above actions. If it cant do that, then it will need to work with the third party to achieve the 
same results.
Finally, I can see that Miss T has contacted NatWest many times over the years to try and 
get this matter resolved. So I also propose that NatWest pay Miss T £150 for the distress 
and inconvenience caused.
Miss T didnt respond to my provisional decision, but NatWest did and agreed with the steps 
Id outlined in my provisional decision to put matters right for Miss T. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about packaged accounts on our website 
and Ive used that to help me decide this complaint. 
As NatWest accepted my provisional decision and Miss T didnt respond, I see no reason 
why I should reach a different outcome to the one I reached in my provisional decision. 
 
Putting things right
So, to put matters right, NatWest needs to put Miss T back into the position that she 
wouldve been in had the fee-paying Platinum package been removed from her account in 
July 2017.
To do this, NatWest needs to rework Miss Ts account from the date of its final response 
letter, so that all Select Platinum account fees that were applied to the account are removed 
 alongside any overdraft charges that would not have been incurred had the account been 
fee-free.
If this leaves the account in a credit balance, then NatWest should remove any adverse 
information that mayve been recorded on Miss Ts credit file. 
Alternatively, if this still leaves an overdrawn balance, then I dont think NatWest needs to 
remove the adverse information, and NatWest should instead arrange for Miss T to repay 
this debt within a reasonable period of time.
If NatWest has sold the debt, then it will need to buy the debt back in order to carry out the 
above actions. If it cant do that, then it will need to work with the third party to achieve the 
same results.
As Miss T has contacted NatWest many times over the years to try and get this matter 
resolved, NatWest needs to pay Miss T £150 for the distress and inconvenience caused.
 
My final decisionBecause of the reasons given above and in my provisional decision, I uphold this complaint. 
I therefore require National Westminster Bank Plc to do what I have set out above to put 
matters right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 November 2021.
