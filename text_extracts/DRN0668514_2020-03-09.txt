One of our adjudicators partially upheld  Mr Ps complaint. They thought  the loans from loan 
six onwards shouldnt have been  given because by loan six the pattern of borrowing 
suggested Mr P had become persistently reliant  upon short-term loans. And that he may 
have had problems  managing his money.
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan seven. The offer was 
passed onto Mr P but we didnt hear anything more.
Another of adjudicators reconsidered the complaint and thought  that what  the business  had 
offered was satisfactory and didnt think an ombudsman would come  to a different 
conclusion.
We didnt receive any reply from Mr P. As the complaint remains  unresolved  it has been 
passed to me for decision in my role as ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
Ref: DRN06685142consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr P didnt comment on the adjudicators opinions that loans one to five shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But the loans were  part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr P had with Sunny.  So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
As Ive said above,  for the borrowing  to be sustainable there shouldnt be any difficulty  in 
making the repayments and there  wouldnt be a need for a customer to borrow  further to 
meet those repayments,  thereby becoming persistently reliant on short-term  loans. 
Ive looked at Mr Ps declared income from the time of the borrowing and also at the 
repayment amounts  he was obliged to pay. During  the time period of the borrowing, Sunny 
has recorded Mr Ps monthly  disposable income as being between  £591 and £736. The 
borrowing looks to be affordable. So, like the second  adjudicator  I dont think the borrowing  
from loans one to six was unsustainable and it wasnt unfair of Sunny to have given the 
loans. 
Ref: DRN06685143Sunny has already offered  to uphold the complaint  from loan seven and I think thats fair. 
And I think that by loan eight, where Mr P had taken eight loans in two months would  
suggest that he was becoming reliant on short-term  loans.  
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr P, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
eight. I say this because:
at this point Sunny  ought to have  realised Mr P was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr P had taken out eight loans within two months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr P was having  to borrow further  to cover 
the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Ps 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr P was taking up to three loans a month which would suggest that he may have 
been borrowing  to make ends meet or repay  other borrowing. He was therefore 
having to borrow  further, thereby remaining in debt for longer  and with additional 
costs. 
Mr P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan ten was 
taken out seven months after Mr Ps first. And while I appreciate  the amounts 
borrowed did fluctuate, the last loan was for the same amount  as the first loan. So, 
Mr P had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr P lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan eight 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans which Mr P borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ps ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, like the second  adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about  loan eight  onwards  
and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do  Ive included loan seven for 
completeness
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on loan seven onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan seven from Mr Ps credit file;
Ref: DRN06685144the number  of loans taken from loan eight onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loan eight onwards should  be removed 
from Mr Ps credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr P a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ps complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 April 2020.
