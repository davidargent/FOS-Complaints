K821x#15complaint
Mr H has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr H says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mr H took out some  29 instalment loans from Sunny between May 2015  
and September  2018. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Hs borrowing with Sunny, based  on 
the information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
for loans  6 to14 and for loans 18 to 29. Sunny said it didnt agree, although it did offer 
alternative redress, which Mr H declined. 
Ive been asked to make an ombudsmans final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice, on our website. Ive followed this approach when  thinking  about Mr Hs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr H could 
repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These  checks  ought to have  taken 
into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total repayment  
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
Ref: DRN74882052whether Mr H could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether  the repayments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loans  being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr H could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr H including assessing his income,  expenditure and creditworthiness. It says all this 
information showed that he would  be able to make the loan repayments  he was committing 
to. Ive thought  about this and also looked  at the overall pattern  of lending history  with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some  point, 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans to Mr H. 
Ive taken account of what  Ive said above,  about the length of the lending relationship, and 
applied it to the circumstances of loans  1 to 3 in this case. And I dont think  its clear  enough  
that what Sunny would have seen, from its checks,  suggested loans 1 to 3 were  
unaffordable for Mr H. I accept that Mr H may have already been finding managing money  
quite difficult at this point, however, theres no clear  record that the type or depth of credit 
checks that were carried out at that time would have exposed these issues. 
I think that for loans  4 and 5, Sunny ought to have been carrying out more detailed  financial 
checks, not least because there was emerging evidence Mr H was taking out borrowing 
whilst previous loans  were still outstanding. But Ive looked at the amounts involved and his 
income and expenditure disclosures, and even though I think  Sunny probably didnt do what  
it ought to have done, I dont feel this would have actually made any difference. Thats  
because Ive seen  nothing that shows more  detailed checks would have  persuaded Sunny 
not to lend to Mr H for loans 4 and 5. In short, I think loans 4 and 5 would  have still looked  
affordable given the information Mr H had provided. 
So Im afraid  I dont agree that Sunny  knew its lending was unsustainable for loans 1 to 5. I 
therefore dont  uphold this part of the complaint.
However, from the point  of loan 6 onwards, there was a clear  pattern of repeated lending 
evident in my view.  Loan 6 was advanced  after 4 months of consistent borrowing and again, 
whilst other  loans remained outstanding. There was an obvious  dependency on high-
interest, short-term lending evidenced  by this. So Im upholding Mr Hs complaint in respect 
of loans 6 to 14 because Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr H in an unsustainable manner 
because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
Ref: DRN74882053After loan 14 there was a substantial break  in the lending over well over a year. So in 
accordance with our normal approach  and taking account of this particular  case  Im 
going to look at loan 15 onwards as a new lending  chain.  
Loans 15 to 17 therefore fall into the category of what I mentioned before about the early 
stages of a lending relationship. Sunnys checks would have been less in-depth and based 
largely on what Mr H had said about his financial situation. So I dont uphold  the complaint in 
respect of loans 15 to 17.
For loan 18 onwards, however, even the most  basic assessment of Mr Hs situation would 
have revealed  he was again  ramping  up his borrowing. Sunny irresponsibly lent him loan 
number 18 when loans  15 to 17 were still outstanding. And the fact that some of the 
borrowing amounts  were moderate  is irrelevant  it was abundantly  clear Mr H was in 
financial trouble  and not able to manage. He should not have been lent more money.
Additionally, from the point of loan 20 onwards, there was another clear pattern of repeated 
lending evident  in my view,  like the one Ive described above for the first lending chain. 
Loan 20 was advanced after 6 months  of continual lending and the monthly outlay to Mr H 
was rising because  he was heavily indebted.  So again,  there  was an obvious dependency  
on high-interest, short-term lending  for most of his later borrowing events.
putting things right
In order to put things  right for Mr H, Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 6 to 14  AND   18 to 29;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Hs credit file in relation to loans 18 
and 19;
the number  of loans taken from loans  6 to 14  AND   20 to 29 mean any information  
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about loans 6 to 14  AND   20 to 29 
should be completely removed  from Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr H a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I partially uphold  Mr Hs complaint and direct Elevate Credit International Limited to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 May 2020.
