Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ts complaint and thought the loans from loan 7 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the behaviour of his borrowing indicated he was 
suffering from financial difficulties. Sunny disagreed and said repaying instalment loans early  
was a feature  of the product it offered. It also said Mr T repaid  all his loans and didnt fall into 
arrears so it couldnt agree he was suffering from financial difficulties. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr T could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
Ref: DRN70445722But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.  Having  done so, Im partially  upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
There was a significant break in Mr Ts borrowing from Sunny. There  was a gap of around 
seven months between loans 2 and 3. I think it would be reasonable for Sunny to view this 
gap as an indication  that Mr Ts finances  had stabilised  after whatever the circumstances 
that had caused him to take out his previous loans. So, I will look at Mr Ts borrowing in two 
separate lending chains.
Chain one consisted of loans 1 and 2. And Chain 2 consisted of loans  3 to 15.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 and 2 in 
chain 1 or loans  3 to 6 in chain 2. Mr T didnt respond to the view. As there is no dispute  with 
the adjudicators  opinion  about loans 1,2, 3 or 6, I wont be making  any findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 7 to Mr T and the results  of these checks  
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Ts third loan in just over two months  and for a 
larger amount, I think Sunny should  have been  looking  to build a clearer  picture about  Mr Ts 
finances before lending  him this loan.  
I think the fact Mr T repaid his loans much  earlier than planned should have caused some  
concern to Sunny. As that might  be the sort of behaviour that would indicate someone was 
facing problems managing their money  and needing to refinance  loans on a regular basis.  
Ref: DRN70445723Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think that this point was reached by loan 8. I say 
this because at this point Sunny ought  to have realised Mr T was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. In this chain of borrowing, Mr T had taken out six loans within three  
months. So Sunny ought to have realised  it was more likely  that Mr Ts indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably. He also wasnt really  making any inroads to the amount he owed 
Sunny. Loan 15 was taken out 18 months after Mr Ts first loan. Mr T had paid large 
amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny provided  borrowing for loan 8 because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  3, 4 and 5;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 7 from Mr Ts credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  8 to 15 should be removed from  
Mr Ts credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr T a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ts complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 February  2020.
