The complaint
Mr S complains that TSB Bank plc won't send him a replacement paying in book for his 
Passbook Saver account. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
TSB Bank has confirmed it doesnt offer a paying in book for the Passbook Saver
account Mr S holds. TSB Bank accepts Mr S has previously been issued with a
paying in book but says no more will be issued following a systems update.
The Passbook Saver account terms and conditions set out the options for making
deposits but dont include a reference to a paying in book. TSB Bank has confirmed it
no longer issues paying in books for these accounts.
I agree that TSB Bank took too long to respond to Mr S complaint. TSB Bank has
paid Mr S £150 and apologised for the service provided. Im satisfied £150 reflects
the impact of TSB Banks delay on Mr S and is fair in all the circumstances.
Im sorry to disappoint Mr S but as I think TSB Bank has dealt with his complaint
fairly Im not directing it to take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 July 2020.
