The complaint
Mr Y is unhappy about the way PayPal Europe Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) handled two 
disputes he raised with them.
What happened
Mr Y raised two disputes with PayPal regarding purchases with the same vendor for the 
amounts £13.68 and £13.29. Mr Y complained to PayPal that the items ordered were 
significantly not as described (SNAD) and requested a refund. Mr Y returned the items as 
instructed by PayPal and sent them the tracking information as proof of return. 
Mr Y then requested a refund of £17.40 for the cost of the return postage and printing the 
postage label. Mr Y also feels he has been discriminated against because PayPal have not 
responded to many of his emails.  
PayPal say that they didnt correctly attach the proof of tracking Mr Y sent them - which 
caused a slight delay in the refunds being issued. But they say that they have now refunded 
Mr Y both the £13.68 and £13.29 due. PayPal also say that they have acted in accordance 
with their User Agreement  which states they will not cover the return postage. Mr Y wasnt 
happy with this, so he brought his complaint to us. 
Since our involvement PayPal decided to offer Mr Y £100 in response to his complaint for 
any trouble and upset caused. 
Our investigator considered Mr Ys complaint and all the evidence supplied by both parties 
and felt that PayPal didnt need to do anything further.
Mr Y was not happy with this outcome, so the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered what both parties have said in relation to the two disputes raised by Mr Y. 
PayPal have provided evidence to show that they refunded Mr Y £13.68 and £13.29 as the 
amounts paid for each item. PayPal have also supplied a copy of their User Agreement 
which clearly states:
IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we
specify as part of the settlement of your claim. PayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle
you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.
So, I dont think PayPal are required to refund Mr Y £17.40 for printing the label and 
returning the parcel. 
Mr Y also complained that PayPal discriminated against him as they have not been replying 
to his emails. Mr Y provided evidence about his race and current medical condition which he 
feels is relevant to his complaint. 
Discrimination is covered under the Equality Act 2010 (Act), so Ive thought carefully about 
what this might mean for my decision.
Its not my role to say whether PayPal has breached the Act, because thats a matter for the 
courts to decide. Ive taken the Act into consideration, as its relevant law, but I must decide 
whether PayPals treated Mr Y fairly in the specific circumstances of his complaint.
I have seen Mr Ys dispute was not resolved as quickly as it couldve been, but PayPal have 
said that this was because they accidently failed to attach the proof of postage to his case 
file. Mr Y sent the proof of postage on 18 July 2022, PayPal then emailed him on 19 July 
2022 to request the proof of postage again.
On 3 August 2022 Mr Y emailed the proof of postage again and PayPal issued the refund, 
which I can understand caused him some inconvenience.
Having considered everything, I dont think it is fair to ask PayPal to refund the money Mr Y 
paid for postage. But PayPal have offered Mr Y £100 for any of the trouble and upset their 
mistake may have caused and considering the circumstances I think that is fair.
Putting things right
PayPal should pay Mr Y the £100 offered in trouble and upset.
My final decision
PayPal should pay Mr Y the £100 in trouble and upset. I do not think they need to do 
anything further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 November 2023.
