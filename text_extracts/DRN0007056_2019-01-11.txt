K820x#14complaint
Mr B is complaining that Barclays  Bank  Plc didnt do enough to recall a payment hed made  
to the wrong account.
background
In June 2018 Mr B made two transfers of £100 and £1,000 from his Barclays  account to 
what he thought  was his account  with another bank. 
The funds didnt arrive.  So he spoke  to Barclays to try and find out what had happened.  
Barclays tried to recall the payment by contacting  the beneficiary of the account  where  the 
money had gone.  But it didnt get any reply so Barclays told Mr B there was nothing  more it 
could do.
When Mr B contacted the other bank directly  it traced the funds into a holding account itd 
not been using for a while, and credited them to Mr Bs account.
Mr B complained to Barclays  as he felt it could have done more by calling the other bank 
directly. Barclays  said it hadnt done anything wrong.
Our investigator looked into Mr Bs complaint and told Mr B he thought  Barclays  had done 
everything it needed to do to get his money back. But Mr B didnt agree.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  In doing so Ive come  to the same 
conclusion as the investigator for very similar reasons.
I can see that Barclays tried to contact the other  bank but it didnt get any response. When  
Mr B contacted the other  bank  it immediately traced  the funds in a holding account and 
transferred them to the correct account.  Its not clear why it didnt reply to the queries 
Barclays raised, but I dont think thats Barclays fault. 
I know Mr B will be disappointed with my decision but I dont think  Barclays  has done  
anything wrong. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 February  2019.
