The complaint
Mr G complains that Retail Money Market Ltd (RateSetter) unfairly reduced his interest
returns on his crowdfunding investments and delayed in returning his money following his 
withdrawal requests.
What happened
RateSetter is a peer-to-peer crowdfunding platform which was acquired by TP in September
2020. However, for ease, I shall refer to both parties separately throughout this decision.
RateSetter provided several types of investment accounts in which investors could lend 
money to third party individuals and/or businesses in return for interest. While each of these 
accounts had a set Going Rate - a market interest rate determined by RateSetter - 
investors could also decide to set their own target interest rates. The actual interest earned 
was based upon the loan contracts contained within an investors account.
RateSetter operated a contingency fund called the Provision Fund. The Provision Fund
was used to automatically reimburse investors their outstanding capital and interest in the
event this wasnt paid by a borrower. This in effect mutualised risk for all investors by
diversifying their exposure across the entire loan portfolio. Although payments from the
Provision Fund werent guaranteed, payments would be made provided there were sufficient
funds available in it.
The adequacy of the Provision Fund was expressed by the Interest Coverage Ratio -
calculated by dividing the size of the Provision Fund by the Expected Future Losses (the
total amount of missed and unrecovered borrower repayments expected over the lifetime of
active loans). RateSetter also published a Capital Coverage Ratio - calculated by adding
the size of the Provision Fund and all the future interest from active loans and then dividing
by the Expected Future Losses.
Historically, the Provision Fund was funded through borrowers as part of their loan fees and
not by investors. But RateSetter says that, due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, it
saw a decrease in new lending and in turn, a decrease in borrower fees going into the
Provision Fund. RateSetter has told us that in April 2020 the Interest Coverage Ratio had
dropped below 74% and in May 2020, in response to this, it introduced a Stabilisation
Period  a 50% reduction to the interest rate investors received on their investments. 
RateSetter says that was introduced to replenish the Provision Fund. It also says the Capital
Coverage Ratio was around 154% at the time and so a capital rate reduction wasnt
necessary. RateSetter says this was all implemented in line with the terms of the investment.
TP acquired RateSetter in September 2020, but the entire loan portfolio remained with
RateSetter. RateSetter has explained that the Interest Coverage Ratio had returned above
100% by December 2020 and the Stabilisation Period ended in January 2021. In February
2021 RateSetter announced that TP was acquiring the entire loan portfolio which then
completed in April 2021. As a result, investors received their capital back, plus any interest
due.
Following the introduction of the Stabilisation Period, Mr G requested to make withdrawals 
from his investment in June and July 2020.
Mr G complained to RateSetter in July 2020 as he was unhappy with the delay in completing 
his withdrawal requests. He also complained about RateSetters decision to reduce his 
interest rate. He said it was unfair for it to do so when it was still charging borrowers the 
same amount. He felt that it was only RateSetter that was benefiting from the interest rate 
reduction. 
RateSetter considered Mr Gs complaint but didnt uphold it. In summary, it said:
Since the Covid-19 pandemic struck, it had focused on strengthening the Provision 
Fund and protecting all investors equally.
The interest rate reduction introduced in May 2020 was a necessary part of ensuring 
that all investors were fully protected  and a necessary step towards the outcome of 
investors getting their money back in full in April 2021.
Had it not increased its Provision Fund, investor capital would have been at risk.
Mr Gs withdrawal requests were in a queue to be released which was subject to the 
liquidity in the market at the time  as per the terms of the investment.
Mr G remained unhappy with RateSetters response and so he referred his complaint to
this Service for an independent review. 
An investigator at this Service looked into Mr Gs concerns and originally upheld the 
complaint but later revised her view based upon new information provided by RateSetter. In 
summary, she said:
She felt RateSetter had made it clear to Mr G in its Investor Terms that his ability to 
withdraw was dependent on there being liquidity in the market. 
There was clearly an imbalance in supply and demand caused by the reaction to the 
Covid-19 pandemic, with reduced demand on the secondary market. So, she didnt 
think it was unreasonable that it took longer than normal for RateSetter to process Mr 
Gs withdrawal requests.
She was satisfied that RateSetters Investor Terms gave it a broad discretion to 
introduce the Stabilisation Period.
She was persuaded that RateSetters decision to implement the Stabilisation Period 
was fair, and consistent with maintaining the Interest Coverage Rate above 100% to 
ensure continued mutualisation of risk across the loan portfolio.
She also commented on RateSetters decision to close Mr Gs account following the 
sale of the entire loan portfolio to TP. She felt RateSetter had the power to do so 
under the Investor Terms and she felt that, by receiving a return of his capital and 
interest accrued up to that point, Mr G had received what he was entitled to.
RateSetter had accepted that it delayed providing all available evidence for the 
complaint and had it not done so, she wouldnt have reached the same outcome as 
she did in her initial opinion. She said RateSetter had offered £250 in recognition for 
the unnecessary delay caused and any distress and inconvenience caused by this, 
which she felt was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
Mr G didnt accept the investigators findings. In summary, he said:
Its unacceptable that RateSetter moved from a position of paying out withdrawals 
usually within 24 hours to months.
Whilst the possibility of being unable to withdraw money was highlighted to investors, 
it wasnt what hed previously experience and, as a result, expected.RateSetter changed its terms retrospectively and these changes ultimately protected 
and benefitted RateSetter.
He remained of the opinion that it was unfair to apply an interest reduction to all his 
loans. 
As no agreement could be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When considering what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances, Ive taken into account
the relevant rules and regulations FCA regulated firms, such as RateSetter, are required to
follow. These are set out in the FCAs Handbook of rules and guidance. The FCA Principles
for Business (PRIN) are a general statement of the fundamental obligations of firms under
the regulatory system (PRIN 1.1.2G) The Principles themselves are set out in PRIN 2.1.1R.
The most relevant principles here are:
PRIN 2.1.1R (2) A firm must conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence.
PRIN 2.1.1R (6) A firm must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and 
treat them fairly.
RateSetter was also required to act in accordance with the rules set out in the Conduct of
Business Sourcebook (COBS). And the most relevant obligation here is:
COBS 2.1.1R (1) A firm must act honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance 
with the best interests of its client.
Withdrawal delays 
I appreciate that Mr G is unhappy with the amount of time it took for RateSetter to complete 
his withdrawal requests, especially considering hed been accustomed to withdrawals only 
taking hours prior to the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, having reviewed the 
information provided to him at the time of investing on the platform, Im satisfied RateSetter 
made him aware that his ability to withdraw from the investment was dependent on liquidity 
of the market he was invested in. 
Some platforms (including RateSetter) have put in place secondary markets that allow 
investors to sell their loan parts to other investors in order to withdraw funds. There is no 
regulatory requirement on platforms to have this facility available. And it follows that there 
are no rules dictating how these secondary markets should be run. Ultimately, how 
RateSetter decided to process withdrawal requests was a commercial decision which its 
entitled to make. This isnt something this service can change. Instead Ive looked at whether 
Mr G has been treated unfairly as a result of that decision. 
RateSetters Investor Terms explained:
8.3. If your funds have already been matched to a loan contract, you can only 
withdraw them using the Release Investment function detailed below.
9. The Release Investment function9.1. Once your funds are matched and a loan contract is formed, you may be able to 
withdraw matched funds before they are repaid by the borrower by using the 
Release Investment function, but this will only be possible where there are sufficient 
funds available in the market. We may temporarily suspend your ability to use this 
function in order to manage supply and demand on the platform.
Taking into account the above terms, I think RateSetter made Mr G aware that withdrawing 
would only be possible where there were sufficient funds available in the market. RateSetter 
has explained it received a larger number of requests to release funds during the onset of 
the Covid-19 pandemic which, in turn reduced liquidity and increased queue times.  Im also 
aware that RateSetter did provide updates regarding withdrawal wait times on its website to 
manage investors expectations.
So taking into account all of the above, Im satisfied that RateSetter hasnt unfairly delayed 
Mr Gs withdrawal requests.
Fairness of the implementation of the Stabilisation Period
I understand Mr G thinks that RateSetter has changed the terms on which he agreed to 
invest when it reduced his interest rate. However, I dont agree. RateSetter has relied upon 
the following term which was in its Investor Terms to introduce the Stabilisation Period:
19.1. If at any time, RateSetter reasonably believes the Provision Fund does not
have sufficient funds (including expected future inflows) to cover current or expected
borrower defaults, RateSetter may implement a Stabilisation Period.
While I think the term gave RateSetter a broad discretion to introduce the Stabilisation
Period, I must also consider whether in doing so RateSetter treated Mr G fairly and acted
with his best interests in mind.
RateSetter has explained that that prior to April 2020, the Interest Coverage Ratio was and
had only ever been above 100% and that the objective  as disclosed to investors  was to
maintain it to this level. The Provision Fund Policy on RateSetters website explained:
Future economic uncertainty is currently not factored into the Expected Future Loss
calculation but this is taken into account by managing the Interest Coverage Ratio to
a figure greater than 100%.
Its also clear that the Provision Fund was a vital mechanism in ensuring mutualisation of risk
across the loan portfolio. And if this was not sufficiently maintained, investors would likely be
exposed to risk beyond that which theyd accepted when agreeing to invest on a platform
that mutualised risk across the whole loan portfolio. The Provision Fund policy explained:
The Provision Fund exists to protect RateSetter investors. It protects all investors
equally and so has the effect of mutualising the risk for all investors by diversifying
their exposure across the whole loan portfolio. This means that it is the performance
of the whole loan portfolio that matters for RateSetter investors.
RateSetter has also explained that expected future losses were estimated each month-end
by RateSetter's Executive Credit Committee, based on historic losses in the portfolio as well
as independent macroeconomic forecasts produced by Oxford Economics. And that the
impact of Covid-19 in March 2020 caused a sharp spike in expected future losses which,
when tested at month end April 2020, caused the Interest Coverage Ratio to drop to 74%. It
was this level of drop in the Interest Coverage Ratio which RateSetter says meant it was
necessary to implement the Stabilisation Period  ensuring investors were protected equallyand that their risk was fully mutualised.
Understandably, there was a lot of uncertainty during the Covid-19 pandemic, and I think it
would be unfair to scrutinise a firms decision taken during this time where its clear it has
taken precautionary steps having relied upon independent forecasts. Its also apparent from
the information provided that RateSetter had lengthy discussions regarding what was the
best action to take in these circumstances. 
So, on balance, Im persuaded RateSetters decision to implement the Stabilisation Period
was fair, as it was consistent with the objective of maintaining the Interest Coverage Rate
above 100% - ensuring continued mutualisation of risk across the loan portfolio - and
allowing investors to continue to benefit from protection whilst still receiving interest (albeit
less than expected) during a period of economic uncertainty. Im also are satisfied the
Provision Fund shortfall estimates were reasonably assessed, as RateSetter considered
relevant factors from independent sources. Its also important to consider these decisions
were made in unprecedented circumstances and it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to
consider these with the benefit of hindsight.
I appreciate the investigator commented on RateSetters decision to close Mr Gs account 
following the sale of the entire loan portfolio to TP. However, the purpose of my decision is to 
explain my findings on the key issues of this complaint and having reviewed Mr Gs 
submissions in full, I consider the crux of his complaint to about the delay in actioning his 
withdrawal requests and reducing his interest rate only. Therefore, I dont find it necessary to 
comment any further on the sale of the loan portfolio to TP beyond that:
I agree with the investigator that the sale was a legitimate exercise of the rights given 
to RateSetter under the Investor Terms by Mr G when he invested.
I agree that RateSetter was able to close Mr Gs account with two months notice 
under 16.1. of the Investor Terms.
Im satisfied Mr G was only entitled to a return of capital and accrued interest at the 
point of withdrawal under the Investor terms and so he received what he was entitled 
when RateSetter sold the loan portfolio to TP.
RateSetters delay in providing a full response
RateSetter has made an offer of £250 to recognise the inconvenience caused to Mr G by its
delay in providing all available evidence for the complaint. Whilst I've not found a failing in
terms of introducing the stabilisation period, the sale to TP or the delay in withdrawing, I
think this offer fairly reflects the distress or inconvenience caused to him by not providing this
information at the earliest opportunity. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and instruct Retail Money Market Ltd to pay 
Mr G £250 for the distress and inconvenience it caused him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 April 2023.
