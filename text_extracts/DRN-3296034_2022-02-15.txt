DRN-3296034
The complaint
Ms E complained that her claim for storm damage under her home insurance policy with 
Aviva Insurance Limited (Aviva) was unfairly declined.
What happened
Ms E contacted Aviva on 8 September 2021 to claim for damage to her roof following a 
storm. She was not entirely sure when the damage occurred, but an estimated date was 
agreed when the damage may have occurred (15 July 2020). Ms E said water was dripping 
in her living room and causing damage to the inside of her home. She delayed making her 
claim as she was worried about builders attending due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
On 17 September 2021, Aviva sent a surveyor to review the damage. Following review, 
Aviva declined the claim, as it said the damage was due to gradual deterioration and not due 
to a storm, so wasnt covered by the policy.
Our investigator decided not to uphold the complaint. She agreed with Aviva that a storm 
didnt cause the damage to the property and thought the surveyors report was persuasive 
that the damage was caused by gradual deterioration, so wasnt covered by the policy. Ms E 
disagreed, so the case has been referred to an ombudsman.

My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont require Aviva Insurance Limited 
to do anything more.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms E to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2022.
