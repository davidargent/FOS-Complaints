K821x#15complaint
Mr L says Expert UK Solutions Ltd (Magnum Claims) has sent him an invoice charging its 
fee at a rate of 36% plus VAT,  when  it should only be 20% plus VAT. 
background
Mr L instructed Magnum Claims to pursue payment protection insurance (PPI) claims on his 
behalf on 19 May 2018. The Terms  of Business explained Magnum Claims would charge 
36% (inclusive of VAT) in the event of a successful claim. 
On 29 December 2018 Lender  H upheld  Mr Ls PPI complaint, and agreed to award  
£10,094.96 to Mr L.  
On 15 January 2019 Mr L paid Magnum Claims £3,117.64 in settlement  of its success fee 
representing approximately 30.88% of £10,094.96.
On 22 January Magnum  Claims sent Mr L an invoice showing the total amount  payable as 
£4,361.03. The invoice showed that the £10,094.96 successful claim would be subject to a 
success fee of 36% plus 20% VAT, resulting  in a success fee of 43.2% of the total 
compensation received (inclusive of VAT). The invoice  also showed Magnum Claims had 
received Mr Ls payment  of £3,117.64, and £1,243.39 remained outstanding.
Mr L complained to Magnum Claims about the invoice sent to him. Magnum Claims didnt 
respond to Mr Ls complaint. Mr L brought his complaint to the Legal Ombudsman. This 
complaint was originally  investigated by the Legal  Ombudsman, but was transferred to the 
Claims Management Ombudsman (a Financial Ombudsman service) as part of the change 
in the regulation of claims management companies. 
Magnum Claims agreed to reduce Mr Ls invoice to 30% plus VAT during our investigation.  
The investigator found that this offer wasnt fair, and said that to resolve the complaint 
Magnum Claims should  reduce  Mr Ls invoice to 20% plus VAT in line with the CMRs 
guidance on the PPI fee cap. The investigator  didnt refer to the amount Mr L had already 
paid to Magnum  Claims. Magnum Claims didnt agree with this, and so the complaint was 
referred to me for decision.  
I issued my provisional decision on 6 January 2020 saying that I uphold this complaint. A 
copy of my provisional decision is attached with this final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Mr L accepted  my provisional  decision. Magnum Claims didnt respond. I havent seen any 
evidence to change  my mind. So my provisional decision remains  unchanged.
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above, my final decision is that I uphold Mr Ls complaint. 
Expert UK Solutions Ltd must refund  Mr L £694.85,  plus 8% simple  interest  for the period 
from 15 January 2019 to the date of the refund. 
Ref: DRN30039622Expert UK Solutions Ltd must also pay an additional  £150 to Mr L as compensation for 
the trouble  and upset  hes experienced by Magnum Claims poor handling  of his PPI 
claim. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 March  2020.

Ref: DRN30039623On 29 December  2018  Lender H upheld  Mr Ls PPI complaint, and agreed to award £10,094.96  to Mr 
L.  
On 15 January 2019 Mr L paid Magnum  Claims £3,117.64 in settlement of its success  fee 
representing approximately  30.88% of £10,094.96.
On 22 January Magnum Claims sent Mr L an invoice showing the total amount payable as £4,361.03. 
The invoice showed  that the £10,094.96 successful claim would be subject to a success fee of 36%

£1,243.39 remained  outstanding.
Mr L complained  to Magnum Claims  about the invoice sent to him. Magnum Claims didnt  respond to 
Mr Ls complaint. Mr L brought his complaint to the Legal Ombudsman. This complaint was originally  
investigated by the Legal Ombudsman, but was transferred  to the Claims Management  Ombudsman 
(a Financial  Ombudsman service) as part of the change in the regulation of claims management 
companies.

should reduce Mr Ls invoice to 20% plus VAT in line with the CMRs guidance  on the PPI fee cap. 
The investigator didnt refer to the amount Mr L had already paid to Magnum Claims. Magnum Claims 
didnt agree  with this, and so the complaint  has been referred to me for decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Having  reviewed the case, although I agree  with the investigators  
findings, Ive reached a different outcome. Ive explained why below.
The Financial Guidance and Claims Act 2018  required  the CMR  to introduce a fee cap for PPI claims. 
The fee cap came into force on 10 July 2018. From this date, claims management companies  couldnt 
legally charge  a success fee of more  than 20% plus VAT.
But, on 11 May 2018,  the CMR  issued  guidance to all claims management  companies. This said 
from the date of this guidance you should inform all new or potential  clients of the upcoming change  
to the fees you can charge . In December 2018,  the CMR  told the Legal Ombudsman that, once the 
guidance had been issued, we expected businesses to inform  all new or potential  clients of the 
change to the fees that could be charged.
I agree with the investigators findings that the guidance was applicable at the time Mr L instructed  
Magnum Claims on 19 May 2018. Because of this, Magnum Claims  shouldve advised  of the 
upcoming fee cap, and asked whether  Mr L still wanted Magnum Claims to act for him at the higher 
rate. I cant see any evidence  that it did this. Had Mr L known of the fee cap, its likely he wouldve 
waited until after this came into force before  instructing Magnum Claims. He would then only have 
had to pay a fee of 20% plus VAT.  Because of this I agree with the investigator that applying the fee 
cap to Magnum  Claims success fee is a fair. 
The investigator recommended Magnum  Claims invoice  Mr L for its success fee based on it 
charging 20% plus VAT. Applying  this success fee to the compensation  paid by Lender L of 
£10,094.96, it would mean that Mr L is charged £2,422.79. Mr L has already paid Magnum  Claims 
£3,117.64. So to put things right, Magnum  Claims should refund Mr L £694.85, plus 8% simple 
interest for the period  from 15 January 2019 (when Mr L paid Magnum Claims £3,117.64) to the 
date of the refund. 
In addition  to this compensation  I also think  Mr L has been caused  trouble and upset which he 
wouldnt otherwise have experienced  if Magnum Claims had charged Mr L correctly  from the 
Ref: DRN30039624outset. Because  of this I also think that Magnum  Claims should pay an additional £150 to Mr L as 
compensation for the trouble  and upset hes experienced  by Magnum Claims  poor handling of his 
PPI claim.  
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  explained above, my provisional  decision is that I uphold  Mr Ls complaint.  
Expert UK Solutions Ltd must refund Mr L £694.85, plus 8% simple  interest for the period from 15 
January 2019 to the date of the refund. 
Expert UK Solutions Ltd must also pay an additional £150 to Mr L as compensation  for the trouble 
and upset hes experienced  by Magnum  Claims  poor handling of his PPI claim.
