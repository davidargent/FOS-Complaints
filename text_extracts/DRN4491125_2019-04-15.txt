K821x#15complaint
Ms A has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc hasnt complied with her 
instruction to transfer money to a relative  in a foreign country and hasnt returned the money  
to her.
background
In April 2018 Ms A asked  NatWest to transfer a sum of money to a relative living in a country 
outside the European Union. She wanted  the transfer to be made in US dollars. NatWest 
withdrew the sterling equivalent of the money to be transferred from her account and paid it 
to an American bank Ill call D to process  the payment.
In May 2018  the money hadnt been received by Ms As relative and she complained to 
NatWest. It told her D required her to complete a form giving detailed  information about the 
transfer. Ms A didnt want  to do this and asked NatWest  to return  the money to her. Initially 
NatWest told her the money  would be returned  but it then said D needed her to complete the 
above form before it could  even return the money. NatWest offered Ms A £50 compensation 
for giving her incorrect information.
Ms A wasnt happy with the service  and information  shed received from NatWest  and 
referred her complaint  to this service.
After the complaint was referred  to this service Ms A completed  the form and our investigator  
sent it to NatWest. But the money  still hasnt been  transferred or returned. NatWests says it 
transferred the money to D to act as its intermediary in making the transfer.  It says it had to 
do this because Ms A asked for the funds to be transferred in US dollars and it isnt 
responsible for Ds actions which are in accordance with US regulations.
our initial conclusions
Our investigator recommended the complaint  should be upheld. He thought NatWest should  
increase its offer of compensation to £100  but Ms A didnt agree with this recommendation.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Ms A is frustrated  that her payment hasnt been received by her 
relative. But banks  are subject to laws and regulations  that are outside  their control. That 
includes laws and regulations affecting banks outside the UK that have to be used  to make 
payments to bank accounts overseas.
In this case, its clear  its not in NatWests gift to return the money to Ms A. That decision 
now rests with D. It will make its decision based  on the information Ms A has provided  on the 
required form. I cant say whether that information will be sufficient to enable the money  to 
be refunded. I have no role or remit over that.
It does seem to me that NatWest didnt  provide  Ms A with a very good standard  of service in 
dealing with the problems shes had over the payment. But Im not satisfied that the money 
would have been transferred or returned  if NatWest had done anything different.  I therefore 
Ref: DRN44911252think £100 is a sufficient amount to compensate Ms A for the trouble and upset shes 
suffered as a result  of NatWests errors.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is I uphold this complaint. I require National 
Westminster Bank Plc to pay Ms A £100.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 May 2019.
