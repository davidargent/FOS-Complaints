Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Cs complaint and thought  the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. Elevate disagreed but it did offer to uphold  the 
complaint from loan 11 onwards. 
The offer was put to Mr C but he hasnt responded.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me to decide in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Elevate needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN03483922But certain factors might  point to the fact that Elevate should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Elevate was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.  After  doing so Ive decided to uphold 
this complaint in part, and Ill explain why.
Neither party responded to the adjudicators view not to uphold  loans from one to five. And 
as there  isnt any disagreement about these loans, I wont  be making a decision about them. 
But I have considered these loans as part of the overall borrowing by Mr C. Elevate has also 
made an offer for loans  11 to 14 but Mr C didnt respond so Ive included  loans 11 to 14 in 
my decision.   
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Elevates lending history  with Mr C, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point  at which  Elevate  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Elevate should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because:
At this point Elevate ought to have realised Mr C was not managing  to repay  his 
loans sustainably. Mr C had taken  out six loans within seven months.  So Elevate 
Ref: DRN03483923ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr C was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that 
Mr Cs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
From  loan six onwards Mr C was provided with a new loan within days  or weeks of 
settling a previous  one. As examples, loan six was taken out on 8 September  2017, 
about a week  after loans one and two were paid off, loan seven was taken on 
8 October, again just over a week after loan four was repaid on 29 September. And I 
notice loan nine was taken out within two days of loan five being repaid. I also see 
that some  of the loans were either overlapping or paid off early which  can be an 
indication that Mr C may have been struggling  to manage his money and was just 
borrowing further to pay off existing debts.  
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Elevate. Mr C had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Elevate over an extended 
period  16 months altogether.
I think that Mr C lost out because Elevate continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Cs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, like the adjudicator Im also upholding the complaint about loans six to 14 and Elevate 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Elevate needs to do
If any of the loans have an outstanding balance and have been sold to a third party, Elevate 
should try to buy the loans back if it can. If Elevate cant  buy the loan back,  then it needs to 
work with the third party to make sure the following is achieved:
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr C towards  interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Mr C which were 
considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mr C originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges  from the balance on any upheld  outstanding 
loans, and treat any repayments made  by Mr C as though they had been  repayments 
of the principal on all outstanding loans.  
If this results  in Mr C having made overpayments then Elevate should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date the complaint is settled. 
Ref: DRN03483924Elevate should  then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step 
E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should  be paid to Mr C. However, if there  is still an 
outstanding balance then Elevate should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan 
with Mr C. 
E) The number of loans taken from loan six onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loan six onwards  should be removed 
from Mr Cs credit  file. Elevate  does not have to remove any outstanding from Mr Cs 
credit file until these have been  repaid, but any adverse information recorded about 
these loans  should still be removed.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Elevate to take off tax from this interest.  Elevate must  give Mr C 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2020.
