K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that PDL Finance Limited,  trading as Mr Lender, was irresponsible  when it 
provided him with a number of loans between  2012 and 2018.
background
Mr G began borrowing from Mr Lender in September 2012. Ive attached a table in the annex  
to this decision. It contains some of the information Mr Lender has provided  to us about  
Mr Gs loans.
Mr Lender tells us that there were 16 loans but I note that whilst Mr G applied for a loan of 
£200 on 28 July 2014 it was withdrawn  on the following  day and no interest was paid by him. 
So my table refers to the 15 loans which did go ahead.
Loans 1 to 6 were payday loans with terms of between 10 and 29 days. From  Loan  7 Mr G 
took instalment  loans.  These were  repayable  over several months - usually three  or six.
Our adjudicator recommended  that Mr Gs complaint  should be upheld from a point when 
Mr G had rolled-over (deferred)  his repayment of Loan 2 for the fourth time.  He thought that 
there were indications that Mr G was having  some financial difficulty. And he thought  that 
from Loan 7 a pattern of borrowing had emerged  which meant that Mr Lender shouldve  
realised that all future lending was unsustainable  for Mr G.
Mr Lender didnt agree with our adjudicators assessment but it did make  an offer to put 
things right in relation  to Loans  6 onwards.  Mr G didnt accept the offer.  As the complaint 
wasnt settled informally, it came to me  an ombudsman  for a decision. 
A few weeks  ago I issued  a provisional  decision in which  I explained why I wasnt  minded to 
uphold as much of Mr Gs complaint as our adjudicator  had recommended.  And I invited the 
parties to let me have anything further  theyd like me to think  about before I reconsidered my 
decision.
This is my final decision. If it is accepted by Mr G it will be binding on the parties.
my findings
Ive once again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general  approach  
to complaints about these types  of loans - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and 
good industry practice - on our website.  
This is what  I said in my provisional  decision:
Before 2014 Mr Lender was licensed by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). It was later 
regulated by the Financial  Conduct Authority  (FCA).  All of the regulations made it clear that 
lenders had to act responsibly. Part of that obligation involved lenders carrying  out 
proportionate checks before  approving any loans to ensure that the borrower  would be able to 
repay them  in a sustainable  way. 
Ref: DRN60995952Id expect a proportionate  assessment to vary with circumstance. In general, Id expect a 
lender to require more  assurance, the greater the potential risk to the borrower  of not being  
able to repay  the credit  in a sustainable way. And there may even come  a point where the 
lending history  and pattern of lending  itself demonstrates that the lending  was unsustainable.
Mr Lender says that it conducted affordability checks and some  credit file enquiries  before it 
provided the credit to Mr G. But in the absence of clear information as to what  details it held, 
Im not persuaded  I can safely  say that Mr Lender did proportionate checks before providing  
the loans to Mr G. But that doesnt mean I am therefore going to uphold his complaint about 
all the borrowing. I have to think about whether - if Mr Lender  had done proportionate checks  
 would  it have realised that the loans wouldnt be affordable for Mr G in a sustainable way.
Thinking about everything Ive seen, Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence for me 
to conclude that Mr Lender failed to act responsibly  when it provided Loans 1 to 6. I accept 
that Mr G did roll-over the repayment of some  of his loans a few times.  Before  2014 good 
practice dictated that lenders shouldnt  allow borrowers  to roll-over repayment  on more than 3 
occasions. Our adjudicator  thought that Mr G had rolled over Loan 2 on four occasions   
having already rolled-over Loan 1 three times. But Ive carefully examined Mr Gs statement 
of account. It seems to me that he only deferred repayment of Loan 2 on three occasions. 
Having taken  the loan on 16 May 2013 he made a repayment  on 27 May, on 28 June and on 
26 July. He finally repaid the whole loan on 28 August. 
Mr G didnt ask for another loan (Loan 3) until 9 October 2013  around six weeks later. And 
on this occasion he again borrowed £150. He was due to repay it on 28 October but actually 
repaid it two days early.  Loans  4 and 5 were taken within  a few days  of the previous loan 
being repaid. I accept  that those  were also rolled-over twice. But taking all of this together  
including thinking  about the amounts of the loans, the frequency of borrowing and Mr Gs 
repayment history Im not persuaded  that there is enough for me to safely conclude that 
Mr Lender acted irresponsibly when it provided Loans 1 to 6 to Mr G. I dont think there were  
sufficient indicators for it to reasonably conclude that Mr G wasnt able to repay  these  loans 
sustainably, and therefore desist from further lending. 
But, the lending relationship  didnt cease after Mr G took his fifth loan. Ive looked  at the 
overall pattern of Mr Gs lending history with Mr Lender, with a view to seeing  if there was a 
point at which  Mr Lender should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so it shouldve realised that it was irresponsible to 
provide any further loans to him. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Gs case, I currently  think that this point was 
reached by Loan 6. I say this because Loan 6 was Mr Gs fifth loan in 12 months.  Since  
taking Loan 2 there  had been only short gaps between Mr G repaying one loan and taking 
another. This meant that between taking Loans 2 in May 2013 and taking Loan  6 in May 2014  
there had only been 53 days during which Mr G wasnt indebted to Mr Lender (and 42 of 
those days were between Loans 2 and 3). 
I think  that by Loan 6, Mr Lender  ought  fairly and reasonably to have realised that a pattern 
was established. And that it was more  likely than not Mr G was having to borrow again and 
again to cover  the holes repaying his previous  loans left in his finances. This meant that his 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. He wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount 
he owed Mr Lender.  And indeed from Loan 7 he began to borrow  £300 through  longer term 
instalment loans.  
Ref: DRN60995953I think  that Mr G lost out because Mr Lender continued to provide credit  from Loan 6 onwards. 
These loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use. The sheer number of loans  was likely to have 
had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream (and cheaper) credit  and so 
kept him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
I acknowledge that there was a gap of around eight  months between Mr G repaying Loan 10 
and taking Loan 11. But this was in the context of a borrowing relationship which by October  
2015 had lasted around three years. And during the two year-period of borrowing between 
Loans 3 to 10 there  had only been 33 days during which Mr G wasnt in debt to Mr Lender. 
Im not persuaded  that this break was sufficient for Mr Lender  to reasonably conclude that Mr 
G wasnt still in a cycle of unsustainable borrowing.
So, Im planning to uphold  Mr Gs complaint about Loans 6 to 15 and propose that Mr Lender 
put things right in the way Ive set out below.
Mr G has responded to my provisional  decision. He says that whilst hes disheartened he 
accepts it. Mr Lender says that it has nothing  further  to add.
In these circumstances I see no reason to depart from my provisional  conclusions. So I 
uphold Mr Gs complaint  about  Loans  6 to 15. 
putting things right
Mr Lender shouldnt have  given Mr G Loans 6 to 15 (as outlined  in the table in the annex to 
this decision) and should  put things right as set out below:
a)Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr G towards  interest, fees and 
charges on these loans,  
b)Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr G which were 
considered as part of a), calculated from the date he originally  made the payments, 
to the date the complaint is settled.
c)Pay Mr G the total of a) plus b).
d)The overall pattern  of Mr Gs borrowing from Loan 6 onwards means any information  
recorded about them is adverse, so Mr Lender  should remove  these loans entirely 
from Mr Gs credit  file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires Mr Lender to deduct tax from this interest. It should  give Mr G a 
certificate showing how much  tax it has deducted,  if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above and in my provisional decision, I uphold Mr Gs complaint in 
part. And PDL Finance  Limited (trading as Mr Lender)  should put things  right in the way Ive 
explained.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2020.
