K820x#14complaint
Mr L is unhappy that NewDay Ltd registered a default against his credit  file.
background
In early 2014, Mr L went into arrears on a credit card account he held with NewDay. Mr L 
had initially  set up a direct debit to collect  the full balance but these began to return  unpaid.
Around the same time that the account went  into arrears, Mr L said he contacted  NewDay to 
make them aware that he was changing address to care for a family  member. NewDay  said 
they have no record of this, and continued to send written correspondence to his original 
address. After receiving  no further  contact or payment, NewDay  recorded a default on Mr Ls 
credit file. They then sold the debt to a third party company in December 2014.
In November 2018, Mr L says he became aware of the default.  He paid the full outstanding 
balance the same month. 
Mr L then raised his complaint with Newday. Newday said they held no record of Mr L 
notifying them about his change of address,  and they had an obligation to update his credit  
file accurately when  payments were missed.  They wouldnt remove  the default. Mr L was 
unhappy with this response and so referred  his complaint to us.
An investigator looked into Mr Ls complaint and decided not to uphold it. They thought 
NewDay were not aware of Mr Ls change of address and Mr L knew about the debt. They  
concluded that NewDay had acted reasonably.
Mr L disagreed with this view. Mr L explained  that he had changed  his address on all other  
accounts he held at the time and this was the only account with adverse  information on his 
credit file. He thought  the investigator  hadnt looked at the matter  impartially.
As Mr L disagreed, the complaint has been  passed  to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive decided not to 
uphold the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the investigator.
change of address
Mr L says he called NewDay  in or about April 2014  to explain that he would be moving  
address. NewDay have said that they do not keep call recordings for longer than 12 months. 
I dont think thats  either unreasonable  or unusual. NewDay have, however, provided  contact 
notes  which are the notes they made at the time of each contact they had with Mr L. Whilst 
I acknowledge Mr Ls frustration that the call recordings are unavailable, I think  the contact 
notes provided by NewDay, together with Mr Ls recollections, allow me to make a fair and 
informed decision.  
Ref: DRN53727832Ive seen the notes document  conversations held in both February and May 2014 but dont 
include a record of a conversation about  Mr L changing address. As NewDay had 
documented the discussions in other  telephone calls around that time, its reasonable to 
assume that NewDay would have also taken  a record of Mr Ls change  in circumstances. It 
would have been in NewDays best interests  to ensure they had the correct  contact  
information as at this time the account  was already in arrears.  
So, on the balance  of probability, I dont  believe NewDay were  made  aware that the address  
they held for Mr L was incorrect.  It follows that I dont think  NewDay  did anything  wrong  in 
continuing to write  to Mr L at the address they had on file. And, as Ill explain below, I think 
Mr L knew about the debt and that payments were overdue in 2014  even if he wasnt  
receiving NewDays letters. 
registering a default
Mr L maintains that, as he did not receive  the letters due his change  of address, he wasnt 
aware of the arrears.  Mr L states if he had known, he would have  paid the arrears in full. 
The contact  notes show that on 15 May,  which crucially is after the time Mr L says he made 
NewDay aware of his address change, NewDay discussed  the arrears  on the account with 
Mr L. They show that Mr L agreed to make  the full payment of Â£641  on 28 May and in return  
NewDay would refund some late payment charges.
No payment was made and NewDay wrote to Mr L on a number  of occasions requesting 
payment before closing his account  on 11 August.  A default was registered on Mr Ls credit  
file the following month.
I am aware  that Mr L was a full-time carer at this time and his circumstances were very 
difficult. But I feel Mr L was aware that the account  was in arrears  and that a payment was 
due, whether or not he received the letters  sent by NewDay.  
NewDay allowed Mr L six months  to pay the outstanding balance before  registering the 
default. This gave Mr L a reasonable  opportunity  to pay the arrears. I must also 
acknowledge NewDay are required to report accurate information on Mr Ls credit file about  
how he has operated  the account. 
In this situation, I feel the default was registered reasonably as no payment had been 
received on the account for six months.  So I cant agree that NewDay should remove the 
default from Mr Ls credit file.
Mr L can ask the credit  reference agencies to add a notice of correction to his records  
explaining his circumstances if he wishes. Lenders  may take account  of that if he applies for 
credit in future.
incorrect postcode
In response to the investigators initial view, Mr L raised an issue about the postcode  that the 
third party debt company  held. Mr L stated that he believed N provided the incorrect  
postcode and this meant  he was unable to receive any correspondence  the debt company 
sent. The investigator responded stating they believed  the letters would still have been 
delivered correctly and Mr L disagreed. 
Ref: DRN53727833I am unable  to say for certain whether  the error on the postcode was due to the information  
provided by NewDay.  NewDay  used the correct  postcode in all their correspondence so I 
see no reason why they might have provided  the wrong postcode when they sold the debt. I 
am also unsure  whether  the error  with the postcode prevented the letters  from being  
delivered correctly. 
However, even if the letters issued by the third party  didnt reach  that address due to the 
incorrect postcode,  this would not have impacted Mr L as Mr L has already confirmed he had 
moved. So the point raised by Mr L doesnt affect my decision.
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above, I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint about NewDay  Ltd.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 October  2019.
