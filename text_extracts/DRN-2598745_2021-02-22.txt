The complaint
Mr H complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) wont write off his credit card debt (debt). He 
also complains that NewDay wont amend what it has reported in respect of this debt to 
credit reference agencies.
What happened
Mr Hs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that it 
shouldnt be upheld. In summary she said she was satisfied that NewDay had done nothing 
wrong in its administration of Mr Hs debt and that she had seen insufficient evidence to 
conclude that what had been reported to credit reference agencies by NewDay was 
inaccurate.
Mr H didnt agree and so his complaint has been passed to me for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I can confirm that Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator and 
for the same reasons. There is also very little I can usefully add to what has already been 
said.
Having considered what both parties have said and submitted Im satisfied that NewDay has 
sold on Mr Hs debt. Im also satisfied that when NewDay sold on Mr Hs debt, which it was 
entitled to do, it was neither aware, nor should it have been aware, that such a sale might be 
unfair, unreasonable or inappropriate.
Because NewDay has sold Mr Hs debt on to a third party which, as I say above, Im 
satisfied it could do, even if I was to agree with Mr H there is simply no debt in NewDays 
books in his name to be written off.
Finally, I would add that like the investigator Ive seen insufficient evidence to be able to 
conclude that what has been reported to credit reference agencies by NewDay is inaccurate.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 March 2021.
