K820x#14complaint
Mr K complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA are asking him to repay  money which 
was debited from his account after a chargeback from a credit  card user to whom hed sold 
goods.
background
Mr K has an account with PayPal. In May 2018, he sold a bike through  eBay  for £1500. The 
buyer paid the money into Mr Ks PayPal account  (on 11 June 2018) using a credit card and 
asked Mr K to post the bike to him. Mr K did this and the buyer received the bike on 24 June 
2018.
On 25 July, the buyer initiated a chargeback request through his credit card scheme 
provider. He said the goods supplied  were significantly not as described when  the 
purchase took place.  PayPal put a temporary  hold on Mr Ks account for the £1500 until the 
chargeback request was resolved.
On 28 August, the chargeback was allowed and £1500 was debited  from Mr Ks account. 
When Mr K didnt  pay the balance, PayPal asked  a debt collection agency to pursue Mr K for 
the relevant amount.
Mr K complained to PayPal. He said the £1500  should not have been taken back from his 
account. He pointed out that the bike had not been  returned to him. And he objected to 
PayPals use of a debt collection agency  to chase him for payment.
PayPal said they had no choice but to comply with the chargeback once  the card scheme  
provider had decided  to allow it. And they said they were entitled to ask Mr K to pay off his 
balance, though as a gesture of goodwill  they offered to share his loss and take £700 off the 
debt.
Mr K wasnt  happy with this outcome and complained to us. Our investigator looked into it 
and thought PayPal hadnt  done anything wrong.
Mr K disagreed and asked for a final decision  from an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand Mr Ks anger and frustration about  whats happened. He agreed to post the 
bike to the buyer as a favour, when he neednt have done so. His bike hasnt  been  returned 
to him, but the payment has now been  taken back by the buyer. I can see why Mr K believes 
the bike has effectively  been stolen.
My decision  though isnt about whether Mr K has suffered an unjust and annoying loss as a 
result of his dealings with the buyer.  Its about  whether PayPal have  acted unfairly or 
unreasonably towards  Mr K in the way theyve handled the transaction.
Ive taken into account the terms and conditions which apply  to use of PayPals service. Mr K 
signed up to these when he decided to do business with PayPal.
Ref: DRN41637292The terms ask users to resolve  any disputes through PayPals  own resolution scheme  
which amongst other things requires that any goods  are returned to the seller  before a 
refund is given. But they do say that this cant be compulsory. And they contain a very clear  
warning of a risk that buyers may try to reverse payments through  a chargeback,  for 
example.
They also say where a chargeback is allowed, users may benefit from PayPals seller 
protection programme.  But its clear  that this will not apply if the buyer alleges that the goods 
were significantly  not as described.
In Mr Ks case, the buyer  has chosen to use the chargeback scheme to try to reverse his 
payment into Mr Ks account,  rather than raising a dispute through PayPals own scheme. As 
I say, PayPal do warn their customers that this might happen.
This means  that the ultimate decision about  whether the payment should  be taken back is 
for the card scheme provider, not for PayPal.  PayPal  have  no choice but to return the money 
if the card scheme provider decides the chargeback  should be allowed. Again, PayPals 
terms and conditions are clear about this.
Its also reasonable in this case  for PayPal to say their seller protection programme will not 
apply. Again, the terms are clear, if the chargeback is based on a claim that the goods  were 
significantly not as described, as in Mr Ks case,  then the seller  will not be protected by the 
programme.
So, on the face of it, PayPal  havent acted unfairly  towards Mr K. They warn users about  
chargebacks. They  are obliged to return money  if the card scheme  provider makes a 
decision to allow a chargeback. That decision is not in PayPals hands. And theyre clear  
about when their seller  protection  programme  does and does not apply.
However, PayPal also say they can help sellers to dispute a chargeback. Their note on 
resolving disputes,  claims and chargebacks says:
"Our team of chargeback  specialists can help you build a case  to take to the credit  
card company - assuming  you have  good reason to dispute it." 
So, despite  the fact that PayPal didnt make  the decision  to return the payment, I could still 
conclude that PayPal had acted unfairly  in this case if they hadnt  provided Mr K with the 
service described above.
The facts  here are in dispute  at least in part. PayPal  say they asked Mr K to provide any 
relevant information  which  might  help dispute  the chargeback on a number  of occasions. 
And they say he failed  to provide them with anything of any relevance.
Mr K says he received  initial emails  from PayPal saying the buyer had lodged a chargeback  
request. He says he responded  to these, but got no further requests for clarification or 
further information from PayPal. 
So, we know  PayPal  contacted Mr K to try to assist  him in disputing  the chargeback (as they 
promise to do). We know he responded. And we know PayPal didnt think  his response 
added much to the case  they say he simply reiterated the details of the transaction.  All of 
this was in early August 2018.
Ref: DRN41637293Its here that the two versions of events diverge. PayPal say they went back  to Mr K by email 
on 21 August and asked  him to report his case to Action Fraud   by 23 August. They  say 
this would then provide  relevant and verifiable information about  the dispute.  Mr K says he 
didnt receive that email.
I should say its not entirely clear that the chargeback  request  would  have been  denied even 
if Mr K had done as PayPal say they suggested. However, if PayPal did try to assist  Mr K in 
the way they describe, but couldnt do so because  they received no response from him 
before the chargeback was permitted  (on 28 August), then it would be very difficult  to make 
a case that theyd acted in any way unfairly.
Im aware that Mr K has pointed out that email is not a guaranteed method of 
communication. But its not for us to question whether PayPals decision to use email to 
communicate with their customers is right or wrong.  They havent  treated Mr K unfairly by 
using different means of communication with him than they would with any other customer.
PayPal have provided evidence that the email  of 21 August 2018 was sent  and to the 
correct address. I dont  doubt Mr K when he says he didnt get it, but I dont think its unfair or 
unreasonable in all the circumstances  for PayPal  to have assumed that Mr K received it and 
to act accordingly.
So, Im satisfied PayPal  did take reasonable steps to deliver to Mr K the service they 
promise  to help their users dispute chargebacks where thats appropriate.
In summary,  I do think Mr K has been treated badly over the sale of his bike  hes now got 
neither the bike nor the payment. He says hes been subjected to fraud.  Its not for me to 
determine that. But in any case, if he has, I dont think PayPal are responsible for that.
Mr K says this case shows that theres a loophole in the banking  and money  transfer 
systems that fraudsters  can exploit.  And he thinks PayPal are doing nothing  about it and so 
are complicit  in the fraud. 
I think if thats Mr Ks case, his argument  is not so much about PayPal but about the system 
of chargeback as a whole. And again,  I dont think its for our service  to say that the system 
as a whole  should be changed. 
In this particular  case, Im satisfied PayPal did what they say theyll do in their terms and 
conditions of business. They were prepared to make an argument against the chargeback  if 
Mr K had provided relevant and persuasive information. 
And Im satisfied theyve  not acted unfairly  or unreasonably towards Mr K in the way they 
handled the chargeback  transaction.  I also note that they offered to share the loss with Mr K 
despite being under no obligation to do so, in my opinion.
I also think PayPal are entitled to maintain that Mr K owes them the money theyre asking 
him to repay. And its not unreasonable in that context for them to use a debt collection 
agencys services given that Mr K has so far refused to settle  his balance.
Ref: DRN41637294my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 July 2019.
