The complaint
Mr C complains that Sainsbury's Bank Plc (Sainsbury's) declined his chargeback claim.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so, I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Sainsburys issued a temporary refund when it raised the chargeback for Mr C. Im 
satisfied Â£75 fairly reflects the impact of Sainsburys delay in debiting the funds from 
Mr Cs credit card after his chargeback claim was declined. 
After the chargeback claim was declined, Sainsburys gave Mr C information about 
how to raise a claim under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. 
Sainsburys followed the right chargeback process. The merchant successfully 
defended the claim after testing the product and failing to find any faults. Whilst I 
understand Mr C is unhappy with the response, Im satisfied Sainsburys has handled 
the chargeback claim correctly and its decision to decline it was reasonable. 
I havent found anything to show Sainsburys has made a mistake by declining the 
chargeback claim. I think Sainsburys has dealt with Mr Cs complaint fairly, so Im 
not telling it to take any further action.  
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 May 2020.
