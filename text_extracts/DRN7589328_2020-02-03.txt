Mr M says Elevate Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny),  irresponsibly lent 
to him.
background
This complaint is about twelve short-terms loans Sunny  provided  to Mr M between  
April 2017 and September 2018. Mr Ms borrowing history is as follows  (I have  rounded the 
figures):

Sunny initially rejected  Mr Ms complaint but later offered  to uphold loans 11 and 12.
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and thought that Mr Ms complaint should be 
partially upheld  and concluded the loans from loan five onwards shouldnt have been given. 
Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN75893282the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Neither party has made any comment on loans one to four not being  upheld. And because 
there doesnt appear to be an outstanding dispute about these loans, I wont be making a 
finding on these  loans in this decision.  But I have thought about these loans in the overall  
context of Mr Ms lending relationship.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint. Although Sunny did do a number of 
checks on Mr M throughout his relationship with the business, while  these seem  reasonable 
for the earlier loans,  I think Sunny ought to have realised that by loan five Mr M was starting 
to struggle with managing his money.  So, like the adjudicator, I also think from loan five 
onwards the loans shouldnt have been  given,  for similar reasons.
By this point  I think there was an indication that Mr M was having  problems repaying his 
previous loans. When Mr M came back  to borrow more at loan five, Sunny should have seen 
that Mr M still had three previous loans  outstanding.  It should have questioned whether 
Mr Ms borrowing was potentially  unsustainable.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 
six. I say this because:
Ref: DRN75893283At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr M had taken  out six loans  within  five months. So Sunny ought  to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr M was having to borrow  further to cover  
the hole repaying  his previous loans  was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Ms 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Sunny has 
commented that there was a four month break  between loans eleven and twelve. But 
I would  point out these were  the last two loans in the chain and by loan eleven,  Mr M 
had been borrowing  for twelve months.
From  loan six the amounts borrowed invariably at the higher end of Mr Ms borrowing 
range. So, Mr M had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So overall, Im upholding the complaint about loan five and then from loans six to twelve and 
Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  five to twelve;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan five from Mr Ms credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  six to twelve should  be removed 
from Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr M a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 March 2020.
