Mr W says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny irresponsibly lent to him.

This complaint is about a flex credit  loan and three instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr W 
between September  2014  and December 2015. Mr Ws borrowing history  based on what 
Sunny provided  is as follows:

Mr W has said reasonable and proportionate  checks were not carried  at the time. If they had 
been then Sunny would have seen Mr W was reliant on short  term loans in a sustainable 
manner. Sunny has said all relevant eligibility, creditworthiness  and affordability checks were 
completed. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ws complaint in part and thought the loans from the sixth 
drawdown on 3 November 2014  onwards shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed but it 
did agree  to partially uphold the complaint from the second instalment loan onwards. The 
complaint has now been  passed  to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN07155322But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
Mr W hasnt disputed our adjudicators findings about the first five drawdowns so I wont be 
considering these any further because they are no longer in dispute. 
By the sixth drawdown (3 November 2014), Mr Ws overall pattern of borrowing suggested 
that he had problems managing his money.  This was Mr Ws sixth drawdown in two months 
as well as being  the second at the maximum  credit limit allowed by the agreement.  I think 
this lending does  point to longer term, more serious, financial problems rather than a short  
term need for credit. In particular, I think its relevant  that Mr W was failing to make  any 
inroads into his debt over a number of pay periods. And as far as I can see Sunny was given 
no indication  that this would change going  forward. 
And Ive borne in mind  that the illustrations  for this product show  a single drawdown repaid 
over five months. Even  accepting the flexibility  this plan offers Mr Ws borrowing and 
repayment history was very different to this. 
Given how the flex credit facility had been managed, I also think  that it wouldve been  
proportionate to fully review  Mr Ws financial situation on 3 November 2014 before approving 
Ref: DRN07155323further lending.  And I think  that Sunny needed to verify  the information it found  out where 
possible. This is to make  sure Mr W was in position  to make the loan repayments 
sustainably. Having looked at the information Mr W has provided I can see, amongst other 
things, he was borrowing  and repaying significant amounts to other  short-term  lenders in the 
months before this drawdown. I think that Sunny wouldve found out this information if it had 
made proportionate  checks. And I think it wouldve seen Mr W would not have been  able 
repay the loans  in a sustainable way. So I dont  think Sunny should  have  approved it. 
So Im upholding  the complaint from the sixth drawdown (3 November 2014) to loan 4 and 
Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid from the sixth drawdown (3 November  
2014) to loan 4;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about the sixth drawdown (3 November 2014) to 
loan 4 from Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 March 2020.
