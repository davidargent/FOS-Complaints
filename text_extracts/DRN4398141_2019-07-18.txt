K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that DJS (UK) Limited  (trading as PiggyBank) was irresponsible to lend to 
him.
background
Mr W had 23 loans from PiggyBank between January  2015  and August 2018 as seen in the 
loan summary at the end of this document.
Mr W says PiggyBank should  have  realised he was in a cycle of short-term  loans and 
shouldnt have lent to him.
PiggyBank says it asked  Mr W for details of his income and expenditure and checked his 
credit file for additional  commitments. It says it found his disposable income was between  
£450 and £800 per month and that the repayments were affordable to him. However,  it says 
the consistent pattern of borrowing should have prompted further checks,  so it offered to 
uphold loans  6 to 19 and loan 23.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She considered the pattern  
of borrowing  itself from loan 6 should  have  indicated the repayments  were likely to be 
unsustainable. She said PiggyBank should refund  interest and charges on loans 6 to 23 
(plus 8% statutory interest) and remove the loans from Mr Ws credit  file.
PiggyBank responded to say, in summary,  that the gap in borrowing between  loans 19 and 
20 was sufficient to break  the borrowing cycle. In addition, it says that loan 20, at £200, was 
significantly lower than the £1,150 borrowed for loan 19.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
PiggyBank needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that PiggyBank  should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN43981412the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that PiggyBank was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
Loans 1 to 5
PiggyBank asked  Mr W about  his income  and expenditure and checked his credit file before 
approving these loans. Although,  I consider  some of these checks should have gone  further, 
I cant see there was anything in the available information that indicated  Mr W would have 
difficulty repaying these  loans.
Loan 6
Mr Ws scheduled repayment  on this loan was £620.  Given  hed declared his disposable 
income to be £650, I dont  consider  this was affordable to him, especially given other  short-
term loans were beginning to appear on his credit file.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of PiggyBanks lending history  with Mr W, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which PiggyBank should  reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so PiggyBank should  have realised  
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr W was provided with a new loan within days/weeks of 
settling a previous  one. So PiggyBank  ought  to have realised it was more likely than 
not Mr W was having  to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan 
was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ws indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably;
Ref: DRN43981413oI accept PiggyBank says there  was a break  in borrowing between  loans 19 
and 20, but, given  Mr W had been  borrowing consistently for almost three 
years by then, I dont consider a break of less than three months was 
significant in that context;
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed PiggyBank. Loan 23 
was taken out almost  three-and-a-half years after Mr Ws first. And it was for almost 
three times the amount.  Mr W had paid large  amounts  of interest to, in effect, service 
a debt to PiggyBank over an extended  period.
I think that Mr W lost out because PiggyBank continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ws 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 23 and PiggyBank  should put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. DJS (UK) Limited (trading as PiggyBank)  should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr W paid on loans 6 to 23;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 23, apply  the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr W; 
Remove any negative  information about loan 6 from Mr Ws credit file.
The number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 23 should be removed from 
Mr Ws credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires PiggyBank  to take off tax from this interest. PiggyBank  
must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If 
PiggyBank intends  to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it must do 
so after deducting  the tax. 
Ref: DRN43981414Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 August 2019.
