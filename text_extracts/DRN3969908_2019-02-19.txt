K820x#14complaint
Mr T complains that Cynergy  Bank  Limited (formerly Bank of Cyprus  UK Limited) offered a 
refund of interest  on some but not all of his mortgages. He asks that this is independently 
audited; that overpaid interest  is refunded with compound interest at 10% on the refund; his 
costs of other loans  are paid; and for compensation of £10,000 for the distress this has 
caused him.
background
Mr T had three mortgages with Cynergy  Bank. Two were  in joint names with relatives.  
Cynergy Bank offered refunds of interest  for the two joint mortgages  which  were  subject  to 
re-pricing in 2009.  Mr T says it should  also refund interest on the third mortgage  which  is in 
his sole name. This mortgage was repaid in April 2012. This decision  only considers Mr Ts 
complaints about  the mortgage  in his sole name.  
The investigator didnt  recommend that the complaint should  be upheld.  He said particular 
circumstances led to Cynergy Bank offering  refunds on Mr Ts joint mortgages. This didnt 
apply to the third mortgage. Here, Cynergy  Bank  had applied  interest  in accordance  with the 
terms of the mortgage.  The interest  rate increased  and decreased in line with Cynergy 
Banks base rate. The investigator said there was no evidence of unfair re-pricing or 
changes to the terms of the mortgage. 
Mr T asked  for evidence that he was told about  the terms of the mortgage and the interest 
rate and questioned whether the interest applied by Cynergy Bank  was in accordance with 
the terms. He asked for a table comparing the rates  on his mortgage to Cynergy Banks 
base rate.
Mr T said the investigator mis-stated the position  with his other mortgages. He said he was 
unable to move to a different lender due to Cynergy Banks threatening manner. Mr T asked 
that every  single point  in his complaint is addressed.  Mr T asked for compensation from 
Cynergy Bank and an additional £1,000 from this service. 
my provisional decision
I sent a provisional  decision  to the parties. I wanted  to set out my reasons for not upholding 
this complaint and give the parties  an opportunity to provide further comments and evidence. 
In my provisional decision,  I set out the following provisional findings:
Ive read Mr Ts complaint in detail. We provide an informal dispute resolution service.  
Consistent with this, I will focus on the matter  that is at the heart of Mr Ts complaint.  That is, 
whether interest  was applied to his mortgage  in accordance with the terms he agreed.  
Cynergy Bank sent a copy of the mortgage  offer dated 29 March 2007. The offer letter, 
which Mr T signed on 2 April 2007,  said:
From the date your home loan completes  we will charge a rate of 1.25% above our 
base rate, but with a discount of 0.50%, for a period of 12 months from the date of 
drawdown. After that we will charge a rate of 1.25% above our base  rate for the 
remainder of the term. Our base rate is advertised by notices in our branches and on 
our website and is currently 5.25%. 
Ref: DRN39699082I think Mr T was aware of and agreed  to the terms of the loan. This included changes  in the 
interest rate when  Cynergy Banks  base rate changed and when the discount  period ended.  
Cynergy Bank provided a table showing the changes in its base rate. It also provided  
mortgage statements  and copies of letters to Mr T confirming changes to the interest rate 
applied to his loan. Ive set out the dates of changes to the base rate and the interest rate 
applied to Mr Ts account at the end of this decision.
Cynergy Bank has carried out a remediation exercise in relation to loans  that were re-priced 
from February to May 2009. It confirmed that the mortgage taken out in Mr Ts sole name 
wasnt re-priced. The available evidence supports this. I dont think  Mr Ts mortgage was re-
priced. 
However, there is a disparity between the terms set out in the mortgage offer and the actual 
interest rate applied  to Mr Ts account.  The mortgage offer documents  are inconsistent.  I 
asked Cynergy Bank about this and it provided comments and further evidence.   
The facility  letter said the applicable interest rate was 1.25% above  base  rate with a discount 
for the first 12 months. The mortgage  offer said the interest rate was 1.25% above base rate 
with a discount for the first two years. 
Cynergy Bank says the facility letter is correct. It says while the application was for a loan 
with a discount for two years, it offered a loan with a discount for 12 months. It provided 
copies of its notes  about the application process  to support this. 
I think the available evidence supports what Cynergy Bank has said  that it intended to offer 
a discount for 12 months only. But I also have to consider what Mr T thought  hed agreed  to. 
In doing so, Ive taken  into account the notes made  by the staff member that negotiated the 
mortgage terms with Mr T. Ive also taken into account that the interest rate and discount 
period is set out on the first page  of the offer letter signed by Mr T. I think  if this wasnt what  
Mr T thought hed agreed hed most likely  have raised this at the time.  So, on balance, I think  
Mr T agreed  to a loan with an interest discount for the first 12 months. 
The 0.5% discount was actually applied  to the account until December 2008 (for about  19 
months). Cynergy Bank accepts this was an error. But as this meant  Mr T benefitted from 
the discount for a longer  period  than had been agreed, I dont think  its fair and reasonable to 
require Cynergy Bank to pay compensation. 
I do appreciate that Mr T might disagree. And he may have further evidence about what  
happened when  he applied for the loan in 2007.  I will of course  take any comments  or 
evidence that Mr T provides into account  before I write my final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
Ref: DRN39699083Neither party provided further relevant  comments or evidence in response to my provisional 
decision. In the circumstances,  I see no reason to change my findings or outcome from 
those set out in my provisional decision.  
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 March  2019.
