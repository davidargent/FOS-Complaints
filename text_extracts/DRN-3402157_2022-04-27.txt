The complaint
Mr D believes he held ten separate pension policies, but Scottish Widows Limited has only 
compensated him in respect of one, depriving him of pension funds which are rightfully his. 
Mr Ds original policy was sold by Lloyds TSB Life, which is now Scottish Widows Limited, 
which is why this decision is against Scottish Widows.
What happened
In 1990 Mr D was advised to transfer the deferred benefits of his occupational pension 
scheme (OPS) from his employment with G to a personal pension with Lloyds TSB (now 
Scottish Widows). In 1999 the sale of this policy was reviewed as part of the then regulators 
industry-wide pension review, and Mr D accepted compensation of £11,516 which was paid 
into his plan. In 2002 Lloyds carried out a further review as it had identified an error in its 
original loss calculation, which found Mr D was due additional compensation. £2,556 was 
paid into a new policy (ending ***21F) set up for this purpose, divided into ten segments 
numbered 01-10.
In 2005, aged 64, Mr D took benefits from policy ***21F by way of a tax-free lump sum and a 
modest annual annuity. 
Mr D has sadly been diagnosed with a serious illness and has been sorting out his affairs. In 
doing so he came across the paperwork for policy ***21F which he believes shows he held 
ten separate policies all of £1,000 each. So Mr D asked Scottish Widows about the other 
nine unclaimed policies, believing he should have received ten times the amount of 
compensation.
Scottish Widows explained he received one amount of additional compensation of £2,556.16 
following the re-run of its pension review calculation. This was used to set up policy ***21F 
which is segmented for operational reasons, he never had ten individual policies. But it 
offered Mr D £50 to apologise for the poor service he received when he telephoned Lloyds 
bank and wasnt immediately referred to the pensions team. 
Mr D was disappointed this service rejected his previous pension complaint (about transfer 
delays) in 2004. Mr D believes the evidence hes now provided confirms he had ten separate 
policies. So in November 2021 he referred his complaint about additional compensation to 
this service. 
One of our investigators reviewed all the information provided by Mr D and Scottish Widows, 
including the original pension review from 1999 and the subsequent recalculation in 2002. 
Having done so he was satisfied Mr D was only due one lot of compensation of £2,556.16, 
which had been paid into a new policy divided into segments, he didnt accept Mr D ever had 
ten separate policies. 
Mr D is sure plan ***21F is nothing to do with his OPS from G. He believes hes being 
deprived of pension funds, so asked an ombudsman to issue a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As the investigator explained, before I go on to consider the merits of Mr Ds complaint, its 
important we establish whether this service has the power to do so  this means whether the 
complaint falls within our jurisdiction. This involves verifying among other its been brought 
in time, which usually means within six years of the event being complained about. 
In Mr Ds case, the event hes complaining about isnt the original pension review calculation 
in 1999/2000, but the additional redress he was awarded in 2002 following Lloyds revised 
calculation. So under the six-year rule, Mr D had until 2008 to complain. However those time 
limits only apply if the business (Scottish Widows) objected to us accepting Mr Ds complaint 
for investigation, and in this case Scottish Widows has consented to our involvement so the 
time limits dont apply. So I can look into the merits. 
Having done so, Im not going to uphold it. I realise this will be disappointing for Mr D so let 
me explain why.
Ive reviewed the paperwork provided by Scottish Widows which shows how policy ending 
***21F came to be established. Ive set out the key points below. 
In January 1990 Mr D was advised by Lloyds TSB Life (now Scottish Widows) to 
transfer the benefits of his OPS with G valued at £7,520.85 to a personal pension 
(ending ***303). 
In March 1999 Mr D applied to have this advice reviewed as part of the industry-wide 
pension review. His request for a review was acknowledged by Lloyds in May 1999.
In March 2000 Mr D accepted compensation which uplifted his pension policy by an 
additional 2913.97 units, which had the effect of increasing the value by £11,516. Mr 
D signed to accept this compensation on 21 March 2000.
In April 2000 Lloyds sent Mr D a schedule for his new plan (ending ***729) which 
showed those 2913.97 units were actually valued at £12,125.03 and were invested in 
the managed pension fund. The schedule showed Mr Ds pension was payable in 
2006 when hed be 65.
In 2002 Lloyds identified an error in its previous calculation which revealed Mr D was 
due an additional 836.97 units, and that the correct amount of compensation 
shouldve been £14,844.17, rather than the £12,125.03 hed been paid. Mr D signed 
to accept the additional compensation in October 2002.
On 12 November 2002 Lloyds wrote to Mr D confirming that following its review of 
policy ending ***303, a new personal pension policy ending ***21F had been set up 
containing 836.97 units invested in the managed fund.  
The schedule which was sent to Mr D showed that plan ending ***21F was set up on 
15 October 2002 for a transfer payment of £2,556.16, split into ten segments 
numbered 21F-01 to 21F-10. This schedule explained that the compensation is 
applied in equal proportions to each of the ten policies.In September 2004 Mr D transferred a number of his pension polices (including 
policies ***303 and ***729 but not ***21F) to another business Ill call N. His 
complaint to Scottish Widows about delays was considered but not upheld by this 
service in 2005. 
It's not surprising Mr D doesnt recall the review of the advice to transfer the benefits of his 
OPS with G as it happened more than 20 years ago. By way of background, In October 
1994, the then regulator, the Securities and Investment Board, established an industry-wide 
review of particular pension business carried out by authorised firms between April 1988 and 
June 1994. It was generally known as the "Pensions Review". Firms were required to carry 
out a loss calculation according to a prescribed formula. In 2002 Lloyds identified an error in 
its original loss calculation for Mr D, so it re-did the calculation and paid him the difference 
into a new policy ***21F. 
While setting his affairs in order, Mr D came across the schedule for policy ***21F. He has 
interpreted this to mean that £2,556.16 was paid to one of his ten policies, so he shouldve 
received the same redress for each of the other nine (so £25,561.60 in total). I see why Mr D 
would like this to be the case, but I dont think the evidence supports it.
Mr D only had one policy (ending ***303) which was subject to redress under the pension 
review. The review was originally carried out in 1999 and redress of £12,125.03 was paid to 
Mr Ds new policy ***729 in 2000, which was invested in the managed fund. The redress 
calculation was re-done in 2002 which resulted in additional compensation of £2,556.16 
which couldnt be paid to policy ***729 so a new policy ending ***21F was established for 
this compensation. For operational reasons some pension policies are segmented (divided), 
which enables a policy holder to phase the way they take benefits, taking 25% of each 
segment tax-free, prior to the flexibility provided by later legislation. 
Mr D evidently believes he has been underpaid compensation of more than £23,000. For me 
to agree with him, Id have to be satisfied that his original redress of £12,125.03 shouldve 
been doubled when the calculation was redone in 2002. But the original review calculation in 
2000 shows Mr D was awarded 2913.97 units (which means they were valued at around 
£4.16), and the second review in 2002 awarded him an additional 836.97 units. To arrive at 
an additional £23,000 compensation, those units would need to be worth more than £27 
each, which is implausible. 
Also I think Mr D has misunderstood the clause in the ***21F policy schedule which says the 
compensation (of £2,556.16) is applied in equal proportions to each of the ten policies. I 
think the use of the word policies (rather than segments) is confusing, as it gives the 
impression Mr D has ten separate pension policies. But he only has one pension policy 
number divided into ten segments numbered ***21F-01 to ***21F-10, so the compensation 
was effectively divided into ten, and a tenth of the total (£255.61) applied to each of the ten 
segments, it wasnt multiplied by ten. 
Ive seen a copy of Mr Ds annual statement for policy *** 21F for the year to 6 April 2005 
showing the value as £3,131.94. And as part of his 2004 complaint Mr D provided a copy of 
a letter from Lloyds dated 25 November 2004 which includes the sentence We have not 
received any request to transfer policy [***21F]. The current value of this plan as of today is 
£3,006.78. I think both of these documents support the position that ***21F is one policy 
which started in 2002 and increased in value over a couple of years, it doesnt suggest Mr D 
had ten policies. In November 2005, just ahead of his 65th birthday in April 2006 Mr D decided to take benefits 
from policy ***21F and was given a quote of a tax-free lump sum of £851 and an annual 
annuity of £166.36, paid quarterly. Scottish Widows paid the lump sum of £888 to Mr Ds 
bank on 23 November 2005 and set up an annuity of £171.28 per year, paid quarterly. If 
Mr D believed he had nine other policies of the same value, or that ***21F was worth ten 
times as much, Id have expected him to query it at the time.
So while I realise this will be disappointing for Mr D Im satisfied he doesnt have nine 
unclaimed policies and isnt due any further compensation. Mr D says policy ***21F is 
nothing to do with his previous OPS which was transferred to provider A. I can see in 2004 
he transferred a number of policies totalling around £60,000 to N (which later became A). 
These included policies ***303, the original plan to which his deferred OPS benefits were 
transferred, and ***729, but not policy ***21F which was set up in October 2002 to receive 
the additional compensation which arose when Lloyds re-did its pension review calculation.  
Scottish Widows offered Mr D £50 for the poor service it provided. Mr D hasnt specifically 
raised this as part of his complaint to this service, but I assume this offer is still open to Mr D 
if he now wishes to accept it. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 May 2022.
