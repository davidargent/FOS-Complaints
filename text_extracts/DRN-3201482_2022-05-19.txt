DRN-3201482
The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt do enough to protect 
him from the loss of £491.82 to a scam. 
What happened
In 2017 Mr D was befriended by someone online who tricked him into sending money for 
what Mr D subsequently realised was fictitious medical treatment. Mr D says he realised 
hed been scammed in 2019 when he flew to India to meet the person. He says he then 
spoke to NatWest (in 2019) which said it couldnt do anything.
Mr D sent the money to the scammer through Remitly, funded using his NatWest debit card,
and the transactions appear on Mr Ds NatWest current account statement as follows:
Date Transaction type Amount (£)
4 December 2017 POS Debit Card www.remitly.com 201.99
18 December 2017 POS Debit Card www.remitly.com 111.99
4 January 2018 POS Debit Card www.remitly.com 177.84
Total 491.82
Remaining unhappy, Mr D referred his complaint about NatWest to us. As our investigator 
couldnt resolve the matter informally, the case has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry Mr D lost this money to a scam. But losing money like this doesnt automatically 
entitle Mr D to a refund from NatWest.
I dont think NatWest can reasonably be expected to have prevented the payments Mr D lost 
to this scam. This is because at the time generally, banks were expected to process 
payments a customer authorised it to make. And under The Payment Services Regulations 
and terms and conditions of the account, Mr D is presumed liable for the loss in the first 
instance, in circumstances where he authorised the payments. That said, as a matter of 
good industry practice, NatWest should have taken proactive steps to identify and help 
prevent transactions  particularly unusual or uncharacteristic transactions  that could 
involve fraud or be the result of a scam. However, there is balance to be struck: banks had 
(and have) obligations to be alert to fraud and scams and to act in their customers best 
interests, but they cant be involved in every transaction. And in my opinion, its clear that Mr 
Ds transactions here were not unusual or uncharacteristic. I cant reasonably say anything 
about these transactions should have stood out to NatWest such that it was unreasonable 
for NatWest to process the payments Mr D authorised without getting in touch with him first. I 
therefore cant say NatWest ought reasonably to have prevented the payments Mr D lost to 
this scam.
After the payments were made, I couldnt reasonably expect NatWest to have done anything
further unless or until Mr D notified it of the scam. And even then, because these were debit 
card payments, the only recourse for potential recovery of the payments would have been
chargeback. Chargeback is a process by which disputes are resolved between card issuers
(here that means NatWest) and the merchant. Because Mr D made the payments from his 
NatWest card to Remitly, that would mean the merchant here would be Remitly. So NatWest
would not have had the power to submit chargebacks for Mr D against the scammer, but 
only Remitly. And if Mr D reported the scam to NatWest in 2019, it looks like that would have 
been too late anyway, under the time limits, for chargebacks. In any event, even if this hadnt 
been the case, and I presumed NatWest ought to have processed chargebacks for Mr D, I 
am satisfied that these chargebacks ultimately wouldnt have succeeded, on the basis that 
Remitly provided Mr D with the services he contracted with it to provide (which was to send 
money onto the details he provided).
I realise this means Mr D is out of pocket by £491.82. But I think this was ultimately caused 
by the scammer here, and not NatWest. I cant reasonably ask NatWest to refund this to Mr 
D in circumstances where I dont think it did anything wrong, and where I think chargebacks, 
if made, wouldnt have been successful in any event.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 June 2022.
