At the time of writing  this decision, the balance of loan 13 remains outstanding. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ws complaint  and thought the loans  from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the overall  pattern  of Mr Ws borrowing indicated he was 
reliant on these loans and the borrowing was becoming unsustainable.  Sunny disagreed  and 
said it had done  robust  checks on Mr W  including reviewing reports  from credit reference 
agencies  and these checks did not raise  any concerns. But it did offer to uphold  Mr Ws 
complaint from loan 9. Our adjudicator put this offer to Mr W, but he didnt accept  it.
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider a number of different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
Ref: DRN68129842income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. Having done so, I am partially upholding  the 
complaint. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Ws complaint about loans 1 to 3. Mr W hasnt provided any 
further evidence  or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because  they no longer appear  to be in dispute. 
Sunny has offered to uphold Mr Ws complaint  about loans 9 to 13 and whilst what it has 
offered to do is in line with our approach, I dont think  its gone far enough. Ill explain why.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 4 to Mr W and the results  of these checks  
didnt raise any concerns.  But this was Mr Ws fourth loan in three months so I think  Sunny 
should have been looking to build  a clearer picture  than it did about Mr Ws finances  before  it 
lent to him again.  
I say this because  it was likely Mr W was having  problems managing his money. He had 
taken out three loans  over the previous three months, which  were  still outstanding when he 
Ref: DRN68129843took out loan 4. And this loan was his second  in July 2018.  His combined monthly repayment 
had increased  by an extra £100 in the space of three months.
I also note that Mr W repaid some of his loans early   and some of those all on the same 
day. I think the fact Mr W repaid his loans much earlier than planned  should  have caused 
some concern to Sunny.  As that might be the sort of behaviour  that would indicate someone  
was facing problems  managing their money and needing to refinance loans on a regular 
basis.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr W had taken out six loans within six months and often had more than 
one loan running with Sunny. So, Sunny should  have realised it was more  likely than 
not Mr W was having  to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan 
was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ws indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Mr Ws first loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £250.  At this point Sunny ought to 
have know it was unlikely  that Mr W was borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in 
his income, but more  to meet an ongoing  need.  
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr W was provided with a new loan within days  of taking  out a 
previous one. 
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 13 was 
taken out eight months after Mr Ws first. And it was for a similar amount. Mr W had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect; service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 and 5 as well as loans 6 to 13. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Ref: DRN68129844If Sunny has sold the outstanding debt Sunny should buy it back  if Sunny is able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If Sunny cant buy the debt back,  then Sunny should  liaise  
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made by Mr W towards interest,  
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by 
Mr W which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr W originally made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should  remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr W as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on the outstanding loan. If this results in Mr W having made 
overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on the outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Mr W. However,  if there is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr W. Sunny shouldnt  
pursue any outstanding balances made  up of principal  Sunny has already written-off.
E) Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  recorded on Mr Ws credit file in relation to 
loan 5. The overall pattern of Mr Ws borrowing  for loans 6 to 16 means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove  these loans entirely from Mr Ws 
credit file. Sunny does  not have to remove the outstanding loan from Mr Ws credit  file until it 
has been repaid,  but Sunny should still remove any adverse information recorded  about this 
loan.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr W a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 May 2020.
