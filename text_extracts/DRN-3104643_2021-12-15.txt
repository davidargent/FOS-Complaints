The complaint
Mr S complains that MBNA Limited wont refund to him the money that he paid for some 
accommodation. 
What happened
Mr S used his MBNA credit card in February 2019 to pay Â£361 for some accommodation for 
seven nights for himself and some roommates in March 2019. He complained to the 
accommodation provider that the accommodation wasnt suitable for a wheelchair user and 
he then claimed a full refund from MBNA under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
He wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ss complaint should be upheld. She didnt think 
that the accommodation provider had breached any contract or made any misrepresentation 
to Mr S so she said that she couldnt reasonably require MBNA to refund him for the cost of 
the accommodation or to compensate him for the disappointment that he experienced. She 
thought that MBNA had acted fairly and reasonably in response to Mr Ss claim.
Mr S has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that:
he booked a family room as he needed space for his wheelchair, the room was on 
the ground floor but the toilet on the ground floor was down a corridor and couldnt be 
accessed in his wheelchair; and
all current buildings and hotels must have disabled access by law but this hotel didnt 
so it was mis-sold and there was a breach of contract and misrepresentation by the 
accommodation provider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
Mr S used credit provided by MBNA to pay for the accommodation and, in certain 
circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the 
supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ss complaint about MBNA, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the accommodation provider and 
that MBNAs response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but 
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ss claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
Mr S booked the accommodation online, which was advertised as having a shared 
bathroom, and he added a request to say that he wanted a ground floor room for a 
wheelchair user;
the room that was made available to him was on the ground floor and he used it for 
the seven nights that hed booked it for but he says that he wasnt able to access the 
toilet and hes described the issues that that caused him;
I sympathise with Mr S for the difficulties that he experienced and understand that it 
must have been a distressing experience for him  but the room wasnt advertised as 
being suitable for a disabled person and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr S 
contacted the accommodation provider before he made his booking to check what 
facilities it offered and whether it was suitable for his requirements;
the service from the accommodation provider hasnt been as helpful as I would 
expect it to be and it hasnt fully responded to MBNAs request for information 
relating to Mr Ss claim  although that may have caused additional distress and 
inconvenience for Mr S, it isnt something for which MBNA would be liable under 
section 75;
the accommodation was provided to Mr S and he was able to use it for the period of 
the booking (although I accept that his use of it will have been impacted by the issues 
with the toilet) and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
accommodation provider has breached its contract with Mr S or that Mr S was 
induced into entering into the contract by a misrepresentation made by the 
accommodation provider;
I consider that MBNAs response to Mr Ss claim has been fair and reasonable in 
these circumstances and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that it has acted incorrectly in its dealings with him; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require MBNA to refund to Mr S 
the money that he paid for the accommodation, to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 January 2022.
