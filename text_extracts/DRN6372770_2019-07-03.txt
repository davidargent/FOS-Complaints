Miss B says CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, was irresponsible  when it 
provided loans  to her.
background
QuickQuid provided  four loans to Miss B in 2008  and 2009.  I've prepared  the table below 
from some  of the information  provided by QuickQuid. For ease of reference  Ive rounded the 
sums involved. 
 date takenprincipal

Loan 1 10/11/08 £225  24/04/09 51 £281
Loan 2 05/05/09 £275 11 03/07/09 52 £344
Loan 3 08/07/09 £375 5 03/11/09 51 £469
Loan 4 06/11/09 £500 3 08/12/14 48 £625
All of the loans  were planned  to be repaid  through  two instalments. All of the loans were  
extended beyond  their original term. 
QuickQuid said that Miss B had complained too late  given that she had taken the loans 
more than six years before she complained.  Weve  told QuickQuid why we think we can look 
into Miss Bs complaint. And our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Bs complaint about  her 
loans. She thought Loans 2, 3 and 4 shouldnt have been given. QuickQuid hasnt 
responded to our latest letter and, as it hasnt agreed to uphold Miss Bs complaint as 
recommended by the adjudicator, the matter has been passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Ref: DRN63727702Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending  including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly  speaking,  
this all means that QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. This meant it had to carry out proportionate checks  to establish that Miss B 
could repay  her loans  in a sustainable  manner. Additionally, there may come a point where 
the lending history and pattern of lending  itself clearly demonstrates that the lending was 
unsustainable.
Miss Bs first loan with QuickQuid was £225   the highest repayment, 51 days later, was due 
to be around £281. QuickQuid hasnt provided  details of the monthly income Miss B declared 
at that time. But she tells us it was around  £1,050  and I can see that at the point she took 
Loan 4 she told QuickQuid it was £1,034. So its likely her income  was somewhere in that 
region. And on balance  I dont think that it wouldve been unreasonable  for QuickQuid to 
conclude that Miss B would be able to afford Loan 1. So I'm not upholding her complaint 
about it. 
However whilst Miss B was repaying  Loan  1 it seems that she was in a difficult financial 
situation and QuickQuid became aware of this. Not only did she have to roll-over Loan 1 on 
four occasions she also told QuickQuid about  her problems in emails. For example  she sent 
the following  emails  to QuickQuid:
23 December 2008: I have a loan with you and I am supposed to be paying  £56 at the end 
of this month, however, I will not be able to pay this as I am struggling with money. Would  I 
be able to pay at the end of January instead?
24 January 2009:  What  will happen if I extend it again, will I have to pay the £56.25  end of 
February and the rest end of March? I cannot  afford to pay anything this month.
In February Miss B asked QuickQuid whether she could have a new loan whilst she still had 
one outstanding. It told her she would have  to clear one before taking another.  In mid-March   
she asked how much she would have to repay if she was able to do so by 31 March but a 
week later she extended  repayment of Loan 1 again  until 24 April.
Miss B eventually repaid Loan 1 four months  after originally agreed. And eleven days  later 
she took Loan 2 for a higher amount. 
In the light of how Miss B had managed Loan 1 and her evident financial difficulties I dont 
think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid to conclude  that she would be in a position to repay  
Loan 2 as agreed, in a sustainable way. Shed struggled with Loan 1 which  had been for a 
smaller amount and repaid it only eleven days earlier. This time her highest repayment was 
due to be around £344. So Im upholding her complaint about Loan 2.
And by the time Miss B took Loan 3 a clear pattern of dependency  on short term credit from 
QuickQuid had developed. She had rolled over Loan 2 and even before shed repaid it she 
asked QuickQuid on 1 July how much she would have to repay  if she was to get a loan of 
£350. It replied the following day (2 July)  that the repayment  amount would  be £437.50. She 
then asked how much she needed to repay to clear  Loan 2 and asked if that meant once 
shed paid off Loan 2 she could take another loan?  She then repaid Loan  2 on 3 July.
From the correspondence it seems  that on Saturday  4 July 2009  Miss B applied for a loan of 
£300 but two days  later asked QuickQuid if it was too late to change it to £350. On 8 July 
she was approved for Loan 3  a loan of £375.  
Ref: DRN63727703This pattern of lending and the broader history  rolled over repayments, ever growing sums 
being borrowed and the content of the emails  received from Miss B demonstrated  that 
further lending  would  likely be unsustainable for her. Indeed  she took Loan 4 - for the highest 
sum yet (£500) - three days after she repaid Loan 3. Her first repayment wasnt  made on 
time so she was charged a late fee and it took her until December 2014 to finally repay that 
loan.
Taking everything together Im satisfied that QuickQuid shouldnt have provided Loans 2, 3 
and 4 to Miss B. So I'm upholding her complaint about those loans.
putting things  right
I require CashEuroNet  UK LLC to: 
refund  all interest and charges Miss B paid on Loans 2, 3 and 4
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse information  about  Loan 2 taken on 5 May 2009 from Miss Bs 
credit file.
the pattern  of lending from 8 July 2009  onwards means any information recorded 
about these loans is in itself adverse. So all entries  about  loans  approved from this 
point onwards should be removed  from Miss Bs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss B a certificate  
showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Miss Bs complaint. CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
should put things right as set out.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 August 2019.
