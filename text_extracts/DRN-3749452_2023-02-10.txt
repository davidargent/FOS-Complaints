The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as R, is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) provided a Bounce Back Loan (BBL) to one of its directors on a sole trader 
basis, rather than to the company itself on a limited company basis.
This complaint is brought to this service by Rs directors, whom Ill refer to as Mrs and Mr J.
What happened
On 4 May 2020, Mrs J applied to NatWest on Rs behalf for a BBL. The application was 
approved, and a BBL agreement was created by NatWest and sent for Mrs J to sign. Mrs J 
returned the signed BBL agreement to NatWest on 8 May 2020, and the BBL funds were 
subsequently drawn down.
In March 2022, Mrs and Mr J contacted NatWest to discuss closing Rs accounts as R had 
ceased trading. NatWest rejected the request because the BBL was still outstanding on the 
account, and it was at this point that Mrs and Mr J learned that BBL hadnt been set up in Rs 
name as a limited company, but rather in Mrs Js name as a sole trader. This meant that Mrs 
J remained personally liable for the BBL balance, despite R having ceased trading. Mrs and 
Mr J werent happy about this, and so they raised a complaint on Rs behalf.
NatWest looked at Rs complaint. They noted that they had never held a business 
relationship with R as a limited company because the business account had been set up in 
the name of Mrs J as a sole trader, and that it was against this account which the BBL had 
been successfully applied for. Mrs and Mr J werent satisfied with NatWests response, so 
they referred Rs complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel that NatWest had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation, and so didnt uphold the complaint. Mrs and Mr 
J remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to begin by confirming that this service isnt a regulatory body or a Court of Law and 
doesnt operate as such. This means that it isnt within my remit to declare whether NatWest 
have acted in a non-regulatory or unlawful manner here  such declarations would be for a 
regulatory body or a Court of Law to potentially make.
Instead, this service is an informal, impartial dispute resolution service with a remit focussed 
on fairness of outcome. This means that in this instance, my remit is focussed on assessing 
whether I feel its fair for NatWest to have issued the BBL in Mrs Js name rather than that of 
R, given all the information and evidence available to me.
Mrs and Mr J dont dispute that when the NatWest business account was opened it was 
done so on the basis of Mrs J being a sole trader. However, theyve explained that when R 
was incorporated, which took place shortly after the business account was opened in 2011, 
that NatWest were informed of this and were provided with a copy of Rs certificate of 
incorporation. They also say that from that time onwards they assumed that the business 
relationship with NatWest and the basis of the accounts had been amended accordingly.
Mrs and Mr J have explained that they provided information about Rs incorporation to 
NatWest over a decade ago in 2011. But NatWest dont have any record of ever being 
updated as to Rs incorporation, including any record of a receipt of Rs certificate of 
incorporation. And while its understandable that detailed records from 2011 may not be 
retained by NatWest, given the length of time thats elapsed, I feel that its highly likely that if 
NatWest had been provided such information by Mrs and Mr J that it wouldnt be the case 
that the business relationship between NatWest and Mrs J remained on a sole trader basis.
NatWest have also confirmed that it would never have been the case, had they received 
notice of Rs incorporation, that the status of the business account opened by Mrs J on a 
sole trader basis would have been updated to a limited company basis. Instead, the sole 
trader account would have needed to have been closed and a new business account applied 
for on a limited company basis. But by Mrs and Mr Js own testimony, this never happened, 
and Mrs and Mr J have stated that they assumed the account had been updated to a limited 
company basis following the provision of Rs certificate of incorporation to NatWest.
I also feel that if the basis of the account had changed, this would have been reflected in the 
correspondence that Mrs and Mr J were receiving from NatWest, which would have 
addressed R as a limited company. Again, this didnt happen, and NatWest have continually 
sent correspondence to Mrs and Mr J addressing the company on the same basis as when 
the account was opened  because that basis has never changed. 
Furthermore, even if I accept that NatWest had been given details of Rs incorporation in 
2011 and had failed to act upon these details, its evident that the basis of the account has 
remained as being on a sole trader basis, and I feel that this should reasonably have been 
recognised and rectified by Mrs and Mr J in the intervening years, given the responsibilities 
of account holders to monitor accounts on an ongoing basis. 
Finally, Mrs J received a BBL agreement from NatWest that was in her own name rather 
than that of R, and Mrs J signed and returned this agreement to NatWest. And I feel that Mrs 
J should reasonably have questioned this BBL agreement with NatWest, if she felt it was 
structured incorrectly. Also, if it was the case that Mrs J signed and returned the BBL 
agreement without properly reviewing it, then this wouldnt be something I would consider 
holding NatWest accountable for.
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly by providing a BBL to 
Mrs J rather than R, as Mrs and Mr J maintain. This is because I dont feel that there is any 
compelling evidence which reasonably confirms that NatWest were informed of Rs 
incorporation, and also because I feel that Mrs and Mr J have had ample opportunity to 
recognise and amend the status of the business relationship with NatWest over many years, 
in line with their responsibilities as account holders. And I feel this latter point would remain 
valid and salient even if it were the case that NatWest had been provided evidence of Rs 
incorporation in 2011 and had failed to act upon it.
Im aware that Mrs and Mr J feel that the nature of R as a limited company was explained to 
NatWest during the BBL application process and feel that because this wasnt recognised by 
NatWest that their BBL application process wasnt fit for purpose. 
However, the unprecedented social circumstances surrounding the emergence of Covid-19 that led to the creation and set up of the BBL scheme in 2020 meant that banks such as 
NatWest were asked to process BBL applications quickly and without many of the checks 
that standard loan applications would be subject to. As such, I dont feel that Mrs and Mr Js 
position in this regard holds merit in this unique instance. And this is especially the case 
given that, as previously explained, Mrs J ultimately received, signed, and returned a BBL 
agreement in her own name rather than that of R  which Im satisfied she had the 
opportunity to review and question if she felt that agreement was structured incorrectly.
I realise this wont be the outcome that Mrs and Mr J were wanting, but it follows that I wont 
be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action here. I trust that 
Mrs and Mr J will understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision 
that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 March 2023.
