The complaint
Mr C complains that MBNA Limited (MBNA) lent to him irresponsibly.  
What happened
In August 2016, Mr C applied for a credit card from MBNA. It was approved with a limit of 
£6,700. Then further increases were requested by Mr C, and approved by MBNA:
Date Limit
August 2016 (New card) £6,700
February 2017 £10,000
October 2017 £15,000
 
Requests for increases were declined by MBNA as follows:
Date of decline Limit requested
March 2017 £15,000
April 2017 (two requests) £15,000 each 
May 2017 £15,000
June 2017 £20,000
June 2017 £15,000
October 2017 £20,000
November 2017 £20,000
November 2017 £17,500
January 2018 £20,000
There were three balance transfers  in August 2016 (£6,014); February 2017 (£8,320); 
June 2017 (£8,185). In May 2018, Mr C contacted MBNA and said he was in financial 
difficulty. MBNA stopped charging interest and fees and agreed a payment plan of £70 a 
month. A notice of default was sent to Mr C in October 2018. The debt was sold to a debt 
collection agency in February 2019.
Mr C complained  he said that as a result of MBNA lending him more money, he was 
drowning in debt. At the time when MBNA increased his limit to £15,000, he had three other 
cards with total limits of £29,800. He had taken on two full time jobs to try to pay his debts 
and meet his obligations. More recently, he has contracted a serious illness and had been 
signed off work until the end of December 2021.
MBNA said that Mr C passed their credit checks at each increase. Their information said Mr 
C could afford the increased borrowing. Theyd declined several other requests for increases 
 as responsible lenders. They didnt know anything about Mr Cs financial difficulties at the 
time - until he told them later.
Mr C brought his complaint to us and our investigator said that MBNA had acted responsibly 
when first issuing the card in August 2016 and when agreeing to the first increase to £10,000 
in February 2017. But hadnt lent responsibly when increasing Mr Cs limit to £15,000 in 
October 2017. At that time, Mr C had said his income was £50,000 a year, but MBNA could 
see that his total debts had increased significantly since the earlier checks, Hed also 
incurred a late payment fee and an over limit fee recently. And  there had been six declined 
applications for increased limits between March 2017 and June 2017. All this suggested that 
they shouldnt have increased his limit in October 2017. She said MBNA should refund 
interest and fees charged on borrowing over £10,000 since October 2017 to date, and that 
8% per annum simple should be added to payments that Mr C had made. And  any 
adverse information advised to Mr Cs credit file since that time should also be deleted. A 
suitable repayment programme should be agreed for the remaining debt.
MBNA didnt agree. They agreed with us - that Mr C had revolving debts of £20,000 in 
October 2017. But that was a 40% debt to oncome ratio  given his salary of £50,000. This 
was within their risk appetite  he passed MBNAs credit tests. Our investigator considered 
MBNAs further points but didnt change her mind. In mid-September 2021, she asked 
MBNA for any further comments  but MBNA havent provided any. So  Mr Cs complaint 
has now come to me to look at to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
All lenders have an obligation to lend money responsibly. We must check whether MBNA 
acted in line within the Financial Conducts (FCA) rules on creditworthiness assessment as 
set out in its handbook, (CONC) section 5.2. These say that a firm must undertake a 
reasonable assessment of creditworthiness, considering both the risk to it of the customer 
not making the repayments, as well as the risk to the customer of not being able to make 
repayments. We look at:
Whether the lender completed reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that the borrower would be able to repay any credit in a sustainable way?
If reasonable and proportionate checks were completed, did the lender make a fair 
lending decision made bearing in mind the information gathered and what the lender 
knew about the borrowers circumstances?
And a reasonable and proportionate check would usually need to be more thorough:
othe lower a customers income, and the higher amount to be repaid. 
othe greater the number of loans and frequency of loans.
othe longer the term of the loansIts important to note that the checks must be proportionate to the amount being lent  so the 
higher the amount, the greater the checks must be, and the lower the amount, then fewer 
checks can be made.
 So  Ive looked at what happened in the light of this guidance. And  I think its fair to say 
that when looking at limits of £10,000 and over  these are significant in size, and therefore 
the proportionate checks should be greater than for smaller amounts.
When Mr C applied for the card in August 2016  he stated he had an annual income of 
£30,000. MBNA could see he had other debts of £37,074  but also, there werent any 
obvious financial problems  there werent any defaults or late payments showing in the 
information they saw. So, I cant say they were wrong to issue the card  the checks were 
proportionate to the limit of £6,700.
I looked at the request for the first increase to £10,000 in February 2017. By then, Mr C said 
his salary had increased to £50,000 a year. And MBNAs information showed his debts had 
decreased to £3,311  so that was a modest amount of credit. Monthly payments had been 
made. There was probably a case to be made that MBNA shouldve asked for confirmation 
of Mr Cs salary and his other circumstances  for example, his income and expenditure. But 
 based on what MBNA saw, I think the increase to £10,000 was reasonable. 
Looking at the final increase to £15,000 in October 2017  this is where its clear to me that 
MBNA shouldve carried out further checks, even though they said to us that Mr C passed 
their tests. By then, the increase wouldve meant that MBNA agreed to more than double Mr 
Cs limit in just over 12 months  for what was then a new card holder. Significantly, MBNA 
could see that his debts had increased to £20,547  this was a lot of unsecured credit. And, 
by the date of the increase, Mr C had requested limit increases of various amounts  six 
times, and all had been declined by MBNA. They didnt have any new information about Mr 
Cs circumstances. So  its not clear why, only a short time later after those declines, MBNA 
agreed to the increase to £15,000. 
I also saw that there had been a late payment and an over limit charge in the time since the 
last increase.  And  six requests for limit increases suggests that Mr C was having 
problems, and at least shouldve suggested MBNA found out more about what was going on. 
I think it wouldve been proportionate, under the circumstances to find out more about Mr Cs 
situation  to confirm his salary (which had not been done); to find out about his income and 
expenditure and other debt commitments. I also noted that Mr C had taken a second 
balance transfer of £8,320 in February 2017  which meant hed transferred debt of £14,334 
from other lenders in just over a year. On one hand, this may have been saving Mr C money 
in interest (they were on zero interest, or low interest rate offers); but on the other hand, it 
showed that Mr C had debts elsewhere  and MBNA might have asked questions about that. 
So  I agree with our investigator  MBNA shouldve carried out more checks before 
agreeing to the increase to £15,000 in October 2017.
Mr C called MBNA in May 2018 to say he was in financial difficulty, and MBNA agreed to not 
charge interest or fees from that time and accepted monthly payments of £70  so that was 
the right thing to do. But because the payments werent enough, MBNA defaulted the 
account and sold it to a debt collection agency with the balance at £14,580. 
Mr C is clearly well intentioned  and has taken on two jobs to try to deal with his situation. 
But - he has recently showed us that his health is suffering  he has a serious illness. Hes 
shown us evidence of this and that hes been signed off work until late December 2021. The 
way in which MBNA now deal with the residual debt is a decision for them  having regard to 
the industry guidelines for dealing with customers in financial difficulty. But also, its clear 
that Mr C is now also vulnerable  given his health problems  and MBNA must take that into account also.
My decision is that MBNA shouldve carried out more checks when agreeing to increase Mr 
Cs limit to £15,000 in October 2017. And so  they should refund all interest and fees 
charged on any borrowing over £10,000 since October 2017 to date; and if this results in a 
credit balance, then pay 8% per annum simple on the payments Mr C made since the time of 
the payments. And  MBNA must remove any adverse information added to Mr Cs credit file 
after October 2017. A mutually agreeable agreement should then be made for Mr C to repay 
any remaining debt  having regard also to his difficult personal circumstances as Ive 
outlined.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. And MBNA Limited must:
Refund interest and fees on borrowing over £10,000 from October 2017 to date.
This should be credited to the debt; and if a credit balance results, then pay 8% per 
annum simple on the payments from the time the payments were made.
Agree a mutually acceptable repayment programme for the remaining debt.
Delete adverse entries from Mr Cs credit file from October 2017.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 December 2021.
