The complaint
Mr E complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited, trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk 
(MoneyBoat) lent irresponsibly to him.
What happened
Mr E borrowed two loans from MoneyBoat. The lending history is set out below:

TakenDate 
RepaidInstalments Amount Repayment
115/03/2019 28/06/2019 4 £400.00 £142.22
212/08/2019 Outstanding 6 £600.00 £170.70
Our adjudicator didnt think the complaint should be upheld. Mr E didnt agree with that 
view. He said he was struggling financially when he applied for the borrowing and that his 
difficulties would have been evident from a credit check.
I issued a provisional decision in this matter in which I said I thought the complaint should be 
fully upheld. In the reasons for my provisional decision, I said: 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure M
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts 
and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
However, in this case, I can see that MoneyBoat undertook a relatively comprehensive 
credit check at the point when Mr E applied for both loans. So I would expect MoneyBoat to 
take account of the information it had gathered in that regard when it was deciding whether 
to agree the loans.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MoneyBoat was required to establish 
whether Mr E could sustainably repay the loans  not just whether the loan repayments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this 
is the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on 
time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to 
meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
So in applying that to Mr Es case, I can see that when he applied for loan 1, Mr E 
declared his monthly income to be £2,100 per month. He said that his monthly 
expenditure was£1,260, which included £450 for credit repayments. Based on the figures 
provided by Mr E, the loan could have appeared affordable.
However, MoneyBoat made some adjustments to Mr Es income and assessed the 
application on the basis that he earned £1,935 per month. It made no adjustment to his 
credit expenditure. But looking at the credit report MoneyBoat obtained, I think Mr Es 
credit repayments at that time would have been closer to £1,000 per month. And putting 
that together with his other day to day expenses, I dont think Mr E would have had 
enough money to sustainably repay loan 1. On that basis, I dont think MoneyBoat should 
have agreed to this borrowing.
Mr E then made another four applications to MoneyBoat. On three occasions, he applied 
to borrow £1,500 and on another, he asked for £400. All of those applications were 
declined. Then in August 2019, he applied for £1,000. MoneyBoat didnt lend him that 
much, but it did agree to a loan of £600.
Again, when doing so, MoneyBoat looked at Mr Es income and expenditure. Mr E said his 
monthly income was £2,000 per month. MoneyBoat revised that figure down to £1,957. It 
also undertook another fairly comprehensive credit check. Looking at what was contained 
in that credit report, it appears to me that Mr Es expected monthly debt repayments 
exceeded his monthly income. That is even before Mr E had paid for his food, rent, 
transport and utilities.
So when Mr E made this application, MoneyBoat knew he had applied for several large 
loans, which had been declined. That should have put it on notice that Mr E was looking 
for a lot of credit. The credit report showed that he had opened 12 new credit accounts in 
the preceding six months, which is a further indication that he was in financial trouble. But 
most importantly, his expenditure outweighed his income by far. My provisional view is that 
it should have been absolutely clear to MoneyBoat that Mr E could not sustainably repay 
loan 2. I dont think this loan should have been agreed either.
I asked the parties to comment on how I was proposing to settle the complaint. Mr E 
responded and provided an update about the repayments hed made to MoneyBoat.  
MoneyBoat didnt respond at all to my provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website
Having reconsidered all of the information before me and in the absence of any new 
substantive information, I see no reason to depart from my provisional findings, So for the 
reasons set out above, I uphold this complaint in respect of loans 1 and 2. MoneyBoat will 
need to take action to put things right . 
.Putting things rightMoneyBoat shouldnt have given Mr E loans 1 and 2.
I understand there is an outstanding balance in respect of loan 2. If that is the case and 
MoneyBoat has sold the outstanding debt, it must buy it back if it is able to do so. If it is not 
able to buy it back, it must liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined 
below:
a. MoneyBoat must add together the total of the repayments made by Mr E 
towards interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding 
balance, not including anything that has already been refunded;
b. MoneyBoat must calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made 
by Mr E which were considered as part of paragraph (a) from the date Mr E 
originally made the payments to the date the complaint is settled;
c. MoneyBoat must remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any 
upheld outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr E as though they 
had been repayments of principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr E 
having made overpayments, MoneyBoat should refund these overpayments with 
8%* simple interest calculated on the overpayments from the date the 
overpayments would have arisen to the date the complaint is settled. It must then 
refund the amounts calculated in paragraphs (a) and (b) and move to step (e);
d. If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculated in (a) and (b) 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on the outstanding loan. If this 
results in a surplus, then the surplus must be repaid to Mr E. However, if there is 
still an outstanding balance, MoneyBoat should try to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Mr E. It must not pursue outstanding balances made up of 
principal it has already written off;
e. MoneyBoat must remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Es credit file 
in respect of loans 1 and 2.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat
must give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require Evergreen Finance London Limited, trading as 
MoneyBoat.co.uk to put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 September 2020
