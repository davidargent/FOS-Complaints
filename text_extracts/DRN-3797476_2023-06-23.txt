The complaint
Mr H complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) has refused to refund the money he has 
lost following him falling victim to a scam. 
Mr H is being represented by a third party. To keep things simple, I will refer to Mr H 
throughout my decision.
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to all parties, so I wont repeat what 
happened in detail.
In summary, Mr H met a woman (X) via an online dating application. Mr H got to know X by 
initially chatting through the app and then via WhatsApp. Having built trust with Mr H, X 
started to talk about crypto investments she was involved in. Mr H explained he was 
interested, and X walked him through how to make an investment himself.
X explained that Mr H would have to send his funds to a Stic wallet and that he would need 
to use the legitimate cryptocurrency exchange Binance to do this. X helped Mr H setup these 
accounts as he had not had experience doing this before and once Mr H had transferred the 
funds X helped him make the deposits into investments.
X also had a video call with Mr H, and he tells us the person he spoke to appeared to be the 
same person he had met via the dating app.
Mr H was able to see his account online and that his investment was growing. By the end of 
the scam Mr Hs online account was showing a balance of over £2,000,000.
Mr H made the following payments to Binance via his Visa debit card:

1 December 2021 Binance £5,000 Debit Card

Mr H realised he had been scammed when he was speaking to a colleague about the 
investment and how it had come about, and his colleague warned him about an article he 
had seen that was similar and turned out to be a scam.
Mr H has not been able to recover any of the payments he made into the scam.
Our Investigator considered Mr Hs complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Mr H didnt 
agree so this complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It has not been disputed that Mr H has fallen victim to a cruel scam. The evidence provided 
by both Mr H and HSBC sets out what happened clearly. What is in dispute is whether 
HSBC should refund the funds Mr H lost due to the scam.
Recovering the payments Mr H made
The only method HSBC has available to recover payments made via debit card is to request 
a chargeback. But HSBC was unable to process a chargeback for the payments Mr H made 
in relation to this scam to Binance.
The chargeback scheme is a voluntary scheme set up to resolve card payment disputes
between merchants and cardholders. The card scheme operator ultimately helps settle 
disputes that cant be resolved between the merchant and the cardholder.
Such arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme, meaning there are only limited
grounds and limited forms of evidence that will be accepted for a chargeback to be
considered valid, and potentially succeed. Time limits also apply.
Mr H was dealing with the scammer, which was the person that instigated the scam. But Mr 
H didnt make the debit card payments to the scammer directly, he paid a separate 
cryptocurrency exchange (Binance). This is important because HSBC was only able to 
process chargeback claims against the merchant he paid (Binance), not another party.
The service provided by Binance would have been to convert or facilitate conversion of
Mr Hs payments into cryptocurrency. Therefore, Binance provided the service that was 
requested; that being the purchase of the cryptocurrency.
The fact that the cryptocurrency was later transferred elsewhere  to the scammer  doesnt
give rise to a valid chargeback claim against the merchant Mr H paid. As Binance provided 
the requested service to Mr H any chargeback attempt would likely fail.
Should HSBC have reasonably prevented the payments Mr H made?The payments Mr H made to Binance were for a significant amount, to a new payee. So, I 
would have expected HSBCs fraud prevention systems to have been triggered, and for 
HSBC to have asked Mr H questions about the payments he was making.
I can see that Mr H had several calls with HSBC throughout the duration of the scam and 
HSBC has provided a copy of the calls to us. Its clear from the calls Mr H was becoming 
more and more frustrated as payments he was attempting to make were being stopped. 
In one call Mr H is attempting to make a transfer from his account at HSBC to another of his 
accounts held at another bank and he explained he was making this payment to then fund 
his Binance account. Mr H confirmed that no third party was involved in the payments and 
that he had not been instructed or persuaded to make the payment.
In another call Mr H was asked if he had checked with the FCA that the payments were 
legitimate. Mr H avoided the question and instead said he knew the investment was 
trustworthy and that he knew others making the same investment.
The above answers were incorrect as a third party was clearly involved in the payments Mr 
H was making and he had been persuaded to make the payments by X.
Mr H has told us that HSBC should have done more and the scam he was experiencing had 
attributes common to other scams HSBC would have been aware of at the time. Its always 
possible for a business to ask more questions about payments that are being made but its 
clear to me from the above calls that Mr H was willing to give incorrect answers to HSBC 
about the payments he was making so they would be processed. 
For this reason, I think its unlikely Mr H would have given more honest answers had he 
been questioned further by HSBC when the payments were being made, so I dont think 
HSBC would have been able to uncover the scam.
As I dont think HSBC missed an opportunity to prevent the scam it is not responsible for Mr 
Hs loss.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2023.
