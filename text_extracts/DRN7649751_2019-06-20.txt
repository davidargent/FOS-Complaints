K821x#15complaint
Mr R has complained about Liverpool  Victoria  Insurance Company Limiteds (LV) handling of 
his car insurance policy.
background
In February 2017,  Mr R renewed his car insurance with LV. His total premium for the policy  
year was £467.32. In November 2017, Mr R changed his car and his address. His policy was 
therefore amended  with those details and a mid-term  adjustment (MTA) was made.  The 
changes increased  the cost of his policy and he was charged an additional  premium  of 
£102.36 for the remaining  three  months of the policy  year.  During that policy  year, in 
November 2017,  Mr R made a claim on his policy as a result of fire damage caused to his 
car. That claim had no effect on his policy for the 2017 policy year.
Mr Rs policy  was due to renew in February  2018. LV sent him a letter  dated 18 January 
2018 inviting him to renew the policy at a cost of £1,244.71. Another  letter  dated 22 January 
2018 was sent to him quoting a renewal figure  of £2,671.87. And a further letter  was sent to 
him dated 2 February 2018 quoting  £1,070.23.  Mr R said the different quotes  were 
confusing.
Mr R complained. He said:
The additional premium of £102.36 he was charged for the remaining three months  
of the 2017 policy year (following the MTA) was excessive and unfair.
The increase  of his premium  to £1,070.23 for the 2018 policy year was excessive 
and unfair.
The different quotes  he was given  for the 2018 renewal policy  were  confusing.
The 2 February  2018  letter inviting him to renew  for the 2018 policy  year stated that 
the cost of his premium for the 2017  policy year was £791.61.  He said that was 
confusing and inaccurate as his premium  for the 2017 policy  year had cost £467.32.
LV didnt uphold  Mr Rs complaint. Mr R didn't  think that was fair so he brought  his complaint 
to us. One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint.  He felt that LV hadnt  done anything 
wrong. As Mr R didnt agree with our adjudicator,  the complaint was passed to me to decide.
My provisional decision was issued on 31 May 2019. I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im intending to 
uphold this complaint in part. Ill explain why.
Mr R has made a number of detailed points and Ive considered all of those very 
carefully. But, in this decision,  I will focus on what I consider to be the key issues.  My 
role is to decide if LV have dealt with Mr R in a fair and reasonable way.
the additional premium for the 2017 policy year
It might help if I explain that we're not the industry  regulator. That means it's not my 
role to tell an insurer how much they can charge  for their policies. And our service 
generally takes the view that, providing they treat people  fairly - that is they treat 
Ref: DRN76497512customers with similar circumstances  in the same way - insurers  are entitled to 
charge what they feel they need to in order to cover a risk.
Because Mr R changed his car and address during his 2017 policy year,  he was 
charged an extra £102.36 for the remaining three months of his policy.  I can 
understand why Mr R wasnt happy with that and that he found the increase 
excessive. But just because his premium increased, I don't think  that means that LV 
treated him unfairly. LV provided me with information to show how Mr Rs premium 
increased. That information is commercially  sensitive so I can't share  it with Mr R. 
But, having  looked at it carefully, Im satisfied that LV treated Mr R in the same way 
as they would other policyholders in similar circumstances.  So I think  they calculated  
his additional  premium reasonably.
When setting premiums,  insurers  will think about the likelihood that their 
policyholders will make a claim and how much they will have to pay out for those. 
And its not down to me to tell insurers what factors they should take into account  
when assessing  risk, nor how to go about those assessments. Different insurers will 
have different views  on what presents a risk and the extent of those. Thats 
essentially a matter of commercial judgement, balancing risk against the need to 
compete with other policies on offer, and not something we would usually think  its 
fair to interfere with. 
I can understand why Mr R thinks it was unfair for LV to charge an additional 
premium. But each  insurer  will have their own methods of calculating  risk. LV have 
told us that Mr Rs change  of car and address had a bearing on his premium. For 
insurers different cars and addresses present different risks. As insurance is 
essentially an assessment of risk, I dont  think theres anything wrong with insurers 
considering whether or not certain  cars or addresses fall into higher risk groupings.  
So I cant say Mr R has been singled out or treated differently to others in similar 
circumstances. So Im not intending to uphold this part of the complaint.
premium increase for the 2018 policy year
Mr R was unhappy that his premium  increased  to £1,070.23 in the 2018 policy year.  
He said that was excessive and unfair. I can understand why he felt that way, but my 
comments, above, about how insurers rate risks and calculate premiums apply here 
as well. One important  factor  that caused  part of the increase  was the claim Mr R 
made in November 2017 after his car suffered fire damage.
That claim was recorded as a fault claim against Mr R. And recent fault claims do 
tend to cause  premiums to go up, sometimes significantly. But the term fault claim 
can be misleading. Mr R said the incident  that led to him claiming on his policy  wasnt 
his fault. While that may be the case, insurance  industry practice is to record any 
claim as fault where the insurer hasnt been able to recover their costs  (known  as 
their outlay) from another party. To illustrate the point  Ill give two examples:  (1) Car 
A crashes  into car B causing damage. The accident  is car As fault.  Car Bs insurer  
repairs their policyholders car and successfully claims all their costs from car As 
insurer. That incident will be recorded as a non-fault claim because car Bs insurer  
recovered all their costs from the other side. (2) Car A crashes into car B. Car A 
leaves the scene without providing  any details. Car Bs insurer  repairs  their 
policyholders car. But because  the identity of car As driver and insurer  arent  known, 
car Bs insurer is unable  to recover their costs. That incident will be recorded as a 
Ref: DRN76497513fault claim against car Bs policyholder. So, in Mr Rs case, LV didnt do anything 
wrong by recording  the November  2017 claim as a fault claim against  Mr R as they 
werent able to recover their costs  from anyone.
LV have also pointed out that Mr Rs premium for the 2017 policy year initially  cost 
£467.32. But once  the MTA  happened after Mr R changed his car and address,  he 
was charged a further £102.36 for the remaining three months of the policy. LV have 
correctly said that had Mr R changed his car and address  at the start of the 2017 
policy year,  his premium  wouldnt have  been £467.32, but it would have cost 
approximately £400 more. In other words, his annual premium  for 2017 would have 
been around £800. So a large part of the increased  premium of £1,070.23 for the 
2018 policy year was because of the change of car and address that happened 
during the 2017 policy year.
LV provided me with information to show how Mr Rs premium increased in the 2018  
policy year.  That information is commercially  sensitive so I can't  share it with Mr R. 
But having  looked at it carefully, Im satisfied that LV treated Mr R in the same way 
as they would other policyholders in similar circumstances.  So I think  they calculated  
his additional  premium reasonably. So Im not intending to uphold  this part of the 
complaint.
the different  quotes Mr R was given for the 2018 policy year
LV sent Mr R a letter dated 18 January 2018 saying his renewal policy for the 2018 
policy year was £1,244.71. Two weeks later LV sent him a second  letter  dated 2 
February 2018, but this time the said the premium for the 2018  policy  year was 
£1,070.23. The main difference Ive seen  between the two was the higher amount  
had a fee of £70 for breakdown cover, which wasnt included in the lower  quote. But 
that still doesnt explain the difference.  Mr R said he also received a renewal quote 
for the 2018 policy year that said the premium was £2,000. But I havent seen a 
written quote for that amount. I can understand why Mr R was confused by the two 
different quotes,  especially as the second  one gave no explanation for the difference. 
Ive also seen that the 18 January letter said that the premium  Mr R had paid for the 
2017 policy year was £858.04,  whereas the 2 February letter said he had paid 
£791.61 for the 2017 policy year. Again, there  was no explanation for the different 
amounts. I think that caused Mr R further confusion, especially as he was trying to 
compare the 2017 and 2018 policy years to try and understand how much  he was 
charged and by how much his premium had increased. Even after Mr R complained, 
I dont think that LV adequately explained  the different  figures. This confusion  has 
been a source  of distress and inconvenience for Mr R. As a result,  Im intending to 
uphold this part of the complaint and I intend  to require LV to pay Mr R £200 
compensation to address that.
the cost of the 2017 policy
LVs letter dated  2 February 2018  inviting Mr R to renew for the 2018 policy year 
stated that the cost of his premium for the 2017 policy  year was £791.61. Mr R 
disputed that as he said his premium for the 2017  policy year had cost £467.32.  LV 
have explained  that although the 2017 policy did initially  cost £467.32, once the MTA  
was made  in November  2017 to take account of the changes in car and address, LV 
charged Mr R an additional £102.36 which was the pro-rata cost for the remaining 
Ref: DRN76497514three months of the 2017 policy year. So the cost of the 2017 policy  overall wasnt 
£467.32. And had the additional premium  for the changes  in car and address been 
applied pro-rata  to the whole of the 2017  policy year, the cost of the premium for 
2017 would  have been £791.61. So the £791.61 figure was accurate, although I think 
LV could have  explained  it to Mr R. Im not intending  to ask LV to do anything more, 
given my intended compensatory award  of £200 takes into account  the confusion  
caused to Mr R arising from this aspect  of his complaint.
The parties were invited to comment on my findings. LV agreed  with my provisional findings 
but said £200 compensation was too high. Mr R made the following comments:
The November 2017 incident where  his car was damaged by fire was closed as a 
non-fault claim against him as LV were  able to recover their outlay from another 
party.
One of the three different premium quotes he received for the 2018 renewal policy  
was rounded down to £2,000 in my provisional  decision. But the actual quote was 
£2,671.87, so it shouldnt have been rounded down  as it was nearer to £3,000.
He should  be refunded the additional  premium  of £102.36 he was charged for the 
last three  months of the 2017 policy year after he had changed his address and car.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, my findings remain  the 
same. But I would like to respond  to the additional  comments as follows:
Given the distress and inconvenience Mr R experienced as a result of the confusion 
caused by the different quotes,  and considering that he has spent a considerable 
amount of time dealing with the complaint, I think any amount of compensation below 
£200 would  be unfair.
Mr R is correct in saying  that the claim he made  in November 2017 for the fire 
damage to his car was closed as non-fault  because  LV were  able to recover  their 
costs from another  party.  But the claim was closed as non-fault  sometime around 
April 2018. But, at the time LV calculated  Mr Rs 2018 renewal premium in 
January/February 2018, the claim was still open as it was still being looked into. 
And, in the insurance industry,  a claim that is open is, for the purpose of setting  a 
premium, treated as being a fault claim.  Thats because until a claim is closed, the 
insurer cant know how it will be closed. So they treat it as a fault claim and charge  
the premium accordingly. If, as in Mr Rs case,  the claim is later closed as non-fault 
after the premium  has been  set on the basis that it was a fault claim, our expectation 
is that the insurer will recalculate the premium  to see if a refund is due. LV have 
confirmed to our service that after Mr Rs November  2017 claim was closed as non-
fault in 2018, they recalculated his premium for the 2018 policy  year but no refund 
was due. So, while the claim was eventually closed  as a non-fault claim, I cant  say 
that LV were wrong to treat it as a fault claim when  they calculated  Mr Rs 2018  
renewal policy.
Mr R feels  that he should  be refunded  the additional premium  of £102.36 he was 
charged for the last three months of the 2017  policy year after he had changed his 
address and car. But, as explained in my provisional decision,  I think  LV were correct 
to charge him an additional premium to reflect the change in risk following the 
changes to his policy. So Im not asking  LV to make a refund.
Ref: DRN76497515my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I uphold this complaint in part and require Liverpool Victoria 
Insurance Company Limited  to:
Pay Mr R £200 compensation for the distress  and inconvenience caused to him. This 
should be paid within 28 days  of us telling them that Mr R has accepted my final 
decision. If they pay later than this they must also pay interest on that amount from the 
date of my final decision to the date of payment at a rate of 8% a year simple.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 July 2019.
