The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) made his account dormant 
without informing him. Hes also unhappy with how it dealt with a transfer into his dormant 
account.
What happened
Mr C held a Euro account with NatWest. After he sold his overseas holiday home, he asked 
his solicitor to transfer the sale proceeds to his NatWest Euro account. He was then 
intending to transfer those funds to his Sterling account.
Mr C said the Euro exchange rate at the point of transfer was favourable. As he wanted to 
benefit from that exchange rate, and due to the large sum of money being transferred, he 
said he made considerable efforts to ensure the sale proceeds would be successfully 
transferred to his Euro account. He said this included visiting a branch and making 
numerous telephone calls to NatWest.
Mr Cs solicitor transferred the sale proceeds to his Euro account on 18 March 2020 via 
online banking. But the funds were returned two days later. On this date NatWest contacted 
Mr C to explain that his funds been rejected because his Euro account had been made 
dormant  so it couldnt receive the transfer. But Mr C said he was unaware his Euro 
account was dormant as NatWest had failed to inform him that the status of his account had 
changed. And he also said NatWest hadnt contacted him prior to it returning his funds 
overseas.
Mr C said that, as his Euro account had been marked as dormant, he had no alternative but 
to redirect the sale proceeds to his NatWest Sterling current account. His funds credited that 
account on 25 March 2020. On receipt of the money he transferred the funds to his NatWest 
saving account. He said this all caused him to be considerably out of pocket.
Mr C complained to NatWest about what had happened. It issued its final response to his 
complaint on 3 April 2020. Within its final response letter, NatWest explained Mr Cs Euro 
account had been made dormant as it hadnt been used since for a long time. Although 
NatWest didnt believe it had made an error in restricting Mr Cs account it accepted he had 
experienced some service failings when he had tried to discuss his transfer prior to the funds 
being returned. And it credited his account with £300 in compensation to recognise his poor 
customer experience. But Mr C said he lost £5737 in exchange rate differences and he 
wanted NatWest to compensate him for his loss. So, he referred his complaint to our service.
An investigator at our service looked into what had happened but they didnt recommend 
upholding Mr Cs complaint. They agreed with how NatWest had decided to resolve this 
complaint. And they thought the compensation it had paid Mr C was fair and reasonable. But 
Mr C disagreed with our investigators view of this complaint. And he asked an ombudsman 
to review it. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive read and considered all the information provided by Mr C and NatWest, but Ill 
concentrate my decision on what I think is relevant to decide this complaint. If I dont 
comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on board and think about 
it. Its because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right 
outcome.
Im sorry to hear about the difficulties Mr C experienced here. I can understand why hes 
frustrated by what happened. And I acknowledge how shocked he must have been to learn 
that his Euro account had been made dormant. I can see how strongly he feels about his 
complaint. But while I emphasise with him, my role is to assess whether I think NatWest 
made a mistake, or treated him unfairly, such that it needs to now put things right.  
The first issue Ive thought about is whether NatWest made an error in making Mr Cs Euro 
account dormant and Ill explain why I dont think it did.
NatWest said when an account is unused it will become dormant. This is a security measure, 
which will lead to blocks being placed on the account. And this will prevent transfers being 
made or received. The terms and conditions of Mr Cs Euro account explain the 
circumstances in which an account may become dormant. 
NatWest told our service Mr Cs account became dormant in June 2014 as it hadnt been 
used since 2009. I havent been able to check Mr Cs statements between 2009 and 2014 
for account activity because NatWests records only go back six years. 
Im not persuaded that expecting NatWest to have records prior to 2014 is a fair or 
reasonable expectation. I say this because banks are only required to have six years worth 
of records. So, it wouldnt be fair for me to say that NatWest should provide records in 
circumstances where theres no obligation for it to retain them.
Ive looked carefully at the statements NatWest has been able to send us. Based on these, I 
can see there are no account transactions recorded in the last six years. Interest credited Mr 
Cs account in 2016 and 2017  which is when interest ceased to accrue. And, other than 
the accrual of interest, theres been no account activity. 
I think its important to acknowledge that interest crediting an account is an automated 
process, which is initiated by the bank. It doesnt show a customer is using their account. So, 
interest crediting an account, in circumstances where theres no other activity, wont 
ordinarily prevent an account being marked as dormant.
The evidence Ive seen evidence shows that Mr C wasnt using his Euro account regularly. 
Im also satisfied he hadnt used his account for a very long time, which explains why it was 
marked as dormant. Given the history of account inactivity, I cant fairly find NatWest made 
an error in making Mr Cs Euro account dormant.
NatWest told our service that, prior to making an account dormant, it would notify a customer 
of its intention to make their account inactive in line with its terms and conditions. But Mr C 
says he wasnt warned his account would become dormant. And he also says he wasnt 
informed once his account had become dormant. 
NatWest said a letter informing Mr C that his account would be marked dormant was sent to 
him on 3 June 2014. I havent seen a copy of that letter as NatWest hasnt kept a copy. But 
that isnt unusual given the age of that letter. And I have seen records from NatWest that 
persuade me it sent a dormancy letter to Mr C on 3 June 2014 as its told our service. It follows that Im persuaded NatWest informed Mr C it was intending to make his account 
dormant.
I can see Mr Cs told our service he didnt receive the letter NatWest says it sent him. And I 
dont doubt what he says about that. But, as the evidence Ive seen satisfies me that 
NatWest wrote to him as it says, I think the reason he didnt receive it is perhaps due to 
issues with the post. While its very unfortunate when things get lost in the post, I dont think 
it would be fair for me to hold NatWest responsible for that. Its not something over which it 
has any control. 
NatWest said it retains a list of all accounts it intends to mark dormant on a spreadsheet and 
it said it monitors each for a response. It said it didnt receive a response from Mr C prior to 
marking his account dormant. And I cant fairly find that it made an error in proceeding to 
make his account dormant in those circumstances. 
As a result of the dormancy block on Mr Cs account the proceeds of his sale were returned 
to the originating account. I cant say this was an error because dormant accounts cant 
receive funds.
Ive seen evidence of the efforts Mr C made to contact NatWest in order to discuss the 
transfer he was due to receive. And I think this is where things could have been handled 
better. I say this because when Mr C contacted NatWest to discuss transferring funds to his 
Euro account it should have been obvious, at that stage, that his account was dormant. I 
therefore think NatWest missed an opportunity to inform Mr C that his account wouldnt be 
able to receive funds due to the dormancy marker.
Ill turn now to what happened after the sale proceeds were transferred to NatWest. Its clear 
Mr C believes NatWest ought to have told him it was intending to reject the funds his solicitor 
had attempted to transfer. But NatWest said the dormancy marker on Mr Cs account 
prevented it from doing that. And, while Mr C may feel that was unfair, its the process 
NatWest has in place. I think its important to say that, at this point, that the Financial 
Ombudsman Service is not a regulator. We provide informal dispute resolution. So, we dont 
have the power to tell NatWest to change its policies regarding how it deals with dormant 
accounts. Its entitled to exercise its own commercial judgment about that. And that isnt 
something wed interfere with. 
Following on from Mr Cs telephone calls with NatWest, I can see he attended his local 
branch to discuss the status Euro account. Ive thought about whether staff there could have 
reactivated his account on his behalf. But, based on the evidence Ive seen, Im not 
persuaded staff there could have changed the status of Mr Cs account. I say this because 
NatWest said its processes dont allow branch staff to remove the dormancy marking during 
a branch visit. Theyd only have been able to signpost Mr C in terms of asking him to contact 
the currency account unit by telephone, which I understand was the advice provided. So, 
theres no evidence of any error here.
When Mr C attempted to discuss his dormant account with the currency account unit I can 
see he encountered difficulties due to long wait times. NatWest accepts this left Mr C with a 
poor customer experience overall and I can see why he was frustrated. 
NatWest has acknowledged the poor overall experience Mr C received over the telephone. 
And its credited his account with £300 compensation for the distress and inconvenience he 
was caused. Its clear Mr C doesnt feel this amount fairly reflects the trouble and upset he 
was caused. So, Ive thought about what a fair offer to settle this complaint might look like 
here.Mr C told our investigator he suffered a financial loss as a result of exchange rate 
differences. But Ive already explained why I havent been able to conclude that Mr Cs sale 
proceeds were returned to his solicitor as a result of an error by NatWest. I havent seen any 
evidence that Mr C incurred a financial loss as a result of what happened for which I can 
hold NatWest responsible.
I thought about the telephone expenses Mr C would have incurred communicating with 
NatWest about the status of his Euro account. But Im satisfied the compensation NatWest 
has already paid adequately covers any telephone expenses Mr C might have incurred. I 
havent seen any evidence to the contrary. So, Im satisfied I dont need to consider 
awarding additional compensation for telephone expenses here.
Ill turn now to awards for non-financial loss. When our service considers awarding 
compensation for trouble and upset there isnt a set formula that we use to calculate awards 
for particular errors. Its my role to consider what impact NatWests errors had on Mr C and 
to decide, within guidelines set by our service, how much compensation would be 
appropriate in the circumstances.
Ive already explained why I think the service from NatWest could have been better. NatWest 
hasnt disputed that Mr C received elements of poor service and its right that hes 
compensated for the trouble and upset he would have been caused. But our service isnt 
here to punish businesses and, in the overal circumstances of this complaint, Im satisfied 
that NatWest has taken appropriate steps in putting things right here. 
I know Mr C will disagree with me. But Im satisfied that the compensation NatWest has 
already paid is a fair amount thats proportionate to the inconvenience and worry that he 
would have been caused here. Its in line with our approach in similar scenarios and its what 
I would have told NatWest to pay. 
I understand that Mr C is seeking a higher compensation award. But I havent seen enough 
to persuade me that a higher amount is warranted here. So, I wont be directing NatWest to 
increase the compensation its already paid to resolve this complaint.
This now brings to an end what we, in trying to resolve Mr Cs dispute with NatWest 
informally, can do for him. Im sorry we cant help Mr C any further with this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 March 2021.
