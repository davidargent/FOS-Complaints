K821x#15complaint
Miss N complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) gave her loans that she 
couldnt afford to repay. She asks that the interest is refunded and the loans are removed 
from her credit file.
background
Miss N took out five loans between December 2014 and December 2015. She says she was 
taking out loans to repay  existing debts.
Our adjudicator recommended  that part of the complaint should be upheld, saying:
Quick Quid should have made  more checks before loans 1 and 2. But if it had, its likely 
the information it received would have suggested Miss N could repay the loans in a 
sustainable manner.
Quick Quid should have made  more checks before loans 3, 4 and 5, given  the amounts 
of the loans relative to Miss Ns income  and her borrowing pattern. Had it done  so, it 
would have known  she had other  short term loans outstanding and didnt have enough 
income left to meet the repayments for loans 3 to 5.
Our adjudicator said that Quick Quid should refund  interest and charges on loans 3 to 5, with 
8% interest, and remove negative information about  them from her credit  file. Quick Quid  
didnt agree. It said it had provided information indicating why the loans were  lent 
responsibly.
my provisional decision
I didnt agree with all of the adjudicators recommendations. So I sent a provisional decision 
to the parties  to explain why and give them an opportunity to respond. In it, I set out my 
provisional findings and provisional  decision  both of which are substantially  the same  as 
the findings and decision set out below. Both Miss N and Quick  Quid  responded to my 
provisional decision saying they had no comments or further information.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Miss N took out five loans with Quick Quid:

1 24.12.2014 £300 51 days 13.02.2015 £369
2 13.02.2015 £350 91 15.05.2015 £434

5 30.12.2015 £550 76 15.06.2016 £665
Before offering these  loans to Miss N, Quick Quid needed to take reasonable steps  to 
ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In practice  this means that it should have carried  out 
Ref: DRN95798542proportionate checks to make sure Miss N could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Miss Ns income and expenditure. 
When she applied for loans 1 and 2, Miss N told Quick Quid her monthly  income was £1,100 
and her monthly expenditure was £279.  When she applied for loan 3, Miss N said her 
monthly income was £1,200 and her expenditure was £245. Quick  Quid  says it verified 
Miss Ns stated income and did credit  checks, but it hasnt  provided  the results.
In the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks  might be reasonable and 
proportionate. Ive also taken into account  that Miss N told Quick Quid she had no 
dependants and lived with her parents. The expenditure  information  she gave to Quick  Quid 
was consistent  with this. And the income  and expenditure information  she provided 
suggested the loan repayments  were affordable. 
So I dont  think it was wrong for Quick Quid to offer Miss N loans 1 to 3.
I think though  that Quick  Quid  should have considered whether further  lending  was 
sustainable when  Miss N asked for loan 4. I say this because:
Quick Quid ought to have realised Miss N was having to borrow  further  to cover the gap 
in her finances left by repaying her previous loan. As a result,  her indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably. 
Miss N wasnt  reducing the amount she owed Quick Quid. When  she asked for loan 4, in 
July 2015, Miss N had been  borrowing without a significant break since December 2014.  
By loan 5 shed  been borrowing for a year without  a break.  And the amounts of loans 4 
and 5 increased from loans 1 to 3. 
I think that Miss N lost out because Quick Quid continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards. Loans  4 and 5 had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Miss Ns indebtedness  by 
allowing her to take expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time. I also think  her use of these loans  was likely to have had negative implications on her 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Miss Ns complaint about  loans 4 and 5. Quick Quid should:
refund  all interest and charges Miss N paid on loans 4 and 5;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove all entries about  loans 4 and 5 from Miss Ns credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Miss N a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN95798543my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold parts of Miss Ns complaint. I order  CashEuroNet UK LLC to 
take the steps and pay the compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss N to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 August 2019.
