The complaint
Mrs L complains about the amount that shes been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, for damage to a car that she 
returned at the end of a hire purchase agreement. Her husband is also involved with her 
complaint. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mrs L under a hire purchase agreement with Mercedes-
Benz Finance that she signed in August 2016 and she agreed that, if she returned 
the car, she would do so in line with the vehicle return standards that were detailed in 
the agreement;
the car was collected from Mrs L when the agreement ended and an appraisal report 
was completed in June 2019 which identified some damage to the car  and 
Mercedes-Benz Finance then produced a video showing the damage to the car;
it charged Mrs L £435 for damage to the front bumper, an alloy wheel and the 
paintwork but, when Mrs L complained, it agreed to reduce the charge for damage to 
the bumper from £210 to £35;
Mrs L has accepted the charges of £85 for damage to the alloy wheel and £35 for 
damage to the front bumper  so I havent considered those issues any further  but 
she disputes the £140 charge for the chipped paintwork;
the vehicle return standards says that: Any chipping and scratching of paintwork that 
has penetrated the base coat  is unacceptable but Mrs L says that, in its final 
response letter, Mercedes-Benz Finance has accepted that the video  shows the 
damage to the paintwork is through to the base coat so hasnt penetrated it;
Ive watched the video and I consider that it shows damage to the paintwork on the 
bonnet, rear bumper and left door which has gone through the paintwork  including 
the base coat  so I consider that the damage is unacceptable in accordance with the 
vehicle return standards;
Im not persuaded that the damage would reasonably be considered to be fair wear 
and tear or that a charge of £140 for the paintwork damage is excessive; and
Mercedes-Benz Finance has reduced the damage charges to £260 (£140 for the 
paintwork, £85 for the alloy wheel and £35 for the front bumper) and I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to further 
reduce (or waive) those charges - or to take any other action in response Mrs Ls 
complaint.
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 August 2020.
