Complaint
Mr B has complained about personal loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) provided to him. He says that the loans were unaffordable and so shouldnt have 
been provided to him.
Background
118 118 Money initially provided Mr B with a first loan for £2,000.00 in December 2014. The 
loan had an APR of 99.9% and the total amount to be repaid of £3,808.08, which included 
interest, fees and charges of £1,808.08, was due to be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of 
£158.67. This loan was repaid with some of the proceeds from loan 2.
 
118 118 Money then provided Mr B with a second loan for £1,149.14 in January 2017. 
£149.14 of the proceeds from this loan went towards settling the outstanding balance on 
loan 1. This loan also had an APR of 99.9% and the total amount to be repaid of £2,126.40, 
which included interest, fees and charges of £977.26, was due to be repaid in 24 monthly 
instalments of £88.60.
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mr Bs complaint and eventually concluded that 
proportionate checks wouldnt have prevented 118 118 Money from providing Mr B with loan 
2 but that such checks wouldnt have prevented it from providing loan 1. So she thought that 
Mr Bs complaint should be partially upheld. 
Neither party agreed with our adjudicators assessment. So the case was passed to an 
ombudsman as per the next step of our dispute resolution process. 
My provisional decision of 2 October 2023
I issued a provisional decision  on 2 October 2023 - setting out why I intended to uphold   
Mr Bs complaint. I wont copy that decision in full, but I will instead provide a summary of my 
findings. 
I started by explaining that weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable 
and irresponsible lending on our website. And that I had used this approach to help me 
provisionally decide Mr Bs complaint. 
118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is that 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mr B could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
I considered what 118 118 Money had done in light of this.
The information 118 118 Money had provided suggested that it carried out credit checks 
before both loans were provided. The information I was able to extrapolate suggested that 
the results of these credit checks would more likely than not have shown that Mr B was 
significantly indebted and had had previous difficulties repaying credit. Indeed Mr B had an 
extended history of payday loans. 
Furthermore, Mr B appeared to have been more indebted by the time that he applied for loan 
2, a significant proportion of his monthly income was going towards credit repayments and I 
thought that 118 118 Money would have been aware that Mr B was only able to finally repay 
loan 1 with some of the proceeds from loan 2. 
All of this left me persuaded by what Mr B had said about already being in a difficult financial 
position at the time of these loans. While I did accept that it was possible Mr Bs financial 
position wasnt as a result of financial difficulty, I explained that it was my experience of 
these types of cases that this was unlikely. And in the absence of any reasonable or 
plausible arguments from 118 118 Money, I was persuaded to accept Mr Bs version of 
events here. 
As this was the case, I thought that Mr Bs existing financial position meant that he was 
always unlikely to be able to afford the payments to these loans, without undue difficulty or 
borrowing further. And I was satisfied that, bearing in mind everything, reasonable and 
proportionate checks would more like than not have shown 118 118 Money that it shouldnt 
have provided these loans to Mr B. 
As 118 118 Money provided Mr B with these loans, notwithstanding this, it was my intention 
to issue a final decision concluding that it failed to act fairly and reasonably towards him. 
Mr B ended up paying interest, fees and charges on loans he shouldnt have been provided 
with. So I was satisfied that Mr B lost out because of what 118 118 Money did wrong and I 
concluded by stating that it was my intention to issue a final decision that directed it to put 
things right.
Responses to my provisional decision
Mr B didnt respond to my provisional decision and or provide anything further to me to 
consider.
118 118 Money confirmed that it didnt have anything further for me to consider and said that 
it would await my final decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I set out in some detail why I intended to uphold Mr Bs complaint in my provisional decision 
of 2 October 2023. As Ive not been provided with anything further by the parties to consider, 
Ive not been persuaded to depart from those conclusions. So overall and having considered everything, Im still upholding Mr Bs complaint and I 
remain satisfied that 118 118 Money needs to put things right.
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Mr B
Having thought about everything, Im satisfied that it would be fair and reasonable for       
118 118 Money to put things right for Mr B by:
refunding all interest, fees and charges Mr B paid on his loans;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Mr B to the date of settlement;
removing all adverse information it recorded on Mr Bs credit file as a result of these 
loans. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in my provisional decision of 2 October 2023, Im 
upholding Mr Bs complaint. Madison CF UK Limited should put things right in the way Ive 
set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2023.
