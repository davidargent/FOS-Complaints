DRN-4060531
The complaint
Mr N complains that two of his credit card accounts are missing from his credit report with 
TransUnion International UK Limited (TransUnion), which has had a negative impact on his 
credit score.
What happened
In October 2022, Mr N settled and closed several credit cards and paid off his mortgage. 
Following this, TransUnion reduced his credit score, which Mr N says is based on him 
having insufficient credit. However, Mr N holds two active credit cards that arent showing on 
his TransUnion credit report. Mr N says by not reporting these accounts, TransUnion is 
giving potential lenders a false and damaging judgement on his ability to repay debt.  
Mr N tried to raise a dispute online but was only given the option to dispute inaccurate 
information showing on the report, not missing information. So, he complained to 
TransUnion via email. 
In its final response, TransUnion said it was not responsible for the missing accounts and is 
reliant on information being given by data providers.
 
Mr N was unhappy with this response, so he brought his complaint to this service. Our 
investigator agreed that TransUnion is not responsible for the missing information on Mr Ns 
credit file, but thought it shouldve done more to ensure the information it held was accurate 
by raising the dispute directly with the provider of Mr Ns missing credit card accounts. As 
TransUnion hadnt done this, our investigator upheld Mr Ns complaint, and recommended 
TransUnion raise the dispute and pay £150 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience caused. 
Mr N accepted our investigators recommendation. TransUnion disagreed and maintained 
that it can only display data it is provided, and it cannot approach data providers and ask for 
a specific account record. TransUnion also noted that it does not claim to keep a full record 
of an individuals financial standing, and its reports may not always include all financial 
accounts due to lenders not always supplying data to all credit reference agencies (CRA). 
As no agreement has been reached, the matter has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I will be upholding this complaint, and for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator.
I think it would be helpful to start by setting out what I can and cant do here. Providing a 
credit score is not a regulated activity, so isnt something I will be making a finding on. But Id 
like to add some clarity around how it works for Mr N. The score itself is based on an 
algorithm using the data on the credit file, each CRA has its own algorithm based on the 
criteria it thinks is important. Mr Ns credit score will only be visible to him, its a general 
indication which helps customers get a simple view of how their credit file might be perceived 
in a number format. But individual lenders cannot see this number, they can only see the 
data showing on the credit file. Each lender will have their own internal lending criteria which 
they base their lending decisions on, sometimes they also refer to this as a credit score  but 
it is their internal number not the number displayed to Mr N on his credit file.
Its for a lender to provide data to CRAs. But I can consider if TransUnion acted fairly when 
Mr N notified it of the missing accounts. And I dont think it did.
Ive not seen any evidence to support that TransUnion failed to report information provided 
by Mr Ns credit card provider. So I cant conclude it is at fault for the accounts being missed. 
However, TransUnion has a duty to take reasonable measures to ensure the information that 
is reported by lenders via its credit files is accurate. So, when Mr N notified it of the missing 
accounts, its reasonable to expect TransUnion to have raised a dispute with the lender at 
the time.
 
TransUnion has said that credit providers dont always provide data to all CRAs. But Im 
satisfied the provider of Mr Ns missing accounts does report information to TransUnion, and 
therefore it shouldve raised the dispute directly with the lender to ensure the information 
reported was accurate. As this hasnt been done, TransUnion should do so now.
As this service is not the regulator, I cannot fine or punish TransUnion. But I can consider 
the impact caused to Mr N and I do think TransUnions inaction caused him unnecessary 
inconvenience and frustration. So, I think TransUnion should pay Mr N £150 compensation 
in recognition of this.
Putting things right
TransUnion should now:
Raise the dispute with the provider of Mr Ns two missing credit card accounts.
Pay Mr N £150 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, my final decision is that I uphold Mr Ns complaint about 
TransUnion International UK Limited. I now require it to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 November 2023.
