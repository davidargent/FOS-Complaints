K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that PDL Finance  Limited (trading as Mr Lender) was irresponsible to lend 
to him.
background
Mr W had five instalment loans from Mr Lender  between March 2015 and April 2016  as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Max Repayment Due Repaid
1 12 Mar 2015 £200 3m 98.66 29 May 2015 16 Apr 2015
2 22 Apr 2015 £100 3m 63.73 31 Jul 2015 31 Jul 2015
3 19 Aug 2015 £300 4m 178.20 31 Dec 2015 31 Dec 2015
4 4 Jan 2016 £600 6m £224.00 30 Jun 2016 5 Feb 2016
5 15 Apr 2016 £900 6m £472.92 31 Oct 2016 28 Feb 2018
Mr W says Mr Lender should  have carried out better affordability checks. He says that had it 
done so it would have found  he was borrowing from multiple short-term  lenders and was 
unable to repay the loans in a sustainable  manner.
Mr Lender says it asked Mr W for information about his income and expenditure and verified 
his employment.  It says Mr W had a good credit record,  had enough disposable income to  
cover the repayments  and made  all his repayments  on time. Mr Lender says Mr W contacted  
it during his fifth loan to report a change of financial  circumstances and it froze  interest on 
the loan and agreed a repayment  plan.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld in part. She was satisfied Mr 
Lender had done enough checks  before  approving  the first three loans  but considered it 
should have done better  checks for loans  4 and 5. She found that, had it done so, its likely  
to have found loan 4 was affordable,  but that loan 5 was not. She recommended Mr Lender  
should refund interest and charges on loan 5 (plus  8% statutory interest)  and remove any 
associated negative information from his credit file.
Mr Lender responded  to say, in summary that it did not agree that a full financial review was 
required for loan 5 because there was a gap of over two months between loans 4 and 5 and 
so it considered this would be a new chain of borrowing. It said that, based on the 
information it had, Mr W would still be left with a disposable income  of over £340. It adds that 
it also asked Mr W further questions before approving  the loan and Mr W confirmed the 
money was for a holiday,  he was not in financial difficulty and the money wouldnt be used to 
repay other loans.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Lender was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make  sure Mr W 
could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr W was borrowing, and his lending history.  But 
there was no set list of checks Mr Lender  had to do.
Ref: DRN06596882Loans 1 and 2
When Mr W applied  for his first loan with Mr Lender  he said his income was £1,850. As the 
highest scheduled repayment  was a small proportion of that and Mr Lender says it verified  
Mr Ws employment and checked  his credit file, I cant conclude  Mr Lender  was wrong to 
approve the loan.
Mr W repaid the first loan early and applied for a smaller loan a week later.  Again,  I consider 
the information Mr Lender  had about his income and credit record  was enough for it to find 
the loan affordable.
Loan 3
Mr Ws third loan was for a higher amount and came relatively  soon after he repaid  loan 2. 
For those reasons, I consider Mr Lender should also have asked  Mr W about his 
expenditure. I can see it did this and found Mr W had a disposable income of over £1,100.  
So, Im satisfied Mr Lender would have found loan 3 affordable to him.
Loan 4
Mr W repaid loan 3 on time,  but again  quickly applied for another loan. As this was Mr Ws 
fourth loan in quick succession, and he needed to make a repayment of over £200, I 
consider a proportionate  check should  have included asking Mr W whether he had any other 
short-term loans. I cant see it did this, so Ive had a look at Mr Ws bank statements to see 
what hes likely to have said.
Between taking  out the fourth Mr Lender  loan and paying the first instalment, I can see Mr W 
also needed to make repayments  to four other  short-term lenders. These payments totalled 
about £400. Given Mr Ws self-declared  disposable  income was £1,103  and his first 
instalment on the Mr Lender loan was £220,  the payments to the other  lenders would have 
left Mr W with around £500 for any unforeseen expenses. So I think its likely Mr Lender 
would still have found the repayments were affordable had it done proportionate checks. 
Loan 5
By the time Mr W applied  for loan 5, he had been borrowing almost continuously from Mr 
Lender for over a year.  I acknowledge  Mr Lender  says there  was a two-month break 
between loans 4 and 5, but Im not satisfied that thats long enough for this to be considered  
a new chain of borrowing. As this was by far the biggest loan in the chain and Mr W needed  
to repay  over £470 in a single month, I find that a full financial review would have been 
proportionate for this loan. Ive considered what such a review would have shown.
I can see that Mr Ws income  was roughly in line with what  he told Mr Lender at around 
£1,830 per month. But I can see regular expenditure that is significantly higher than what  
Mr W declared. There are regular  monthly payments to a family member of £700, which  
appears to include  rent. Mr W was also repaying  two loans at over £370  per month and had 
regular direct debits  totalling  around  £130. Utility costs were  £65 and TV and mobile phone 
costs came to £130. This expenditure alone  came to around  £1,400,  without taking into 
account the eight credit and store cards he needed  to repay.  Mr W spent  over £400 each 
month on those combined.  He also had three  other short-term loans at the time for which he 
needed to repay around £220  in the same month the Mr Lender instalment of over £470 was 
due.
Ref: DRN06596883So, Im satisfied that had Mr Lender  carried out proportionate checks for loan 5, it would 
have found it to be unaffordable.
I acknowledge what Mr Lender  says about the questions it asked Mr W at the time, but I 
consider it should  have  verified the information Mr W provided in order for the checks to be 
proportionate for loan 5.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. PDL Finance Limited  (trading as Mr 
Lender) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr W paid on loan 5;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loan 5 from Mr Ws credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender  to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2019.
