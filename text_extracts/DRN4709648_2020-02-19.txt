K821x#15complaint
Ms R has complained about loans granted to her by Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny (Sunny or the lender).  Ms R says that the loans were unaffordable  and 
Sunny didnt carry out appropriate checks when she applied for them. She says she was 
borrowing from several other short term lenders and it was a difficult  time for her financially.  
background
Sunny agreed  twelve loans for Ms R from August  2014 to April 2016. The first loan was an 
open-ended credit facility  with a £500 limit. The remaining eleven loans were short term 
loans from £100  to £500, each to be repaid over six months. The below table sets out some 
of the information Sunny  has provided about  these loans (with numbers rounded to the 
nearest pound).

* This was an open-ended credit facility with a £500 limit
Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Rs complaint in part and recommended that Sunny refund all of 
the interest and charges she paid on loans  2 to 12. 
Sunny disagreed with this recommendation but offered to refund interest  and charges on 
loans 8 to 12 because,  it said,  the loans  started  to increase at loan 8 and then exceeded the 
original amount borrowed at the next loan taken, loan 9.
Ms R didnt accept this offer and so the complaint has come to me, as an ombudsman, for 
review and final decision. If Ms R accepts  my decision, it will be legally binding on the 
parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. Ive followed that approach here. 
Ref: DRN47096482The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when  Ms R took out her loans. The 
relevant rules and guidance set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  said that for 
all loans Sunny  needed  to check that Ms R could  afford to meet her repayments in a 
sustainable manner.  This meant Ms R being  able to meet  her repayments out of her normal 
income without having  to go without or borrow further. Sunny was also required to monitor  
Ms Rs repayment record and take appropriate action if there were signs  of potential 
repayment difficulties.
The regulations werent prescriptive  about what checks Sunny needed to carry out in order  
to reasonably assess whether or not Ms R would  be able to meet her repayments 
sustainably. But the regulations said that such checks  needed  to be proportionate. This 
suggests that the same checks might not be the appropriate thing to do for all consumers, or 
for the same consumer  in all circumstances.
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more  difficult  to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
-the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting  that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher  repayment from a particular level of income);  
-the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time 
during which a customer  has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. 
Sunny said that it asked  Ms R for information  about  her income when she applied  for her 
running credit facility. It says if the amount of the drawdown requested constituted  a 
significant proportion  of [a consumers] declared  income, the application was declined.  
Sunny recorded  a figure of £780 for Ms Rs monthly  income and the credit facility  had a limit 
of £500, which Ms R drew  down  immediately. 
Sunny says it asked  Ms R for information  about her income and expenses from loan 2 
onwards. The lender  recorded Ms Rs monthly  income as £780, which  increased  to £1,200 
for her final loan. Her monthly expenses  ranged  from about  £250 to £550,  and Sunny  
recorded this as credit  expenditure  with nothing for essential  expenses  or rent or mortgage 
costs. 
Sunny also said that it checked Ms Rs credit  record  through  a third-party  credit  reference 
agency but it hasnt provided any of the information it obtained in this way. Ms R hasnt 
provided her credit  file or any bank statements so I dont have much information  about how 
she was managing her existing credit commitments. From the information I do have I can 
see that she was borrowing  from other  short term lenders during the time she borrowed from 
Sunny and for two of these, at least, was paying  her loans by way of a repayment plan. 
I think Sunny  ought to have gathered information about Ms Rs expenses when she first 
applied to it for credit. I dont know what she might have told it at that point  it seems she 
gave her monthly credit expenditure as almost £400 some  five months later when she 
applied for loan 2. A monthly  repayment on her credit facility  of £178 might  potentially  have 
Ref: DRN47096483left her with around  £200 to live on each month.  However, given this was her first loan with 
the lender and the lack of information I have from Ms R, in this case I dont find Sunny 
irresponsible to have  agreed to this facility in the first instance. 
Sunny needed  to monitor how Ms R was using this facility. The credit agreement shows an 
example repayment  schedule  with five repayments of £178 should  she take out her full limit 
of £500, which she did. The below table shows her drawdown history (with figures rounded  
to the nearest pound).

Ms R made repayments and then borrowed up to her limit again shortly afterwards. After 
almost four months into what was initially a five month agreement she again drew down an 
amount of £500.  When she repaid  this she took out her first instalment loan within a couple 
of weeks. This pattern  of making payments  then borrowing again suggests  to me that Ms R 
was in a position where  she needed  to borrow to meet the shortfall caused in making these 
repayments. Bearing in mind  what  shed  said about  her monthly  income, I think in this case 
Sunny shouldnt have agreed  to further  loans for her when it closed her credit  facility. 
Sunny has offered to refund interest and charges  on loans 8 onwards because it said it 
recognised that the amount Ms R needed  to borrow was increasing. I agree that it that it was 
irresponsible to have  agreed these loans  but I also think Sunny  should have stopped  lending  
to Ms R before then. I appreciate that there were a couple of two month gaps  earlier in their 
lending relationship and that Ms R borrowed lower amounts for loans 6 and 7. But shed 
been borrowing  from Sunny for almost a year at that point and I think Sunny should have 
recognised then that she wasnt  managing  to make her repayments in a sustainable manner 
and declined  to lend to her. 
Ive noted Sunnys comments about  early repayment, but although Ms R successfully repaid 
her loans, sometimes early, doesnt  mean she managed to do so sustainably.  I think  by 
continuing to lend to Ms R from loan 6 onwards Sunny prolonged her indebtedness to it and 
the number of loans and length of time she borrowed for was likely to be seen negatively by 
other lenders, potentially  keeping her in the market for high cost loans.
Ref: DRN47096484what Sunny should  do to put things right
Sunny was irresponsible to have agreed  further credit for Ms R from and including her 
second loan taken out on the 8 January 2015.  In order to put things right for her, Sunny 
should
-refund all interest  and charges she paid on loans 2 to 12; and
-pay interest on all these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the dates of settlement; and
-remove any adverse information about  loans 2 to 5 from Ms Rs credit file.
-remove all information about loans 6 to 12 from Ms Rs credit file because  any 
information recorded about  these  loans is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I am upholding Ms Rs complaint about Elevate Credit International 
Limited trading  as Sunny and direct it to put things right for her as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 March  2020.
