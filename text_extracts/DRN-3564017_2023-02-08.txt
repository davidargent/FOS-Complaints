The complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain that First Holiday Finance Limited wont refund to them the money 
that they paid for a holiday ownership product. Theyre being represented in their complaint 
by a legal adviser. 
What happened
Mr and Mrs S entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with First Holiday Finance in 
December 2009 to pay for a holiday ownership product. The purchase price was £10,580 
and they paid £500 to the holiday company so the loan was for £10,080. They agreed to 
make 120 monthly payments of £176.20 to First Holiday Finance.
Mr and Mrs S wrote to First Holiday Finance in January and March 2021 and said that it 
appeared that the credit intermediary wasnt permitted or authorised to arrange loans and 
they asked it to explain its position. First Holiday Finance said that all of the sales companies 
used by the holiday company held the relevant licences when brokering finance. 
Mr and Mrs S then complained to this service. Their representative wrote to this service in 
June 2021 and said, in summary and amongst other things, that the credit intermediary 
wasnt authorised to arrange the loan, the holiday ownership product was misrepresented to 
Mr and Mrs S, there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs S and First Holiday 
Finance pursuant to section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act, there was no evidence that a 
credit check was conducted before the loan was granted and the high interest rate was also 
an indication of an unfair relationship. It also referred to an overseas court judgment which 
commented on the unlawful structure of a group of companies which included the holiday 
company and it said that one of those companies was in administration. 
This service forwarded Mr and Mrs Ss representatives letter to First Holiday Finance and it 
issued a detailed response in which it set out the reasons that it didnt agree with the points 
raised. It also said that it thought that the complaint was made outside of the time limits for a 
complaint to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ss complaint should be upheld. She 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale. She didnt think that 
the relationship between Mr and Mrs S and First Holiday Finance was unfair and she wasnt 
persuaded that a court would conclude that the relationship was unfair. She then said that 
she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr and 
Mrs S.
Mr and Mrs Ss representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It has responded to our investigators recommendations in detail and 
says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
 the ombudsman service isnt required to follow the relevant law, guidance and 
practice but to reach an evaluative assessment of the merits of First Holiday 
Finances decision;
 Mr and Mrs Ss complaint is that the loan was sold to them by unlawful means;
 Mr and Mrs S were expressly told that in becoming members of the holiday club they 
would benefit from many holidays at affordable rates  but that hasnt been possible;
 there was an unfair relationship and the loan should have been fully explained to Mr 
and Mrs S;
 the specific entity that brokered the loan hasnt been identified;
 First Holiday Finance has failed to show that an assessment was conducted on Mr 
and Mrs S to determine whether their earnings were sufficient to repay the loan; and
 the interest rate is excessive.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Ss complaint shouldnt be 
upheld but for these reasons:
 we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
 Mr and Mrs Ss complaint is that First Holiday Finance turned down the claims that 
their representative had made in its June 2021 letter to this service and they referred 
their complaint to this service before that letter had been provided to First Holiday 
Finance - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to their 
claims;
 Mr and Mrs Ss claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not 
determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be 
able to do that - Im considering whether or not First Holiday Finances response to 
those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
 section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
 Mr and Mrs Ss claim under section 75 is that the holiday ownership product was 
misrepresented to them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to them - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, First 
Holiday Finance would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was 
brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would 
be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
 the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
 I consider that Mr and Mrs S could have made a claim to the holiday company or 
First Holiday Finance about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into 
buying the product in December 2009 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been incurred 
as that was when they also entered into the loan agreement with First Holiday 
Finance; I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or First Holiday Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made until 
June 2021, more than eleven years later which was outside of the time limits set out 
in the Limitation Act so I consider that their claim is now time-barred;
 even if their misrepresentation claim wasnt time-barred, I agree with our investigator 
that there isnt enough evidence to show that the product was misrepresented to 
them;
 Ive not been provided with a copy of the agreement that Mr and Mrs S entered into 
in December 2009 to purchase the holiday ownership product but Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that the availability or affordability of the 
product was misrepresented to Mr and Mrs S in December 2009;
 Mr and Mrs S first raised their concerns about the authorisation of the credit 
intermediary with First Holiday Finance in January 2021 and there was no reference 
in that letter  or the letter that they then sent to it in March 2021  to any concerns 
about the holiday ownership product being misrepresented to them;
 I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained to the 
holiday company or First Holiday Finance about any alleged misrepresentations 
much sooner than they did  and to have referred to the alleged misrepresentations 
in the letters that they sent to First Holiday Finance in January and March 2021;
 Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs and their representative have provided enough 
evidence to show that Mr and Mrs S were induced into buying the holiday ownership 
product by misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
 Mr and Mrs Ss representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr 
and Mrs S and First Holiday Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, 
amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under 
a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the 
debtor and the creditor;
 the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
 Mr and Mrs Ss loan was settled in September 2020 and their complaint was made 
within six years so their section 140A claim isnt time-barred;
 Mr and Mrs S and their representative say that the credit intermediary hasnt been 
identified but First Holiday Finance has identified the sales company for Mr and 
Mrs Ss purchase of a trial membership and the sales company for their December 
2009 purchase  both of which it says held a licence issued by the Office of Fair 
Trading;
 Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the credit intermediary 
wasnt authorised to arrange the loan for Mr and Mrs S in December 2009 or that the 
loan was sold to them by unlawful means;
 Mr and Mrs Ss representative says that theres no evidence that a credit check was 
conducted before the loan was provided to Mr and Mrs S and that First Holiday 
Finance has failed to show that an assessment was conducted on Mr and Mrs S to 
determine whether their earnings were sufficient to repay the loan  but the 
application form for the loan agreement, which was signed by Mr and Mrs S, shows 
that they were both employed with an annual income of £35,000 each and that they 
were homeowners and I consider that it would have been reasonable for First Holiday Finance to have concluded, based on that information, that they could afford 
to make monthly payments of £176.20;
 the loan was repaid in September 2020 and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr 
and Mrs S complained to First Holiday Finance about its credit checks or the 
affordability of the loan until their representatives letter to this service in June 2021  
and neither of the letters that Mr and Mrs S sent to First Holiday Finance in January 
and March 2021 referred to those issues;
 Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr and Mrs S when 
it was provided to them or that theyve experienced any financial difficulties since 
then; 
 Mr and Mrs Ss representative says that the high interest rate that Mr and Mrs S were 
expected to pay is also an indication of an unfair relationship and that the interest 
rate was excessive  but Mr and Mrs S signed the loan agreement which clearly set 
out the annual rate of interest and the APR and immediately above their signatures it 
says This is a Credit Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it 
only if you want to be legally bound by its terms;
 Im not persuaded that the interest rate was excessive and if it wasnt acceptable to 
Mr and Mrs S I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them not to have 
signed the loan agreement;
 the loan agreement also set out their right to cancel the loan agreement within 
fourteen days but Ive seen no evidence to show that they tried to cancel the loan 
agreement within that period or that they contacted First Holiday Finance about 
ending the loan agreement at any time before the loan was repaid in September 
2020;
 Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs S were 
unduly pressured into buying the holiday ownership product or entering into the loan 
agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices 
against them  they didnt complain to First Holiday Finance about any issues until 
January 2021 (more than eleven years after they entered into the loan agreement) 
and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained to First 
Holiday Finance about any such issues before then;
 Mr and Mrs Ss representative has referred to an overseas court judgment which 
commented on the unlawful structure of a group of companies which included the 
holiday company  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
the structure of those companies was unlawful;
 Mr and Mrs Ss representative has also referred to the administration of one of those 
companies  but it wasnt the holiday company and Ive seen no evidence to show 
that the administration of that company has impacted the holiday companys ability to 
provide the holiday ownership product to Mr and Mrs S;
 Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs S and their representative have provided enough 
evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Ss relationship with First Holiday Finance was 
unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an 
unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs S and First Holiday Finance;
 I consider that First Holiday Finances responses to Mr and Mrs S and their 
representative have been fair and reasonable and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that it has acted incorrectly in these circumstances; and
 I sympathise with Mr and Mrs S for the issues that theyve had with their holiday 
ownership product but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require 
First Holiday Finance to refund to them any of the money that they paid under the loan agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision before 8 March 2023.
