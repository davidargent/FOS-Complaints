K821x#15complaint
Miss H complained about a number of loans  she took out through a company called Elevate 
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Miss H says she was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems. She says she was repeatedly 
invited to borrow more  money.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny.
background
We now know that Miss H took out 11 instalment loans  from Sunny between February 2015 
and October 2017.  Ive enclosed a summary of Miss Hs borrowing with Sunny, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan 5 onwards. Sunny doesnt  agree with this although it later made  an 
offer to settle the complaint which Miss H declined.  So the complaint has come to me for an 
ombudsmans final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Miss Hs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Miss H could repay all the loans  she was given in a sustainable  manner.  These checks  
ought to have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being  
lent, the total repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN36457172There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss H could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Miss H could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Miss H. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of lending history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, 3 and 4 ought not to 
be upheld as they appeared affordable. Ive looked carefully at these and taken note of Miss 
Hs declared income. Ive also looked at what she said about her monthly  expenditure. 
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which Sunny most likely carried  out appear to have  
been proportionate for loans 1  4. And I think these  levels  of checks,  together  with the 
income and expenditure details provided  by Miss H, would have made  those particular loans 
appear affordable  for her. 
However, I think from the point of loan 5 onwards things would have looked different  and 
therefore required a more thorough and responsible approach. By now Miss H had been 
borrowing regularly for a year and Loan 5 increased  her level of indebtedness to Sunny,  not 
least because loans  3 and 4 were still outstanding. This meant she was borrowing to such 
an extent that the repayments represented a very high portion of her disposable income. I 
think any reasonable assessment of Miss Hs financial situation  would  have shown she had 
very little room for manoeuvre and the level of debt was unaffordable  and causing financial 
problems. I therefore  think loan 5 was lent irresponsibly. 
In addition to the above,  from the point of loan 6 onwards  there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident  in my view. In common with some of the previous 
lending, Loan  6 was taken  out whilst loan 5 remained  outstanding and the amount she was 
allowed to borrow increased again.  And from that point on the amounts being lent showed 
Miss H wasnt  making any in-roads into her indebtedness. So there was an obvious 
dependency in my view,  on high-interest, short-term  lending.  
So Im also upholding  Miss Hs complaint in respect of loans 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as well. 
Sunny repeatedly lent to Miss H in an unsustainable  manner  because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
Ref: DRN36457173the length of time over which Miss H borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss H paid on loans 5 - 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges on these from 
the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement;
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loan 11 and treat any payments 
Miss H made towards these loans as payments towards the capital;
if reworking Miss Hs loan 11 account  as Ive directed results  in her effectively having 
made payments  above the original  capital borrowed, then Sunny should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments,  from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date of settlement. 
If reworking Miss Hs loan 11 account  leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, 
then Sunny can use the total refund for the other upheld  loans  to offset this. And if 
there is still an outstanding capital balance  then I would remind Sunny that it should 
take a sympathetic view when seeking  to agree an affordable repayment plan with 
Miss H for the remaining capital.
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Miss Hs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 should be 
completely removed from Miss Hs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Miss H a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Miss Hs complaint. Elevate Credit  International 
Limited should put things right for Miss H as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 March  2020.
