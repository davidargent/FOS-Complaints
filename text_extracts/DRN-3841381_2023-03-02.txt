The complaint
Mr and Mrs Ms complaint is about a mortgage they had with National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest). They are unhappy that NatWest didnt call them when it said it would in 
June 2022, which has resulted in them not having a new interest rate product in place to 
replace the one that expired at the end of that month. When they next spoke to NatWest, 
they werent offered an appointment until September 2022, which meant their mortgage 
briefly reverted to standard variable rate (SVR) and the monthly payment more than 
doubled.
What happened
Mr and Mrs M took out their interest-only mortgage with NatWest in 2006 over a 25-year 
term. An interest rate product was attached, and new ones have been attached each time an 
existing one expired. It appears that most were applied for during a conversation with a 
mortgage adviser at NatWest, but the 2020 product was applied for online. 
Mr and Mrs M told NatWest and this service that they contacted NatWest in late April 2022 
to discuss a new interest rate product for when their existing one ended in June 2022. 
Theyve said that they were told that NatWest would call them on 17 June 2022, but it didnt 
do so. 
Mr and Mrs M say they then called NatWest again toward the end of June 2022 and it said 
they had been due to initiate the call. They were told in this call that the earliest appointment 
to speak to a mortgage adviser was September 2022.
NatWest searched its records and couldnt find any record of Mr and Mrs M contacting it in 
2022 about their mortgage until 9 July. It was in this call that their concern about having to 
wait so long for an appointment was raised. 
NatWest responded to the complaint on 25 July 2022. It said it was satisfied that 
Mr and Mrs M were familiar with the processes for attaching a new interest rate product to 
their mortgage as they had done so before. In relation to the call in April 2022 that theyd 
said they made, and in which an appointment with a mortgage adviser was booked, NatWest 
said it had searched its records for a call between 15 April 2022 and 14 June 2022, from any 
of the numbers it had for Mr and Mrs M, but it had been unable to locate any calls. As for the 
timescale for an appointment with a mortgage adviser when Mr and Mrs M did contact it in 
July 2022, this was because of the demand for appointments at that time. NatWest said that 
it hadnt made any mistakes and so the complaint wasnt upheld.
Two days later, following Mr and Mrs M applying through NatWests website, an offer for a 
new interest rate product was sent to them. The signed acceptance was received on 
9 August 2022 and the new product applied to the mortgage.
Mr and Mrs M asked the Financial Ombudsman Service to consider their complaint, as they 
werent satisfied with NatWests response. 
One of our investigators considered the complaint, but she didnt recommend that it be 
upheld. She was not persuaded that the evidence showed that Mr and Mrs M contacted 
NatWest when they said they did or that it had booked them in for a discussion in June 2022. 
Mr and Mrs M didnt accept the investigators conclusions. They said that it was clear that 
NatWest was under-resourced to deal with the amount of enquiries it was receiving in the 
summer of 2022. As such, they didnt share the investigators confidence that all calls were 
being logged.  They also commented that they would have expected NatWest to have 
increased its manpower to keep response times within an acceptable level. In addition, 
Mr and Mrs M said that while they took their new product in 2020 online, they had discussed 
their options with someone over the phone first. 2022 was no different and that was what 
theyd intended to do. 
Our investigator considered what Mr and Mrs M had said, but she didnt change her 
conclusions. She did, however, clarify that she accepted that Mr and Mrs M had wanted to 
speak to someone, but if obtaining a rate was that important to them, pointed out that they 
had the option and ability to do so online. As for Mr and Mrs Ms comment about NatWest 
increasing its manpower, she commented that this was not always possible. 
Mr and Mrs M asked that the complaint be referred to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs M have said that they called NatWest in April 2022 and an appointment with a 
mortgage adviser was arranged for them on 17 June 2022. Theyve said they think that the 
lack of reference to this call on NatWests contact logs is likely because it was busy at the 
time, and it simply wasnt logged. However, as NatWest explained to Mr and Mrs M, it not 
only reviewed the contact logs for details of the calls from Mr and Mrs M, but it also searched 
its telephone records for any calls coming in from the numbers it has on record for them. It 
found no incoming calls from the middle of April 2022 over a two-month period. NatWest 
invited Mr and Mrs M to provide it with any alternative numbers that might have been used or 
other evidence of the call, but they havent provided any.
To uphold this part of the complaint I must be persuaded that Mr and Mrs Ms recollection of 
events is more likely than NatWests. However, I am not persuaded that is the case. That is 
not to say that I doubt Mr and Mrs M are giving us their genuine recollections of events, but 
simply their recollections are not more persuasive than the evidence NatWest has provided.
I can understand that Mr and Mrs M liked to speak to NatWest about their options before 
making a decision about what new interest rate product to attach to their mortgage. It is 
unfortunate that when they tried to make such an appointment in July 2022 the next 
appointment was in September 2022. However, the then recent interest rate rises from the 
Bank of England had caused an increase in demand for appointments throughout the 
industry, which isnt something NatWest could have controlled. I also note that while it may 
not have been Mr and Mrs Ms preferred way of arranging a new interest rate product, they 
did have the option to do so online if they couldnt get an appointment they were happy with.
I have also noted their comments that NatWest should have increased its resourcing, given 
the demand. Again, this point of view is understandable, however, sourcing mortgage 
advisers is not that simple. Lenders require mortgage advisers to have relevant qualifications 
and they also need to be familiar with the lenders products and systems. So significantly 
increasing the number of mortgage advisers available is not something that can be done in a short period. 
While I have sympathy for the situation Mr and Mrs M found themselves in, I dont consider 
that NatWest did anything wrong in relation to this matter.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr and Mrs M to accept or reject my decision 
before 30 March 2023.
