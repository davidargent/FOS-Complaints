The complaint
Mr F complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold him two business 
loans. Mr F wants NatWest to alter the fixed term of the latest loan to 15 years at no cost to 
him.
What happened
In 2017, Mr F took out a two-year fixed rate loan (Loan 1) from NatWest for property 
investment purposes. In October 2019, Mr F refinanced Loan 1 (Loan 2).
Mr F says that he was led to believe that Loan 1 had a 15-year fixed rate and that he was 
pressured into taking out Loan 1 after members of staff from NatWest visited him at home.
Mr F was then unhappy with the way that NatWest dealt with Loan 2. 
The investigator didnt recommend that Mr Fs complaint be upheld. She thought that the 
agreement for Loan 1 made it clear the loan was repayable in two years. The investigator 
didnt think NatWest had acted unreasonably when Mr F took out Loan 2 as the repayment 
date for Loan 1 had already passed. 
Mr F disagrees with the investigators recommendation. He says he signed the documents 
trusting what NatWest told him. Mr F says NatWest broke the rules by visiting him at home 
to pressure him to sign documents for an unsuitable loan. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear about the distress that Mr F has felt but after considering his complaint, I 
dont find that NatWest has done anything wrong.
In cases like this where the evidence is inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision 
based on the balance of probabilities. That means Ill look at all the available evidence and 
decide what I think is most likely to have happened.
Mr F thinks the lending was irresponsible but Loan 1 was a commercial loan which NatWest 
secured against commercial property owned by Mr F. Im satisfied that NatWest carried out a 
valuation and credit assessment. So, I dont find that NatWest was irresponsible to agree to 
lend to Mr F.
Mr F asks why he would ask for such a large amount of money in 2017 if he had to repay it 
in two years rather than 15 years. I understand Mr Fs point but this doesnt take away from 
the fact that the agreement he signed said the final repayment date was 24 months after 
Loan 1 was drawn. 
The repayment terms for Loan 1 referred to monthly instalments of around £726 followed by 
a final instalment of an amount sufficient to repay the Loan and interest in full. Im satisfied 
that the Loan 1 agreement made it clear to Mr F that he would need to repay the loan in 2 
years.
Ive also seen a customer declaration document which states that Loan 1 will expire 24 
months after the date the loan was drawn. It asks Mr F to accept that Loan 1 was subject to 
a commitment period of 2 years and that the residual balance outstanding upon expiry of 
the commitment period must be repaid in full. 
The same form says that NatWest isnt obliged to refinance the residual balance when the 
loan term expires but that if it did, Mr F may have to pay an updated valuation fee, 
arrangement fee and interest. Mr F signed the form in May 2017 so I cant reasonably find 
that NatWest didnt make him aware of what would happen once Loan 1 expired in two 
years time.
Although the Loan 1 agreement does include a clause which mentions a repayment term of 
15 years this is only to explain that the instalments were based on a 15 year repayment 
term. And it comes with the warning that the amount of the final instalment may be 
substantial. All of this makes it difficult for me to conclude that NatWest didnt make Mr F 
aware that the term of Loan 1 was two years rather than 15.
Mr F says he was pressurised by NatWest staff members into signing the Loan 1 agreement 
at home. But NatWest says that its not unusual for a relationship manager to meet 
customers face to face at home and this seems reasonable. There is also a telephone note 
from a few days before Mr F signed the Loan 1 agreement which says that hes instructed 
solicitors  presumably to look over the paperwork, including the Loan 1 agreement which 
says clearly at the top: THIS AGREEMENT AND THE BANKS BASE RATE LOAN TERMS 
TOGETHER FORM AN IMPORTANT CONTRACT. YOU SHOULD TAKE LEGAL ADVICE 
BEFORE SIGNING. This seems to indicate that Mr F had the opportunity to consider things 
and seek independent advice before signing the Loan 1 agreement. Overall, I dont have 
enough evidence to conclude that Mr F was pressured or misled by NatWest into signing the 
Loan 1 agreement.
As Mr F couldnt repay the outstanding balance on Loan 1, I dont think NatWest was wrong 
to explore his refinance options with him. Im satisfied that NatWest treated Mr F fairly when 
it gave him more time to consider his options at the end of the fixed term on Loan 1.
Mr F says he felt threatened and intimidated by a member of staff in 2019. Mr Fs 
recollection is that the member of staff told him that if he didnt renew Loan 1, hed have to 
repay it in full or go to a different bank. I can understand Mr F was upset to hear this but 
what the member of staff told Mr F was correct. NatWest doesnt record calls within its 
relationship management offices so its difficult for me to say that the member of staff spoke 
to Mr F in a threatening or inappropriate way. 
Mr F wasnt happy with the proposed interest rates in 2019. But as NatWest explained, it 
couldnt negotiate the fees or rates on commercial property deals. On balance, Im not 
persuaded that NatWest misled Mr F into thinking that the rates were negotiable when it said 
they werent.
There is an email from Mr F to NatWest in November 2019 in which he confirms which loan 
option he would prefer. Mr F says he would take the 3 years fixed loan with monthly 
payments of £785. 
From reading some of the emails in November 2019, I can see that Mr F, through his wife, 
had expressed concerns that the quoted interest rate and monthly payments for Loan 2 were 
higher than expected when compared to Loan 1. There was also mention of misleading information about Loan 1 and that NatWest had originally said that the rates for Loan 2 could 
be negotiated.
However, NatWest responded to these concerns at the time and Mr F went on to sign the 
paperwork for Loan 2. It seems to me that in 2019 it was more a case of Mr F being unhappy 
with the proposed terms, which although unfortunate, doesnt mean that NatWest made a 
mistake.
Although Mr F felt pressurised into accepting the terms of Loan 2, I dont think NatWest did 
anything wrong. As Im not persuaded that NatWest misled Mr F when he took out Loan 1, it 
follows that when Loan 1 expired in 2019, Mr F would need to either repay the loan or 
refinance it. NatWest wasnt obliged to match the earlier interest rate and if Mr F was 
unhappy with the terms that NatWest proposed in 2019, he couldve approached another 
lender to see if it would offer a better deal. 
Overall, I dont find that NatWest did anything wrong, so I wont be asking it to take further 
action.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 June 2022.
