Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Rs complaint about loans 5 onwards  and thought these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed with this opinion, but it did agree that it 
shouldnt have lent Mr R loans 10  12. So Sunny has now agreed to uphold  Mr Rs 
complaint about  loans  10 onwards but still doesnt think the other loans should be upheld.  
So, the complaint has been passed  to me to make  a final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN00903002the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.  Our adjudicator  felt that loans 1  4 
should not be upheld and Mr R appears  to have agreed to these  findings.  So as these  loans 
are no longer in dispute, I havent made any findings  in respect  of these. However,  I have 
thought about these  loans  when looking at Mr Rs overall lending  history with Sunny.   
Sunny says that when Mr R was applying for each of his loans it enquired about his income 
and expenses, including any short-term lending commitments. However, by the time Mr R 
was applying for his fifth loan I think it shouldve completed a more substantial  review of Mr 
Rs financial  situation. 
Bases on the evidence  Ive seen a proportionate check for loans 5 onwards would most 
likely have shown that Mr R was borrowing from other short-term  lenders around the same 
time period. Also, had Sunny fully reviewed Mr Rs current financial situation at the time, it 
shouldve also taken  into account Mr Rs borrowing  history with it so far.  
Mr R had taken out loans 1 and 2 within one month  of each other, and at that time he was 
£1000 in debt.  Loans 3 and 4 were also taken out within one month of each other, and these 
loans combined  meant  he was then £700 in debt. Mr R then applied for Loan 5 just a few 
days after taking out loan 4. So, this record of borrowing,  coupled with the fact that Mr R had 
short-term loans with other providers  at the time suggests that he was in financial difficulty. 
And had Sunny completed a proportionate  check for loan 5 they ought to have decided not 
to lend Mr R this loan - or any subsequent  loans.   
Ref: DRN00903003Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which it should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I agree with our adjudicators  opinion  and 
think that this point was reached by loan 9. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr R was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr R had taken out eight loans within ten months.  And Mr R had applied  
to borrow loan 9 on the same  day he took out loan 8 and for the same  amount  
whilst he still had loan 7 outstanding. So Sunny ought to have realised that Mr R 
wasnt able to manage his current borrowings and it was more  likely than not he was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  previous  loans  was leaving in his 
finances.
Mr Rs borrowing over the first eight loans varied, but the amounts borrowed were not 
significantly reducing over this time. So, by loan 9 Sunny  ought  to have known that 
Mr R was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet 
an ongoing need. 
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  12 was 
taken out more than a year after Mr Rs first. So, Mr R had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 9 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr R borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 5 - 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5, 6, 7 and 8 from Mr Rs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 9, 10, 11 and 12 should  be 
removed from Mr Rs credit file.
Ref: DRN00903004 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr R compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2020.
