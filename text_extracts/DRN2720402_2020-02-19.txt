K820x#14complaint
Miss R says Provident Personal  Credit Limited lent to her irresponsibly. She says that she 
wasnt in a position to borrow money and Provident  wouldve  seen this if it had made better 
checks.
background
This complaint is about seven home credit loans Provident provided to Miss R over two 
periods. These were from June to September 2011 and August 2016 to February  2017.

I should note that Provident has been unable to supply  any information about  loan numbers  
4 to 7. I have taken  the above information from the pass  book Miss R has supplied. Whist 
this isnt ideal I think I have enough to decide  the case  in any event.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. She thought that Provident shouldve  made  
better checks at times. But she didnt  have enough  information to say what  it wouldve seen 
had it made  these checks so she wasnt able to uphold the complaint on this basis.  Miss R 
disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. She said that: 
her income wasnt great  and she often didnt have enough to make  the loan 
repayments easily
Provident hasnt  been able to show that it made the proper checks  to see if she could 
repay the loans
Provident recorded incorrect information  about  Miss R, the correct  information  
wouldve shown that she couldnt  afford the loan repayments. 
Provident went a long time without collecting payments which caused her problems
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been  passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending and high cost credit - including all of the relevant rules,  
guidance and good industry  practice  - on our website. 
Ref: DRN27204022Provident needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Provident should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
In 2011 Miss R took three loans relatively  close to together. But due to the length  of time 
they were due to be repaid the loan repayments were relatively modest. 
Ive seen a record  of the information Miss R provided when  she completed her loan 
applications in 2011. Miss R said she had a monthly income of around  £300 and she had 
regular monthly outgoings  of around £150. This left her with a disposable income  of about 
£150. So the loans wouldve seemed affordable to Provident. 
The situation  is less clear in 2016 as Provident hasnt been able to provide the information it 
obtained before approving this lending. Again  the first three loan amounts  were modest. But 
the fourth  loan was larger. And Miss R seems to have used the proceeds from this to repay 
loans 5 and 6.
This does,  perhaps, point to her having  longer term problems managing her money. And 
I can accept, as our adjudicator did, that Provident probably shouldve  done more before  it 
approved the later loans in both groups of lending.  But while Miss R has indicated  that she 
was in financial difficulty she also hasnt  been  able to fully say, or provide evidence to show,  
what these problems were. So even if I were to find that Provident shouldve  made  better 
checks I wouldnt be able to say, with any degree of certainty, what these checks wouldve 
shown. So I cant uphold  Miss Rs complaint  on this basis. 
Whilst the loan pattern  is concerning. It doesnt  indicate that Miss R was having significant 
problems managing her money. And it isnt enough  on its own to say that Provident shouldnt  
have lent. 
Ref: DRN27204023And it follows that without  further information I cant say that Provident  recorded incorrect 
information about Miss R. This is because I dont know  what the correct situation shouldve  
been. So I also cant uphold Miss Rs complaint on this basis. 
And having looked at the account statements provided by both parties I cant see any 
significant breaks in the repayment  histories. Even  if I these breaks  were  apparent  I dont 
think I could reasonably say that these were due to the actions of Provident alone. 
So overall, in these circumstances, I dont think Providents decision to lend for all of these 
loans was unreasonable and Im not upholding Miss Rs complaint about them. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Miss Rs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 March 2020.
