The complaint
Miss L complains that National Westminster Bank plc blocked her current account.
What happened
Miss L banked with NatWest, where she had a current account and a loan.
In October 2020, someone paid £2,000 into Miss Ls loan account. A few days later, 
NatWest received a report that this payment may have been fraudulent. NatWest therefore 
froze Miss Ls current account while it investigated things.
Miss L says she discovered this had happened after she was told by a retailer that a 
payment had been declined. She then accessed her internet banking, and saw her current 
account had disappeared. She contacted NatWest to find out what had happened.
NatWest initially told Miss L to contact them by email  and after she did so, NatWest later 
sent her a text message asking her to phone them. Miss L says she found it difficult to get in 
touch with NatWest, being kept on hold and being cut off multiple times. NatWest emailed 
Miss L to ask her some questions about the £2,000, and, the following Monday, restored 
access to the account. The investigation continued until 16 October, at which point NatWest 
said it would take no further action. Dissatisfied, Miss L complained to NatWest and then 
complained to us.
To put things right, NatWest initially awarded Miss L £60.80. This included £50 for the 
trouble and upset NatWest had caused, and £10.80 for the time Miss L had spent on the 
phone. More recently, NatWest has offered Miss L a further £100 in full and final settlement 
of the complaint. Our investigator looked at this. She didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly 
in restricting the account. But she agreed NatWest could have handled things better  and 
thought that the £100 NatWest had offered was fair.
Miss L doesnt agree. She says the only reason NatWest lifted the restrictions was because 
she kept chasing them. She feels that the actions of NatWest fall far below the standard she 
should reasonably have been able to expect. She says she was kept out of the funds when 
she had a family staying, and so the block caused real inconvenience. She says she was 
treated like a criminal and kept out of her funds because on an error caused by NatWest, not 
her  and that the bank gave her no way of resolving this when she feels that a quick phone 
call could have cleared the matter up straight away.
As the matter wasnt resolved informally, the complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
Having reviewed all the information, I contacted NatWest and Miss L. I said that based on 
what Ive seen I wasnt satisfied it was fair to block Miss Ls account. But I still thought that 
£100 was fair compensation in the circumstances of this case.
NatWest says it notes my comments, says it had followed its process at the time but has 
taken on board our feedback. Miss L says she has no further comments provided that the 
feedback on the process is passed on to NatWest. Ive therefore reviewed the complaint 
afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Financial businesses, like NatWest, need to have procedures and processes in place to 
combat financial crime. This means that where NatWest receives a report that a transaction 
is potentially fraudulent, it will need to investigate this and may need to restrict accounts 
while this takes place.
In this case, a payment of £2,000 was made into a loan account in Miss Ls name. A few 
days later, NatWest received a report from a third party bank that the transaction may have 
been fraudulent. In the circumstances, I cant say it was unreasonable for NatWest to have 
needed to investigate what had happened. I appreciate that this decision would cause 
Miss L inconvenience while the investigation took place. But to award compensation, Id 
need to be able to say that NatWest was wrong to have done this. Given the information it 
had received, I cant say that NatWest was wrong to investigate Miss Ls accounts.
I question whether it was necessary for NatWest to block Miss Ls current account  the 
disputed funds were paid to a loan account, so in normal circumstances it would be difficult, 
if not impossible, for Miss L to get access to these funds. Ive asked NatWest about that. 
Theyve said that although it was unusual it might in some circumstances be possible for 
funds to be returned to a current account from a loan account. Nevertheless, the examples 
NatWest gave seem very unlikely given Miss Ls circumstances at the time. So while I 
acknowledge NatWests concerns, Im not satisfied its decision to block the current account 
was fair.
Ive therefore gone on to consider the impact all this had on Miss L. Where I award 
compensation for distress and inconvenience, this isnt to punish the business but to reflect 
the impact everything had on Miss L.
Ive first thought about what happened. Miss L discovered the block on 9 October, and 
contacted NatWest the same day. I note the difficulties Miss L says she had getting through 
to NatWests fraud team. I see that as NatWest didnt complete the review on the same day, 
this meant that the block continued over the weekend of 10 and 11 October. I also see that 
access to Miss Ls account was restored on 12 October. This meant Miss L didnt have 
access to her account for those days. NatWest then completed its review. It concluded no 
further actions were needed.
Based on what Ive seen, NatWest appears to have carried out its review quickly  in Miss 
Ls case NatWest was able to restore access to her account on the Monday, the next 
working day after she contacted it. So while I acknowledge the inconvenience of not having 
access to the account over the intervening weekend, I must also take into account that the 
interruption in Miss Ls service was relatively short.
I also recognise that NatWests service could have been better. In particular, Miss L found it 
difficult to get through to NatWest by phone, and NatWest failed to return calls. I can see that 
this added additional stress at what would already have been a difficult time. Id also have 
expected NatWest to explain that Mss L could access her salary or any government benefits. 
I acknowledge that Miss L feels that this was something that could have been resolved 
immediately if shed been able to talk to NatWest over the phone. I also note that Miss L 
feels that NatWest only completed the review as quickly as it did because she chased them.Thinking about all of this, I accept that Miss L experience some inconvenience because of 
NatWests actions. But the impact seems to have been limited. With all this in mind, I think 
the offer of £100 is fair.
Ive considered Miss Ls further points. Shes concerned that NatWests actions had an 
impact on her credit file. We asked her for a copy of a credit report, but she hasnt sent us 
this  and NatWest says it hasnt recorded any adverse information with credit reference 
agencies. So this doesnt change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons above I uphold Miss Ls complaint. National Westminster Bank plc should 
pay Miss L £100 for the trouble and upset it caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2022.
