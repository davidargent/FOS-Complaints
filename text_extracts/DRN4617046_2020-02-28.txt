Miss B says PDL Finance  Limited  trading as Mr Lender (PDL Finance) irresponsibly lent to 
her.
background
This complaint is about 8 loans which PDL Finance provided to Miss B between  June 2014 
and March 2018. Miss Bs borrowing history is as follows:

Miss B says the loans were unaffordable  because she says as soon as she paid off one 
loan, she borrowed again. She thinks PDL Finance  was irresponsible  to continue lending to 
her.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Bs complaint and thought loans  3, 7 and 8 shouldnt  
have been given. PDL Finance agreed  with our adjudicators view in respect  of loans  7 and 8 
and so it made an offer to settle the complaint which was in line with our approach. Miss B 
rejected the offer.  
PDL Finance  disagreed with our adjudicators  view in respect of loan 3 and the complaint 
was passed to me. None of the parties made any comments  about the rejected loans 
numbered 1,2, 4, 5 and 6. So I wont be looking at those loans again. In this decision, I will 
look at loan 3 and I will look at whether  PDL Finances offer is fair in respect of loans 7 and 
8. However, I will also look at the full loan history  to assess the case fairly.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
PDL Finance  needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN46170462But certain factors might  point to the fact that PDL Finance should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that PDL Finance was required to 
establish whether  Miss B could sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 3 would most likely  have shown  
that Miss B was not managing her money  well. I say this because  she took out loan 3 shortly 
after paying  off loan 2 and for a larger amount than loan 1. I think  a proportionate  check 
means PDL Finance would also have seen evidence  that Miss B had other short-term loans 
with other  companies.  I think it would  have realised Miss B was not engaged in short term 
lending to deal with an unexpected cash-flow.  It was more likely she had longer term 
financial problems which she wasnt managing well. So I dont think  PDL Finance should 
have given loan 3 to Miss B. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 3 and PDL Finance should put things right.  
I have also looked  at loans 7 and 8 where  PDL Finance has already made an offer. As its 
offer is in line with our approach, I think it is a fair way to settle  the complaint about those 
loans. 
For the sake of completeness and clarity,  I will refer to loans 3, 7 and 8 in the redress  
paragraph below.
Ref: DRN46170463putting things right  what PDL Finance Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 3, 7 and 8;
pay 8% simple interest a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative payment information about loans 3 and 7 from Miss Bs credit 
file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 means  any information  recorded about it is 
adverse. So all entries about  loan 8 should  be removed from Miss Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires PDL Finance Limited to take off tax from this interest. 
PDL Finance  Limited must  give Miss B a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if 
she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Bs complaint.  PDL Finance 
Limited should put things right for Miss B as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 March 2020.
