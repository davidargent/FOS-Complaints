Mr P complains that his payday loans were mis-sold to him by Elevate Credit  International 
Limited  trading as Sunny.

Using the information from Sunny the adjudicator created a summary  of the approved  loans 
which I have duplicated here.

Following Mr Ps complaint, Sunny sent to him its final response letter  in which  it made an 
offer to refund the first loan. It said that it was satisfied that there  were  factors  in place  which 
should have prevented [Loan 1] being  granted. Those factors are not given. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and having confirmed that the offer for 
Loan 1 still stood, she explained that she was not going to review Loan 1. Our adjudicator 
also thought that Sunny  should put things right for Mr P in relation to Loans 6 to 13.  
Sunny agreed  in part and made  a different  offer  that it put things right in relation to 
Loans 11 to 13, which  are all the loans sold to a third party several  years  ago. Sunny has 
informed us that it was recalling those loans.
Mr P did not accept that offer and so as both parties  do not agree with each of the 
resolutions put forward - one by our adjudicator and one by Sunny  the complaint has been  
passed to me for a decision.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what I consider  to be 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general 
approach to complaints about  short-term  lending - including  all the relevant rules,  guidance  
and good industry  practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN40609042Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr P 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include: 
where a customers income  is particularly  low; where the repayments are particularly high;  
and/or where  the frequency of the loans and the length of time over which  a customer  has 
been given loans need to be looked  at: repeated refinancing could signal that the borrowing 
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being the 
ability to repay without undue difficulties. In particular the customer  should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments,  and without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all arguments,  evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
Lona 1 has been conceded by Sunny and so there is no dispute in relation to that. For 
completeness I incorporate it into the redress  section below. 
Mr P appears to have  accepted the adjudicators  view and from that it seems that Mr P is 
content with the non-upholds for Loans 2 to 5 and so I have not reviewed those. 
I have also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history  with Mr P, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which it should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, and Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think that this point was reached by Loan  6. I say 
this because:
Loan 6 was the sixth in as many  months;
Loan 6 was approved on the same  day that Mr P repaid Loans  3 and 4 and Loan 5 
remained outstanding;
Ref: DRN40609043the loans approved  after that overlapped and so by the end of that year,  he had 
several outstanding  all at once;
there is evidence to suggest  that loans approved were used to repay  other loans 
from Sunny which is an indication of unsustainable borrowing;
Mr P took Loans 11, 12 and 13 within 10 days of each other.
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr P was having to borrow further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loans were leaving in his finances and that Mr Ps 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
I think that Mr P lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from Loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period;
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Ps ability  to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these  
high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about  Loans 6 to 13 and Sunny should put things right.
As I said earlier in this decision, I am incorporating Loan 1 within  the paragraphs for the 
redress below. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
I understand that the loans sold to a third party have been  recalled  and so Sunny should be 
able to achieve the following redress paragraphs.  
refund  all interest and charges paid on Loan  1 and Loans 6 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year* on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove unpaid fees and charges for the recalled loans, apply payments Mr P has 
made towards those  loans as if they were  to repay  the principal sums, and Sunny is 
entitled to set-off  any redress due to Mr P against the principal sums Mr P owes  to 
Sunny. 
remove any negative payment information about Loan 1 from Mr Ps credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  Loans 6 to 13 should be removed from 
Mr Ps credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr P 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. Any set-off needs to be 
done after tax. 
my final decision
Ref: DRN40609044For the reasons  given  above, I am upholding Mr Ps complaint in part.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should do as I have  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 February  2020..
