The complaint
Mrs L complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that shes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Shes being represented in her complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint last month in which I described what had 
happened as follows:
Mrs L and her husband entered into an agreement to buy a holiday product in June 
2010. The total amount to be paid to the holiday company was £10,112, they paid 
£500 using a credit card and Mrs L entered into a credit card agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance and she used £9,612 of that credit to pay the remaining 
amount to the holiday company. The credit was on buy now - pay later terms so the 
£9,612 wasnt applied to Mrs Ls account until six months later. Mrs L repaid the 
credit in February 2011.
Mrs Ls representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in July 2016 under 
section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the membership had been 
misrepresented to Mrs L and her husband and that the holiday company didnt 
conduct a proper assessment of Mrs Ls financial position and ability to repay the 
loan (but it should have referred to the credit), applied considerable pressure to 
procure her agreement to the loan and breached EU law.
Barclays Partner Finance said that Mrs Ls claims were time-barred under the 
Limitation Act1980 so it had no obligation to investigate the points that had been 
raised. Mrs L wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this 
service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ls complaint should be upheld. She 
thought that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of the 
misrepresentation claim to turn it down. She said that she hadnt seen enough to 
suggest that the relationship between Mrs L and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair 
and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the 
relationship was unfair. She also said that she wasnt satisfied that Mrs L had brought 
her complaint about unaffordable lending in time.
Mrs Ls representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It says that it had also complained to Barclays Partner Finance 
that it had utilised the services of an unauthorised broker so the credit agreement 
was unenforceable. It has also raised its serious concerns about the way in which the 
finance was sold to Mrs L.
I said in my provisional decision: I consider that Mrs Ls complaint about Barclays Partner 
Finance should be upheld for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and 
our rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that 
(unless the business consents) we cant normally deal with a complaint if its 
referred to us more than six years after the event complained of; or (if later) more 
than three years from the date on which the complainant became aware (or ought 
reasonably to have become aware) that they had cause for complaint;
Mrs Ls representatives letter included a claim under section 140A that the 
holiday company didnt conduct a proper assessment of Mrs Ls financial position 
and ability to repay the loan but our investigator considered the complaint about 
the affordability of the credit as a separate complaint outside of section 140A  
and she said that she wasnt satisfied that Mrs L had brought her complaint about 
unaffordable lending in time;
Barclays Partner Finance says that Mrs Ls complaint falls outside of the 
Limitation Act and it believes that it has handled the complaint correctly and that 
its out of time  and it hasnt consented to this service considering this complaint;
Mrs L entered into the credit card agreement in June 2010 and her complaint that 
the holiday company didnt conduct a proper assessment of her financial position 
and ability to repay the credit wasnt made to Barclays Partner Finance until July 
2016, more than six years later;
Mrs L would have had three years from when she became aware, or ought 
reasonably to have become aware, that she had cause for complaint to make a 
complaint about unaffordable lending;
for me to be able to conclude that Mrs L was aware, or ought reasonably to have 
been aware, that she had cause for complaint, Id have to find that she was 
aware, or ought reasonably to have been aware, that: there was a problem with 
the credit because it was unaffordable for her; the credit provided by Barclays 
Partner Finance caused her to lose out; and Barclays Partner Finances actions 
(or its failure to act) may have caused her loss;
the credit provided to Mrs L in June 2010 was on buy now - pay later terms so 
the payment of £9,612 wasnt applied to her account until six months later  and 
the interest rate under the agreement was 19.8%;
Mrs L made two payments of £480.60 each to the account in January 2011 and 
then made a payment of £8,650.80 to repay the outstanding amount of the credit 
in February 2011  she paid no interest under the credit card agreement to 
Barclays Partner Finance; 
Mrs L says that she repaid the credit by taking out a loan to consolidate her debts 
and I consider that she ought reasonably to have been aware that the credit may 
not have been affordable for her and that it might have caused her to lose out at 
that time  but that doesnt mean that she should have been aware that it was 
Barclays Partner Finances actions (or failure to act) in June 2010 that might have 
been responsible, at least in part, for the situation in which she found himself with 
credit that was unaffordable for her;
Mrs L says that she didnt raise her concerns about the affordability of the credit 
at that time as she wasn't aware of her rights and I consider that its reasonable 
to conclude that Mrs L wouldnt have been aware that Barclays Partner Finance 
might have some responsibility for the situation in which she found herself until 
she took advice from her representative;
I consider it to be more likely than not that Mrs L did make her complaint within 
three years of becoming aware that she had cause for complaint so I dont agree 
that she brought her complaint about unaffordable lending too late and I find that this service does have jurisdiction to consider her complaint about the 
unaffordability of the credit that was provided to her;
I consider that Barclays Partner Finance should have carried out reasonable and 
proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mrs L was likely to have been able to 
repay the credit in a sustainable way and that: if it carried out those checks, it 
should only have provided the credit to her responsibly using the information it 
had gathered; or, if it didnt carry out such checks, that the required checks would 
have shown that she was likely to have been able to repay the credit in a 
sustainable way;
Barclays Partner Finance says that it no longer has access to the underwriting 
information for Mrs Ls account but it provided the account statement showing 
that the credit was settled in February 2011;
Mrs L says that her husband wasnt given credit and that the credit was 
unaffordable for her  her representative has provided a copy of Mrs Ls 2009/10 
P60, her bank statements for April, May and June 2010 and an income and 
expenditure form;
the P60 shows that in 2009/10 Mrs L received pay of £14,621.20, paid income 
tax of £1,628 and made national insurance contributions of £991.17;
her bank statements show that she was paid £1,297.70 in April 2010, £1,022.30 
in May 2010 and £1,117.69 in June 2010 and that her month-end balances were 
£202.66, £276.45 and £336.54;
the income and expenditure form shows that Mrs L had a net weekly income of 
£230;
the credit limit of the credit card agreement was £20,000, the amount of credit 
provided to Mrs L in June 2010 was £9,612 and the minimum monthly repayment 
under the agreement was 5% of the interest bearing balance outstanding on the 
account;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Barclays Partner Finance carried out 
reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mrs L was likely to have 
been able to repay the credit sustainably and, if it had carried out those checks, I 
consider it to be more likely than not that it would have identified that Mrs L 
couldnt afford a credit card agreement with a credit limit of £20,000 or the credit 
of £9,612 that was provided to her;
I consider that Mrs L has lost out as a result of Barclays Partner Finances 
decision to lend to her because she and her husband were able to buy a holiday 
product that they couldnt sustainably afford and Mrs L had the continuing 
obligation to repay the £9,612, together with interest, that she couldnt 
sustainably afford;
I consider that Mrs Ls complaint about unaffordable lending should be upheld 
and that Barclays Partner Finance should take the actions described below;
I consider that Mrs L was unlikely to have entered into the credit card agreement 
and that she and her husband wouldnt have bought the holiday product but for 
Barclays Partner Finances failings and that it would be fair and reasonable for 
Mrs L to be put back into the position in which she would have been had she not 
entered into the credit card agreement and they hadnt bought the holiday 
product;
I find that Barclays Partner Finance should:
refund the payments that Mrs L made to it under the credit card agreement and any annual membership fees paid by her or her husband 
under the purchase agreement and deduct from those payments the 
market value of any holidays that Mrs L and her husband took using the 
holiday product (the net repayments); and
pay interest on the net repayments at an annual rate of 8% simple from 
the date they were paid to the date this complaint is settled;
when responding to my provisional decision, I ask Mrs L, her representative and 
Barclays Partner Finance to provide their submissions on what they think the 
market value of any use that Mrs L and her husband have had from the holiday 
product should be, along with supporting evidence;
Mrs Ls representatives letter included a claim under section 140A and our 
investigator considered Mrs Ls misrepresentation claim under section 75;
I dont consider that Mrs L had made a claim to Barclays Partner Finance under 
section 75 about any misrepresentations that had been made to her and her 
husband by the holiday but section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim 
against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mrs L could have made a claim to the holiday company or 
Barclays Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her 
and her husband into buying the holiday product in June 2010 as that was the 
latest time that any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss 
would have been  incurred as that was when Mrs L also entered into the credit 
card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that her cause of action would have accrued at that time, so she would 
have had six years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the 
holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim 
wasnt made to Barclays Partner Finance until July 2016, more than six years 
later, so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance would have had a defence to 
any claim under section 75 and that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to 
have rejected any such claim;
Mrs Ls complaint was made about Barclays Partner Finances response to the 
claims that had been made to it under section 140A and her representative says 
that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs L and Barclays Partner 
Finance because the holiday product had been misrepresented to Mrs L and her 
husband, and the holiday company didnt conduct a proper assessment of 
Mrs Ls financial position and ability to repay the loan, applied considerable 
pressure to procure her agreement to the loan and breached EU law;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor 
to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines 
that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim 
under section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided an account statement which show that Mrs L repaid the credit in February 2011 and I consider that the credit card 
agreement ended at that time so she would have had six years from then to bring 
a section 140A claim against Barclays Partner Finance  Mrs Ls representatives 
claim letter to Barclays Partner Finance was sent in July 2016, less than six years 
after the credit card agreement ended so I dont consider that a court would 
conclude that Mrs Ls claim under section 140A was made too late;
but as I consider that Mrs Ls complaint about unaffordable lending should be 
upheld and that Barclays Partner Finance should take the actions described 
above, I dont consider that theres any need for me to make any finding as to 
whether there was an unfair relationship between Mrs L and Barclays Partner 
Finance in these circumstances; and
Mrs Ls representative says that Barclays Partner Finance utilised the services of 
an unauthorised broker so the credit card agreement was unenforceable but this 
services records show that the holiday company was covered under our 
consumer credit jurisdiction in June 2010  which it wouldnt have been had it not 
been granted  a consumer credit licence by the Office of Fair Trading  and, in 
the absence of any persuasive evidence to suggest otherwise, I dont consider 
that its unreasonable to conclude that its more likely that not that the holiday 
company held the requisite licence when Mrs L entered into the credit card 
agreement and that its more likely than not that the credit card agreement would 
be enforceable.
Subject to any further comments or evidence that I received from any of Mrs L, her 
representative and Barclays Partner Finance, my provisional decision was that I intended to 
uphold this complaint. Both Mrs L and Barclays Partner Finance have accepted my 
provisional decision but Barclays Partner Finance says that for it to refund maintenance fees 
it will need evidence of them being paid. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both Mrs L and Barclays Partner Finance have accepted my provisional decision, I see 
no reason the change the findings that I set out in my provisional decision. In my provisional 
decision I asked Mrs L, her representative and Barclays Partner Finance to provide their 
submissions on what they think the market value of any use that Mrs L and her husband 
have had from the holiday product should be, along with supporting evidence. Ive not 
received any such evidence from Mrs L or her representative and Barclays Partner Finance 
says that for it to refund maintenance fees it will need evidence of them being paid. 
Mrs L has until 28 September 2023 to accept or reject my decision. If she accepts my 
decision but doesnt provide evidence about the annual membership fees paid by her or her 
husband under the purchase agreement and the market value of any holidays that theyve 
taken using the holiday product by that date, then I find that it would be fair and reasonable 
for Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mrs L the payments that she made to it under the 
credit card agreement.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to take the actions 
described in my provisional decision and as set out below.My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Ls complaint and I order Clydesdale Financial Services 
Limited, trading as Barclays Partner Finance, to:
1. Refund the payments that Mrs L made to it under the credit card agreement and any 
annual membership fees paid by her or her husband under the purchase agreement 
and deduct from those payments the market value of any holidays that Mrs L and her 
husband took using the holiday product (the net repayments).
2. Pay interest on the net repayments at an annual rate of 8% simple from the date that 
they were paid to the date that this complaint is settled.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Barclays Partner Finance to deduct tax from the interest 
payments to be made to Mrs L and Barclays Partner Finance must give her a certificate 
showing how much tax its deducted if she asks it for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2023.
