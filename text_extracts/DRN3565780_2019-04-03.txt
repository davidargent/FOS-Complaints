K820x#14complaint
Miss B complains  that Stagemount  Limited (trading as QuidMarket) mis-sold her unsuitable  
loans
Miss B wants QuidMarket to write off the outstanding loan or refund the interest that she has 
paid.
background
Miss B took out two instalment loans with QuidMarket. The first loan in August 2015 was for 
£200 with monthly  repayments of £90. The second  loan was for £300 taken in November 
2015. Miss B was due to repay the second  loan by six monthly instalments of around £88.
Miss B doesnt think that QuidMarket carried out adequate affordability assessments. 
The adjudicator didnt recommend that Miss Bs complaint be upheld.  He thought 
QuidMarket was entitled to rely on the information  Miss B gave  about  her income and 
outgoings for both loans.  Based on what QuidMarket knew about Miss B it looked  as though 
she could afford loans one and two. 
Miss B doesnt agree with the adjudicators recommendation. Miss B says that her second  
loan remains outstanding indicating that she couldnt  afford  it.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
QuidMarket was required to lend responsibly and carry  out checks before agreeing to lend to 
make sure that Miss B was able to repay each loan. These checks  had to be proportionate  
to things such as the amount of the loan, the repayments and any lending  history. But there 
wasnt a set list of checks  QuidMarket had to do.
QuidMarket recorded  Miss Bs monthly income  to be around  £1,400  for loan one and over 
£1,620 for loan two. It was early on in QuidMarkets lending relationship with Miss B and it 
expected her to repay the equivalent of less than 9% of her declared monthly net income 
each month. I think it wouldve been  reasonable to agree both loans based on knowing   
Miss Bs income alone.
QuidMarket went further than this and asked  Miss B about her income,  rent other expenses 
and regular credit  commitments  before agreeing both loans. From what Miss B told 
QuidMarket, she was left with a monthly  disposable  income of more  than £700 for loan one 
and £970 for loan two.
QuidMarket says that it carried out credit checks that showed a small amount of outstanding 
credit before loan one and none  before loan two.
Im satisfied that QuidMarket carried out adequate affordability checks. Based on the 
information that it held about Miss B, I cant say that QuidMarket  was wrong to agree either 
loan.
Ref: DRN35657802I appreciate that Miss B is still repaying  loan two but I dont  think this means that 
QuidMarkets checks werent proportionate  at the time. 
As I dont uphold Miss Bs complaint, I cant tell QuidMarket to write off any outstanding 
balance or refund interest.  I appreciate that my decision is likely to disappoint Miss B.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 May 2019.
