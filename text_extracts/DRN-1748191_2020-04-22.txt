The complaint
 Mr L complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) was 
irresponsible to lend him money.
What happened
Mr L took out 16 Sunny loans between March 2015 and October 2016, with a gap in lending 
between April 2015 when he paid loan 2 and January 2016 when Mr L took out loan 3.

Mr L mainly says that Sunny gave him too many loans at high cost that weren't affordable for 
him.  Our adjudicator recommended that Mr Ls complaint should be upheld in part. In summary, 
he thought that it was reasonable of Sunny to agree loans 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 but that Sunny 
shouldnt have agreed loan 4 or loans 8 to 16. Our adjudicator set out the steps he thought 
Sunny should take to put things right for Mr L.
Sunny didnt agree with everything our adjudicator said  its view was that it hadnt been 
wrong to offer loan 4 to Mr L as it had calculated this loan amount shouldve been 
comfortably affordable for Mr L. And Sunny disagreed with our adjudicator about loans 8 and 
9 and didn't feel these were unfairly lent. But Sunny said it was now willing to uphold Mr Ls 
complaint about loan 10 onwards and take the necessary steps to put things right.
Our adjudicator passed on Sunnys offer to Mr L  but Mr L didn't think this went far enough 
to deal with his complaint. 
The complaint came to me to decide. I issued a provisional decision. 
What I said in my provisional decision
Here are some of the main things I said. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L could repay 
the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
Sunny has told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr L. It asked Mr L to provide 
details of his income and to tell Sunny what he normally spent each month. And Sunny also 
carried out checks on Mr Ls credit file. 
I agree with the adjudicator that it wasnt unreasonable of Sunny to provide loans 1 and 2 
based on the information it held about Mr L. And as Mr L hasnt raised any objection to the 
adjudicators recommendation in relation to these loans I dont think that I need to say more 
about them. 
Mr L didnt ask Sunny for any more loans during the period April 2015  January 2016. That 
gap in lending seems long enough to me for Sunny reasonably to think that Mr L mightve 
put his finances in order during this period. This meant that when his borrowing started 
again, and Mr L applied for loan 3, he was effectively starting over. So it was fair for Sunny 
to treat this as a new chain of borrowing and assess his lending requests accordingly. And 
as it looks like Mr L was happy to accept what our adjudicator said about not upholding loan 
3 (which I think is fair) then I dont plan to say more about this loan.
But looking at what our adjudicator originally said in his view letter about loan 4, Ive taken a 
different view (although I think its fair to say that our adjudicator later changed his mind 
about this loan  although I dont know how or if that information was communicated to 
Mr L).
Looking at loan 4, I think the amounts that Mr L needed to repay wouldve seemed relatively 
affordable compared with the take home pay hed declared. Even taking into account that he 
was still paying for loan 3 when he took out loan 4, thinking about the combined repayment 
amounts, what was apparent about Mr Ls circumstances and his borrowing history at that 
time with Sunny, its my view that it wouldnt have been proportionate for Sunny to ask Mr L 
for the amount of information that would be needed to show the lending was unsustainable 
before agreeing this loan. So Im not planning on upholding Mr Ls complaint about loan 4. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold loans 5 -7 and as far as I can see, Mr L hasnt said he 
disagrees with this outcome. So I dont intend to say more about them beyond reassuring 
Mr L that Ive looked into these loans to see what I think and I agree with our adjudicator.
Like our adjudicator, Ive looked at the overall pattern of Mr Ls lending with Sunny to see if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny shouldve realised that it wasnt 
reasonable to lend more money to Mr L. 
Our adjudicator thought this point was reached by the time Mr L took out loan 8  but Ive 
come to a different view. Loan 5 was for a relatively small amount (just £50) compared to the 
amounts Mr L had been borrowing from Sunny. And it was repaid the next day  so I dont 
think its reasonable to include loan 5 when thinking about Mr Ls overall lending pattern.Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that Sunny should reasonably have 
seen that further lending was unsustainable or otherwise harmful by loan 9. I say this 
because: 
by the time he took out loan 9 in July 2016 Mr L had been repeatedly borrowing from 
Sunny for a period of around six months. Hed been more or less continuously 
indebted to Sunny during this period as there hadnt been any significant break in the 
chain of lending from loan 3 onwards. So Sunny shouldve seen that it was likely Mr L 
had to borrow again to cover the hole left by repaying each earlier loan. This 
suggests that Mr L couldnt sustainably afford to repay what he had borrowed without 
borrowing again.
 
Mr L took out some loans whilst he was still paying for previous borrowing and he 
mostly repaid the loans early. For example, loan 5 was taken out less than a week 
after hed paid loan 4, and before hed paid loan 3. Although loan 5 was just £50 and 
he repaid this loan the next day, Mr L then took out a much bigger amount when he 
borrowed loan 6 just two days later  and he was still paying for loan 3.
 
He took out loan 7 whilst he was still paying loans 3 and 6. And although Mr L paid 
loan 7 a couple of days later, he borrowed twice as much again just three months or 
so later when he started loan 8. This all suggests to me that Mr L was having 
problems managing his money in a well planned way.  
 
Sunny didnt necessarily do something wrong by agreeing a loan for Mr L while one 
was still running. But I think this ought to have raised concerns for the lender when it 
continued to happen.
 
Looking at this pattern of lending overall, I think Sunny shouldve realised by loan 9 
that there wasnt any indication that Mr Ls finances had moved on from whatever 
situation had required his previous loans. It was unlikely he was borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in income  rather, it looked like he had an ongoing need for the 
money. And although the loan amounts went up and down, overall he wasnt making 
any inroads into the amount he owed the lender  loan 9 was the biggest single 
amount hed borrowed from Sunny. 
 
I appreciate that Mr L often repaid his loans earlier than the agreed term. But 
successfully repaying his loans doesnt mean he managed to do so in a sustainable 
way. Borrowing and repaying this number of loans early makes me think that Mr Ls 
finances were likely unpredictable and unstable. 
 
Ive carefully considered everything Sunny has said. But for the reasons Ive explained, I 
think Sunny shouldve seen that Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing unsustainably by the 
time he took out loan 9  and it shouldve realised then that it was unfair to continue to 
lending to him. 
I think that Mr L lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 9 
onwards. This is because:these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short term use over an extended period of time. 
 
this number of loans from Sunny, was likely to have negative implications on his 
ability to access mainstream credit. This potentially kept Mr L in the market for these 
high-cost loans. 
 
As Sunny has already reviewed its position and offered to uphold Mr Ls complaint from loan 
10 onwards, I dont think I need say anything further.
What the parties said in response to my provisional decision 
Neither Mr L nor Sunny sent me any further comments. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Having done so, and as no further comments have been received in response to my 
provisional decision that change what I think about this case, I still think its fair to uphold this 
complaint for the reasons I explained in my provisional decision. 
Putting things right  what Sunny should do
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr L towards interest, fees and charges 
on loans 9  16 (inclusive), not including anything already refunded.
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr L which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr L originally made the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled.
C. Pay Mr L the total of A plus B.
D. The overall pattern of Mr Ls borrowing from loan 9 onwards means any information 
recorded about loans 9  16 is adverse, so Sunny should remove all entries about these 
loans from Mr Ls credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ls complaint about loans 9 -16 and direct Elevate Credit International Limited 
(trading as Sunny) to take the steps I've set out above to put things right. 
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 May 2020.
