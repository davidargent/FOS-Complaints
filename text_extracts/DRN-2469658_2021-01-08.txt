The complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA didnt help him with an item he bought
that wasnt as described.
What happened
Mr P says he bought a software product online, but it wasnt as described and so asked
PayPal to assist him. He says PayPal ruled in favour of the seller despite the software not
doing what it said it would. Mr P would like a refund of the product of just over Â£21 and says
the product was not as described. He says he has made a successful chargeback claim and
has received his money back.
PayPal says it ruled the product was not significantly not as described which is the test it
applies and says its up to it to make such decisions under its buyer protection scheme.
Mr P brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld the complaint. The investigator
thought PayPal could have done more to help Mr P and thought the product was not as
described. The investigator forwarded information from Mr P that provided evidence the
software didnt do what it was meant to do and thought PayPal could have assisted with the
dispute.
PayPal doesnt accept that view and says its user agreement says a final decision is its and
Mr P could have appealed its decision and provided it with the information it has now given
to the investigator.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and said as follows.I came to the provisional 
view that PayPal was entitled to reach a decision on a dispute in line with the user 
agreement.
I was satisfied that Mr P would have agreed to the user agreement when he opened his
PayPal account. That agreement says PayPal makes a final decision on a complaint or
dispute and that it doesnt provide a product warranty. The agreement goes on to say that it
will not allow double recovery and may close down a claim if a chargeback is made.
I appreciated that Mr P says the product was significantly not as described but I said it was 
very difficult for me to decide that based on the evidence I had seen. And I thought it up to 
PayPal to make a decision on that point in line with the user agreement. I also thought Mr P 
could have provided the evidence he had given us to PayPal and if necessary, used its 
appeal process.
In any event I said I could see that Mr P made a successful chargeback claim and so I didnt 
think PayPal would have allowed a double payment in line with the user agreement. So, I 
thought that even if PayPal had taken matters forward the outcome would have been the 
same that the claim would have been rejected as a double payment.
Overall my provisional view was that PayPal is entitled to make a final decision on these 
sorts of disputes and in any event, I thought it unlikely Mr P could receive a refund under 
both the chargeback scheme and under PayPals protection scheme. I accepted PayPal 
could have been clearer in its reasons for rejecting Mr Ps claim, but I didnt think that 
justifies compensation.
Mr P has replied to my provisional view and in summary says he did give PayPal all of the 
information he gave us and that he didnt make the chargeback claim until after PayPal 
rejected his claim. He says he didnt want a double payment and wasnt told of PayPals right 
of appeal.
PayPal hasnt added anything to what it has already told us.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I accept that Mr P didnt want to make a double claim and I also accept that 
on balance he would have provided PayPal with the information he gave us. I have looked 
carefully at the information both sides have given us, and I cant see that Mr P was told 
about PayPals appeal process. I made clear in my provisional view that I thought PayPal 
could have been clearer in its rejection reasons. But I dont think that compensation is 
justified here, and Im satisfied that Mr P would have needed to have provided the 
information to PayPal in any event and that PayPal was entitled to reasonably conclude that 
the product was delivered. And that the product worked to a degree. In those circumstances 
I think PayPal was reasonably entitled to conclude that its test of significantly not as 
described was not met.
I have made clear that even if I thought that test was met that I could no longer order PayPal 
to pay compensation for the product as Mr P has now received a refund via the chargeback 
process. So, I come to the same overall view that I reached in my provisional view but for 
slightly different reasons.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 February 2021.
