The complaint
Mrs M says Hamsard 3225 Limited trading as CLC Finance (CLC) lent to her irresponsibly. 
She says that she was encouraged to take more loans and she was struggled to afford the 
repayments to these, alongside the other lending she had. She wasnt offered any 
reasonable alternatives. Mrs M also says she has suffered significant financial hardship due 
the lending. 
What happened
This complaint is about 29 home collected loans CLC provided to Mrs M between July 2011 
and March 2020. Some of the information I have been provided about the loans is in the

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He didnt think CLC was wrong to have 
approved loans 1 to 3. However, he thought it should have made better checks before 
approving loans 4 and 5. He thought that if CLC had done this it would have seen that Mrs M 
was having problems managing her money. And from loan 6 onwards he thought the pattern 
of lending itself showed that to continue to approve loans would be harmful for Mrs M. 
CLC disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. Ive read in total what CLC has said, and a 
breif summary of this is below:
The checks that CLC did at the time were reasonable, and these showed that 
Mrs M could afford the loan repayments. 
She had a good relationship with the agent and wouldve informed them if she was 
having problems managing her money. 
Repeat lending is a factor that is considered as part of the creditworthiness 
assessments for each loan.
CLC referred to a recent court case. It said the reasoning given in this court case is 
applicable here and showed that Mrs M would likely have gone elswhere if CLC 
hadnt lent to her. So no (or reduced) compensation should be paid as Mrs M would 
have incurrred lending costs anyway. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, 
to issue a decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
CLC needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs M could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that CLC should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Mrs Ms complaint in part Ive explained why below.
This Service has responded to CLC on some of the issues raised in response to this 
complaint in detail through other final decisions it has received, and the published decisions 
on our website. So, Im not going deal with these points at length here.
I will say that I consider it reasonable to describe this lending as high cost credit, as does the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  who is the current regulator. The FCA includes home 
collected credit within its identified high cost credit cohort. And while I note it has a longer 
term than, for example, a payday loan, that does not make it a low risk, or inexpensive, 
option for a consumer. And, as such, long-term use of these products can be harmful to a 
consumer. The FCA has not said anything to the contrary on this point. I have considered 
these issues alongside everything else in making my decision.
Loans 1 to 3
Mrs M didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion not to uphold loans 1 to 3. Because of 
this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. And, for the 
avoidance of doubt, given the evidence I have, I dont disagree with what the adjudicator 
said about this lending. But these loans were part of the borrowing relationship Mrs M had 
with CLC. So, they are something I will take into account when considering the other loans 
she took. 
Loans 4 and 5
Loan 4 was Mrs Ms fourth loan in a relatively short period of time. And Mrs M hadnt repaid 
loans 2 and 3 when she took it. So, her indebtedness was increasing. And loan 4 was a 
longer-term arrangement with a term of 44 weeks. So, Mrs M would be making repayments 
for not far short of year going forward. 
I think CLC couldve realised at that time that Mrs M may have some longer term financial 
problems rather than just using the loans to help with a shorter term cash flow problem. CLC 
shouldve also become concerned about whether it knew enough about Mrs Ms true 
financial situation.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate check for loans 4 and 5 would most likely have 
shown that Mrs M was having problems managing her money. I think a proportionate check 
wouldve been to fully review Mrs Ms financial circumstances and verify these where 
possible. I dont think CLC did this. It seems to have relied on what Mrs M told it, in the main. The information I have been provided indicates that she was already borrowing and repaying 
loans from two other home credit providers when she was taking loans from CLC. This 
supports my view that this lending wasnt sustainable, and Mrs M was likely borrowing to 
repay other lenders, or using the loans for her day to day expenditure. 
CLC would have seen this if it had made proportionate checks and had it done so I dont 
think that it wouldve lent to Mrs M. So, Im upholding her complaint about loans 4 and 5. 
CLC disagrees and it says that the checks it made were proportionate. Its provided 
application data for most of the lending which it says shows this.  
But there isnt a great deal of detail in this. I think its fair to say it doesnt really get to the 
bottom of Mrs Ms financial circumstances or why she was taking these loans. It shows that 
she was on benefits for the early part of the lending and then she was in receipt of her 
pension for the later loans. So, her income would be restricted. This may limit her ability to 
repay the loans sustainably.
But most importantly, as Ive outlined above, the regulators guidance is clear in that the 
longer a lending relationship exists the more a business should do to find out why. CLC 
hasnt done this. As far as I can see it has followed the same sales process throughout. I 
dont think this is right. 
Loans 6 to 29
 
Notwithstanding my concerns about the sales process itself, Ive looked at the overall pattern 
of CLCs lending history with Mrs M, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which CLC 
should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. 
And so CLC should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Ms case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
Mrs M had been indebted to CLC for nearly seven months. The loans were intended 
to run around this length of time, so CLC could have expected this would be the 
case. But because these loans overlapped, her overall indebtedness,  and weekly 
repayments, had increased over this period. 
Rather than a picture of decreasing indebtedness, which would happen when a loan 
is taken and repaid, there was a pattern of repeated and increasing borrowing. I think 
taking out six longer term high cost loans, over this period, is a strong indicator that 
Mrs M was starting to struggle financially.
Loan 6 was for the highest amount Mrs M had borrowed, and it was more than twice 
the amount of loan 1. At this point CLC ought to have known that Mrs M was not 
likely borrowing to meet a shorter-term shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing 
need.
Right from the start Mrs M was provided with a new loan within a short time of 
settling an earlier one, or when she hadnt repaid her existing loan. So, there wasnt 
an appreciable time when Mrs M wasnt in debt to CLC. And its notable that by loan 
6, Mrs M hadnt repaid loans, 4 and 5. And her weekly repayment had increased from 
£5 at the start to over £22. 
So, because of the above factors, CLC ought to have realised it was more likely than 
not that Mrs Ms indebtedness was now unsustainable at loan 6.  
And going forward Mrs M didnt make any real inroads to the amount she owed CLC. 
Loan 29 was taken over nine years after Mrs Ms first. So, the harmful pattern I think was established from loan 6 continued. Mrs M had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to CLC over a very long time.
I think that Mrs M lost out because CLC continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ms indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the length of time over which Mrs M borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mrs Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 4 to 29 and CLC should put things right.
 
Putting things right
In its submissions to us, CLC has talked about the 2020 High Court judgement in the case of 
Kerrigan vs Elevate Credit International Limited. CLC drew on the Courts findings to 
question assumptions about what might have happened had it declined the lending in 
question, and so Mrs M had had to apply to a third-party lender. It essentially said that she 
would have incurred lending costs in any event and so no compensation should be paid to 
her.
In deciding what redress CLC should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Mrs M from loan 4, as Im satisfied it ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs M may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Mrs M in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mrs M would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce CLCs liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
CLC shouldnt have given Mrs M loans 4 to 29.
If CLC has sold the outstanding debts CLC should buy these back if it is able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If CLC is not able to buy the debts back then CLC should liaise 
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.A) CLC should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs M towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything 
it has already refunded.
B) CLC should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs M 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs M originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) CLC should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mrs M as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mrs M having made 
overpayments then CLC should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. CLC should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B 
and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans If this results in a surplus then 
the surplus should be paid to Mrs M. However, if there is still an outstanding balance then 
CLC should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mrs M. CLC shouldnt pursue 
outstanding balances made up of principal CLC has already written-off.
E) CLC should remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs Ms credit file in relation to 
loans 4 and 5. The overall pattern of Mrs Ms borrowing for loans 6 to 29 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from 
Mrs Ms credit file. CLC does not have to remove loan 29 from Mrs Ms credit file until this 
has been repaid, but CLC should still remove any adverse information recorded about this 
loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CLC to deduct tax from this interest. CLC should give 
Mrs M a certificate showing how much tax CLC has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Hamsard 3225 Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 August 2021.
