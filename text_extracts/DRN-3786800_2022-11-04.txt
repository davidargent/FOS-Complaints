The complaint
Miss G says NewDay Ltd irresponsibly lent to her.
What happened
Miss Gs complaint is about a credit card provided by NewDay. The account was opened in 
May 2020 with an initial credit limit of £1000. There were no further credit limit increases.
Miss G complained that NewDay lent irresponsibly.
I issued a provisional decision upholding the complaint. I explained that NewDay had to take 
reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly and that it needed to carry out 
reasonable and proportionate checks to make sure that Miss G could afford to repay what 
was being lent in a sustainable manner.
I said that when Miss G had applied for the credit card, she declared gross annual income of 
£18,000 and unsecured debt of £4100. I found that because Miss Gs existing consumer 
credit commitments were high in proportion to Miss Gs income, and because NewDay 
hadnt obtained any information about Miss Gs monthly expenditure (including her 
consumer credit repayments), it hadnt carried out reasonable checks to ensure that the 
lending was affordable for Miss G.
I concluded that NewDay hadnt carried out reasonable and proportionate checks to make 
sure that Miss G could afford to repay what was being lent in a sustainable manner. I said 
NewDay should remove al interest and charges which had been applied to the account.
I invited both parties to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wished to raise.
Miss G responded and said she agreed with my provisional decision.
NewDay didnt respond to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I remain of the view that NewDay lent irresponsibly to Miss G.
Putting things right
NewDay Ltd should settle as follows:
Rework the account removing all interest and charges that have been applied
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Miss G along with 8% 
simple interest per annum calculated from the date of each overpayment to the date of 
settlement.*
NewDay should also remove all adverse information relating to the account from Miss Gs 
credit file 
If the rework results in an outstanding balance, NewDay should agree an affordable payment 
plan with Miss G. Once Miss G has cleared the balance, any adverse information should be 
removed from her credit file.
*HMRC requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. It must give Miss G a 
certificate showing how much tax has been deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. NewDay Ltd must settle the complaint as Ive 
set out above
.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 December 2022.
