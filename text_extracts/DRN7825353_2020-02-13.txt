K821x#15complaint
Mr B says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 22 loans Sunny provided to Mr B between  February 2015 and 
August 2016 to be repaid  in 6 monthly  instalments.  Mr Bs borrowing history is set out in a 
table at the end of this decision.
Mr B says that the initial loan amount was increased in subsequent months without re-
assessing his income  or outgoings  and the resulting loan repayments were  such  a burden  
that he struggled to meet  normal household commitments such as utility  bills, rent and food. 
Hes told us the effect of these loan repayments led him to seeking further loans to repay 
existing ones, creating  a spiral of debt which dramatically impacted his income.
Sunny did not uphold  Mr Bs complaint. It says it carried out eligibility, creditworthiness and 
affordability checks before making  a decision as to whether to provide a loan or decline it 
and it said the amounts  of the loans  were assessed as being affordable over the term of 
each loan. In its final response letter, it also said that its records showed that some of Mr Bs 
loans were repaid  early  and so this did not appear to be consistent with being  in financial 
difficulty at the time.
Our adjudicator didnt  think it was unfair  for Sunny to give Mr B loans 1-3. But she upheld 
Mr Bs complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards  shouldnt  have been given. 
Sunny disagreed but it said it considered it may have  been prudent  to have done things 
differently from when it granted loan 15, due to the increase in the amount Mr B applied  for, 
coupled with a lending relationship of over a year at that time. It said it should  have asked 
more questions of Mr B. It offered £885.75 to settle the complaint and to remove all entries  
from Mr Bs credit  file about loan 15 onwards.  Mr B did not respond  to this offer and as there 
has been no agreement  between the parties,  the complaint  has been passed to me to make  
a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN78253532the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Ive decided to uphold this complaint  
from loan 4 onwards.  I will explain why.
When Mr B took out the first three loans, it was early  in the lending relationship between the 
parties. Sunny told us it had carried out a credit check as well as an affordability  check.  On 
Sunnys own checks at that time,  the information  it gathered would likely have revealed that 
Mr B already  had some active short-term loan accounts. However, there is nothing I can see 
that might  have alerted Sunny to the fact that Mr B should not have taken out the first loan 
and on the next loans  2 and 3 it doesnt  appear that these would have revealed  other  short-
term lending for these loans. So, in my view the checks it did were proportionate  and didnt 
reveal that Mr B was now unable to manage his money.
I agree  with our adjudicator though that by the time Sunny lent Mr B loan 4, a proportionate 
check would  most likely have shown that Mr B had by now been borrowing for nearly 4 
months and the amount he was borrowing for each loan was £850.00.  Each time Mr B took 
out the next loan, the time between each had been  reducing until loan 4 was requested  on 
the day loan 3 was repaid. So, it looks to me that its likely  Mr B was using these  loans to fill a 
hole in his finances and would suggest he was having difficulties managing his money. Mr B 
also borrowed another £850.00 when  he took out loan 5 and within  12 days of repaying loan 
4. So, the amount Mr B was borrowing was not reducing and I think it should have been 
apparent to Sunny that Mr B was having problems managing his money. Although  Sunny 
has said Mr B had repaid  his previous  loans,  Mr B had taken out these 5 instalment loans 
within 5 months and there were hardly any gaps between lending. Loan  5 was £850.00, 
which was the same amount as the previous loans 1-4. It appears to me that Mr B was likely 
using these loans  as if they were  payday  loans rather than instalment loans.
Ref: DRN78253533Taking everything into account,  I'm not persuaded that Sunny acted responsibly when it 
provided loan 5 to Mr B and as a result, I think there was a significant risk in this case  that 
Mr B would be unable  to meet his repayments in a sustainable manner for loans 4 and 5. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr B was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. By the time Mr B had taken out loan 6 he had been  indebted to Sunny 
for nearly  7 months. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr B 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Bs first loan was for £850.00 and loan 6 was also for £850.00. So, the amount 
Mr B was borrowing  had not reduced. So, it doesnt seem likely  that Mr Bs need for 
cash was reducing which  also points to him having a longer term need  for funds. At 
this point Sunny ought to have known  that Mr B was not likely  borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr B was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one and on many  occasions,  he still had other loans outstanding. For 
example, when Mr B was provided  with loan 7, he still hadnt repaid loan 6 and when 
taking loan 8, Mr B still had loans  6 and 7 outstanding.  
Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 22 was 
taken out around 18 months after Mr Bs first. And although loan 22 was for a smaller 
amount of £250.00, this was his 22nd loan which hed taken  within one day of 
repaying loans  18,19 and 20 and whilst  he still had loan 21. Mr B had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Mr B lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr B borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Bs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 and 5 and loans 6 -22 and Sunny should 
put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 4  22;
Ref: DRN78253534pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Bs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about him is adverse. So, all entries about loans 6 -22 should be removed  from 
Mr Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr B a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Bs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 March  2020.
