 Miss A says she borrowed around £4,300 from Sunny, on top of other short-term loans. She 
says it took her a long time to repay them, due to the excessive interest rate, and she had to 
borrow from other short-term lenders to make ends meet each month.
Sunny says Miss A had breaks in her lending and was charged interest for fewer than 12 
months in total. It says it asked Miss A about her income and expenditure and checked her 
credit file, increasing the expenditure figure if necessary, based on what the credit check 
showed. It says all the loans were affordable and met its lending criteria.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld. She considered Sunny 
should have realised Miss A was having problems managing her money when she applied 
for loan 8, with three loans already outstanding. She added that the pattern of lending itself 
from loan 16 showed the loans were unsustainable. Our adjudicator recommended interest 
and charges should be refunded on loans 8 to 17 and that adverse information about loans 8 
to 15 should be removed from Miss As credit file. Our adjudicator said loans 16 and 17 
should be removed from her credit file entirely.
Sunny responded to say, in summary, that the repayments were, on average, a small 
proportion of Miss As income. But it acknowledged that she applied for loan 13 soon after 
repaying loan 12 and the repayments were increasing at that point. It offered to uphold the 
complaint from loan 13 onwards.
Miss A did not accept the offer. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss A could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss A could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to 
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss As complaint.
Loans 1 to 3
Im satisfied Sunny carried out enough checks for these loans and I cant see there is 
anything in the available information that should have indicated the loans were unaffordable 
to Miss A. The largest monthly repayment was under £90 during this period and I can see 
Sunny had calculated her disposable income to be over £900. There was nothing in the 
credit check carried out by Sunny that showed Miss A was struggling financially, so I cant 
conclude Sunny was wrong to have approved loans 1 to 3.
Loans 4 to 7
There was a gap in lending between loans 3 and 4 so again Im satisfied Sunny carried out 
enough checks for these early loans in the chain. Although some of the loans were 
overlapping, the largest total monthly repayment was £112 and I cant conclude Sunny was 
wrong to have found these loans to be affordable.
Loans 8 to 15
When Miss A applied for loan 8 she already had three Sunny loans outstanding. I consider 
this was an indication she was struggling to manage her money and I dont think Sunnys 
checks went far enough at this point. As a result, I dont find it was responsible for Sunny to 
have approved loans 8 to 15. I say that because:
With one exception, Miss A consistently had three Sunny loans outstanding each 
time she applied for a new one;
Her total repayments were increasing throughout the period and, by loan 15, she was 
having to repay a significant amount of her monthly income;
Had Sunny carried out better checks, it would have seen Miss A was also borrowing 
from at least three other short-term lenders during this period.
 
So Im upholding Miss As complaint about loans 8 to 15.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss A, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. Given the particular circumstances of Miss As case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 16. I say this because:
By loan 16, Miss A had been borrowing from Sunny for almost six months;
At this point Miss A was showing a consistent pattern of borrowing within days of 
settling a previous one. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not 
Miss A was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances and that Miss As indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
Miss A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 17 was 
taken out more than six months after loan 4 (the first in the chain) but her total 
borrowing was significantly higher. Miss A had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Miss A lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 16 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss As indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time;
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Miss As 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
 
So Im also upholding the complaint about loans 16 and 17 and Sunny should put things 
right. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss As complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading 
as Sunny) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Miss A paid on loans 8 to 17;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative information about loans 8 to 15 from Miss As credit file.
The number of loans taken from loan 16 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 16 and 17 should be removed from 
Miss As credit file.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss A a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 June 2020.
