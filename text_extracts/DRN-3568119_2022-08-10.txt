The complaint
Mrs L complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk 
accepted a loan application in her name from an unknown third party and pursued her for the 
outstanding amount. Mrs L says MoneyBoat has now defaulted her and threatened her with 
court action. 
What happened
In 2019 MoneyBoat accepted a loan application in Mrs Ls name for £1,487. Mrs L says the 
first time she became aware of the loan was in May 2020 when she received a letter of 
default from MoneyBoat. Mrs L says she made a complaint to MoneyBoat but she never 
received a response. 
Mrs L said she then received a letter to appear in court in October 2020 but she told this 
service that when she rang the court about the hearing she was told it had been struck off 
because the court fee hadnt been paid by MoneyBoat. 
Our investigator thought the complaint should be upheld as MoneyBoat hadnt responded to 
this services request for further information. He said that MoneyBoat should clear the 
outstanding balance of the loan, remove the adverse information and default in relation to 
the loan from Mrs Ls credit file and cease any further attempts at recovering the outstanding 
amount from her. He added that MoneyBoat should pay Mrs L £200 in compensation. 
MoneyBoat hasnt responded to our investigators view and the deadline for responses has 
now passed. So, the complaint has been passed to me.
I told MoneyBoat that as it hadnt responded to the complaint or to this service I was minded 
to uphold it for similar reasons to the investigator except I was minded to increase the 
compensation to £300 for the distress and inconvenience Mrs L had suffered. 
MoneyBoat didnt respond. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im going to uphold this complaint. 
When considering complaints such as this, our service would expect MoneyBoat to show 
evidence that it carried out proportionate checks to make sure it was satisfied it was Mrs L 
that took out the loan. Then when a complaint is received about a potential fraudulent 
transaction, this service would expect MoneyBoat to respond to the complaint and carry out 
an investigation into the alleged fraudulent application. 
MoneyBoat hasnt responded to Mrs Ls complaint nor this services request for information 
into the application and whether its satisfied it was Mrs L that took out the loan. 
Mrs L has provided copies of her bank statements that show a loan from MoneyBoat wasnt 
paid into the current account, mortgage or credit cards held on her credit file around the time 
the loan was accepted. 
So, Im satisfied the money wasnt paid into her accounts. 
MoneyBoat hasnt provided any evidence to show it was Mrs L that took out the loan and 
hasnt responded to either Mrs Ls complaint or this service. In the absence of any evidence 
from MoneyBoat, Im not satisfied its either fair or reasonable to hold Mrs L liable for the 
loan. 
Putting things right
MoneyBoat should write off the loan and stop asking Mrs L for repayment. It should also 
remove any record of the loan and the default from Mrs Ls credit file.
MoneyBoat should also pay Mrs L £300 compensation for any trouble and upset caused
by the impact this has had on her. Mrs L has had a default and court summons as a
result of this issue. So, in the absence of any further evidence showing that she is
responsible for the loan, I can understand why she has found this issue distressing.
My final decision
I uphold Mrs Ls complaint and direct Evergreen Finance London Limited trading as 
MoneyBoat.co.uk to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 September 2022.
