The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt close his loan account 
after the debt was sold.
What happened
Mr M had a loan with NatWest. In November 2019, it was sold to a debt collection agency
(DCA). Mr M received letters and statements from NatWest in March 2020 and September
2020 stating he had a debt with NatWest.
Mr M complained. He said the debt was sold to the DCA in November 2019  and yet was
still getting letters from NatWest showing a debt and arrears with them. This continued even
after the debt with the DCA was repaid in May 2020. He found this confusing and
distressing.
NatWest replied in April 2020 and October 2020. They said the loan debt remained open in
their books and therefore they had to send notices to Mr M under their regulatory
requirements under the Consumer Credit Act (CCA). But - he should ignore them. They
confirmed to Mr M that he didnt owe NatWest any money. And that the DCA was the legal
owner of the debt. In their letter dated April 2020, they agreed that this was inconvenient and
paid Mr M compensation of £75.
Mr M brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said that NatWest had told him
that Mr Ms loan hadnt been closed because it was one of many that had been sold to DCAs
and there was a backlog of work to close them down. But because the loan remained open
in their books, NatWest were correct in sending Mr M CCA letters. NatWest had apologised
and paid compensation of £75, so he felt that was a fair outcome.
Mr M asked that his complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman. 
I reached a provisional decision, where I said:
I take a different view to our investigator.
Mr Ms debt had been legally assigned to a DCA in November 2019. The letter he received
from NatWest said On 27 November 2019 your account was assigned to (DCA) who are
now the legal owners of the debt and will now manage your account. their contact details
are So, Mr M would reasonably have expected to deal with the DCA, and not NatWest.
And he was making payments to the DCA  and indeed, paid the debt off with the DCA in
May 2020. But in March 2020, and again in September 2020, Mr M got letters from NatWest
saying that he owed them money  and that he was in arrears. Ive seen these and they say
You may have to pay default sums and interest in relation to the missedpayments in this
notice. you are required to pay any interest on arrears mentioned in this notice The
March 2020 letter quotes arrears of £1927.79. The September 2020 letter quotes arrears
of £2356.22. The September 2020 letter also enclosed the FCA Arrears information sheet
saying Dont Ignore the problemdoing nothing could make things worse
Mr M was making his payments to the DCA, so to get these letters must have been
confusing and distressing. When he called NatWest  they didnt call him back as theyd said
they would.
To be fair to NatWest, they apologised for the confusion and paid compensation of £75.
They did say that he didnt owe them any money. But, they just said that Mr Ms account
remained open  they didnt say when it would be closed, or why it hadnt been closed. And
because it was still open, they had to send him arrears letters  which they said to ignore.
So, I can see that Mr M must have felt left in the dark.
NatWest told us that there was a backlog of work which was delaying the closure of Mr Ms
loan with them. But, Mr Ms loan account was still open almost a year after the debt was sold
to a DCA. Given that Mr M had complained to them, it would have been sensible to close his
account  even if an exception was needed to do this.
So, on balance I think NatWest couldve done more here to help Mr M and settle his
complaint. So, I think NatWest should pay an additional amount of compensation of £75 to
Mr M in recognition of this. This is in addition to the £75 theyve already paid.
Mr M has referred also to NatWests obligations under GDPR  this is beyond the scope of
this service. Mr M has approached the ICO about that.
Mr M accepted my findings, and so did NatWest.
So  I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both Mr M and NatWest accepted my findings, I wont be departing from what I said in my 
provisional decision for the reasons I gave in it. So, my final decision is that NatWest should 
do what Ive already suggested.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay 
to Mr M compensation of £75. This is in addition to the £75 already paid.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 April 2021.
