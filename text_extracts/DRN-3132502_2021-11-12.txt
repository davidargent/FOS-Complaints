The complaint
Mr S complains about how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA dealt with a dispute over an 
item he sold.
What happened
Mr S says he sold a telephone which was delivered and received by the buyer in November 
2020. He says he received the money in his PayPal account for just over £250. And had no 
further contact with the buyer. Mr S says he received a message from PayPal that the buyer 
had raised a dispute and PayPal later told him he had lost the dispute which meant he lost 
the money as well as a fee. He says he hasnt received the telephone back and is out of 
pocket in the amount of £263.50. Mr S would like the money refunded or his telephone 
returned.
PayPal says the buyer raised a chargeback via his credit card account provider. It says it 
told Mr S that and asked him for further information to defend the chargeback which it did. 
PayPal says the credit card provider found in the sellers favour and so it had no choice but 
to refund the buyer under the chargeback rules. It says its seller protection doesnt cover 
unsuccessful chargebacks.
Mr S brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
explained the chargeback scheme and explained the credit card issuer found in the buyers 
favour and that decision was not PayPals. The investigator didnt think Mr S was covered by 
any seller protection as per the user agreement.
Mr S doesnt accept that view and says PayPal should have asked for the telephone to be 
returned and says his contract is with PayPal not the credit card issuer.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr S will be disappointed by my decision and I also appreciate his frustration that 
he has lost the money and the telephone. But that doesnt mean PayPal is at fault for what 
took place for the reasons I will explain.
The investigator has explained the chargeback rules and that they are set, not by PayPal, 
but by the credit card providers. And that any dispute is resolved by those credit card 
providers and not as in this case by PayPal. I make that clear as Im satisfied that PayPal did 
dispute the chargeback raised by the buyer of the telephone, but the card provider found in 
the buyers favour. In those circumstances Im satisfied that PayPal had no choice in the 
matter but to refund the buyer the cost of the telephone.
I appreciate Mr S will conclude that is unfair and says that his contract was with PayPal and 
not the card provider. I dont think that matters as I have made clear that PayPal must follow 
the chargeback rules and follow any decision made by the card providers. Im also satisfied 
that PayPal makes that clear in its user agreement which Mr S would have agreed to when 
the account was first opened. That agreement also makes clear that a seller would be not 
covered by its protection policy in the event of a successful chargeback which is what took 
place here.
Im satisfied that its not for PayPal to insist the telephone be returned to Mr S and it may be 
that Mr S will have to consider alternative action to have it returned to him or contact the 
credit card company in question.
Overall, Im satisfied the chargeback decision was not made by PayPal and it had no option 
but to follow its outcome.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 December 2021.
