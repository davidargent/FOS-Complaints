Two adjudicators have  looked at Mr S complaint. The most recent adjudicator  didnt think 
the complaint  should be upheld. Mr S disagreed and so the complaint  was passed to me to 
decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ive seen that for each of the loans, Sunny asked Mr S to provide some  information about his 
income and expenditure. For the first six loans, Mr S said his net monthly income was 
£1,300; this increased to £1,500 for loans 7 and 8. The total monthly expenditure figure 
Sunny used was as low as £400  (for loan 2) and a maximum of £782 (for loan 6). 
The contractual monthly payments for the loans ranged from £150 down to £15  although  
as some of the loans  overlapped,  the cumulative monthly repayments would sometimes be 
higher than £15. As Mr S appeared, on the basis of the income  and expenditure information  
Sunny obtained,  to be able to afford the monthly repayments, Sunny decided  he could afford 
each of the eight loans.
I think the steps Sunny took to assess the affordability of the loans was proportionate for 
most of the loans  it provided. Loans  1 to 6, although  taken out in close  succession, were  not 
all for clearly  increasing sums (the amounts Mr S borrowed  generally decreased  after loan 2) 
Ref: DRN74116972and I think it was broadly  reasonable for Sunny to assess the affordability of the loans while  
placing significant weight  on the information  provided by Mr S about his income  and 
expenditure. As this information suggested  the loans  were  affordable,  I dont think Sunny  
acted unfairly by providing loans 1 to 6.
For the last two loans,  I think Sunny ought to have taken a more sceptical view of the 
information provided by Mr S. Two of Mr S loans (2 and 6) were  taken  out and repaid either 
on the same  or next day and by loan 7, Mr S had taken out three loans  shortly  after settling 
the preceding  loan.  This suggests  Mr S wasnt likely to have  the sort of short-term financial 
problem these loans  are intended to bridge, but more likely  some other form of financial 
difficulty. The rapid take up of new borrowing  despite Mr S reporting significant disposable 
income each month  means it wasnt reasonable for Sunny to rely on what Mr S was 
reporting about his expenditure. I think instead  it ought to have asked him for some  form of 
proof of his expenditure, such as bills and/or bank statements.
Having said this, I havent seen any information  from Mr S about  his income/expenditure  
and so I cant say what  proportionate checks wouldve  likely  shown  for loans  7 and 8. As 
such, Im not able to say Mr S lost out because  of Sunnys decision to approve these loans 
and so I am not upholding  his complaint about them. 
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint against  Elevate Credit International Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 May 2020.
