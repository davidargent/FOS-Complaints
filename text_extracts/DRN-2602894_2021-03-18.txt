The complaint
Miss S complains that Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax (Halifax) lent to her 
irresponsibly.
What happened
Miss S opened a credit card with Halifax in April 2016 on an interest free deal. Her limits 
were as follows:
Date Limit
April 2016 £1000
June 2016 £1500
January 2017 £3500
October 2018 £2700
September 2019 £2650
The increases were proactively offered by Halifax. In September 2016, she missed a 
payment. The interest free agreement stopped. 
Miss S complained that Halifax shouldnt have increased her credit limits  she had just gone 
over her limit when the increase to £3,500 was made in January 2017. As a result, she now 
had a large debt to pay off. This was her first credit card.
Halifax said Miss S missed a payment in September 2016  so this meant the promotional 
offer of 0% interest was cancelled. At the time of the increase of limit to £3500, Halifax wrote 
to Miss S and said she could opt out of this if she wanted to  but she didnt. She met their 
lending criteria at the time. There had been a small number of late payments  but nothing 
that showed Miss S was in trouble. As a gesture of goodwill, they waived interest on the card 
account for three months from February 2020.
Miss M brought her complaint to this service. Our investigator looked at what had happened. 
He said Halifax had acted reasonably. Interest had become payable because of the missed 
payment. When Miss S first took the card, a limit of £1,000 was reasonable, as was the 
increase to £1,500. She was earning a salary of £18,000 a year and was living with her 
parents, so didnt have a mortgage or rent to pay. There were little or no other debts. When 
Halifax offered to increase her limit to £1,500 in June 2016, they wrote to Miss S and said 
she could opt out if she wished. Hed looked at the bigger increase to £3,500 in detail  as 
shed just missed a payment. Miss S passed Halifaxs credit score, and there was no 
adverse credit information showing on other debts. Hed seen Halifaxs analysis of her 
income and expenditure. Even though Miss Ss income later went down to £12,000 per 
annum, she still passed Halifaxs affordability criteria. Miss S was making more than the 
minimum payments each month, and there were no obvious problems with meeting 
payments on her other debts. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss S says that Halifax shouldnt have increased her limits. Her income had gone down, 
and she was struggling as a result. She now finds herself with a large debt to repay, which 
she says is unfair.
My role here is to decide whether Halifax did lend to Miss S irresponsibly. 
When Miss S missed a payment in September 2016, this meant that the interest-free deal 
ended. Its normal for lenders to do this. I can see that Halifax looked at Miss Ss income and 
expenditure when they offered to increase her limits  I looked especially at the large 
increase to £3,500 in January 2017. In May 2016, shed told Halifax she was earning 
£18,450 per annum  about £1,400 per month net of tax. Her housing costs were £270 per 
month, essential living costs £300 per month, and other debt repayments were £54 per 
month. So, the limit increase looked affordable. Halifax told us that Miss Ss annual income 
later dropped to £12,756 in May 2017  but even then, the debt looked affordable. 
Particularly as Miss S lived at home with her parents. Theyd looked at credit reference 
agency data  and this showed no problems of late payments or defaults with other lenders. 
So, on this basis, it looks like Halifax didnt do anything wrong.
Ive looked at Miss Ss credit card statements from when the card account was opened in 
2016 up to 2020. Looking at the time between 2016 and the limit increase to £3,500 in 
January 2017- apart from one late payment in September 2016 (which Miss S says was a 
mistake by her) - there werent any late payments or times when she went over her limit. And 
she always paid much more than the minimum amount each month. Miss S has showed us 
her credit report  and this shows there were few other debts at that time. I can also see 
from the statements that Miss Ss spending was mainly on retail goods (rather than 
household essentials)  so, in other words, if she found herself in difficulty, she could 
probably have stopped or reduced her outgoings. Halifax told us that when the increases in 
limits were offered  they included an opt-out in their letter. But Miss S didnt decline the 
offers. So, there were no obvious reasons why Halifax shouldnt have increased the limit to 
£3,500  as all looked ok.
I can see that things did get worse for Miss S later  after the increase in limit. In 2018, there 
were late payments occurring and she went over her limit. There was other borrowing taken 
with other lenders. But  Halifax could only be expected to make a decision on what they 
knew in December 2016/January 2017. 
I was sorry to learn that Miss S is now struggling to pay off her debt with Halifax, especially 
as this was her first credit card. It was good to see that Halifax gave her a three-month 
interest free period in 2020  which must have helped. I hope that things have become 
easier for her. But  and Im sure that this will be disappointing for Miss S, I dont think 
Halifax did anything wrong here, and I wont be asking them to do anymore.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 April 2021.
