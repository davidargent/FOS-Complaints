The complaint
Mr V complains that MotoNovo Fiannce Limited didnt collect his direct debit and reported 
missing payments on his credit file.  
What happened
In February 2017 Mr V was supplied with a car and entered into a hire purchase agreement 
with MotoNovo. The agreement was for a term of 5 years with monthly payments of £313.
Due to the pandemic, Mr V arranged a 3-month payment holiday, followed by a further 3-
month payment holiday. When the second payment holiday ended, Mr V agreed to re-start 
his payments. MotoNovo told Mr V it would re-start the direct debit. 
MotoNovo says that the direct debit failed, resulting in Mr Vs account going into arrears.
Mr V says that MotoNovo didnt tell him there was a problem with his direct debit. He only 
found about about the missed payments when he tried to obtain other credit in early 2021.
Mr V complained to MotoNovo. In response, MotoNovo said Mr Vs bank had rejected the 
direct debit instruction whe it tried to re-start it in September 2020. MotoNovo acknowledged 
that it hadnt contacted Mr v about this and offered £100 compensation. But it said it couldnt 
amend Mr Vs credit file because this correctly reflected the missed payments.
 Mr V wasnt happy with the response and complained to this service.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. She said MotoNovo couldve done more to make Mr 
V aware that there was an issue with his direct debit. She said MotoNovo should remove the 
adverse information from Mr Vs credit file and pay compensation for the directs and 
inconvenience caused.
MotoNovo didnt agree. It acknowledged that it shouldve made Mr V aware that his direct 
debit hadnt restarted but said it couldnt amend the credit file because there was no 
evidence that it had made an error in reporting the missed payments. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
MotoNovo has acknowledged that it didnt contact Mr V to make him aware that there was 
an issue with his direct debit. Nor can in see that MotoNovo tried to contact Mr V in the 
weeks ad months that followed to advise him that he had missed payments and/or that his 
account was in arrears.
Whilst the issue with the direct debit appears to have been the responsibility of Mr Vs bank, 
I think MotoNovo shouldve told Mr V about the issue as soon as it became aware of it. I also 
think MotoNovo shouldve contacted Mr v each time he missed a payment. If it had done so, 
Mr V wouldve been alerted sooner to the missed payments. Ive thought about MotoNovos 
point that Mr V is responsible for ensuring that his payments are made. Whist I dont 
disagree, I think that in the particular circumstances of this case, where MotoNovo told Mr V 
that it would arrange for his direct debit to re-start, Mr V was entitled to reply on that. 
Mr V has explained that the adverse information has caused him difficulties in obtaining 
credit. In circumstances where things have gone wrong, Id expect a business to take steps 
to put things right. In this case, Mr V wants his credit file amended. Ive thought about the 
points made by MotoNovo in relation to its obligation to report on how the agreement has 
been managed. Whilst I agree that Mr V didnt make payments, Im of the view that the 
reason he missed payments was because of a lack of communication and poor service from 
MotoNovo. If MotoNovo had made Mr V aware of the issues with the direct debit, I think its 
more likely than not that Mr V wouldve taken step to make payments some other way. I say 
this because when Mr V discovered the arrears, he took immediate steps to bring the 
account up to date. On balance, Im of the view that MotoNovo made an error by not 
advising Mr V that it was unable to collect his payments. Because MotoNovo made an error, 
I dont think it was fair to report the missed payments.  
Putting things right
To put things right, MotoNovo should remove any adverse information from Mr Vs credit file.
Mr V has explained the impact that the adverse information has had on him and his 
business. In dont doubt what he says, but Im only able to ask MotoNovo to compensate Mr 
V for direct financial losses caused by its error. There isnt enough evidence here to support 
that.
Nevertheless, I can see that Mr V has been caused distress and inconvenience as a result of 
the entries on his credit file, and I think ty fair to ask MotoNovo to pay compensation for this. 
I appreciate that 3100 has already been paid but I dont think this is enough to reflect the 
degree of distress and inconvenience caused, so Im asking MotoNovo to pay a further 
£100.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. MotoNovo Finance Limited must remove the 
adverse information from Mr Vs credit file and pay further compensation of £100.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2021.
