he was in a debt spiral and couldnt afford the loan repayments. He thinks Lending Stream

Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ls complaint and thought the loans from loan 6 to 33 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Lending Stream disagreed and so the complaint was passed to 
me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it 
didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate 
checks to make sure Mr L could repay his loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there 
may come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
Our adjudicator thought that by loan 6 it shouldve been clear to Lending Stream that Mr L 
was having problems managing his money. Mr L was taking loans and repaying them within 
a few days and then borrowing again. And this was the fifth time he had done this over a ten 
day period. Hed already borrowed and repaid £710 of lending before he took loan 6, and he 
took loan 7 very shortly afterwards. So, I dont think it was reasonable to assume he could 
repay this lending given what Lending Stream knew about his circumstances. 
Ive also considered the overall lending up to loan 8 and I think the lending history and 
pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that further lending would likely be 
unsustainable from this point onwards. Even at this early point it was clear that Mr Ls 
lending was increasing and there seems to be no indication that it would reduce in the near 
future.  So, I think Lending Stream was irresponsible to continue lending after this point.
Ive considered the points Lending Stream made in response to the adjudicators view. It 
said that it did make proper affordability checks, particularly over loans 29 to 33. And it said 
that these should override any problems shown in the pattern of lending. 
Our adjudicator did respond to these points. And they arent new  theyre factors already 
taken into account in the adjudicators assessment. And we have considered in detail why 
the lending pattern itself can become unsustainable in the decisions we have published on 
our website. Which Lending Stream should be aware of. 
And they dont demonstrate to me that the lending from loan 8 was sustainable. So the 
points raised by Lending Stream havent changed my decision and Im upholding this 
complaint.
Putting things right
Lending Stream shouldnt have given loans 6 to 33.
If Lending Stream has sold any outstanding debts Lending Stream should buy these back if 
Lending Stream is able to do so and then take the following steps. If Lending Stream is not 
able to buy the debts back then Lending Stream should liaise with the new debt owner to 
achieve the results outlined below.
A) Lending Stream should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr L towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything Lending Stream has already refunded.
B) Lending Stream should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Mr L which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr L originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Lending Stream should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any 
upheld outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr L as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr L having made overpayments then Lending Stream should refund these overpayments with 8% simple 
interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have 
arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Lending Stream should then refund the amounts 
calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any principal Lending 
Stream has already written-off. If this results in a surplus then the surplus should be paid to 
Mr L. However, if there is still an outstanding balance then Lending Stream should try to 
agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr L. Lending Stream shouldnt pursue outstanding 
balances made up of principal Lending Stream has already written-off.
E) Lending Stream should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ls credit file in 
relation to loans 6 and 7. The overall pattern of Mr Ls borrowing for loans 8 to 33 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so Lending Stream should remove these loans 
entirely from Mr Ls credit file. Lending Stream does not have to remove loan 33 from Mr Ls 
credit file until this has been repaid, but Lending Stream should still remove any adverse 
information recorded about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to deduct tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream should give Mr L a certificate showing how much tax Lending Stream has deducted, 
if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ls complaint. 
Gain Credit LLC should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 October 2020.
