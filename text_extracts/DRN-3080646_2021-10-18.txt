The complaint
 Mr B complains of irresponsible lending by NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua. He would like any 
further action on his debt to be stopped pending our investigation
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again here 
instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having done so I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons: -
I accept NewDay is a second chance lender whose accounts have been designed to 
help customers with lower credit ratings. But that take away the obligation to offer 
credit responsibly
There is some dispute as to whether NewDay was aware that Mr B had 17 payday 
loans when at the time of his application. From what I have seen I do believe that 
NewDay did have this information. 
However even if NewDay didnt have this information whats not in dispute is that Mr 
B declare income in relation to unsecured debt was very low. I think that should have 
indicated to NewDay that more investigation into Mr Bs financial situation would 
have been prudent. That might have clarified the payday loan issue. And having seen 
Mr Bs credit file it would also have shown that Mr B had made enquiries about 15 
other payday loans. I think that information would have shown that Mr B was 
struggling financially which was confirmed by the fact he fell behind with his 
repayments just two months after he opened his NewDay account.
I am not persuaded that NewDay acted responsibly in offering Mr B credit. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
In full and final settlement NewDay Ltd should:-
Refund all interest and charges applied to Mr Bs account. This amount should be 
used to reduce any outstanding balance on the account. In the event of any surplus 
this should be refunded with 8% simple interest to Mr B
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2021.
