The complaint
Mrs T, who was a sole trader, is unhappy with the service she received from National
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) surrounding an application she made for a business
account.
What happened
Mrs T applied for a business account with NatWest in September 2020. Mrs T believed that
shed applied for a Business Current Account (BCA) but subsequently learned that
NatWest were considering her application as being for a Loan Feeder Account (LFA)  a
restricted form of account designed solely to be used as an account from which to service a
Bounce Back Loan (BBL), and which didnt include the functionality of a standard BCA as
Mrs T needed.
Mrs T also learned that NatWest had placed the application on hold as they were waiting for
Mrs T to provide proof of her businesss turnover as shed declared it in the application. Mrs
T hadnt received any such request from NatWest and was advised by the agent with whom
she was speaking that her case handler would contact her to confirm what was required.
But NatWests case handler didnt contact Mrs T as shed been promised, and several
months passed without the application progressing. And, when Mrs T did contact NatWest
again in April 2021, she was told the application had been cancelled because the required
documents hadnt been received by NatWest. Mrs T wasnt happy about this, especially as
by this time the BBL scheme had ended, meaning that she wasnt able to subsequently
apply for a BBL for her business as shed intended. So, she raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mrs Ts complaint. They confirmed that the application had been for an
LFA, and that NatWest had cancelled the application after their request for further
information from Mrs T about her business hadnt been responded to. NatWest also
confirmed that although the BBL scheme had now ended, as an exception, theyd
considered whether Mrs Ts application for a LFA and subsequent BBL would have been
successful, and concluded that they wouldnt have been.
Finally, NatWest acknowledged that Mrs T hadnt received an acceptable standard of service
from them in regard to her not being kept informed as to the ongoing status of the
application. NatWest apologised to Mrs T for this and offered to pay £500 to her by way of
compensation for any trouble or upset she may have incurred. Mrs T wasnt satisfied with
NatWests response, so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they felt that the response that
NatWest had issued to Mrs Ts complaint, including the £500 compensation offer to Mrs T,
already represented a fair and reasonable resolution to what had happened.
Mrs T remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 2 September 2022 as follows:
It appears to me that theres considerable confusion over the type of account that 
Mrs T applied for on behalf of her business, including confusion over the following 
terms: Business Current Account, Loan Feeder Account, and Business Account. As 
such, Im going to begin by clarifying these terms:
A NatWest Business Current Account (BCA) is a current account opened in 
the name of a business and which includes the full functionality of a current 
account. This includes debit card and cheque book facilities.
A NatWest Loan Feeder Account (LFA) is a restricted version of a BCA 
which doesnt include any debit card or cheque book facilities and which is 
intended to be used solely as a vehicle for servicing a loan (in this instance, a 
Bounce Back Loan (BBL).
The term business account doesnt refer to a specific account, but instead 
refers to the category of accounts where the accounts contained within that 
category are all designed for business use. Importantly, both a BCA and an 
LFA are business accounts.
I feel its necessary to clarify the above because I note several instances of Mrs T 
providing evidence of her NatWest application being for a business account which 
Mrs T feels is proof that her application was for a BCA. This isnt the case, because 
as explained, the term business account is a categorial term which applies to both 
an LFA and a BCA equally.
One of the key aspects of Mrs Ts complaint is that in September 2020, she applied 
for a BCA with NatWest on behalf of her business.
I can appreciate how Mrs T might have believed that she had applied for a BCA. But 
having reviewed all the information and evidence available to me, Im satisfied that 
she did in fact apply for an LFA. The main reasons I reach this conclusion are as 
follows:
1. NatWest had placed a hold on new BCA applications from May 2020 which 
was still in place in September 2020 when Mrs T made the application. This 
means that Mrs T wouldnt have been able to apply for a BCA at that time.
2. The screenshots of NatWests internal systems provided to this service by 
NatWest confirm that the application was for an LFA, and not for a BCA.
3. Ive listened to a recording of a telephone call from November 2020, when 
Mrs T spoke with NatWest to chase the status of the application, and in this 
call NatWests agent clearly confirmed to Mrs T that BCA applications were 
on hold and that her application was for a LFA.
During the telephone call of November 2020 referenced above, NatWests agent also
explained to Mrs T that the LFA application was on hold because NatWest were 
waiting for her to provide further documents about her business as requested by NatWest. Mrs T advised that she hadnt received any such request, and because the 
agent that Mrs T was speaking with couldnt see what specific documents were 
needed, they advised Mrs T that they would arrange for the relevant case manager to 
contact Mrs T in the near future.
But the relevant NatWest case manager didnt contact Mrs T. Mrs T chased this 
matter with NatWest again, several months later, at which time she learned that her 
application had been cancelled a few months previously because the further 
documents that NatWest had requested hadnt been received.
NatWest dont dispute that they should have provided a better standard of service to 
Mrs T in regard to her being contacted as she was told she would be, and NatWest 
have apologised to Mrs T for this and made an offer of £500 compensation to her for 
any trouble or upset that she might have incurred.
Matters of compensation can be subjective, with an offer considered as being fair 
and reasonable by one party not being considered as being such by someone else. 
But the £500 that NatWest have offered Mrs T as compensation for this poor 
standard of service does feel fair to me, given the full circumstances of this 
complaint.
In arriving at this position Ive considered that this compensation amount is for the 
impact of the standard of service that Mrs T received from NatWest only, and isnt in 
consideration of any further aspects of Mrs Ts complaint, such as Mrs Ts application 
being processed incorrectly by NatWest  which, as explained above, Im satisfied 
wasnt the case. Ive also considered that Mrs T herself appears not to have chased 
the application with NatWest for several months, despite being informed by NatWest 
in November 2020 that the application was on hold as NatWest were waiting for her 
to provide further documents to them.
As such, while I accept that Mrs Ts was impacted by NatWest not contacting her 
about what was required to progress the application as NatWest had promised, I feel 
that this impact is mitigated by the factors detailed above such that the compensation 
amount of £500 is fair.
NatWest have confirmed to this service that the further information that they required 
from Mrs T included proof of her businesss turnover. This was because, in her 
application for an LFA, Mrs T had declared that her business had turnover of over 
£200,000 per annum. Mrs T also declared that she had been using her personal 
NatWest current account as her transactional account for her business. But when 
NatWest checked Mrs Ts personal current account, they couldnt see business 
income at the level that Mrs T had declared.
Ive reviewed the statements for Mrs Ts personal current account to check whether 
any evidence of business turnover can be ascertained from those statements. And 
having done so, Im satisfied that NatWests position in this regard is reasonable.
Furthermore, NatWest have confirmed that having received Mrs Ts complaint, they 
then reviewed the cancelled application on the basis of the information they had to 
see whether that application would have been successful. And, at least in part 
because of the lack of proof of business turnover running through Mrs Ts personal 
current account, NatWest confirmed that the LFA application would have been 
declined, even if it had been progressed rather than being cancelled. NatWest have 
also confirmed that had the application been made for a BCA, and not for an LFA  if such an application had been possible  then the BCA application would also have 
been declined for the same reasons.
All of which means that I find it difficult to conclude that NatWests actions have had 
the level of impact on Mrs Ts businesss ability to obtain a BBL as Mrs T contends 
here. This is because Im satisfied that Mrs T didnt apply for a BCA as she believed 
she had, and because even if Mrs T had been able to apply for a BCA, that 
application would have been reasonably declined by NatWest at least in part 
because the proof of business turnover that would have been required by NatWest to 
progress that application wasnt received by them.
Ultimately, in consideration of all the above, I dont feel that it can be reasonably 
stated that NatWest actions caused Mrs Ts business to miss out on the opportunity 
to obtain a BBL as Mrs T believes. Indeed, Mrs Ts own actions, including not 
providing evidence of business turnover, means I feel that Mrs T must bear some 
responsibility for how events transpired here. And it's for these reasons that I wont 
be instructing NatWest to provide Mrs T with a loan on the same terms as a BBL as 
Mrs T would like.
And while I acknowledge that Mrs T didnt receive the standard of service that she 
should reasonably have expected to receive from NatWest, especially in regard to 
her not being called back by NatWest about the paused application, I feel that there 
are mitigating factors in respect to this aspect of the complaint (as explained 
previously) such that Im satisfied that the offer of compensation that NatWest have 
already made to Mrs T in this regard already represents a fair and reasonable 
outcome to that aspect of this complaint.
I realise this might not be the outcome that Mrs T was wanting here, but it follows 
from all the above that I wont be instructing NatWest to take any further action here, 
beyond that to which theyve already agreed. However, in circumstances such as 
this, where a business has made an offer of compensation to a customer but where 
that offer hasnt yet been paid, Im obliged to uphold the complaint in the customers 
favour in order to formalise the compensation offer that the business has made.
As such, my provisional decision here will be that Im upholding this complaint in Mrs 
Ts favour, but only the basis that NatWest must make a payment of £500 to Mrs T, 
in line with the offer of compensation that NatWest have already made.
In response to my provisional decision, Mrs T sent several detailed submissions explained 
why she didnt agree with my provisional decision. Id like to thank Mrs T for making these 
submissions, and I can confirm that Ive read and considered them. However, I hope Mrs T 
wont consider it discourteous that I wont be responding to her submissions in similar detail 
here. Instead, Ill address what I consider to be the key points of Mrs Ts response, in line 
with this services role as an informal dispute resolution service. 
As such, if Mrs T notices that I havent responded to a specific point shes made in her 
replies to my provisional decision, it shouldnt be taken from this that I havent read and 
considered that point. Instead, it should be taken that I have read and considered that point, 
but that I dont feel it necessary to address that point directly here, in order to arrive at what I 
feel is a fair outcome.
Mrs T has explained that she feels that my provisional decision letter didnt address all of her 
complaint points. Ive reviewed the complaint points that Mrs T has reiterated, and I feel that 
the only one that may not have been covered in my provisional decision letter is Mrs Ts 
complaint that NatWest incorrectly advised her that she had to open a business account in 
order to apply for a bounce back loan. However, NatWest were entitled by the rules of the BBL scheme to stipulate that a NatWest 
business account  in this case, an LFA  must be in place to facilitate the BBL, and so I 
dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly towards Mrs T in this regard.
In regards to the other complaint points that Mrs T draws attention to, I feel that these have 
been addressed by my provisional decision directly, and so in regard to those I dont address 
further in the following paragraphs, I would refer Mrs T to my provisional decision in regard 
to my continuing position on those complaint points.
Mrs T has reiterated her assertion that she did apply for a BCA and didnt apply for an LFA in 
in September 2020. And Mrs T states that she has evidenced this point. However, I dont 
feel that Mrs T has evidenced this point as she believes, and while its clear that there has 
been considerable confusion surrounding this point, I havent seen anything in Mrs Ts 
submissions to this service which leads me away from the conclusion that Mrs T did in fact 
apply for a LFA in September 2020. And I reiterate again the three points detailed in my 
provisional decision letter above which I contribute towards my reaching this conclusion.
Ive also asked NatWest directly whether it was the case  as Mrs T contends  that Mrs T 
was incorrectly allowed to apply for a BCA, and whether that application was then amended 
into being an LFA application when it was realised that the hold that NatWest had placed on 
BCA applications meant that Mrs T should never have been allowed to apply for a BCA.
NatWest have confirmed that they have no evidence of this, and as explained previously, 
Ive also seen no evidence of this in any of the information or evidence presented to me. 
NatWest have also confirmed that an application cant be amended to a different product, 
and that as such if it were the case that Mrs T had applied for a BCA, that application would 
have had to have been cancelled and a new application for a LFA submitted. But that wasnt 
what happened here, and Im satisfied that this was because Mrs T did apply for a LFA in the 
first instance, although I accept that Mrs T may not have been fully aware of the nature of 
the business bank account that shed applied for.
Even if it were the case that Mrs T did apply for a BCA as she contends  which as 
explained above, Im satisfied wasnt the case  I wouldnt consider NatWest as having 
acted unfairly towards Mrs T by not allowing her to continue with that application, given that 
they werent accepting new applications of that type at that time.
But Mrs T had stated to NatWest that she wanted a BBL, and as explained it was a condition 
of NatWest that some form of NatWest business account be in place to facilitate any BBL 
applied for with them. So it seems to me that the actual outcome here, which is that Mrs T 
applied for an LFA  which she needed in order to enable any BBL application to be 
potentially successful  and not a BCA  which Mrs T couldnt apply for at that time as 
previously explained  is the only outcome that could have reasonably occurred.
Mrs T also feels that my statement that she didnt chase the matter with NatWest for several 
months is unfair, and notes that she continuously checked the status of her application in her 
online account, which stated that no further action was required of her.
I apologise if Mrs T was upset by the language I used in this regard. But I feel that the point I 
raised about her being told by NatWest during the telephone call in November 2020 that her 
application was on hold pending the receipt of further information from her remains valid, 
especially if this was in contradiction to the information displayed to her in her online 
account. And while it may have been the case that Mrs Ts online account displayed 
inaccurate information, I feel that the £500 offered to Mrs T by NatWest already provides 
sufficient compensation for this and the other failings which NatWest dont dispute did occur.Finally, Mrs T has explained that she feels that some of the issues shes experienced are as 
a result of NatWest failing to distinguish between applications for new business accounts 
she made in regards to her two separate companies. However, I havent seen any evidence 
that this was the case, and NatWest have also confirmed that no mix up of this sort occurred 
and that Mrs Ts application for a BCA with her other company  which was made at a later 
time and when NatWest were accepting new BCA applications  was successful. 
And while I note that Mrs T has explained that she was told by a NatWest agent in April 2021 
that they had cancelled an application of hers because theyd seen that shed taken out a 
BCA already  with her other company  all the information provided to me by NatWest 
confirms that Mrs Ts application for an LFA  the application under consideration here  was 
cancelled via an automated process after the application didnt move forwards for a period of 
90-days because required documents needed to progress the application werent received.
Ultimately, I continue to feel that the key point here is that a different outcome to that which 
actually occurred couldnt reasonably have taken place. This is not only because Mrs T 
couldnt apply for a BCA for the reasons already explained, but also because NatWest have 
confirmed that Mrs Ts BBL application wouldnt have been successful on the basis of the 
information that they had. 
One reason for this is that NatWest didnt have evidence of the business turnover that Mrs T 
had self-declared. And while I appreciate that Mrs T has stated that she had personal bank 
statements with another bank that confirmed her business turnover, it was a requirement of 
a BBL that proof of declared business turnover be provided. And while Mrs T may contend 
that she was never asked specifically by NatWest for those third-party bank statements, I 
feel that this was stipulated both in the application requirements of the BBL and also 
explained to Mrs T by NatWest during the aforementioned telephone call in November 2020.
All of which means that it remains my position that the response that NatWest have already 
issued to Mrs T regarding this complaint, including the offer of £500 compensation for the 
poor customer journey she experienced here, does already represent a fair and reasonable 
resolution to whats happened here. And I dont feel that NatWest should be instructed to 
make any further payments of compensation, or take any restorative or corrective action, in 
regard to any other aspects of Mrs Ts complaint.
I realise this wont be the outcome that Mrs T was wanting, but it follows from all that above 
that while my final decision here will be that I will be upholding this complaint in her favour, 
Ill only be doing so in order to formalise the £500 offer of compensation that NatWest have 
already made to her. I hope Mrs T will understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive 
made the final decision that I have.
Putting things right
NatWest must pay compensation totalling £500 to Mrs T
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc on 
the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 November 2022.
