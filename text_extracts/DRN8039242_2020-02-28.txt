K821x#15Complaint
Mrs L complains  about the way NewDay  Ltd closed down her credit card. 
Background
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision dated 24 December 2019. In my provisional decision I explained why I thought  
Mrs Ls complaint should be upheld and what NewDay should  do to put things right. I invited  
both parties to provide any additional  comments or information they wanted me to consider 
before I made my final decision.
NewDay responded to say it accepts my provisional decision. Mrs L responded to say that 
she was pleased that I agreed her complaint should be upheld  but felt the level of 
compensation was too low and didnt reflect the trouble  and upset caused by the situation. 
My findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs L has told us she feels the £50 awarded  is too low. I appreciate the situation went on for 
some time. But once Mrs L contacted NewDay after she received its letter in 
September 2018 the situation  was resolved in good time. NewDay didnt  report  any 
information about what happened  to the credit reference agencies and didnt charge Mrs L a 
late payment fee. 
Ive considered everything Mrs L has told us about how the issues  raised  impacted her. 
Having done so, I remain of the view that £50 is fair in all the circumstances. Im sorry to 
disappoint Mrs L but I havent been persuaded to increase  the award as set out in my 
provisional decision. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and direct  NewDay  Ltd to pay Mrs L £50. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 March  2020.

Complaint
Mrs L complains  about the way NewDay  Ltd closed  down her credit card.  
Background
Mrs L opened a credit card with NewDay  but decided  she wanted to close it a short  time later. Mrs L 
paid £3.38 online via debit card. She then called  NewDay  on 20 July 2018 to close her account. 
During the call, Mrs L said shed repaid  £3.38 which  the online system said was outstanding  and 
wanted to be sure that was all she needed  to pay. Mrs L said she thought  there was around £7 left to 
pay. The advisor  confirmed the payment of £3.38 was all Mrs L needed to pay and said her account  
would be closed down.  
On 6 September 2018 NewDay wrote to Mrs L as there was an outstanding balance of £4.24. The 
letter said a late payment  fee of £12 had been charged and that NewDay  had informed  the credit 
reference agencies  that Mrs L had missed a payment. 
Mrs L complained  and went on to refer the issue to our service. An adjudicator  looked  at what had 
happened and accepted that NewDay  could  have  handled the call on 20 July 2018 better but didnt 
uphold Mrs Ls complaint. Mrs L didnt  accept  so her complaint has been passed to me to make a 
decision. 
My provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Having  done so, Ive reached a different decision to the adjudicator. 
NewDay says a payment  of £4.24 was made on 19 July 2019, the day before Mrs L repaid the 
outstanding balance and tried to close her account. As a result, it wasnt showing on NewDays 
payment systems when Mrs L called  to close her account. NewDay also said that if Mrs L had been 
registered to look at her statements online  she would  have seen the transaction debit her account. 
Whilst both those points may be correct, I think the advisor missed  an opportunity to warn  Mrs L about 
payments that might not have been claimed by the merchant.  
During the call, Mrs L said shed paid £3.38 and wanted to check whether that was all she needed  to 
pay. The call handler confirmed that it was and that she would close the credit card down. Mrs L said 
she was expecting  the balance to be a bit higher (it turns  out the £4.24  payment hadnt yet been 
claimed). The call handler could have warned Mrs L about the risk of unclaimed payments  being 
claimed after the account  was closed.  She could  also have advised  Mrs L to check  her statements  to 
ensure the full balance was repaid. But no information about unclaimed transactions was provided. 
Given Mrs L said shed expected  the balance  to be slightly higher and that she wanted to check shed  
paid everything, I think thats something  NewDay  should have mentioned.  
I take NewDays  point that Mrs L could have registered to review online statements but I can 
understand why she didnt that step.  The credit card was only open for a short time and 
Mrs L had repaid everything NewDays systems and call handler said was outstanding. There  was no 
advice to check  the statements in the short term to ensure any unclaimed transactions  had gone 
through. Im not persuaded  that its reasonable  to have expected  
Mrs L to continue  to a monitor an account she was told had been closed. 
Had NewDay  told Mrs L to continue to check her account  Im satisfied she would have taken that step 
and paid back  the outstanding balance  much sooner. 
Ref: DRN80392423Im pleased NewDay chose not to inform the credit reference agencies  about the late payment and 
didnt charge  Mrs L. But I can see this situation was upsetting  for Mrs L. She told NewDay she was 
applying for a mortgage when  she called on 20 July 2018.  So I can understand why a concern over 
adverse credit would be particularly worrying. Mrs L has told us that she felt threatened by the tone of 
NewDays letters and thought its decision  to charge her and report  the late payment had already been 
made. I think the service provided  should have been better and Im satisfied the situation has caused 
Mrs L some trouble and upset. I think the fairest way to resolve this case is for NewDay to pay Mrs L 
£50, which fairly reflects the impact of the situation on her. 
My provisional decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to pay Mrs L £50. 
Mrs L and NewDay have until 24 January  2020 to send  me any additional  comments or information  
they would like me to consider before I make my final decision.
