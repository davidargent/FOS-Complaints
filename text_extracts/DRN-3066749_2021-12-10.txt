The complaint
Miss A says Morses Club PLC lent to her irresponsibly.
 
What happened
This complaint is about eight home collected loans Morses provided to Miss A between 
November 2019 and January 2021. Some of the information I have been provided about the 
lending is in the table below. 
loan date taken amount instalments date repaid
1 08/11/2019 £250 34 28/04/2020
2 22/01/2020 £300 34 13/07/2020
3 28/04/2020 £250 34 11/09/2020
4 01/05/2020 £100 34 05/09/2020
5 13/07/2020 £300 34 06/01/2021
6 15/09/2020 £400 34 outstanding
7 01/12/2020 £400 53 outstanding
8 06/01/2021 £300 34 outstanding
Morses has considered Miss As complaint. It thought that it hadnt lent irresponsibly for 
loans 1 to 3. But it said that it shouldnt have approved loans 4 to 8. It offered to calculate 
compensation in respect of these loans. This led to a proposed reduction in the amount 
Miss A owed for loans 6 to 8. Miss A didnt accept this offer. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. He didnt think that Morses had lent 
irresponsibly for loans 1 to 3. And he thought the offer Morses had already made in respect 
of loans 4 to 8 was reasonable. 
Miss A disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. She said Morses only asked for relevant 
information for loan 1. She thought it should have asked for more information before 
approving loans 2 and 3. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss A 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Loans 1 to 3
Ive seen a record of the information Miss A provided when she completed her applications 
for these loans. Miss As weekly income was recorded as being around £300 to £350. She 
had regular weekly outgoings of around £250. So, it wouldve been reasonable for Morses to 
think that the loans were affordable for Miss A
Miss A feels that Morses should have made more in-depth checks before lending. But given 
the amounts borrowed against her income, and that that it was early in the lending 
relationship, I dont think its reasonable to say Morses should have looked into her finances 
in more detail, or asked her to verify any details.  
I havent seen any further information that shows its likely Morses was made aware of any 
financial problems Miss A mightve been having. Or anything that wouldve prompted it to 
investigate her circumstances further. So, I think it was reasonable for Morses to rely on the 
information it obtained.
Overall, in these circumstances, I think the assessments Morses did for loans 1 to 3 were 
proportionate. So, I think Morses decisions to approve these loans was reasonable and Im 
not upholding Miss As complaint about them. 
Loans 4 to 8
Miss A didnt disagree with the offer Morses has made in respect of loans 4 to 8. And it is 
the same as I would award if I were to uphold the complaint. So, my decision is that this 
offer is a reasonable way to resolve this complaint. And I recommend that Miss A accepts it. 
It looks likely that after any compensation is calculated that Miss A will still need to repay 
some of the capital she borrowed. I would remind Morses of its responsibility to treat Miss A 
fairly in this regard. 
My final decisionFor the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Miss As complaint. 
If Miss A accepts my decision, Morses should recalculate the offer is has already made to 
Miss A (if it needs to) and implement it.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 January 2022.
