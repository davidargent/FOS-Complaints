An adjudicator considered  Ms Ms complaint  but didnt  recommend it be upheld. They thought  
Mr Lender had carried out proportionate checks before lending  to Ms M and that it hadnt acted 
irresponsibly by providing the loans. Ms M didnt  agree with this, so the complaint was passed to 
me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about  
short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding  Ms Ms case.  
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Ms M could  repay  
her loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such  as how much was being  
lent, the repayment amounts and Ms Ms income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early 
stages of a lending  relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
Before lending  to Ms M, Mr Lender  asked her to provide information about her income and 
expenditure. This included asking Ms M about her mortgage/rent, utility bills, travel  costs,  council 
tax and credit  commitments. 
The information  Ms M provided  about her income  and expenditure across her various 
applications suggested she had disposable income of approximately £760-£1,300 per month.
Whilst this seems like a large amount  of monthly disposable income for someone  applying for 
multiple high-cost loans, I dont think Mr Lender  acted unreasonably by relying on the information 
Ms M provided.  The information  wasnt  so unusual that Id have  expected to see Mr Lender  
asking Ms M for bank  statements or other proof of income and expenditure. This would  be 
disproportionate, particularly given the loan instalments were so much lower than Ms Ms 
declared disposable income,  even when  allowing for some margin for error  or exaggeration.
Overall, I think Mr Lender acted fairly by relying on the information Ms M provided. 
Ref: DRN33934582Mr Lender isnt to blame if that information  wasnt  accurate  it didnt (and wasnt required to) 
carry out a comprehensive  credit check and so wouldnt have  been aware if Ms Ms credit 
commitments were  higher than she stated. And whilst it appears  Mr Lender was aware Ms M had 
a mortgage, it doesnt appear it was aware of the arrangement to pay in place.  Even  if it had 
been aware of this, I dont think it wouldve been  irresponsible to lend. The arrangement to pay 
appears to have been maintained successfully  in the year before the first loan was approved  and 
throughout the rest of the period of lending.
Ive also considered the pattern of lending but I do not have any significant  concerns.  Although 
loans 1 to 3 were taken out successively, there was then a ten month gap in the lending   and I 
dont think three  loans of this type in a row is enough  to suggest Ms M wasnt repaying them  
sustainably. After the ten month  gap Mr Lender  approved another four loans in the space of 
about eight  months.  By the seventh  loan, its arguable a pattern was beginning to emerge which 
might suggest Ms M was struggling  to repay the loans  sustainably. But the amount Ms M 
borrowed for loan 7 decreased compared  to loans 5 and 6 and the instalments were less than 
10% of her declared disposable income. On balance, I dont think  that by loan 7 the pattern of 
lending had quite reached the point where  Mr Lender  ought to have  realised  it wasnt appropriate 
to continue to lend.
I understand that Ms M feels  the regulators rules on rollovers and affordability  checks  mean  that 
the loans  wouldnt now have been approved  but I dont agree. The rules Ms M refers to were in 
place at the time (FCA regulation began in April 2014 and the rollover cap was in place as of 
July 2014) and I do not think Mr Lenders  decision to approve the loans  went against the rules for 
responsible lending or rollovers.
I realise this will be disappointing for Ms M but I do not think Mr Lender acted irresponsibly  when 
it approved her loans  and so I do not uphold her complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold Ms Ms complaint  against PDL Finance Limited.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October  2019.
