The complaint
Mr G complains about the amount that he's been charged by PSA Finance UK Limited, 
trading as Peugeot Financial Services, for damage and excess mileage after he returned a 
car when his hire purchase agreement ended. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr G returned the car when his hire purchase agreement ended and the car was 
inspected and collected from him in August 2018 by a third party acting on behalf of 
Peugeot Financial Services;
the inspection report recorded that the car had been driven for 43,792 miles and 
identified damage to the car, including missed services, for which charges totalling 
£844.26 were recommended;
Peugeot Financial Services charged Mr G £844.26 for the damage (which it later 
reduced to £568) and £1,289.60 for the excess mileage;
Mr G had agreed in the hire purchase agreement to an annual mileage limit of 6,000 
miles and an excess mileage charge of 6p per mile (or 12p per mile if the total 
mileage exceeded the agreed mileage by 30%) - but he says that he was told by the 
dealer that he didn't need to worry about excess mileage;
I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that he was told that he 
didn't need to worry about the excess mileage - and his agreement was with Peugeot 
Financial Services so I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have 
confirmed any variation to the terms of the agreement with it or to have obtained 
written evidence of the variation; 
I'm not persuaded that it's likely that the dealer would have told Mr G that he didn't 
need to worry about the excess mileage or that he didn't need to have the car 
serviced;
nor am I persuaded that Peugeot Financial Services needs to provide Mr G with 
information about the sale price of the car after it was returned or that any fault with 
the car when it was returned means that the charges should be reduced;
Mr G says that he accepts some of the damage charges, Peugeot 
Financial Services has reduced the damage charges from £844.26 to £568 (which 
includes £400 for two missed services and £25 for a missing service book) - and I'm 
not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that it's unfair or unreasonable 
in these circumstances for it to charge him those amounts;Mr G has described the personal difficulties with which he's had to deal - and I 
sympathise with him for those difficulties - but the car was driven for 43,792 miles 
during the term of the agreement, I'm not persuaded that there's any evidence to 
show that it wasn't of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to him, he accepts that 
the car hadn't been serviced and that it was damaged when he returned it;
I'm not persuaded that the amounts that Mr G has been charged by Peugeot 
Financial Services are excessive (or that they're unfair or unreasonable); and
I find that it wouldn't be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Peugeot Financial Services to waive or reduce the amounts that it's charged Mr G.
 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I don't uphold Mr Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 June 2020.
