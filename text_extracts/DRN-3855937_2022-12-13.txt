The complaint
Mr S complains about delays by National Westminster Bank Plc when he applied for a 
mortgage. Interest rates increased during the delays. Mr S asks that NatWest applies the 
rate he chose when he applied, or compensates him for the higher rate hes paying to 
another lender. 
What happened
Mr S made an online mortgage application in October 2021. NatWest said it couldnt process 
the online application due to the nature of Mr Ss identification documents (ID). It said Mr S 
could meet with a mortgage adviser to make an application. Initially, Mr S declined to meet 
with a mortgage adviser. When he did, interest rates had gone up and the product hed 
wanted was no longer available. 
Our investigator said NatWest offered a reasonable option to progress Mr Ss mortgage 
application and it was Mr Ss choice not to go ahead with an appointment. NatWest offered 
Â£450 compensation. It said this was for poor service related to Mr Ss complaint and 
confusion caused about acceptable forms of ID. The investigator said this was fair.
Mr S didnt agree saying:
Several people at NatWest said his ID was acceptable. No-one contacted him to say it 
was a problem. He had to chase NatWest throughout.
Hed asked for call recordings from NatWest. This included a call on 28 October 2021 
when he was told his ID was acceptable.
He provided calculations of his losses, after taking out a new product with his existing 
lender. 
NatWest ended his complaint early and provided copies of text messages to support 
what he said. NatWest had written to Mr S with a link for the compensation and Mr S 
said he felt it was bullying him into accepting it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We asked NatWest for recordings of its calls with Mr S, in particular the calls on 15 October 
2021 and 28 October 2021 when Mr S says he was told his ID was acceptable. NatWest 
said it couldnt find any record of calls from Mr S on those days. It provided recordings of 
calls on 6 October 2021, 12 October 2021 and 15 November 2021, which I briefly 
summarise below. 
Mr S says there are other calls, and NatWest sent him a CD with recordings of five calls out 
of the 10 hed asked for. He expressed concern that call recordings could have been 
falsified. Im satisfied that I have enough evidence to reach a fair decision. I had no concerns 
while listening to the recordings that theyd been altered.
Mr S says he was also given incorrect information when he visited his branch. Unfortunately, 
neither Mr S nor NatWest can provide further evidence of this discussion. I should say that 
where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the 
balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in 
light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances. 
The call recordings
Mr S called NatWest on 6 October 2021. He said he was making a re-mortgage application 
online and had been asked to confirm his current mortgage would be repaid before the new 
mortgage was in place. He said he didnt know how to answer this question. NatWests call 
handler said they cant help with completing on-line applications but it could arrange an 
appointment for Mr S with an adviser. 
Mr S made an online mortgage application on 11 October 2021. He called NatWest on 12 
October 2021. He said hed applied for a re-mortgage online and had been asked to provide 
photo ID, such as a passport or driving licence, which he didnt have. NatWest said for an 
on-line application without advice the only ID it could accept was a passport or driving 
licence. NatWest said if Mr S had correspondence from HMRC with his name and address 
he should upload it as it could use it on occasion. The adviser offered to book an advised 
appointment. Mr S said hed try to progress the on-line application first. NatWest said if the 
ID he provided wasnt acceptable it would offer the option of an advised appointment. 
Mr S called NatWest again on 15 November 2021. He said hed made an application in 
October and expected to hear back within 14 days. He said hed loaded the requested 
documents. NatWest checked and said the application hadnt progressed because Mr S 
hadnt uploaded photo ID. Mr S said he didnt have photo ID and hed provided a letter from 
HMRC instead. Mr S said he expected NatWest to contact him if there were problems with 
this. NatWest said the system was waiting for ID documents, and Mr S hadnt noted on the 
application that hed been unable to load the required documents.
NatWest said it would arrange for the application to be passed to the underwriters with a 
note about the ID and it would be for the underwiters to decide whether to accept the ID 
provided. It said Mr S would retain the product rate hed applied for when he made the 
application. 
What happened after this?
Mr S says he wasnt contacted and had to chase NatWest. It contacted him at the end of 
December 2021 saying it needed him to provide a driving licence or passport to progress an 
online application. 
NatWest offered a meeting with a mortgage adviser. Mr S didnt accept this. This would have 
meant making a new application, with a new product recommended by the adviser. Mr S felt 
this was unfair as hed been told his identity documents were acceptable. He wanted 
NatWest to allow his application to proceed with the original product rate. He hoped this 
would be the outcome of his complaint.
NatWest didnt agree to Mr Ss application proceeding on the basis of the original product 
rate. Mr S met with NatWests mortgage adviser in mid-2022. He wasnt happy with the 
products offered and took out a new product with his existing lender. What should happen now?
Mr S asks that NatWest pays compensation based on his mortgage being on a higher 
interest rate than the product hed applied for in October 2021. And compensates him for 
being on his lenders standard variable rate until mid-2022. I dont think its fair and 
reasonable to require NatWest to do that. Ive explained why below.
NatWest is entitled to make decisions about its processes and lending criteria. This 
includes what identity documents are acceptable. The ID offered by Mr S wasnt 
acceptable to NatWest for an online mortgage application. 
Mr S was able to apply to NatWest for a mortgage with the ID he had available, but he 
needed to do this through an appointment with a mortgage adviser. NatWest offered 
Mr S an appointment on 6 October 2021 and 12 October 2021, as well as at the end of 
December 2021.
NatWest told Mr S that limited ID documents are acceptable for an online application. It 
didnt confirm it would accept the letter from HMRC. During the call on 12 October 2021 
it said it accepts it on occasion. Mr S wanted to continue with the on-line application. 
NatWest said if he did this and his ID wasnt accepted it would offer an advised 
appointment. I appreciate that Mr S hoped his ID would be acceptable. But I think Mr S 
ought reasonably to have been aware that NatWest might not accept his ID when he 
decided to continue with the online application.
The product Mr S applied for was withdrawn on 20 October 2021. To secure this product 
Mr S would have had to meet with a mortgage adviser and make a new application 
before then. It was Mr Ss choice to continue with the online application after the call on 
12 October 2021, despite being aware that there could be a problem with his ID and 
NatWest offering an advised appointment. If Mr S was (as he says) given incorrect 
information on 28 October 2021 this didnt change the outcome  the product he wanted 
had already been withdrawn.
Mr S told NatWest in October 2021 he might not have the right equipment for a call with 
a mortgage adviser, for instance if a computer with a camera was required. Ultimately 
though, he was able to have an advised call with a mortgage adviser. It seems likely this 
could have been arranged in October 2021, had Mr S chosen this route.
Theres no guarantee that NatWest would have offered Mr S a mortgage even if hed had 
the right form of ID or had met with a mortgage adviser. It would have had to complete 
checks, such as an affordability check and that the property met its lending criteria.
When NatWest told Mr S his ID wasnt acceptable for an online application it offered an 
advised appointment. Mr S hoped NatWest would allow his application to continue with 
the original product rate and wanted to wait for the outcome of his complaint. But it was 
Mr Ss choice in late 2021 and early 2022 not to go ahead with an advised appointment 
or look elsewhere for a better rate, despite being on his lenders standard variable rate. 
Mr S was clearly frustrated with the process. But its for NatWest to decide what forms of ID 
it accepts for online mortgage applications. I think it made Mr S aware that his ID might not 
be accepted. And it offered a reasonable alternative  an appointment with a mortgage 
adviser. I know Mr S will be disappointed. But I dont think its fair and reasonable to require 
NatWest to pay compensation for his costs or losses due to his online application being 
rejected, or the time he spent on his lenders SVR while he pursued the online application 
and waited for the outcome of his complaint. NatWest did make some errors here and I think its right that it offered compensation. Mr S 
says he was given incorrect information by branch staff about his ID being acceptable. 
NatWest accepts that Mr S could have been given incorrect information at his branch and 
offered compensation for this. 
Mr S made an application in October 2021 (albeit this was missing the required photo ID). It 
took NatWest until the end of December 2021 to tell Mr S his ID wasnt acceptable, despite 
Mr S calling it in mid-November 2021 to check what was happening. While I think NatWest 
ought to have given Mr S an answer more quickly after he called in mid-November 2021, I 
dont think this would have changed the outcome. I think Mr S would still havent wanted to 
see if there was a way for him to proceed with the product he chose in October 2021. 
NatWest also accepts there were errors with the way it dealt with Mr Ss complaint. NatWest 
offered Â£450 compensation for the way it dealt with the complaint and the incorrect 
information Mr S says he was given. I think for the inconvenience and upset caused by 
NatWests poor service, this is fair and reasonable. 
I dont think NatWest intended to bully Mr S by offering compensation and sending a link for 
him to claim the money. It made it clear in the final response letter that accepting the 
compensation wouldnt affect him being able to bring his complaint to this service.
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Â£450 to Mr S, as it offered to 
do. It can deduct any compensation it has already paid.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 January 2023.
