The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that a postage cost credit voucher offered to him by PayPal Europe Sarl & 
Cie, SCA, isnt available for him to use. 
What happened
Mr S bought an item online using his PayPal account. Mr S returned the item and was 
advised by PayPal that hed receive a credit to his PayPal account to cover the return 
postage cost and that he would receive an email from PayPal explaining how to access the 
credit.
However, while Mr S did notice that a credit was available to him on his account, he didnt 
receive the email from PayPal as promised which explained how to access and use the 
credit. Furthermore, when Mr S tied to use the credit some time later, he found that the credit 
was no longer available to him. Mr S wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr Ss complaint. They noted that there was a credit amount available to 
Mr S but that it was only available under certain conditions. PayPal also attempted to assist 
Mr S with accessing the credit that was available to him. Because of this, PayPal didnt think 
that theyd acted unfairly or unreasonably toward Mr S, so they didnt uphold his complaint.
Mr S wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they felt that because PayPal had 
confirmed that the credit was available to Mr S, and because PayPal had been attempting to 
help Mr S access that credit, that it wasnt fair to uphold this complaint.
Mr S remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand how it must be frustrating for Mr S to not be able to view the credit amount 
that hes been told he has access to on his account, but having reviewed all the information 
on this complaint its clear that PayPal have credited Mr S the credit amount in question 
here, and that therefore the issue that presents itself is why this credit amount continues to 
remain inaccessible to Mr S.
In circumstances such as this, where access to a given credit is problematic, what this 
service would expect would be that the business in question confirms that the credit has 
been provided and then seeks to help the customer access the credit so that it can be used 
when needed.
I think that PayPal have largely done that here. Theyve confirmed that a credit has been 
allocated to Mr Ss account and theyve attempted to work with Mr S so that he can try to 
access the credit thats been allocated to him. While these attempts havent thus far proven 
successful, and while I can understand Mr Ss frustration that this might be the case, its 
difficult to see what else PayPal can do here or what alternative corrective action they could 
employ. 
PayPal have confirmed that the use of the credit amount is subject to certain conditions. 
These conditions have already been explained in detail by our investigator, and so I wont 
repeat that information here. Additionally, PayPal have confirmed that they will continue to 
endeavour to help Mr S access the credit so that it can be used. 
Ultimately, this appears to be a technical service issue that I can only see being resolved by 
Mr S and PayPal cooperating to find a solution together. While I understand that Mr S feels 
that hes been given conflicting information and has been frustrated and inconvenienced by 
this ongoing matter, I cant see that PayPal have acted unfairly or unreasonably here, either 
in how theyve allocated the credit to Mr Ss account in the first instance, or in their 
subsequent attempts to help Mr S access the credit.
If, at the time of the issuance of this letter, this matter remains unresolved, I would strongly 
encourage PayPal to contact Mr S so that a solution can be found. Especially given that the 
detailed instructions that PayPal have previously provided to this service, and which have 
been relayed to Mr S, appear not to work.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr S was wanting here, but it follows that I wont 
be upholding this complaint or asking PayPal to take any mandatory corrective action at this 
time  although I do encourage PayPal to continue to work with Mr S as mentioned above. 
I sympathise with Mr S here, and I continue to appreciate how frustrating this ongoing matter 
must be. But I hope that Mr S can understand - given that I cant see that PayPal have acted 
unfairly or unreasonably towards him, and given that the issue appears to be of a technical 
nature and that it isnt within the remit of this service to instruct a business to change or 
amend its internal systems - why I have made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 July 2021.
