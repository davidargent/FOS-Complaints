The complaint
Mr S complains about the advice he received from Future Wealth Management (FWM) when 
he transferred four existing personal pensions to a Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP). 
These funds were split between two different discretionary fund managers, with £51,000 
invested in high-risk investments that subsequently lost almost half their value. Mr S said he 
wasnt an experienced investor, other than investing in with profits funds and didnt have the 
knowledge to make investment decisions.
At the time FWM was an appointed representative of Pi Financial Ltd (Pi), so they are 
responsible for FWMs actions and for this complaint. For ease of reading Ill refer to Pi 
throughout this decision. 
What happened
Several firms will be mentioned in this decision. These are:
Kingsgate Law (KL)  unregulated introducer
Pi Financial Ltd (trading as FWM) - regulated financial adviser
Horizon Stockbroking Ltd (HS)  regulated discretionary investment manager-in liquidation
TAM Asset Management (TAM)  regulated discretionary investment manager
James Hay (JH)-SIPP provider
Mr S said he was contacted by KL in 2014. He believes he was referred to them by his 
previous adviser who said he could no longer act for him. KL subsequently introduced Mr S 
to Pi. 
Mr S has disputed several of the signatures on documents which accompanied the 
application for his SIPP. There isnt sufficient evidence to say these werent his signatures, 
so Ive assumed he did sign the relevant documents. In any event, whether these signatures 
were his or not does not affect the outcome of this case.
Mr S signed a letter dated 1 August 2014 to PI saying: 
I would like to transfer my existing pension plans into a new Self Invested Personal 
Pension Plan, in order to allow me access a wider range of investments. 
Could you please recommend a suitable SIPP provider and a Discretionary Fund Manager 
to manage 50% of the investment held within the SIPP, and arrange the transfer accordingly. 
Please note I would like to manage the remaining 50% of my funds so do not require any 
advice on this as I have a separate investment advisor.
I hope that you will be able to assist me and look forward to hearing from you regarding this 
request.
On 4 August 2014 the adviser from Pi replied saying:
Thank you for the letter of the 1st August 2014 in which you instructed me to transfer your 
current . Plans into a new Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP).  I confirm I am happy to 
carry out your request and, as discussed, I will research the whole of the market to find the 
most appropriate SIPP for your requirements. 
I have made you aware that, under normal circumstances, I would carry out a full review of 
your personal and financial circumstances and assess them in relation to the suitability of the 
SIPP. However you have specifically requested this particular vehicle and did not want me to 
look into alternative options for you.
I will have no input in the investment strategy for your SIPP funds, as you are using a 
separate investment adviser for this, and therefore I will only be responsible for arranging, 
and transferring your funds into, the SIPP.
Mr S signed a service agreement and fee schedule with Pi on 6 August 2014. This 
agreement indicated the service level was limited advice service only.
Four Pension Replacement Contract Forms were completed on the same day. They 
included information about Mr S s existing pensions and the new SIPP, including charges 
and whether the existing plans held any guarantees. All four of his plans were with the same 
provider. The risk category for the SIPP was recorded as balanced/medium, with an asset 
allocation being described as managed. This matched what was recorded for the existing 
plans.
The Reasons for Switching section had ticks next to the headings:
No longer suitable for clients investment objectives
Lack of features/flexibility
Other
A section on the form headed Alternatives Considered asked whether moving funds within 
the existing contracts was an option. This was ticked as no. And a note recorded this option 
was discounted because: 
Client setting up SIPP to invest with DFM & also self-invest a part of the portfolio himself.
A Fact Find was completed and signed by Mr S on 6 August 2014. This showed he was 
employed, with a gross income of £37,500 a year. He was married, age 50 and had a 
desired retirement age of 60-62. He had recorded liquid assets of £27,000 in ISAs/PEPs. No 
further details were given for these holdings.
Pi sent a suitability report dated 9 September 2014 and headed Personal Pension To SIPP 
Transfer. This said, amongst other things: 
My advice is based on the details you provided at our meeting.
 
You instructed me to specifically limit my advice to Pension Planning and setting up a Self 
Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) and I have acted accordingly. I have, therefore, only 
obtained the necessary information from you to advise on the above area. You should be 
aware that my recommendations may have differed if I had undertaken a full review of your 
financial circumstances.

ObjectivesWe have not discussed providing you with a target income In retirement or compared your 
existing providers projections. You have simply asked that I find a suitable Investment fund 
for 50% of your existing pension plan and via your SIPP you will self-Invest the rest in line 
with your agreed risk profile..

Your Risk Profile
We established that your risk profile would lead you to be a balanced medium risk investor.
And there was a section titled Replacement Business which said:
In reviewing your objectives, I have recommended that you surrender/discontinue the
contracts outlined in the Replacement Policy Form.
The rationale for this is also outlined in the Replacement Policy Form, which we completed
during our last meeting and a copy of which is attached to this letter.
The adviser outlined the points to consider for a transfer including charges, exit penalties 
(none, though some bonuses would be lost); guaranteed annuity rates (none) and 
investment selection. 
It also said the effect of the charges would depend on the investment chosen within the 
SIPP.
The SIPP recommendation section said:
We discussed the various ways you could achieve your present objective as outlined above. 
I recommend that you consider a Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) Plan offered by 
James Hay Partnership. James Hay Partnership was chosen over the other providers on the 
original research due to their low annual management charge, low set up fee and quality of 
service. 
It is worthwhile outlining the product features of the contract recommended to demonstrate 
why it is suitable to your current circumstances and stated objectives, which I outlined 
earlier.
It was noted in the Provider section that a copy of the research undertaken with Defaqto 
Engage had been provided with the report, which outlined in greater detail the reasons the 
recommended provider had been chosen. This report was dated 21 August 2014.
.
Discretionary Fund Manager Recommendation
The provider I am recommending is TAM Asset Management
It went on to set out the benefits of a SIPP and the reason TAM had been recommended as 
the DFM. Mr S was recorded as a balanced medium investor. It was noted that the most 
suitable risk profile for Mr S was Balanced.
The report was signed to confirm that Mr S had received and understood it on 10 August 
2014.An application for the SIPP was completed and signed by Mr S on 23 September 2014. It 
showed Pi as the financial adviser and the initial adviser charges for transfers was 3% of 
each pension transfer received.
The SIPP was opened on 1 October 2014. Funds totalling £100,424.15 were transferred 
from the ceding scheme on the 16th and 17 October 2014.
The application for TAM Investment Proposal was signed by Mr S on 10 September 2014. 
£45,000 was transferred to TAM on 10 December 2014.
An application form for HS was signed by Mr S on 15 January 2015. This form recorded that 
Mr Ss annual income was £37,500. The section Current Investments showed he had 
£27,000 in equities and £97,000 in pensions.
The section Strategy & Risk Profile shows that the option to trade in Equities and CFDs 
(contract for differences) was ticked. 
It was noted in the Knowledge and Experience that Mr S had 10+ years of experience in 
investments. However the section which asked if a customer had ever traded in a number of 
more complex investments including CFDs, Options, Derivatives, Commodities or Spread 
Betting was left blank.
Under the section Investment Risk and Objectives Mr S was recorded as having a medium 
attitude to risk. This stated he had: some tolerance to fluctuation of capital value and/or 
current income in normal market circumstances A box was ticked as Yes to indicate that 
Mr S was willing to invest through a managed CFD account and that he was only investing 
money that he could afford to lose. It said: I understand that this is a high-risk speculative 
product, and that I might lose some or all of the funds invested.
The Power of Attorney for HS was witnessed by Pis adviser on 18 May 2015. 
£51,000 was paid to HS on from the SIPP on 22 July 2015. I am aware an allocation of 
£45,000 to TAM and £51,000 to HS isnt an exact 50/50 split, but for ease of reference I will 
continue to use 50% as the intended investment amount for each DFM.
All funds were returned to cash and transferred to a new pension provider on 23 August 
2016. The transfer value was £80,530.83.
Mr S complained to Pi in November 2019, who didnt uphold his complaint and so it was 
referred to this service. 
One of our investigators considered it. He recommended that it should be upheld. He 
thought Pi shouldnt have facilitated the switches of Mr Ss pensions into a SIPP, as it was 
unnecessary and the switch ultimately led to the investment in unsuitable CFDs.
Pi disagreed and the complaint was passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Pi has submitted detailed submissions which I considered in full. Ive also considered their 
more recent submissions on a similar case which is relevant to this complaint. However, Ill focus in this decision on what I consider to be the key material issues in deciding the fair 
outcome of this complaint. 
Its worth noting that I informed both parties my redress would be slightly different to what 
the investigator recommended. Pi said they still disagreed with the outcome but accepted my 
decision. Mr Ss representative also accepted the changes.
Pis position in summary is that:
Mr S instructed Pi to recommend an appropriate SIPP provider and Discretionary 
Fund Manager (DFM) for 50% of his pension. It only provided Mr S with a limited 
advice service on these specific instructions. Given the limited nature of the retainer 
the firm took reasonable steps to ensure that its recommendation was suitable in full 
compliance with COBS 2.4.4 and 11.2.19. Pi would have been in breach of the rules 
if it hadnt acted in line with his request
Pi didnt provide Mr S with advice on the switch from his personal pension plans to a 
SIPP or on the investment through HS. Mr S had already decided what he wanted to 
do before he approached Pi. 
Mr S had confirmed that he would be using a separate investment manager. Pi 
established that manager was an authorised and regulated firm and appropriately 
qualified. They did compliance on both HS and TAM.
The investment strategy for the SIPP was the responsibility of HS who was also a 
regulated party. HS and TAM are responsible for Mr Ss losses and not Pi who only 
played a very limited role here. The fact that HS is now in liquidation doesnt change 
this.
relevant considerations
In deciding whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of a complaint, Im required to 
take into account relevant law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; 
codes of practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to be good industry practice at the 
time.
The FCAs Principles for Businesses (PRIN) apply to all authorised firms including Pi. Of 
particular relevance to this complaint is: 
PRIN 2: A  firm must conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence.
PRIN 6: A firm must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly 
PRIN 9: A firm must take reasonable care to ensure the suitability of its advice and 
discretionary decisions for any customer who is entitled to rely upon its judgment. 
In addition, where regulated investment advice is given, the more detailed Conduct of 
Business Sourcebook (COBS) rules apply. Of particular relevance to this complaint are:
COBS 9 which applies where a firm makes a personal recommendation in relation to 
designated investment.
COBS 9.2.1(1): A firm must take reasonable steps to ensure that a personal 
recommendation, or a decision to trade, is suitable for its client.COBS 9.2.1 (2) says that when making a personal recommendation, a firm must obtain the 
necessary information regarding the client's:
(a) knowledge and experience in the investment field relevant to the specific type of 
designated investment or service;
(b) financial situation; and
(c) investment objectives;
so as to enable the firm to make the recommendation, or take the decision, which is suitable 
for him.
COBS 9.2.2 provides:
(1) A firm must obtain from the client such information as is necessary for the firm to 
understand the essential facts about him and have a reasonable basis for believing, giving 
due consideration to the nature and extent of the service provided, that the specific 
transaction to be recommended, or entered into in the course of managing:
(a) meets his investment objectives;
(b) is such that he is able financially to bear any related investment risks consistent 
with his investment objectives; and
(c) is such that he has the necessary experience and knowledge in order to 
understand the risks involved in the transaction or in the management of his portfolio.
(2) The information regarding the investment objectives of a client must include, where 
relevant, information on the length of time for which he wishes to hold the investment, his 
preferences regarding risk taking, his risk profile, and the purposes of the investment.
(3) The information regarding the financial situation of a client must include, where relevant, 
information on the source and extent of his regular income, his assets, including liquid 
assets, investments and real property, and his regular financial commitments.
I am also mindful of the general legal position including: the law relating to causation, 
foreseeability and remoteness of losses.
My considerations here are:
Did Pi give Mr S investment advice including a personal recommendation?
If so, was the advice suitable? 
If the advice was unsuitable I need to consider whether:
Mr S would have relied on the advice or whether he would have acted the 
same way he did irrespective of Pis advice and 
If Mr S did follow Pis advice, how fair compensation should be calculated in 
the specific circumstances of this case.
advising on investmentsI have firstly considered whether, based on the facts of the complaint, Pi provided Mr S with 
regulated investment advice. 
Regulated activities specified for the purposes of section 22 of the Financial Services and 
Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) were set out in the Regulated Activities Order (RAO) and 
included:
Advising on investments
53.  Advising a person is a specified kind of activity if the advice is
(a) given to the person in his capacity as an investor or potential investor, or in his capacity 
as agent for an investor or a potential investor; and
(b) advice on the merits of his doing any of the following (whether as principal or agent)
(i) buying, selling, subscribing for or underwriting a particular investment which is a security 
or a relevant investment, or
(ii) exercising any right conferred by such an investment to buy, sell, subscribe for or 
underwrite such an investment.
Part III of the RAO listed the kinds of investment which are specified for the purposes of 
section 22 of FSMA. This included:
Article 82, Rights under a pension scheme which at the time read.
(1) Rights under a stakeholder pension scheme. 
(2) Rights under a personal pension scheme.
As far as I can see Pi agrees that they recommended a particular SIPP with a particular 
SIPP provider to Mr S. This is also clearly evidenced in the following documents:
The research report which was issued on 21 August 2014 and prepared by Pis 
adviser and which -after comparing several SIPPs and providers- recommended the 
James Hay Modular iSIPP for Mr S. 
The suitability report dated 9 September 2014 headed Personal Pension To SIPP 
Transfer which said amongst other things:
My advice is based on the details you provided at our meeting.
You instructed me to specifically limit my advice to Pension Planning and setting up a Self 
Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) and I have acted accordingly.
The report then went onto outline the points to consider. It said In undertaking this transfer I 
would like to draw your attention to the following. It went on to list, amongst other things, the 
charges for the SIPP Pi was recommending, and confirmed there were no exit penalties from 
the original arrangements and that they didnt provide guaranteed annuity rates. It also noted 
that Mr S would be losing a share of the bonuses which applied to each of his with profits 
plans.
Pi went onto make a specific recommendation We discussed the various ways you could 
achieve your present objective as outlined above. I recommended that you consider 
establishing a Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) Plan offered by a James Hay 
Partnership. James Hay Partnership was chosen over the other providers on the original 
research due to their low annual management charge, low set up fee and quality of service. It is worthwhile outlining the product features of the contract recommended to demonstrate 
why it is suitable to your current circumstances and stated objectives [my emphasis], 
which I outlined earlier.
Having undertaken appropriate research on your behalf I believe that James Hay 
Partnership will offer the most suitable contract given your stated objectives.
A copy of the research undertaken . accompanies this letter for your
consideration which outlines in greater detail the reasons for the recommendation of the 
chosen provider. [my emphasis]
When considering a DFM for 50% of Mr Ss pension, Pi stated In order to determine the 
most appropriate offering available I have undertaken research via an independent 
agency
The provider I am recommending is TAM Asset Management
The basis on which I have provided this advice is set out in the Client Agreement,
which I gave you at our initial meeting. The advice provided is also based upon the
information you have disclosed and therefore, if this letter does not match your view of
the situation please let me know.
I think its clear from the documents that Pi recommended a particular SIPP with a particular 
provider which they said was suitable for Mr S as well as a DFM. Im satisfied that their 
recommendations can be considered to be advising under Article 53 RAO. 
I am satisfied that Pi were giving regulated advice on investments and provided a personal 
recommendation to Mr S when they advised on the SIPP and DFM. Therefore the 
obligations in COBS 9 were engaged.
was PI entitled to rely on their limited retainer? 
Pi has said it provided a limited advice service in accordance with Mr Ss instructions. Mr S 
had specifically asked for them to recommend a SIPP product and he told them he didnt 
require investment advice for 50% of his pension. Pi says they didnt provide advice on the 
switch from Mr Ss personal pension to the SIPP or where 50% of it would be invested.
The issue to determine is whether Pi was entitled to restrict their advice to the 
recommendation of the SIPP product and a DFM for half of the investments only. Having 
considered this carefully I dont think it was fair and reasonable for them to do so.
The purpose of Pis regulatory duties under FSMA (and COBS) is to provide consumer 
protection taking into account the differing risks involved in different kinds of investments, the 
differing degrees of experience and expertise consumers have and the needs consumers 
may have for the timely provision of information and advice that is accurate and fit for 
purpose (Section 1B FSMA). 
When recommending the SIPP and DFM, Pi needed to have a reasonable basis for 
believing that their recommendation would meet Mr Ss objectives and that he was able to 
bear any related investment risks. Mr Ss recorded objective for transferring to the SIPP was 
that he wanted to use a DFM and self-invest 50% of his funds. 
I consider the risks of Mr S transferring his existing pensions and the risks of his intended 
investments through the SIPP with these monies were related to the establishment of the SIPP itself. Applying COBS 9.2.2, Im satisfied Pi couldnt simply ignore the context of why 
Mr S wanted a recommendation for a SIPP and what Mr S was intending to do with all of his 
funds once the SIPP was established. I consider that in order to advise on the merits of 
setting up a specific SIPP product, Pi needed to have regard to Mr Ss wider circumstances 
including how his funds were currently invested and what the entire intended investment 
strategy would be. Assessing the suitability of a SIPP in isolation without considering the 
whole transaction is not reasonably possible.
The FSA published an alert in 2013 when they became concerned that regulated financial 
advisers were misinterpreting the rules. The alert focussed on unregulated investments 
which were introduced by unregulated introducers as these held particular risks for 
customers, however I consider the principles here still apply where regulated investments 
are concerned. The alert said:
It has been brought to the FSAs attention that some financial advisers are giving advice to 
customers on pension transfers or pension switches [my emphasis] without assessing the 
advantages and disadvantages of investments proposed to be held within the new pension.. 
The FSAs view is that the provision of suitable advice generally requires consideration of
the other investments held by the customer or, when advice is given on a product which is a
vehicle for investment in other products (such as SIPPs and other wrappers), consideration
of the suitability of the overall proposition, that is, the wrapper and the expected underlying
investments in unregulated schemes.
Financial advisers using this advice model are under the mistaken impression that this
process means they do not have to consider the unregulated investment as part of their
advice to invest in the SIPP and that they only need to consider the suitability of the SIPP in
the abstract. This is incorrect.
For example, where a financial adviser recommends a SIPP knowing that the customer will
transfer out of a current pension arrangement to release funds to invest in an overseas
property investment under a SIPP, then the suitability of the overseas property investment
must form part of the advice about whether the customer should transfer into the SIPP. If,
taking into account the individual circumstances of the customer, the original pension
product, including its underlying holdings, is more suitable for the customer, then the SIPP is
not suitable
And it specifically referred to cases where advisers were under the false impression they 
could advise on the suitability of a SIPP in the abstract. In 2014 the FSA issued a further 
alert in which they reiterated [emphasis added]:
Where a financial adviser recommends a SIPP knowing that the customer will transfer or 
switch from a current pension arrangement to release funds to invest through a SIPP, then 
the suitability of the underlying investment must form part of the advice given to the 
customer. If the underlying investment is not suitable for the customer, then the 
overall advice is not suitable. 
The initial alert outlined our view that where advice is given on a product (such as a SIPP) 
which is intended as a wrapper or vehicle for investment in other products, provision of 
suitable advice generally requires consideration of the overall transaction, that is, the vehicle 
or wrapper and the expected underlying investments (whether or not such investments 
are regulated products).
Despite the initial alert, some firms continue to operate a model where they purportedly 
restrict their advice to the merits of the SIPP wrapper. I appreciate that the alert focussed on particular situations and it didnt mention explicitly 
situations where a second regulated party was involved to give investment advice. Pi says 
the alert was to provide guidance where there was an advice gap and the adviser was the 
only regulated party in the transaction. And this wasnt the case here. 
However, I think applying a narrow reading of the alert to only specific circumstances is 
misguided. The essence of the alert, in my view, was to remind advisers that they couldnt 
just advise on a SIPP in isolation, but that to comply with their regulatory obligations they 
needed to consider the consumers wider circumstances and whether what they were 
intending to do was suitable and in their best interest. I strongly disagree with Pi that these 
alerts arent relevant to Mr Ss complaint. However, I want to be clear that I consider Pis 
obligations in this regard stem from COBS 9 and the Principles. The alert just provides 
clarification and sets out expectations from the regulator and good industry practice. The 
requirements of COBS 9.2.2 dont fall away when another regulated party is involved.
It follows that in order to give suitable advice on the SIPP Pi needed to consider Mr Ss wider 
circumstances and the suitability of the whole transaction, i.e. the switch from a personal 
pension to a SIPP, the suitability of a particular SIPP product and provider and the 
underlying investment strategy including the use of a DFM.
I also point to COBS 2.1.2R which sets out clearly that a firm must not seek to exclude or 
restrict; or rely on any exclusion or restriction of any duty or liability it may have to the client 
under the regulatory system. So Pi couldnt limit their obligation in COBS 9 by taking 
instructions from Mr S to only consider the SIPP wrapper in isolation. 
Pi and Mr S were in an advisory relationship where Pi was the expert and they had a duty to 
meet their regulatory obligations. As explained above COBS 9 required Pi do consider the 
wider suitability of Mr S s intended transactions when recommending a SIPP-whether he 
requested this or not. They failed to do this and therefore I consider they did not act fairly or 
reasonably when providing their advice to Mr S.
Pi Financial referred to the court case Denning v Greenhalgh Financial Services which it said 
considered the scope of duty of advisers. And the High Court decision - Adams v Carey 
Pension UK LLP, where it noted the court had considered the duty of a party performing a 
limited service and said the decision was relevant to Mr Ss case. 
 
With respect to the Adams v Carey Pension UK LLP High Court decision, that case was 
about an execution-only contract. The parties were a SIPP administrator and an investor. It 
was clear on the facts of the case that the SIPP administrator didnt act in an advisory role 
and it told the investor to seek independent advice elsewhere. The judge held that COBS 
2.1.1 would have to therefore be construed in light of the nature of the contractual 
relationship which was not advisory. I think the circumstances in this complaint are 
significantly different. Pi didnt act on an execution-only basis. They were giving advice on 
the SIPP, so the regulatory obligations of COBS 9 did apply. And as explained above part of 
the suitability assessment of the SIPP would have included the suitability of the pension 
switch and the underlying investment strategy.
I have also considered Denning v Greenlagh, but it doesnt change my findings either. 
For the reasons I have explained, Im satisfied that Pi gave regulated advice on the suitability 
of the particular SIPP. They had to comply with their regulatory obligations under COBS 9 
and, in that sense, I dont think Denning is of value to that determination.   
In summary, I consider that when advising Mr S on the suitability of the James Hay Modular 
iSIPP, Pi had to consider the suitability of the whole intended transaction including the 
pension switch and where Mr S intended to invest all of his funds after the transfer.did Pi provide suitable advice?
COBS 9 required Pi to take reasonable steps to provide Mr S with a suitable 
recommendation, so I considered whether they met this requirement.
Mr S was 50, married, and had an annual income of £37,500. He had £27,000 in ISAs or 
PEPs, but no details were provided about the funds within these wrappers. His personal 
pensions were all invested with profits funds. His retirement age was recorded as 60-62.
As part of the advice process in recommending a suitable DFM for 50% of Mr Ss pension, Pi 
established the client had a medium attitude to risk. Given that he had some, unquantified, 
investment experience in PEPs or ISAs, only held with-profits pensions and had a term to 
retirement of 10-12 years, I think this is reasonable assessment.
Its unclear from the paperwork whether Pi knew in this particular case that Mr S was 
planning to invest through Horizon when they gave their advice on the SIPP. However, Ive 
seen email correspondence between Pi and HS in 2015 where Pi was requesting statements 
for their clients which included Mr S. Pi said : [The statements] are all off by quite a bit and 
[Pis adviser] wants to speak to them. The email chain indicates that Pi and HS were in 
frequent contact about their mutual clients.
This indicates that Pi was still actively involved after the investments were made which 
somewhat conflicts with Pis statement that they only recommended the SIPP and played a 
very limited role in the process. So on balance I think its likely Pi knew that Mr S, like other 
clients introduced by LP and other unregulated introducers, would invest through Horizon.
Pi confirmed that during their due diligence enquiries with HS, they confirmed to Pi that "at 
present all our SIPP clients' have a portfolio containing ETFs and CFDs. This is consistent 
with the client's attitude to risk completed on the application form". So if they knew Mr S was 
intending to invest through Horizon, they ought to have known HSs investment strategy was 
too high risk for Mr S.
Even if I assume Pi originally didnt know what Mr S wanted to invest in, they should have 
found out before they gave their advice. As stated before, Pi needed to consider the 
transaction as a whole and without knowing what Mr S was planning to do and achieve, they 
couldnt reasonably conclude whether the transfer to a SIPP was suitable. 
Although Mr S had funds in an ISA or PEP there was no other information to place his 
experience into any sort of context, for instance by saying what he was actually invested in, 
or for how long. As such, I dont think there is sufficient evidence for the business to have 
accepted that he had the relevant knowledge, experience or attitude to risk to take on high 
risk investments. His existing pensions were all with-profits and didnt require any 
involvement from the consumer in their management, so he had no experience of managing 
his pensions. 
Even if Mr S had suddenly wanted to invest into high risk investments, I think its highly 
unlikely he had the knowledge and experience to understand the risks involved in CFDs. 
Given that he was investing around half of his entire pension provisions I think it also should 
have been clear to Pi that he didnt have the required capacity for loss for high risk 
investments.
Pi assessed Mr S as being a medium risk investor and it is clear that a high-risk and 
speculative investment, such as CFDs would be unsuitable for him. Pi have also confirmed to this service they agree CFDs are unsuitable for retail investors. So I dont think the issue 
of whether CFDs were suitable is really in dispute. 
For the reasons I have set out previously, the suitability of the SIPP couldnt be established 
without confirming the suitability of the underlying investments and Pi shouldnt have 
recommended the switch when it didnt know what level of risk around 50% of Mr Ss 
portfolio was going to be exposed to. Pi ought to have found out how HS intended to 
manage the portfolio and couldnt make a recommendation without this information.
In summary, I think Pi should not have recommended a SIPP to Mr S and certainly shouldnt 
have facilitated the investment with HS by witnessing the power of attorney form he signed. 
They should have explained that his intended investments were too high risk and that given 
his limited assets, he couldnt financially bear the risks with his retirement funds, even if this 
only accounted for half of his pension fund. 
In my view Pi were in breach of the Principles and COBS when they recommended the SIPP 
and helped him arrange the paperwork for investments which were clearly not suitable for 
him. They didnt pay due regard to Mr S s interests and did not take reasonable steps to 
ensure that their personal recommendation was suitable for Mr S, as per their regulatory 
obligations. Therefore I do not consider that Pis actions in their dealings with Mr S were fair 
or reasonable in the circumstances. 
However, Pi couldnt just look at half of Mr Ss funds without considering what was 
happening to the other half. I have already set out, there was no clear reason why Mr S 
needed to move his existing pensions to a SIPP and DFM, when he had no previous 
experience of managing his own investments. Moving four pensions to one SIPP provider 
would serve a function of consolidating Mr Ss pensions, but this would be of limited value to 
the consumer when his pensions werent being actively managed by him up to that point and 
on its own wouldnt be sufficient reason in my opinion to warrant additional charges.
While there are no concerns with the level of risk attached to the DFM, there was no evident 
need for Mr S to switch his pensions at all. 
would Mr S have transferred his pension to a SIPP and invested through HS anyway?
Pi say that the paperwork Mr S received from HS would have clearly set out that the product 
was high risk and that he could lose his money. So Mr S would have known the risks and 
agreed, Pi presumes, in the expectation of higher returns. Pi said it was beyond doubt that 
even if they had provided Mr S with risk warnings or refused to recommend the SIPP, Mr S 
would have gone ahead with the transfer with someone else.
I carefully considered Pis argument, however on balance I think Mr S would have listened to 
Pi if they had clearly told him they wouldnt recommend a SIPP and that they considered the 
intended investments through HS to be unsuitable for him. 
Mr S has said his first contact with KL was when they wrote to him telling him his original 
agent was no longer working with the same firm his pensions were managed by. KL then put 
him in touch with Pi. Although Mr S might have signed the instruction letter, I think it needs to 
be considered in the context that the transaction was initiated by KL. There was no 
longstanding relationship between Mr S and KL and Mr S told us before being approached 
he hadnt planned to change his pensions or invest in high risk propositions, such as CFDs. 
He had no experience in these products and had been happy with his existing pensions. I 
find this plausible.Its true that the risk of the underlying investment was highlighted in the CFD account 
opening process/forms. However, as I said previously, Pi witnessed the form Mr S signed 
giving HS power of attorney for his investment with the DFM. I believe most consumers 
would view an advisers willingness to do this as reassurance they had no real concerns 
about this.
Also, I think on balance if Pi, as a regulated adviser and independent third party, had told Mr 
S they couldnt recommend the SIPP without knowing full details of how his pension was 
going to be managed, told him the limited information it did have indicated the intended 
investments werent suitable for his circumstances, said the transaction wasnt in his best 
interest and he couldnt afford to risk his pension in this way, he likely would have decided 
not to proceed. 
Im not persuaded the evidence suggests Mr S was so strongly motivated to make the 
transaction that he would have decided to press ahead with it against professional expert 
advice. For the reasons I have given above, Im satisfied that Mr S would more likely than 
not have remained with his existing pension arrangements if Pi had explained the position in 
full and recommended against the SIPP and investment with HS.
reliance on another regulated party: COBS 2.4.4
Pi also said COBS 2.4.4 should be considered. They say they were entitled to rely on HS 
providing a suitable recommendation for Mr S. Pi doesnt accept that there was a regulatory 
obligation for them to assess the investment in detail and certainly not to the extent than it 
would be expected from someone who recommended the investment.
Firstly, I dont consider that COBS 2.4.4. applies here. The rule broadly says where a firm 
(F1) receives an instruction from another regulated firm (F2) to carry out a regulated activity 
on behalf of a client, F1 can rely on assessments or information provided to it by F2. Pi 
suggests in these particular circumstances they were F1 and HS were F2. However, Pi didnt 
receive any instructions here from HS. 
There was no need for Pi to assess the investment in encompassing detail. But they needed 
to have sufficient understanding of what Mr S would be invested in. Pi knew or should have 
known that Mr S would be invested in CFDs which they themselves agree were unsuitable 
for retail clients. 
So in any event, even if COBS 2.4.4. applied, I cant see how Pi could reasonably rely on HS 
providing Mr S with a suitable investment, when they shouldve known HSs strategy for all 
their SIPP clients (as confirmed in 2015) included the use of CFDs. 
fair compensation
I have found that Pi gave Mr S unsuitable advice and if it wasnt for their advice, Mr S more 
likely than not would have remained in his personal pensions. Having considered all the 
evidence and arguments, I consider it fair that Pi compensates Mr S for any losses he 
suffered by transferring into the SIPP and investing into high risk investments through HS.
Pi says it cant be required to pay compensation which is outside of its legal scope of 
responsibility and which is too remote to be recoverable as a matter of law. It referred to 
SAAMCO v York Montague Ltd [1997] and BPE Solicitors v Hughes-Holland [2018]. 
Pis scope of duty was to take reasonable steps to give a suitable recommendation. This 
included understanding Mr Ss knowledge and experience, objectives and financial situation. Part of this duty was the consideration of the pension switch and the underlying investment 
in the SIPP as explained above. 
Pi breached their regulatory duties when they recommended a SIPP although the intended 
investments in CFDs were evidently unsuitable for Mr S.  For the reasons I have given 
earlier in the decision, I think Mr S would have likely remained in his existing pensions but for 
Pis failings. So Mr S wouldnt have been in the SIPP or CFD account at all if Pi had met its 
obligations under COBS and PRIN. And consequently he wouldnt have suffered the 
investment losses he did. I therefore consider the losses Mr S suffered from the high-risk 
investment are related to Pis unsuitable advice.
Pi say HS, who was also a regulated firm, had their own obligations towards Mr S and it was 
their investment strategy that ultimately caused Mr Ss losses. Pi pointed to other decisions 
at this service were findings were made that HS had caused losses by excessive trades. 
Based on this, Pi say it seems likely that the losses suffered by Mr S are down to similarly 
excessive trade volumes by HS and a failure to keep the proportion of CFDs within portfolios 
to an acceptable level. They say these were not issues that could have been foreseen by Pi 
and the losses incurred are therefore too remote. 
I recognise that HS also had regulatory obligations and its possible that their actions may 
have also separately caused some of Mr Ss loss. And Ive taken into consideration that, in 
principle, if HS acted negligently or fraudulently, such actions might represent a break in the 
chain of causation. 
In these particular circumstances, however, I dont think Mr Ss losses were unforeseeable. 
Pi knew or should have been aware of the investment strategy which involved a CFD 
account. They knew this was a high-risk and speculative investment product and they had 
already classed Mr S as having a medium attitude to risk. So Im satisfied the real risk of Mr 
S suffering substantial losses and even the risk of total loss of to his pension would or should 
have been foreseeable to Pi. 
Its possible that HS did excessive trades and Pi might have not foreseen the scale of the 
losses. However, Pi knew of the high risks and significant losses Mr S could suffer by 
investing his pension funds through HS in a CFD account. If Pi had given Mr S suitable 
advice these losses would have been prevented.
I cant consider a complaint against HS as they are in default. In the circumstances of this 
case I think its reasonable to award fair compensation against Pi notwithstanding any 
potential break of chain of causation. 
This is because Im putting Mr S as far as possible in the financial position he would be in 
but for Pis unsuitable advice. Mr S wouldnt have lost out at all but for Pis failings to take 
reasonable steps to ensure their advice was suitable and Pi benefitted financially [in their 
role as independent financial advisors] from advising on this unsuitable transaction. So I 
consider it fair that Pi should compensate Mr S. I think apportioning responsibility to Pi for 
the whole of the loss represents fair compensation in this case.
In my view Mr S s losses flowed from PIs failures in regard to COBS and PRIN as I have 
described. I dont think the losses are too remote or that I am departing from the law. In all 
the circumstances, Im satisfied its fair compensation that Pi compensates Mr S for the 
losses he suffered by transferring his pension into a SIPP and from there into high-risk 
investments. putting things right
In awarding fair compensation for Mr Ss losses my aim is to put Mr S as close as possible to 
the position he would probably now be in if he had been given suitable advice by Pi.
In my view, for the reasons given above, Mr S would more likely than not have stayed in his 
existing arrangements if Pi had followed their regulatory duties and not recommended the 
SIPP. 
Mr S was advised to switch his pension again to a new provider with new investments in 
August 2016. This advice was given by the same adviser, however in his role as an adviser 
for a different firm (Tidal Wealth Management) who wasnt an appointed representative of Pi. 
Mr S has complained about this later recommendation to the FSCS (as Tidal Wealths 
principal firm has gone into liquidation). As the advice in 2016 forms a new advice point 
which Pi is not responsible for, I consider it fair and reasonable to stop loss calculations on 
this date. However, I also considered that Mr S will have lost out on investment returns on 
this loss amount between then and now. So losses need to be brought up to date as set out 
below.
Pi should request notional values from Mr Ss previous pension provider. Pi should calculate 
compensation by comparing the value that Mr Ss existing pensions would have been on the 
day in August 2016 when they were transferred to a new provider (Value A) with the value of 
his SIPP (Value B) on the same date.
If Value A is higher than B, then the difference between A and B is the loss. This loss 
amount should be revalued in line with the FTSE UK Private investors Income Total Return 
Index from August 2016 until the date of this final decision. I consider this benchmark fair as:
Mr S wanted capital growth and was willing to accept some investment risk.
The FTSE UK Private Investors Income total return index (prior to 1 March 2017,
the FTSE WMA Stock Market Income total return index) is made up of a range of
indices with different asset classes, mainly UK equities and government bonds.
Its a fair measure for someone who was prepared to take some risk to get a
higher return.
Although it is called income index, the mix and diversification provided within the
index is close enough to allow me to use it as a reasonable measure of
comparison given Mr Ss circumstances and risk attitude.
When calculating Value A, any withdrawal, income or other distribution out of the SIPP 
should be deducted from the point it was actually paid so it ceases to accrue any return in 
the calculation from that point on. If there are a large number of regular payments, to keep 
calculations simpler, Ill accept if they are totalled and all those payments deducted at the 
end instead of deducting periodically. Any additional sum paid into the SIPP should be 
added to the Value A calculation from the point in time when it was actually paid in.
The compensation amount should if possible be paid into Mr Ss pension plan. The payment 
should allow for the effect of charges and any available tax relief. The compensation 
shouldnt be paid into the pension plan if it would conflict with any existing protection or 
allowance.
If a payment into the pension isnt possible or has protection or allowance implications, it 
should be paid directly to Mr S as a lump sum after making a notional reduction to allow for future income tax that would otherwise have been paid. If Mr S hasnt yet taken any tax-free 
cash from his plan, 25% of the loss would be tax-free and 75% would have been taxed 
according to his likely income tax rate in retirement presumed to be 20%. So making a 
notional reduction of 15% overall from the loss adequately reflects this. 
In addition, Pi Financial Ltd should pay Mr S £300 for the distress suffered when he realised 
he had lost significant parts of his pension. 
Pi Financial Ltd should pay interest at the rate of 8% simple per annum on the compensation 
calculated as at the date of decision if its not paid to Mr S within 28 days of us notifying Pi 
Financial Ltd that Mr S has accepted my final decision. 
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If Pi Financial considers its required by
HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income tax from the interest, it should tell Mr S how 
much its taken off. It should also give Mr S a tax deduction certificate if he asks for one, so 
he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Details of the calculations should be provided to Mr S in a clear and simple format.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require Pi Financial Ltd to pay compensation as set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 November 2021.
