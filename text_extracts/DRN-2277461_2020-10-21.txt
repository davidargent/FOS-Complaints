The complaint
Mr S complains about how Bank of Scotland plc (BofS) dealt with his concerns about a
payment he made, or tried to make, from his BofS current account to his credit card with a
business that I will call M.
What happened
On 17 January 2020 Mr S paid, or attempted to pay, £1,000 from his BofS current account to
his credit card with M using his debit card. This payment was never credited to Mr S credit
card with M. It was debited from his BofS current account on 20 January 2020 but recredited
the same day. Between 17 and 20 January 2020 the payment of £1,000 appears to have
been marked on Mr S BofS current account as a pending transaction.
On 17 January 2020 Mr S paid £739.46 from his BofS current account to his credit card with
M using his debit card. This payment was credited to Mr S credit card with M on
17 January 2020 and debited to his BofS current account on 20 January 2020. Between
17 and 20 January 2020 the payment of £739.46 appears to have been marked on Mr S
BofS current account as a pending transaction.
Mr S was concerned that his payment of £1,000 wasnt credited to his credit card with M on
the 17 January 2020  the day he paid it or attempted to pay it  so he contacted BofS to
raise his concerns. He then contacted it to raise a complaint.
Mr S wasnt happy with BofS investigation into his complaint, or its response to it, so he
referred it to our service for investigation.
Mr S complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that BofS
had done nothing wrong.
Mr S didnt agree with the investigators view so his complaint was passed to me for
review and decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in September 2020. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Mr S has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their
entirety. However, I trust that Mr S will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The purpose
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
Based on what has been said and provided, its my understanding that:
On 17 January 2020 Mr S paid, or attempted to pay, £1,000 from his BofS current 
account (by debit card) to his credit card with M.
On 17 January the sum of £1,000 was marked as pending on Mr S BofS current 
account.
The sum of £1,000 was never credited to Mr S credit card with M, M submitting that 
BofS had declined the payment.
On 20 January 2020 the payment of £1,000 was debited to Mr S BofS current 
account.
On 20 January 2020 BofS credited Mr S current account with £1,000 pending a 
chargeback.
On 20 January 2020 Mr S current account with BofS was credited £1,000 in respect 
of his 17 January 2020 payment/attempted payment to M.
On 11 February 2020 Mr S current account with BofS was debited £1,000 to reverse 
the 20 January 2020 £1,000 credit made by BofS pending a chargeback.
Now its unclear precisely what happened between 17 and 20 January 2020 with both BofS
and M providing different accounts as to why payment was never successful. However, I
dont think I need to decide what happened between these two dates to fairly decide this
complaint.
In my view Mr S hasnt suffered a financial loss, on either his BofS current account or his
credit card with M, as a result of what happened between 17 and 20 January 2020. I say this
because I can see that Mr S was able to make two payments of £500 and £501 on
20 January 2020 (debited to his BofS current account on 21 January 2020) so as to avoid
any interest accruing on his credit card with M. And that all charges he incurred on his BofS
current account between 1 January 2020 and 14 April 2020 totalling £83.37 were refunded
by BofS on 10 July 2020.
I appreciate that Mr S would have been concerned that on 17 January 2020 his BofS current
account was showing a £1,000 debit pending but M wasnt showing a corresponding credit
of the same sum on his credit card with it.
But Im not persuaded it would be appropriate for me to make any award in this respect. I
say this because based on what both parties have said and submitted Im satisfied that BofS
did its best to reassure Mr S about the £1,000 and that three days later, or one bank
working day later, his BofS current account was debited and recredited with £1,000 and the
same sum removed from pending transactions.
For the sake of completeness I would also add that in my view BofS instigated its
chargeback procedures in good time (within 24 hours) and acted entirely appropriately in
debiting £1,000 from the account that it did on 11 February 2020, rather than any other
account Mr S might have held.
BofS responded to say that it accepted my provisional decision and had nothing further to 
add. Mr S confirmed receipt of my provisional decision but submitted nothing materially new 
for my consideration.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Given that BofS accepted my provisional decision and Mr S submitted nothing materially 
new for my consideration, I see no reason to change my provisional findings and I now 
confirm them as final.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2020.
