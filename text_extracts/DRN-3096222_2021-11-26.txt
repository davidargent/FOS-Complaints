The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA placed a permanent limitation on 
his account.
What happened
 
Mr B opened a PayPal account in July 2007. When he did so, he agreed to Paypals terms 
and conditions. The terms set out that PayPals service cannot be used by anyone under 18.
Around 14 years later, in April 2021, PayPal carried out a review of Mr Bs account. As part 
of the process, he was required to provide proof of his address and some identification 
documents. When he did so, PayPal realised that Mr B had been under 18 when he first 
opened the account  which was a breach of its terms and conditions. So, it quickly applied 
a permanent limitation and Mr B could no longer use the account.
Unhappy with PayPals actions, Mr B complained. He said hed been a loyal user of the 
service, and that when hed provided any required personal information in 2007, hed done 
so honestly. Further, Mr B said hed appealed the decision, but hed only received an 
automated response. So, he was unhappy with the level of service hed received.
 
PayPal sent its final response to Mr B on 17 June. In summary, PayPal explained that there 
had been no requirement to enter a date of birth at the time Mr B opened this account. 
Nonetheless, it said its terms and conditions were clear that the use of its service by anyone 
under 18 was prohibited. And as Mr B had been found to have breached these terms, 
PayPal maintained its position.
 
While it didnt change its stance, PayPal did explain that it was still happy to continue 
providing its service to Mr B. It said that it had found he already held two other accounts 
which could be used instead, or he could create a new account.
 
Mr B remained unhappy with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to our service. 
An investigator here considered what had happened, and she didnt think PayPal had acted 
fairly. In summary, she said that while she agreed PayPals terms and conditions on age 
limits were clear  Mr B had still been able to open and operate the account for around 14 
years.
 
So, while she accepted that Mr B had breached PayPals terms and conditions, the 
investigator felt PayPal should compensate him for the time it had taken to recognise the 
account should never have been opened, and the subsequent inconvenience it had now 
caused.
 
PayPal disagreed and it asked for an ombudsmans decision. It maintained that Mr B had 
breached its terms and conditions because he didnt meet the eligibility criteria when he 
opened the account. Moreover, PayPal said Mr B wouldnt have been inconvenienced 
because he held two other accounts which he couldve used.
 
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator  for much the 
same reasons. Ill explain why.
 
PayPals terms and conditions set out that, to be eligible for its service, users must not be 
under 18. Specifically, it says:
Our Service is not available to individuals under the age of 18 years. We may refuse to 
provide our Service, change the qualifications for his use of the Service and/or terminate this 
Agreement with you at any time on giving you notice by email, such notice to take immediate 
effect 
PayPal has explained that, at the time Mr B opened this account in 2007, applicants didnt 
need to provide their date of birth. That surprises me a little, given how clear the age 
requirements are for customers to use PayPals service. But nonetheless, theres no dispute 
over how old Mr B was when he opened the account. He was 16, and that means he did  
however unwittingly  breach PayPals terms and conditions. As a consequence, PayPal has 
decided to place a permanent limitation on this account in-line with its terms and conditions. 
And thats a commercial decision it was entitled to take.
 
Having said that, I do think Mr B was put to some inconvenience. Thats because it took 
PayPal quite some time  around 14 years  to realise that Mr B wasnt eligible to use its 
service when hed first opened this account. 
In his testimony, Mr B has said he used this account regularly to pay bills over the last 14 
years. Hed been using it without issue for all that time and then, at short notice, he had to 
take steps to rearrange his finances so he could meet his commitments. Moreover, when he 
tried to appeal the decision, it seems Mr B only received automated responses  and I can 
appreciate that wouldve been frustrating for him.
 
PayPal has argued that Mr B held two other accounts which he could use. And I accept 
these accounts mean he hasnt been left entirely without use of PayPals service. Indeed, 
Mr B has confirmed that hes made use of his other accounts to keep up with his 
commitments as best he can. But hes also said that this was a far from perfect solution, and 
I dont doubt that it wouldve been inconvenient for him having to take action to rearrange 
things at short notice, after using the account in question for such a long time.
 
So, to sum up  while Im satisfied that PayPal has acted in-line with the terms and 
conditions of its service  I think the 14 years it took to identify the issue has caused Mr B 
some inconvenience.
 
Our investigator recommended that PayPal pay Mr B £100 in recognition of the 
inconvenience hes now been put to. And, for the reasons Ive set out above, I consider that 
amount of compensation to be a fair and reasonable way of resolving this complaint.
My final decision 
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint, and I require PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA to pay Mr B £100 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 December 2021.
