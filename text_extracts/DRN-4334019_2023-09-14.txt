Complaint
Mr F has complained about loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) 
provided to him. 
He says these loans were unaffordable.
Background
118 118 Money provided Mr F with a first loan for £1,000.00 in June 2020. This loan was 
due to be repaid in 12 monthly instalments of £118.14 but was settled in full in March 2021. 
118 118 Money then provided Mr F with loan 2, for £2,500.00, in October 2021. This loan 
had a 24-month term and had monthly repayments of £181.34.
One of our adjudicators reviewed what Mr F and 118 118 Money had told us. And he thought 
that 118 118 Money hadnt done anything wrong or treated Mr F unfairly. So he didnt 
recommend that Mr Fs complaint be upheld. 
Mr F disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to look at his complaint.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Fs complaint.
Having carefully considered everything, Ive not been persuaded to uphold Mr Fs complaint. 
Ill explain why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this 
means is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mr F could afford to repay before providing this loan. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
118 118 Money provided Mr F with loans for £1,000.00 and £2,500.00 in June 2020 and 
October 2021. These loans were due to be repaid in 12 instalments of £118.14 and 24 
instalments of £181.34 respectively. 
118 118 Money says it agreed to Mr Fs applications after he provided details of his monthly 
income and some information on his expenditure. It says it cross-checked this against 
information on credit searches it carried out and all of this information showed Mr F could 
comfortably afford to make the repayments he was committing to. On the other hand, Mr F 
has said the loans were unaffordable.
Ive carefully thought about what Mr F and 118 118 Money have said. 
The first thing for me to say is that 118 118 Money has provided a record of the results of its 
credit searches. 118 118 Money searches appear to show that Mr F had some existing credit 
commitments but that these were relatively well maintained. 
Furthermore, Mr Fs indebtedness actually decreased in the period between loans 1 and 2. 
Ive also kept in mind that loan 1 was repaid three months early and then it was a further 
seven months before Mr F approached 118 118 Money for loan 2. 
So it wasnt immediately obvious that Mr F might have been taking loan 2 because of the 
effect loan 1 left on him finances. And even if loan 2 ran to term this wouldnt have left Mr F 
owing 118 118 Money for an excessive period. So its difficult for me to say that loan 2 had 
the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness either. 
I accept that Mr Fs actual circumstances may not have been fully reflected either in the 
information he provided, or the other information 118 118 Money obtained. Equally I accept 
that if 118 118 Money had gone into the depth of checks Mr F appears to be saying it should 
have  such as obtaining bank statements in the same way a mortgage provider would  it 
may have reached a different answer. 
But the key here is that 118 118 Money wasnt providing Mr F with a mortgage. It was 
providing loans for relatively small sums over relatively short terms  albeit at high rates of 
interest. Its only fair and reasonable for me to uphold a complaint in circumstances where a 
lender did something wrong. Given the circumstances here, and the lack of obvious 
inconsistencies, I dont think that reasonable and proportionate checks would have extended 
into the level of checks Mr F is suggesting. 
As this is the case, I dont think that 118 118 Money did anything wrong when deciding to 
lend to Mr F - it carried out proportionate checks and reasonably relied on what it found out 
which suggested the repayments were affordable. And the second loan was provided in 
circumstances where Mr Fs indebtedness, at least to it, didnt appear to be increasing 
unsustainably. 
So overall I dont think that 118 118 Money treated Mr F unfairly or unreasonably when 
providing him with him loans. And Im not upholding Mr Fs complaint. I appreciate this will 
be very disappointing for Mr F. But I hope hell understand the reasons for my decision and 
that hell at least feel his concerns have been listened to.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 October 2023.
