The complaint
Miss E complains about the amount that shes been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, for issues with a car that she 
returned when she voluntarily terminated the hire purchase agreement under which the car 
had been supplied to her.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Miss E under a hire purchase agreement with Mercedes-Benz 
Finance that she signed in September 2017. She voluntarily terminated the agreement in 
April 2021 and the car was collected from her by a third party on behalf of Mercedes-Benz 
Finance. The car was inspected and damage was identified but the inspection report says 
that a second inspection was required. 
The car was inspected again six days later and damage and missing items were identified 
and a total charge of £1,057.50 was recommended. Mercedes-Benz Finance charged that 
amount to Miss E but she complained to it about the charges. It said that a second 
inspection was required because the car was wet and dirty at the time of the first inspection, 
the damage hadnt been caused in transit and was outside of its vehicle return standards 
and that £1,057.50 remained payable.
Miss E wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator 
didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He believed that the charges had 
been raised fairly so he said that he wouldnt be asking Mercedes-Benz Finance to do 
anything differently.
Miss E has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that she 
had damage insurance but cant now make a claim for the damage identified on the second 
inspection. She says that if shed known there would be a second inspection and shed be 
charged in excess of £1,000 she might not have handed the car back and might have carried 
out the repairs first (or some it may have been covered by insurance). She proposes splitting 
the amount 50:50 with Mercedes-Benz Finance.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in the hire purchase agreement that Miss E had signed shed agreed that she would 
pay the reasonable expenses incurred by Mercedes-Benz Finance if she breached 
the requirements relating to the condition of the car on return and the agreement 
included the vehicle return standards;
the vehicle return standards say: When it is time to return your vehicle  you must 
return the vehicle in line with the Vehicle Return Standards  When the vehicle is 
returned to us a Vehicle Return Standard Inspection will be carried out by trained 
technicians at the nominated Defleet Centre. The vehicle must be: free from any 
broken or damaged items ; free from any defects or condition that would be in 
breach of statutory requirements; free from accident damage; and in good, clean and 
marketable condition  the standards then explain what would be acceptable and 
unacceptable;
the car was collected from Miss E in April 2021 by a third party on behalf of 
Mercedes-Benz Finance, it inspected the car and a vehicle condition report was 
completed  the cars mileage was recorded as 27,736 miles and the report said that 
it was wet and that a second inspection was required;
the report identified that the interior and exterior of the car were dirty, the compressor 
was missing and that a door was scratched  it also identified that the bonnet was 
scratched but said that the damage was within standard;
a second inspection took place six days later at the third partys inspection compound 
and a second vehicle condition report was completed  it recorded the cars mileage 
as 27,878 (so 142 miles more than when the car was collected from Miss E) and, in 
addition to the issues identified on the first report, the following issues were identified: 
the tyre sealant was missing, the scratch on the bonnet was through the top coat of 
paint, a bumper moulding was dented, the scratched door was also dented and two 
quarter panels were damaged  and the report estimated the total repair cost as 
£1,057.50;
the report includes photos and a video of the car which show the condition of the car 
in which it was returned and I consider that the damage to the bonnet, door, quarter 
panels and bumper moulding was unacceptable damage under the vehicle return 
standards and was more than would reasonably be considered to be fair wear and 
tear;
the report also includes photos showing that the compressor and tyre sealant werent 
where they should have been and I consider it to be more likely than not that they 
werent returned with the car;
the first inspection took place when it was wet, the car was returned in a dirty 
condition and the inspection report said that a second inspection was required - I 
dont consider it to be unreasonable that all of the damage wasnt identified at that 
time and I consider that it was fair and reasonable for the car to be inspected again;
Miss E had agreed to return the car in line with the vehicle return standards and she 
could have had any damage assessed and repaired before she returned the car  
and she could have made a claim under her damage insurance - but she didnt do 
so; 
I dont consider it to be likely that the damage was caused between the two 
inspections and I consider it to be more likely than not that the damage was caused 
during the time that Miss E had the car and drove 27,736 miles in it; 
I consider that its fair and reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Finance to charge Miss E 
for the damage to the car and the missing items and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that it acted incorrectly in its dealings with her about the 
return of the car; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it 
to reduce or waive the amount that its charged Miss E for damage to the car and the 
missing items, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response 
to her complaint.I suggest that Miss E now contacts Mercedes-Benz Finance to either pay it the amount that 
she owes or to agree a payment arrangement for that amount. If she doesnt do so, I 
consider that its likely that it will take further action, to the extent that its legally entitled to do 
so, to recover that amount from her.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Es complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 31 March 2022.
