One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and recognised the large  gap between  
Loans 1 and 2, and took that into account as part of her assessment. She thought that 
Skyline should put things right for Mr B for Loan  6 as proportionate checks  would have led to 
Skyline recognising  the indebtedness  Mr B was in, and that he was not likely to be able to 
afford the loan. Then from Loan  7 his overall  pattern  of borrowing suggested he had become 
persistently reliant  on short-term loans and the pattern of lending itself showed  that the loans 
from Loan 7 were unsustainable.  
Skyline disagreed  and made a number  of points including:
there were gaps between lending
he had one loan at a time
his repayment  history was good
when the loan sum increased the weekly repayment figure increases were  small
its checks were  reasonable and proportionate.
Mr B, through his representative,  has not disagreed  with our adjudicators opinion and so for 
Loans 1 to 5 it seems  that they are not disputed.  So, I have not reviewed those loans. I have 
reviewed the disputed ones which are Loans 6 to 15. 
The complaint remains unresolved and was passed  to me for a decision.  
Ref: DRN85909422my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what I consider  to be 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general 
approach to complaints about  high-cost (including  home credit)  lending - including all of the 
relevant rules, guidance and good  industry practice - on our website. 
I have carefully considered all the arguments,  evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. 
Skyline needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure  that it did not lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Skyline should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include: 
where a customers income  is particularly  low; where the repayments are particularly high;  
and/or where  the frequency of the loans and the length of time over which  a customer  has 
been given loans need to be looked  at: repeated refinancing could signal that the borrowing 
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Skyline was required  to establish whether Mr B could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Financial Conduct  Authoritys  Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defined 
sustainable as being the ability  to repay  without  undue difficulties. 
In particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments, and without having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. And it 
follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have considered the submissions by Skyline after our adjudicators view, but I do not find 
them persuasive. And the checks  I would have considered to have been  proportionate by 
Loan 6 would have been a full financial review before lending again.  And I say this because 
Skyline had been  lending  to Mr B on relatively  modest financial information  for almost a year 
(I do not include Loan 1 here)  and by that time when Mr B required more  credit then it ought 
to have sought more information. I do not think that Skyline did that and so I have looked to 
see what it would have  found out if it had carried out that review. 
I have seen from Mr Bs bank statements for the period that he was a regular user of payday 
lenders taking short-term  loans with them. And for example, in February, March  and 
Ref: DRN85909423April 2015 he had repaid between £400  and £700  to three other  lenders  at least in each of 
those months. Mr Bs personal  credit file shows that he had another loan with another  home-
credit provider around that time too. These  were  in the lead up to the approval of Loan  6. 
I do not think that Mr B was able to afford Loan 6. I uphold  his complaint on it. 
I have looked  at the overall pattern of Skylines lending  history with Mr B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Skyline should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And then Skyline ought to have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think that this point was reached by Loan  7 and 
I say this because:
When Mr B applied  for Loan 7 he already had been borrowing for over a year and 
Loan 7 would have extended his indebtedness for a further  20 weeks;
from Loan 7 onwards  Mr B was provided with a new loan often to refinance the 
previous one. So, Skyline ought  to have  realised it was more likely  than not Mr B was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the earlier loan and to carry on borrowing. I think it 
would have been apparent that his indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably;
Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Skyline.  Loans  14 and 
15 were for £500 each  which were larger than the loans he had taken almost  4 years 
earlier. Mr B had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Skyline 
over an extended period;
at least one earlier loan was refinanced into a later one and I think  more than one. 
I think that Mr B lost out because Skyline  continued to provide borrowing  from Loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit use over an extended period;
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Bs ability  to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these  
high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about  Loans 7 to 15 and Skyline should put things right.
putting things right
Skyline should not have given Mr B loans  6 to 15. I understand  that the outstanding £70 on 
Loan 15 was due to have  been repaid and so this redress section assumes  that has been 
repaid and Mr B has no outstanding loans with Skyline.
 
Skyline should: 
A) add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr B towards interest,  fees and 
charges on Loans  6 to 15, not including anything already refunded;
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr B which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr B originally  made the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled;
Ref: DRN85909424C) Amend Mr Bs credit file to remove any adverse payment information for Loan 6. And the 
overall pattern  of Mr Bs borrowing for Loans  7 to 15 means  any information recorded about  
them is adverse,  so Skyline  should remove these loans entirely from Mr Bs credit file; 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Skyline  to deduct tax from this interest. It needs to give
Mr B a certificate  showing  how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I am upholding Mr Bs complaint in part. Skyline Direct Limited 
should do as I have set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 June  2020.
