The complaint
Mr W complains as he is concerned that The Mortgage Business Plc (TMB) may not have 
calculated the outstanding balance on his mortgage correctly.
What happened
Mr W has an interest only mortgage with TMB. The mortgage is made up of two sub-
accounts with the vast majority of the balance owed under sub-account two.
Mr W has been making overpayments regularly for several years to reduce the outstanding 
capital balance owed. In June 2021, he contacted TMB to query the balance on his 
mortgage. He said hed made overpayments between April 2020 and June 2021 totalling 
£1,500, which ought to have applied to sub-account two, but the balance had not reduced by 
this amount. So, he was concerned it had been calculated incorrectly.
TMB said it felt that the mortgage balance had been calculated correctly. It noted that Mr W 
had taken a payment holiday from May to July 2020, and so had not made the contractual 
repayments in that time. But interest had still been applied during that period. And it felt this 
explained the difference in the mortgage balance to what Mr W was expecting.
Mr W was not satisfied with this explanation so asked our service to consider his complaint. 
One of our Investigators looked into matters but was satisfied that the balance had been 
calculated correctly. And he agreed that the payment holiday explained this.
Mr W asked for his complaint to be reviewed again as he still didnt think the explanation 
provided was sufficient. He also felt we were confusing the interest charged to the mortgage, 
with the capital overpayments.
As Mr W did not agree with the Investigators opinion, the complaint has been passed to me 
to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive been provided annual statements for Mr Ws mortgage going back several years. From 
these I can see that he began making regular monthly overpayments towards the mortgage 
from around February 2016 onwards. The amount of the overpayments varied.
Having reviewed the statements provided, I havent seen anything that leads me to think any 
of the overpayments were applied incorrectly prior to April 2020. The capital balance has 
reduced in line with the amounts paid. So, Im satisfied that TMB has calculated the 
mortgage balance correctly to that point.
I understand that Mr Ws concerns mainly are about how the balance has been calculated 
from April 2020 to June 2021.
Mr Ws annual mortgage statements show that the balance outstanding on his mortgage on 
30 April 2020 was £67,542.49. Between 1 May 2020 and 30 April 2021 Mr W made 
payments, in addition to his monthly direct debit, totalling £1,500. But his mortgage balance 
on 30 April 2021 was shown as £66,784.87. So, it hadnt reduced by £1,500. But I would 
only have expected the mortgage balance to have reduced by the full overpayment amount if 
all of the contractual monthly repayments had been made.
Mr W has said he thinks we are confusing the interest charged with the overpayments made. 
But both are factors in the outstanding mortgage balance. And I must consider both when 
looking at whether TMB has calculated the balance incorrectly.
TMB has said, and the account statements show, that Mr W took a payment holiday from 
May to July 2020. What that meant was that Mr W did not pay the contractual monthly 
repayments during that time. But interest was still charged to the mortgage, in line with the 
mortgage terms.
As Ive said, Mr Ws mortgage is an interest only mortgage. What the means is that the 
contractual monthly repayments are intended to only cover the interest charged to the 
mortgage. Interest charged to the mortgage between 1 May 2020 and 30 April 2021 was 
£3,056.01. And Ive seen nothing to suggest this figure was calculated incorrectly. Due to the 
payment holiday Mr W took, he only paid £2,313.63 of his contractual monthly repayments. 
So, in respect of his contractual repayments he paid £742.38 less than he was required to. 
Mr W did make additional payments totalling £1,500 between 30 April 2020 and 1 May 2021. 
But when you factor in the amount not paid due to the payment holiday, that means the net 
additional amount Mr W paid to the mortgage across the year was £757.62.
Going back to what I said earlier, Mr Ws mortgage statement showed his mortgage balance 
on 30 April 2020 was £67,542.49. The balance shown on 30 April 2021 was £66,784.87. A 
reduction of £757.62  the net amount that Mr W overpaid during that time.
I understand that in May 2021 Mr W made a further overpayment of £50  in addition to 
making his contractual monthly repayment. But from the information Ive been provided, the 
balance of the mortgage has correctly been reduced by that amount.
Taking all of this into account, Im satisfied that TMB has not made an error in its calculation 
of the outstanding balance up to June 2021 either. And I think the information it has provided 
to Mr W about the account balance is correct. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 March 2022.
