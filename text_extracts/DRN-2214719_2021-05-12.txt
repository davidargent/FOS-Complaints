The complaint
Mr C says National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has unfairly used compensation from a 
mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) policy to reduce a debt it says Mr C owes.
Mr C says the compensation should be paid to him directly as the outstanding debt was 
written off by NatWest.
 
What happened
Mr C took out a chain of four loans with NatWest.
Mr C complained to NatWest about PPI sold with the loans. My understanding is that 
NatWest made offers for PPI sold with the first three loans and made payment directly to   
Mr C.
The fourth loan was taken out in 2008 and was for £20,000. A further £6,800.82 was added 
to the loan to fund a single premium PPI policy. So Mr C borrowed a total of £26,800.82. The 
loan was to be repaid over 84 months.
Mr C made only nine full repayments to this loan. In 2012 Mr C began paying £50 a month 
towards the loan. He made seven payments of £50. 
In 2014 NatWest made the commercial decision to write off the loan. There was around 
£26,000 outstanding on the loan.
In June 2020 NatWest used PPI compensation of £11,912.27 from the fourth loan to reduce 
the outstanding amount on the loan.
An adjudicator from this service thought NatWest had acted fairly. Mr C disagreed with the 
adjudicators findings so the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think NatWest has acted fairly and Ill explain why.
NatWest made a commercial decision to write off the debt. This meant it wouldnt pursue 
Mr C for the outstanding debt. But it didnt mean the debt no longer existed.
When NatWest agreed that it had mis-sold the PPI it calculated that it owed Mr C a total of 
£11,912.27. Much of this was the PPI premium it added to the loan and interest the premium 
would attract. 
So NatWest owed Mr C £11,912.27. But Mr C owed NatWest a larger amount. So I think it is 
fair that NatWest used the PPI compensation to reduce the amount owed by Mr C.
It is also worth noting that much of the compensation was made up of the single premium 
PPI that was added to the loan. But Mr C didnt actually repay that part of the loan related to 
the PPI. So if I directed NatWest to pay the compensation directly to Mr C, hed be receiving 
compensation for a PPI premium that he had never actually paid for. And that wouldnt be 
fair.
I note NatWest offered Mr C £50 as compensation for the delay in processing his complaint 
and for being mis-informed during a telephone call that the compensation would be paid 
directly. Ive thought about this and I think thats fair compensation for NatWests errors.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc has 
acted fairly in using the PPI compensation to reduce the outstanding balance on the loan.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 June 2021.
