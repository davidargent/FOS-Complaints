The complaint
Mrs B complains about the way that Lex Autolease Limited had dealt with the transfer of a 
cherished registration number when she returned a car at the end of a hire agreement.
What happened
A car was supplied to Mrs B under a hire agreement with Lex Autolease that she signed in 
March 2018. She changed the cars registration number to a cherished number and, when 
she wanted to return the car in March 2021 at the end of the agreement, she paid £80 to Lex 
Autolease for the registration number to be transferred  but she didnt send it the required 
form. That delayed the transfer taking place and the car being collected from her  which 
didnt happen until June 2021. 
Mrs B complained to Lex Autolease about the delay and the additional hire costs that shed 
been charged. It initially didnt uphold her complaint but then offered to refund £73.48 to her 
for four days rental and to pay her £50 compensation for its poor communication. It then 
said that four days rental was £131.47 which would be credited to her account and it offered 
to pay her an additional £25 for the inconvenience caused. Mrs B didnt accept that offer and 
complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She thought that 
Lex Autolease could have done better but it had offered £75 for its poor service, which she 
thought was fair in the circumstances. She said that it had reduced the rental charge by 
£131.47 and that she couldnt reasonably ask it to do more than it had already done. 
Mrs B has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has responded 
to our investigators recommendation in detail and says, in summary, that: 
she paid £80 to Lex Autolease by bank transfer and the information provided should 
have made it easy to link the payment to the car and for Lex Autolease to have 
advised her that she needed to complete a form but no further correspondence was 
received;
Lex Autolease had that payment until she chased up the transfer six weeks later and 
it then completed the form on her behalf but advised her about a strike at the DVLA;
shes been told that Lex Autolease has received a high volume of complaints about 
this issue and was looking to change its process, which she believes has now been 
implemented; and 
the car was parked for 14 days waiting for collection and she shouldnt have to pay 
rental for that period.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mrs B paid £80 to Lex Autolease in March 2021 for her cherished registration number 
to be transferred but she didnt send it the required form for the transfer to take place;
that delayed the transfer being made and the car being collected  which didnt 
happen until the beginning of June 2021;
I consider that Mrs Bs failure to return the completed form significantly contributed to 
the delay in the car being collected from her;
I consider that Lex Autolease has also contributed to the delay in the car being 
collected from Mrs B and it has accepted that its communication with Mrs B was poor 
(and its offered her a total of £75 compensation for the inconvenience that that 
caused) and it has also credited £131.47 for four days rental to her account;
I consider that Lex Autoleases offer to pay £75 compensation to Mrs B and the credit 
of £131.47 is a fair and reasonable response to Mrs Bs complaint and is fair and 
reasonable compensation for its contribution to the delay in the car being collected; 
Mrs B still had the car and was able to use it until it was collected from her  she 
says that it was parked for 14 days waiting for collection but I consider that its fair 
and reasonable for Lex Autolease to charge her rental for the period that she had the 
car (less the four days rental that it has credited to her account);
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Lex Autolease should 
have done more after it received the payment from Mrs B to arranged the transfer of 
her cherished registration number or that its processes needed to be changed;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances but we have no regulatory or disciplinary role over 
those businesses and Im not normally able to require any of them to change the way 
that it conducts its business; and
I sympathise with Mrs B for the frustration that she clearly feels about the service that 
shes received from Lex Autolease  but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to further reduce, or waive, the 
outstanding rental charges, to pay her any more compensation than the £75 that it 
has already offered to her, or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
If Mrs B now wishes to accept Lex Autoleases offer of £75 compensation, I suggest that she 
contacts it about that payment.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 April 2022.
