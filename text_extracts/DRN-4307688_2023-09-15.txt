The complaint
Mr B complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) blocked his account without 
explanation, told him it was unblocked in error, and closed it.
To put things right, Mr B wants NatWest to pay him compensation for the substantive 
distress and inconvenience its actions have caused.  
What happened
On 29 March 2022, NatWest blocked Mr Bs account and it did so until 2 April 2022. 
NatWest reinstated these restrictions from 24 May 2022 until 30 May 2022 and again from 
23 June 2022 until 5 July 2022. 
In between these dates Mr B withdrew £4,000 on 20 May 2022, then the same amount again 
on 31 May 2022, 7 June 2022, and 14 June 2022. This left around £8,000 in Mr Bs account. 
During the period of the blocks Mr B complained. NatWest sent several responses to Mr B. 
In summary, NatWest said it had restricted Mr Bs accounts in line with the terms of the 
account, and in line with it legal and regulatory obligations. 
NatWest added that it did not have to give Mr B an explanation for its actions. NatWest also 
offered Mr B £100 compensation for erroneously telling him in one of its responses that his 
account was unblocked when it wasnt - Mr B did not accept this. Mr B then referred his 
complaint to this service. 
Mr B explained that he had taken £20,000 from another account to deposit into his NatWest 
one. And he withdrew £10,000 from his NatWest account two weeks later to buy a vehicle. 
After selling the vehicle he wanted to deposit the funds and found his account had been 
frozen. 
Mr B also explained that after receiving NatWests response in May 2022, he received a call 
from the Polices economic crime unit that he was being investigated. He says he arranged 
for two officers to visit him at home the following week, and after a short while of talking to 
them, they were happy to leave. Mr B says they told him they had no reason to investigate 
further.   
On 27 July 2022, NatWest sent Mr B a letter explaining it had decided to close his account 
and that it was giving him two months notice. NatWest said that from 26 September 2022 
the account would be closed, and all facilities related to it would cease. 
Mr B was given access to his account during the period of the notice. As the remaining funds 
werent withdrawn, NatWest sent Mr B a cheque for the closing balance in January 2023. 
Our Investigator looked into Mr Bs complaint. In summary, they found: 
- NatWest hasnt provided enough information to show it acted fairly when blocking, 
and in closing, Mr Bs account 
- NatWest isnt obliged to give Mr B an explanation for closing his account, but they do 
need to share information with this service for us to be satisfied it had good reasons 
to do so 
- Once the account was closed on 27 September 2022, NatWest took too long in 
sending Mr B a cheque for the closing balance
- NatWests actions caused Mr B to suffer stress and inconvenience due to the blocks 
on the account, and unnecessary visits to the branch. So it should pay him £300 for 
this. It should also pay Mr B £100 for the inconvenience of having his account closed 
and for the undue delay in the closing balance being sent to him 
- NatWest should pay 8% simple interest on the closing balance from 
30 September 2022 up until 28 December 2022 
Mr B did not agree with what our Investigator said. He explained the cheque was sent in 
January 2023, NatWest should apologise, pay him £5,000 compensation, and reopen the 
account. 
Mr B also sent our Investigator further information and made several points. Some of the key 
ones are: 
- He was visited by the Police in May 2022 and after asking him some questions about 
his finances, they were satisfied he wouldnt have any issues in the future 
- The letter from NatWest shows he was sent the closing balance in January 2023. He 
had made incremental withdrawals amounting to £16,000 but was refused the 
remaining funds around 21 June 2022
Our Investigator reviewed Mr Bs complaint again. The findings they made were:  
- They now recommend NatWest pay 8% simple interest on the closing balance of 
£8,000 from 30 September 2022 until 10 January 2023 
- Their recommendation of £400 compensation for the distress and inconvenience 
caused is in addition to the £100 NatWest offered. So it should pay him £500 
- They wont be asking NatWest to reopen the account as banks are generally entitled 
to close an account after giving 60 days notice
- Typically banks wont send a letter of apology in these circumstances as it believes it 
acted fairly 
NatWest agreed with what our Investigator said it should do to put things right. But it said it 
would not reopen Mr Bs account, nor consider paying £5,000 compensation. NatWest said it 
apologised for any distress and inconvenience its actions caused.
As Mr B didnt agree, his complaint has now been passed to me to decide.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part. Ill explain why. Im very aware that Ive summarised the events in this complaint in far less detail than the 
parties and Ive done so using my own words. No discourtesy is intended by me in taking 
this approach. Instead, Ive focussed on what I think are the key issues here. Our rules allow 
me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as a free alternative to 
the courts. 
If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored it. Im satisfied I dont 
need to comment on every individual argument to be able to reach what I think is the right 
outcome. I do stress however that Ive considered everything Mr B and NatWest have said 
before reaching my decision. 
Banks in the UK, like NatWest, are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to 
meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to 
restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts. 
NatWest hasnt provided all the information we would expect to see to decide if the 
restrictions it applied were done fairly. Nor has it been able to explain why blocks were 
placed on the account intermittently between March 2022 and July 2022  and why it 
allowed Mr B to withdraw four lots of £4,000 between the blocks being applied. 
Given this lack of information, I cant fairly determine NatWest acted in line with its terms of 
account, and its various obligations when restricting the account. Having said that, I do have 
enough information to be persuaded Mr B wasnt unfairly deprived of his funds during the 
time the blocks were applied. So I dont think NatWest need to pay him 8% simple interest 
during this time.  
I note Mr B feels strongly about his complaint and wants an explanation for why NatWest 
acted the way it did. NatWest is under no obligation to do this, and I cant compel it either to 
do so. 
NatWest is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with it. But 
before it closes an account, NatWest must do so in a way, which complies with the terms 
and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account, which NatWest and Mr B had to comply with, say 
that it could close the account by giving them at least two months notice. And in certain 
circumstances it can close an account immediately or with less notice. 
NatWest hasnt given me the information Id expect it to do so for me to see it applied its 
terms fairly in closing the account. But I do note Mr B was given two months notice, and he 
was told he had access to his funds. Mr B says he last tried to withdraw funds before 
NatWest sent him this letter in late July 2022. So Im not sure why he didnt attempt to gain 
access to them earlier. So I can only assume that he relied on a cheque being sent to him 
when the account would close in late September 2022. 
I also note from the statements Ive seen that Mr B didnt use his account for any regular 
payments or day-to-day banking. He has said he used it as a savings and secondary 
account after he reached the protected limits on his other external main account. So I dont 
think the account being closed caused him substantive distress or inconvenience. 
NatWest say it caused delays in sending Mr B a cheque for the closing balance as it should 
have done so on 30 September 2022, a few days after the closure. I agree NatWest has 
caused an undue delay here. Because of this Mr B has been deprived of his funds for longer 
than he should have. I have seen the copy of NatWests letter the cheque was attached to and note it was dated 
10 January 2023. So I think its fair NatWest pay Mr B 8% simple interest on the closing 
balance from 30 September 2022 up until 10 January 2023. 
Given Mr B wasnt left without banking services, nor is that currently his predicament, Im 
satisfied NatWest doesnt have to reopen his account. Nor do I think it needs to send Mr B a 
letter of apology, though I note its apologised for any distress and inconvenience its actions 
have caused him. 
This brings me onto what I think is fair compensation. NatWest already accept it erroneously 
told Mr B he could access his account when he couldnt. Mr Bs also said he made several 
visits to the branch causing him inconvenience, and that NatWests staff were unhelpful and 
at times rude. 
I havent seen any evidence of the staff being rude, but I accept the visits would have 
caused him inconvenience. I also agree the blocks applied to his account would have 
caused substantive distress. 
Taking this all into account, Im satisfied £500 is fair compensation for the distress, 
inconvenience and embarrassment Mr B says he suffered. I note he thinks NatWest should 
pay £5,000 compensation for the trouble and upset hes had to endure.
But I need to carefully weigh up the impact NatWests actions have had on Mr B against 
what I think its done wrong. Having done that I dont think an award of £5,000 is 
proportionate to what Ive seen.         
Putting things right
To put things right, NatWest must: 
- Pay Mr B 8% simple interest on the closing balance of £8,000 from 30 September 
2022 up until 10 January 2023* 
- Pay Mr B £500 compensation for the distress and inconvenience hes suffered 
*If NatWest considers its required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income tax from that 
interest, it should tell Mr B how much its taken off. It should also give Mr B a tax deduction certificate 
if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint in part. National Westminster Bank Plc must 
now put things right as above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2023.
