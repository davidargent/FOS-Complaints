The complaint
Mr A complains that MotoNovo Finance Limited reported adverse information on his credit 
file.
What happened
In August 2016 Mr A was supplied with a car and entered into a hire purchase agreement 
with MotoNovo.
In May 2017 the car was written off following an accident. MotoNovo removed the finance 
marker from the car in April 2018.
Mr A is unhappy that the car was written off. He doesnt think the damage was serious 
enough for the car to be written off and says that despite having been told that the finance 
agreement had been settled, MotoNovo is reporting it as being in default. 
In response to Mr As complaint, MotoNovo said that following the write off of the car, it 
advised Mr A that because his insurance company had paid the settlement amount directly 
to him, there was still an outstanding balance under his agreement. MotoNovo said it had 
sent a Notice of Default to Mr A in March 2018 and wrote off his account with liability in April 
2018. MotoNovo advised Mr A that the outstanding balance of £2,286.61 hadnt been settled 
by either Mr A or his insurance company.
Mr A wasnt happy with the response and complained to this service. He said hed been told 
by his insurance company that the agreement had been settled. He said the adverse 
information reported on his credit file had affected his ability to obtain a mortgage at a 
favourable rate.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She said that although a settlement payment 
had been made to Mr A by his insurer in May 2017, the finance hadnt been settled. The 
investigator said that based on what shed seen, the account was being accurately reported 
as defaulted.
Mr A didnt agree. He said that the credit reference agencies had reported the account as 
settled for the last two years. He said he never received any letters or emails from MotoNovo 
regarding the outstanding balance.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the finance agreement. This says that if the car is written off by the insurer, all 
sums under the agreement are payable by the consumer.
Theres no dispute that the car was written off in May 2017. I appreciate that Mr A was 
unhappy about the insurers decision to write off the car, but ultimately, when an insurance 
company deems a car to be uneconomical to repair, it can declare the car a write off. In this 
situation, the insurance company will pay the value of the car (the settlement sum) to the 
policy holder (Mr A) and its then the policy holder obligation to settle any outstanding finance 
on the car.
I can see that Mr As insurance company sent the settlement sum of £5,850 to Mr A on 24 
May 2017.
Mr A has said that he was told by his insurance company that his agreement had been 
settled. Hes also said that MotoNovo removed the hire purchase marker on the car and that 
the account was marked as settled on his credit file.
Ive reviewed the information provided by MotoNovo. This shows that MotoNovo wrote to Mr 
A in November 2017 to advise him that it hadnt received a payment from his insurance 
company and asking him to settle his account.
I can see that MotoNovo made several telephone calls to Mr A in November 2017 requesting 
settlement of the agreement. I can also see that MotoNovo made further attempts to call Mr 
A in February and March 2018. In March 2018, Mr As insurance company contacted 
MotoNovo and confirmed that it had paid the settlement sum directly to Mr A. The insurance 
company asked MotoNovo to remove its interest in the car. At this time, the car was still in 
storage. I can see that MotoNovo sent a Notice of Default to Mr A on 21 March 2018. When 
the Notice expired, MotoNovo decided that the car was uneconomical to collect and advised 
Mr As insurance company that the hire purchase marker would be removed.
I can see that MotoNovo continued to send letters to Mr A in 2019, 2020 and 2021 advising 
him that there was an outstanding balance on the account.
Based on what Ive seen, theres no evidence to suggest that Mr As finance agreement was 
steeled by his insurance company. Nor have I seen anything to indicate that MotoNovo 
advised Mr A that the agreement had been settled. Taking everything into account, I dont 
think MotoNovo has done anything wrong by defaulting the account and reporting the default 
to the credit reference agencies.
Ive taken account of what Mr A has said about his credit report showing that the agreement 
was settled in August 2018. The significance of this date is that it is around the same time 
that MotoNovo removed its interest in the car and write off the account with liability. Based 
on what Ive seen, Im satisfied that the account was defaulted by MotoNovo. So, I think its 
likely that the credit refence agencies have reported the data in a way which suggest that the 
account was settled, when instead it was written off with liability, which isnt the same thing.
I understand that Mr A is frustrated about what happened and that he would have preferred 
to keep the car. As Ive explained, the decision to write off the car was made by Mr As 
insurer, so I cant hold MotoNovo responsible for this decision.
Taking everything into account, Im unable to say that MotoNovo has made an error or acted 
unfairly here. I wont be asking MotoNovo to do anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 June 2022.
