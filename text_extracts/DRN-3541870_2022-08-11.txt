The complaint
Ms L complains about various issues accessing her bank account with National Westminster 
Bank Plc and the general service received.
What happened
The background to this complaint is well known to both Ms L, NatWest and generally - not in 
dispute. Therefore, in my decision Ill mainly focus on giving the reasons for reaching the 
outcome I have.
Ms L complained to NatWest in 2020. Since then, theyve issued a number of final response 
letters addressing the various issues shes experienced accessing her account and other 
associated issues with the service shes received from NatWest.
NatWest have told our Service theyve upheld Ms Ls complaints and awarded 
compensation. An additional offer of £75 was made when the complaint was referred to our 
Service.
Our investigator considered the complaint but didnt recommend that NatWest needed to do 
anything further to put things right. As Ms L didnt accept, the complaint has now been 
referred to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear of the experience Ms L has had with NatWest. Although a large number of 
issues have been raised, this decision only addresses those issues I consider to be 
materially relevant to this complaint. This isnt meant as a discourtesy to either party  it 
simply reflects the informal nature of our Service. However, Ive given careful consideration 
to all of the submissions made before arriving at my decision. 
Its also important to state that although a number of final response letters have been issued 
by NatWest, this decision will only consider issues raised as part of those complaints and 
also addressed by NatWest up until November 2020. 
Ive also noted that Ms L requested a further extension to a deadline set by our investigator. 
The deadline set was 31 July 2022. Im satisfied that Ms L has been given fair and adequate 
time to prepare a response. As no further submissions have been received, Ive proceeded 
to consider the complaint for a final decision. The approach Im taking here is in line with the 
relevant DISP rules (3.5.15), under which our Service operates:
 If a complainant fails to comply with a time limit, the Ombudsman may:
(1) proceed with consideration of the complaint;
 NatWest have told our Service:
We issued final response letter on 19th March, 8th and 15th September and 5th 
November 2020. We fully upheld the complaint and awarded £575 compensation 
across all complaints.
Therefore, as its not in dispute that NatWest accept things havent happened as they should 
have, my main consideration is whether the compensation offered and actions taken by 
NatWest go far enough to recognise the impact on Ms L and put things right. 
Its unfortunate that Ms L has had the experience shes told us about. Its positive that 
NatWest accept theyve made errors. Its clear that that some of these errors were 
avoidable. For example, on numerous occasions Ms L has been given factually incorrect 
information and there are instances where NatWest havent followed through and done what 
they promised.
Ms L said she wanted a total of around £1000 as compensation. This was to include 
approximately £500 for travel costs. As NatWest have already offered over £600 (including 
the additional offer of £75 since the complaint came to our Service) and agreed theyd 
consider any supporting evidence of travel costs, I dont find that they need to do anything 
further. 
Its not unreasonable that a business would ask a customer for evidence of their losses/costs 
involved in travelling (for the reasons involved here) and Ive seen no persuasive supporting 
evidence that Ms L has yet provided this information to NatWest. NatWest have told our 
Service that theyll still consider any supporting evidence Ms L can show them. I find this fair 
and reasonable.
I find the compensation offered for overall distress and inconvenience caused to be fair, 
reasonable and proportionate  relative to the impact of their actions on Ms L. Had 
NatWest not made an offer here to put things right, this offer is broadly within the range that I 
would have been directing them to pay for any trouble and upset caused. Ms L should let our 
Service know if she wishes to accept the additional £75 offered by NatWest.
Ive also noted that in her complaint form to our Service, Ms L wanted paper copies of 
account statements to be provided. Our investigator has asked NatWest about this and 
theyve confirmed that Ms L can request this through her mobile app, online banking or by 
calling NatWest customer service. Our investigator has also provided Ms L with a copy of a 
form needed to be completed to add a third party to this account. 
I acknowledge that my decision will disappoint Ms L, but it brings to an end what our Service 
- in trying to informally resolve her dispute with NatWest can do for her.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 September 2022.
