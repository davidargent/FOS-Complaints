The complaint
Mr B says Evergreen Finance London Ltd  trading as MoneyBoat (MoneyBoat) - 
irresponsibly lent to him.                           
Background
This complaint is about four loans MoneyBoat provided to Mr B between April 2017 and      
July 2018.  Mr Bs borrowing history is as follows:

4 02/07/2018 outstanding 4 £400.00 £156.91
The complaint has been reviewed by two of our adjudicators. The first adjudicator didnt 
uphold any of the loans Mr B has complained about. Mr B disagreed and the complaint was 
passed to have a final decision. 
Whilst the complaint was waiting for a decision, it was reviewed by another adjudicator. The 
second adjudicator upheld Mr Bs complaint and thought the loans from loan 1 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the information MoneyBoat had gathered about Mr B 
showed he was having problems managing his money because he had other outstanding 
short-term loans and recent County Court Judgements (CCJs) applied to his credit file when 
he was given the first loan. 
MoneyBoat disagreed and said the debts in relation to the CCJs were from 2012 so not 
relevant. It requested an ombudsmans review of the complaint and it was passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MoneyBoat was required to establish 
whether Mr B could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Having done this, Im upholding Mr Bs 
complaint from loan 1. Ill explain why.
I think MoneyBoat ought to have realised that Mr B wouldnt have been able to make his 
repayments for his loan sustainably without taking out more lending. I can see MoneyBoat 
did credit checks on Mr B before it lent the first loan to him. And I can see that MoneyBoat 
has provided the reports from the credit checks to us. 
Having reviewed all of this, I dont think Mr B was able to repay any of his loans in a 
sustainable manner.  The credit check reports show that Mr B already had several 
outstanding short-term loans, alongside two CCJs which had been applied to his credit file 
from before. This information was apparent each time MoneyBoat did a credit check. So, it 
was aware from the information it has provided, that it was likely Mr B would be unable to 
sustainable repay not just loan 1 but all the loans. 
I think this was a clear indication that Mr B was in a debt cycle and relying upon borrowing to 
repay borrowing. Ive noted MoneyBoats comments that the CCJs were in relation to debts 
from five years earlier, but the application of a CCJ shows that these debts had not been 
managed leading to two of these significant markers being placed on Mr Bs credit file. The CCJs have also not been considered in isolation  Ive also taken into account the fact that 
Mr B had a number of other debts with short-term lenders as well as other credit facilities.  
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 1 to 4 and MoneyBoat should put things 
right.
Putting things right  what MoneyBoat needs to do
If MoneyBoat has sold the outstanding debt MoneyBoat should buy it back if MoneyBoat is 
able to do so and then take the following steps. If MoneyBoat cant buy the debt back, then 
MoneyBoat should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) MoneyBoat should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr B towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything MoneyBoat has already refunded.
B) MoneyBoat should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by    
 Mr B which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr B originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) MoneyBoat should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr B as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr B having made 
overpayments then MoneyBoat should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. MoneyBoat should then refund the amounts calculated in A 
and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr B. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then MoneyBoat should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr B. MoneyBoat 
shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal MoneyBoat has already written-
off.
E) MoneyBoat should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Bs credit file in 
relation to loans 1 to 4. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Bs complaint. Evergreen Finance London 
Ltd should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2020.
