complaint
Mr B complains about the short term loans he took out with Casheuronet UK LLC trading as 
QuickQuid. Mr B says that he couldnt  afford  the loans that QuickQuid approved. So he 
thinks that it lent irresponsibly.
background
Mr B took out 12 loans between April 2015 and April 2017. Some  of the information

Ref: DRN5161016QuickQuid has looked  at Mr Bs complaint and said that it shouldnt  be upheld.  It said that it 
did appropriate checks for all of the lending. And these checks  showed that the loans were 
affordable. So it thought  it was reasonable to lend to Mr B.
Our adjudicator partially  upheld Mr Bs complaint and recommended that QuickQuid refund 
the interest and charges that he paid on loans 5 to 12 and 12a. QuickQuid didnt agree with 
this recommendation  and so the case has come  to me, as an ombudsman, for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were offered.
One of our adjudicators  looked at what Mr B and QuickQuid said. They thought  Mr Bs 
complaint should  be partially upheld. She thought  that it had carried out proportionate 
checks for loans 1 to 4. So she thought that QuickQuids decisions to approve these loans 
were reasonable.
She didnt  think that QuickQuid had made  proportionate checks  for loans 5 to 12. She 
thought if it had then it wouldnt  have agreed  to lend Mr B money  for loans 5 to 12. This is 
because she didnt  think that Mr B could afford to sustainably repay these loans.  And 
QuickQuid wouldve seen  this if it had completed  better checks.
QuickQuid didnt agree  with our adjudicator. It didnt comment  on our adjudicators findings 
about the proportionality of its checks or the affordability of the loans, nor did it provide any 
new information for me to consider. It responded to our adjudication saying:
 In response to FOS assessment which recommends QuickQuid uphold  loans  which 
were funded after March 2015, we regret to inform  you that we cannot  agree to FOS 
recommendations. Please note that in QuickQuid's initial response to FOS we provided 
detailed information  indicating why the loans were responsibly lent to Mr B. Therefore, we 
kindly ask that you move this case to the ombudsman queue  for a final decision. 
QuickQuid first mentioned this argument  in its business submissions to us in which  it said:
. We started  implementing  changes to affordability  assessment  in June 2014 and all the 
changes were completed by 28 February  2015. Starting 01 March  2015, before Mr B 
borrowed his first loan,  QuickQuid had implemented affordability review that is consistent 
with the FCA Handbook  and that was in place at the time we received authorisation by the 
FCA. We confirm  that this assessment was conducted properly and individually for each of 
these loans.
It provided further  detail  about the checks  it had made when it approved loans from 2015 
onwards in a document called CEU  Lending Criteria  and Proportional Checks.  This 
document didnt  have  any personalised information about Mr Bs complaint itself and it didnt 
change our adjudicators  opinion.
This Service has responded to QuickQuid  on this generic argument directly  and through  
earlier final decisions. So I am not going  to address this point here, though  I have considered  
it alongside everything else in making  my decision.
Ref: DRN5161016I would  remind Quick  Quid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly  (my emphasis) by businesses.  In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should 
ensure that lessons learned as a result  of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example  by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals  in the respondent 
who handled  the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  
complaints received by the respondent and using this in training and development of 
the individuals dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  and communicating it to the individuals  dealing  with 
complaints in the respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Bs complaint and what both parties have said 
about this.
Mr B didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 4. Because  of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending.  But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr B had with QuickQuid. 
So they are something  I will take into account  when considering the other  loans he took.
Having reviewed the evidence I have  available, I think QuickQuid  was wrong  to have given
Mr B loans  5 to 12. Ill explain  why.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr B borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in mind 
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit  
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because, as before, I would 
expect Quick Quid to be conversant with these  through  previous ombudsman decisions, 
particularly recent decisions, which set these out in detail.)
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential  risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay  the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance  by carrying out more  detailed checks
 the higher  the loan amount
 the lower the consumers income
 the longer  the lending relationship
QuickQuid says it checked:
 Mr Bs income and expenditure. It recorded his income as being  around £1,800 for 
loans 1 to 3 and £2,300  for loans 4 to 12
 it recorded his expenditure  as being  £1,150 for loans 1 to 3 and then about £650 to
£750 for the remainder
 it looked at credit reference agency  reports to see if the loans were affordable, it 
hasnt provided  any of the information it obtained  when it did this
Ref: DRN5161016 it says it used the information  it had gained from the credit  reports  to adjust the 
amounts Mr B had provided to calculate what it called his monthly  estimated 
disposable income (EDI)  which  is shown on my table above
And based on what it saw from this it thought  it reasonable  to lend to Mr B.
why I dont  think QuickQuids checks were proportionate for loans 5 to 12
For loan 5 Mr B needed to make  three  repayments.  This was his fifth loan that was due to 
last for a month or more,  in just over a year. I can see there  was a break in the lending 
between loans 3 and 4 but I dont think this was long enough for QuickQuid to assume that 
his circumstances  had improved, especially given loan 4 was for more than twice  the amount 
of loan 3. And Mr B went  on to borrow from QuickQuid, for varying amounts, for just over two 
years. The amounts Mr B was starting  to borrow were increasing  by loan 4. So loan 5 was
the second time he had borrowed an increased  amount.
So I think QuickQuid  shouldve  realised  at that time,  that Mr B may have some longer term 
financial problems rather than using  the loans to help with a temporary  cash  flow problem. 
QuickQuid shouldve also become concerned about whether it knew enough about Mr Bs 
true financial  situation.
So before approving loan 5, and for the remainder  of the lending, I think that QuickQuid 
needed to get an accurate  picture of Mr Bs situation. I think In Mr Bs circumstances a 
proportionate check wouldve  included QuickQuid making sure it had fully reviewed his 
finances to get sufficient information  about  all of Mr Bs credit commitments,  living  costs and 
expenditure.
Although I havent seen  the full details of all QuickQuids credit  checks,  it has provided me 
with its estimate of Mr Bs disposable income.  This is lower than deducting Mr Bs declared 
expenditure from his declared income,  for varying  amounts,  for loans 5 to 12. I dont know  
exactly how QuickQuid calculated Mr Bs EDI  but it has said that credit  checks are one 
relevant factor.
Because I dont  know how QuickQuid actually worked out the EDI, I cant  say this reflects  a 
proportionate check. And QuickQuid doesnt seem to have fully reviewed  Mr Bs finances in 
any other way. So I need to think about what its likely proportionate checks wouldve shown 
QuickQuid.
what I think  proportionate checks would most  likely have shown for loans  5 to 12
Mr B has provided some information about his financial circumstances. This includes his 
bank statements and a recent credit  report. I accept  that this isnt exactly  what  QuickQuid 
wouldve seen at the time. But I think it wouldve found out similar  information  if it had made  
proportionate checks, so I think its reasonable to rely on it.
These documents show that Mr Bs income  varied. But on average  it seemed to be slightly  
less, but not far off, the amounts QuickQuid recorded. Mr B has said that his regular monthly  
expenditure was close  to his income. But its difficult to say exactly what  Mr Bs regular 
expenditure was as these transactions arent  always clear  from his bank statements. But I do 
know he paid rent and other regular household bills. I understand he also had some
childcare costs. So its reasonable to say that the amounts QuickQuid recorded for his 
expenditure do seem low particularly for loans  4 to 12.
Ref: DRN5161016His credit  report  shows  he had various  longer term loans, and other credit accounts,  over the 
period he borrowed  from QuickQuid. Hed had problems repaying these in the past. And he 
was borrowing and repaying loans from other short term lenders, although the amounts 
werent usually high and the loans werent regular.
Overall I dont  think its reasonable to say that Mr B would have a large amount  left over from 
his income if his likely regular expenditure was taken into account. But he clearly, would and 
did, usually have some  income left over from his normal outgoings.
But by this stage,  I think its likely  proportionate  checks wouldve also shown QuickQuid  that 
a substantial portion  of Mr Bs income  was going on gambling. He didnt have any spare  
income after this is considered; in fact it seems likely from what Ive seen  that he was 
borrowing to make up the shortfall this was causing.  And I think  that if QuickQuid wouldve 
seen this, it wouldnt have  thought it was responsible  to lend to Mr B because of this.
And its worth noting that, as I mentioned earlier, by loan 5 Mr B had a lending relationship 
with QuickQuid for over a year. This lasted about another  year going forward.  I think this 
pattern of lending  itself suggests  that Mr B wasnt using the loans as intended, that is to 
cover a short term gap in his finances, and QuickQuid shouldve realised this when  Mr B 
asked for his fifth loan. The above  shows that Mr B was developing longer term financial 
problems due to his expenditure  patterns.
I think that QuickQuid wouldve found  out this information if it had made  proportionate  
checks. And I think QuickQuid wouldve  seen  Mr B wouldnt have been  able repay the loans 
in a sustainable way. So I think  that QuickQuid shouldnt have given loans 5 to 12 Mr B and
I think hes lost out as a result of this.
So Im upholding  Mr Bs complaint about  loans 5 to 12.
what QuickQuid  should do to put things right
To put things right for Mr B, QuickQuid  should:
   refund all the interest and charges  applied as a result of loans 5 to 12
   add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above  interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement
   remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Bs credit file about these loans
HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN5161016K821x#15my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly  uphold Mr Bs complaint. Casheuronet UK LLC
should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr B to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 March 2019
