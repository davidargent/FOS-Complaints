Mr W says Elevate Credit International Limited   trading as Sunny - irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 24 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr W between November 
2015 and June 2017. Mr Ws borrowing history is listed  at the end of this decision. The 
balance on loan 22 remains outstanding. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ws complaint  and thought the loans  from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the overall  pattern  of Mr Ws borrowing indicated he was 
reliant on these loans and the borrowing was becoming unsustainable.  Sunny disagreed  but 
offered to uphold the complaint about loans 17 onwards.  This offer was put to Mr W, but he 
rejected it.  
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much  was being lent, the 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN35777322I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. Having done so, I am partially upholding  the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Ws complaint about loans 1 to 5. Mr W hasnt provided any 
further evidence  or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because  they no longer appear  to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point  at which  Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr W had taken out six loans in less in seven months. So, it should  have  
realised it was more likely  than not Mr W was having  to borrow  further to cover  the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ws 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr W was repaying some of his loans early  and while I appreciate  this would  have 
saved him interest, it could equally be the behaviour of someone having to juggle 
their finances to make ends meet. This is one of Mr Ws complaint points, so I think  
this is most likely.
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 24 was 
taken out over 18 months after Mr Ws first. Mr W had paid large  amounts  of interest 
to, in effect; service  a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
Ref: DRN35777323The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 24. 
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debt Sunny should buy it back  if Sunny is able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If Sunny cant buy the debt back,  then Sunny should  liaise  
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made by Mr W towards interest,  
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by 
Mr W which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr W originally made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should  remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr W as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr W having  made 
overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on the outstanding loan. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Mr W. However,  if there is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr W. Sunny shouldnt  
pursue outstanding balances made  up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
E) The overall pattern  of Mr Ws borrowing for loans 6 to 24 means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse, so Sunny  should  remove these loans entirely from Mr Ws credit file. 
Sunny does not have to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Ws credit  file until these 
have been repaid, but Sunny should  still remove any adverse information  recorded about 
these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Elevate Credit International Limited  to take off tax from this 
interest. Elevate Credit  International  Limited must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN35777324Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 May 2020.
