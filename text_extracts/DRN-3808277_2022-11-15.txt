The complaint
Mr and Mrs W complain that GE Money Home Finance Limited has rejected the claims that 
theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in October 2022 in which I described what 
had happened as follows:
Mr and Mrs Ws representative made a claim to GE Money Home Finance in 
January 2018 under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. GE Money Home 
Finance said that there were insufficient particulars of the misrepresentations, there 
was no debtor-creditor-supplier relationship and the claims were time-barred under 
the Limitation Act 1980. Mr and Mrs W werent satisfied with its response so a 
complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator said that their complaint was about GE Money Home Finances 
response to claims made under section 75 and also section 140A of the Consumer 
Credit Act. He said that when the complaint was raised in January 2018, GE Money 
Home Finance was no longer regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority so this 
service cant look at whether it fairly assessed Mr and Mrs Ws section 75 claim. He 
also said that the evidence available didnt appear to support their section 140A claim 
that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs W and the credit provider.
Mr and Mrs Ws representative has provided a detailed response to those 
recommendations in which it set out reasons that it considered that Mr and Mrs W 
had claims under sections 75 and 140A. It says, in summary and amongst other 
things, that it had supplied similar fact evidence showing that other customers had 
had similar experiences to Mr and Mrs W, that the membership was sold as an 
investment, there had been fraudulent misrepresentations by the holiday company 
and it referred to a judgment from an overseas court which commented adversely on 
the company structure of the holiday company.
I have issued a separate decision in which I described why this service doesnt have 
the legal power to consider Mr and Mrs Ws complaint about GE Money Home 
Finances response to their section 75 claim. In this provisional decision Ive set out 
my provisional findings on its response to their section 140A claim.
In my provisional decision I said: I agree with our investigator that this complaint shouldnt 
be upheld but for these:
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Ws section 140A claim in this 
decision as only a court would be able to do that, but Im considering whether or not 
GE Money Home Finances response to the claims that had been made was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Ws then representative sent a complaint letter in January 2018  the 
credit provider had changed its name to GE Money Home Finance by then and I 
consider that the complaint should have been made to GE Money Home Finance 
(and not to the related company to which it was made) and I will deal with the 
complaint as if it was made to GE Money Home Finance;
that complaint letter says that the representative was authorised to make a claim 
under section 75 and the letter described the section 75 claim - there was no 
reference in that letter to a claim under section 140A or the relationship between Mr 
and Mrs W and the credit provider being unfair;
GE Money Home Finance responded to that section 75 claim in April 2018 and there 
was no reference in its response to a claim under section 140A or an unfair 
relationship;
Mr and Mrs Ws representative sent a complaint form to this service which was dated 
in April 2018 (with the same date as the date of GE Money Home Finances 
response) and what it called a position statement and letter of complaint  but it 
was dated October 2017 (about three months before the complaint had been made 
to GE Money Home Finance and six months before the complaint was made to this 
service);
that document referred to an unfair relationship and to section 140A  but no claim 
had been made to GE Money Home Finance that the relationship was unfair under 
section 140A;
our investigator considered whether the relationship was unfair but said that the 
evidence available didnt appear to support the claim that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr and Mrs W and the credit provider;
Mr and Mrs Ws current representative has made detailed additional points in 
response to our investigators recommendations, including about the unfairness of 
the relationship;
I dont consider that a claim under section 140A formed part of Mr and Mrs Ws claim 
to GE Money Home Finance so I find that I cant consider a complaint about its 
response to such a claim in this decision  if Mr and Mrs W want to make a claim to 
GE Money Home Finance under section 140A they should first complain to GE 
Money Home Finance about it and then, if theyre not satisfied with its response, they 
may be able to make a complaint to this service;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
I understand that Mr and Mrs Ws credit agreement ended in August 2013 so they 
would have had six years from then to make a claim under section 140A so, although 
I make no finding on this point, it may be that any such claim is now time-barred 
under the Limitation Act; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs W for the issues that theyve had with their holiday club 
membership and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require GE Money Home Finance 
to refund to them any of the money that they paid under the credit agreement, to pay 
them any compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.Subject to any further representations by any of Mr and Mrs W, their representative and GE 
Money Home Finance, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to uphold this 
complaint. None of them has responded to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As none of Mr and Mrs W, their representative and GE Money Home Finance has 
responded to my provisional decision, I see no reason to change the findings that I set out in 
that provisional decision. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W and Mrs W 
to accept or reject my decision before 13 December 2022.
