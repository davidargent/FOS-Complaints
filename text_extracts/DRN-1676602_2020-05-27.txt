Complaint
Mr A complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called Gain Credit 
LLC, trading at the time as Lending Stream. Mr A says he was lent to irresponsibly and the 
loans caused him financial problems.
To keep things simple Ill refer mainly to Lending Stream throughout this decision.
Background
We now know that Mr A took out some 31 instalment loans from Lending Stream between 
October 2013 and February 2016. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr As borrowing with 
Lending Stream, based on the information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix 
at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought it should be upheld 
for loans 4 - 31. Lending Stream eventually made an offer to settle the dispute which didnt 
include six loans which Ive marked on the appendix. This offer wasnt agreed to by Mr A so 
Ive been asked to make a final decision about the case. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice, on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking about Mr As 
complaint.
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr A could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
Lending Stream should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether Mr A could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loans being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr A could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Lending Stream told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing 
to lend to Mr A including assessing his income, expenditure and creditworthiness. So Ive 
looked at the overall pattern of lending history with a view to seeing if there was a point at 
which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some point, Lending Stream should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans to Mr A. 
Ive taken particular account of what Ive said above, about the length of the lending 
relationship, and applied it to the circumstances of loans 1, 2 and 3 in this case. And I dont 
think its clear enough that what Lending Stream would have seen, from its checks, would 
have suggested these loans were unaffordable for Mr A. I accept that Mr A may have 
already been finding managing money quite difficult at this point. However, theres no clear 
record that the type or depth of credit checks that were carried out at that time would have 
exposed these issues. So Im afraid I dont agree that Lending Stream knew its lending was 
unsustainable. 
I therefore dont uphold this part of the complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan number 4, the situation was different. Mr A applied for 
this loan whilst all 3 other loans were still outstanding and this pushed up his overall monthly 
repayments up quite a bit. I note that Mr As income was relatively low and therefore he was 
in a vulnerable financial situation and hed asked for 4 loans in less than 3 months. 
I think all these factors should have combined to show Mr As financial situation demanded 
much greater scrutiny and clarification. Our experience of short-term lending tells us that 
consumers who have difficulty managing their money are less likely to be able to sustainably 
repay a loan. Given his situation and exposure to all the other debts, I dont think lending Mr 
A any more money was a responsible thing to do. Im therefore upholding this complaint 
from the point of loan 4 onwards.
In addition to the above, from the point of loan 8 onwards, there was also a clear pattern of 
repeated lending evident in my view. Again, loan 8 was advanced to him whilst many other 
loans remained outstanding and there was an obvious dependency on high-interest, short-
term lending evidenced by this, his eighth loan in around 6 months. So Im also upholding Mr 
As complaint in respect of loans 8 - 31 because Lending Stream repeatedly lent to him in an 
unsustainable manner because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period; andthe length of time over which Mr A borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
Putting things right
In order to put things right for Mr A, Lending Stream should:
refund all interest and charges Mr A paid on loans 4 - 31;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information recorded on his credit file in relation to loans 4 - 7.
the number of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 8 - 31 should be completely 
removed from Mr As credit file.
If any of the debts have been sold then Lending Stream must buy back those debts 
or otherwise ensure that the above is strictly complied with.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. It must 
give Mr A a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I partially uphold Mr As complaint and direct Gain Credit LLC to put things right as set out 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 June 2020.
