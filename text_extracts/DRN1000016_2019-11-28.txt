Mr W says Sunny allowed  him to take out multiple  loans when he already owed money  to 
other lenders. He said his debt quickly escalated and the stress  caused health issues.
Sunny says it carried out creditworthiness and affordability checks  and considered  it acted 
responsibly when  it approved  the loans.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She found that by loan 6, 
Mr Ws pattern  of borrowing  suggested  hed become reliant on such lending  and that Sunny 
should have recognised the repayments were  likely  to become unsustainable. She 
recommended that interest and charges (plus 8% statutory  interest) should be refunded  for 
loans 6 to 24 and that those loans should be removed from Mr Ws credit  file.
Sunny responded to say, in summary,  that it did not agree  Mr W was reliant on the lending 
by loan 6. It said that the repayments were  a small proportion of Mr Ws income  and there 
was a break in borrowing between loans  7 and 8. However, it offered to refund loans 18 to 
24 and remove those  loans from Mr Ws credit file. But Mr W did not accept the offer.
Ref: DRN10000162my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mr W and to Sunny on 23 October 2019. I summarise  my 
findings:
I was satisfied that Sunny did enough  checks before approving loans  1 to 3 and the 
information showed the loans were affordable;
I considered Sunny  should have done better  checks  for loans 4 and 5 and, had it 
done so, it was likely to have found  Mr W had at least two other outstanding short-
term loans, as well as the three existing Sunny loans. As this indicated Mr W was 
having problems  managing his money, I didnt  conclude Sunny should  have 
approved loans 4 or 5;
By loan 6 I considered Mr W was developing a reliance on such lending and that 
Sunny should  have  realised further lending was likely to be unsustainable. So I didnt  
think it was responsible for Sunny  to approve  loans 6 and 7;
As there  was a gap in lending between  loans 7 and 8, I didnt consider it was 
unreasonable for Sunny to have considered Mr W was no longer reliant on short-term 
lending. I was satisfied  the checks carried out by Sunny  indicated the loans were 
affordable so I didnt  find it did anything wrong by approving loans 8 to 10;
I considered Sunny  should have asked  for further information before approving loans  
11 and 12, but I didnt  find there was anything to indicate those loans were 
unaffordable;
By loan 13 I found Mr Ws pattern of borrowing itself should have indicated  to Sunny 
that further lending was unsustainable:
oMr W had been borrowing continuously for over ten months and many of the 
loans were overlapping;
oFrom  loan 13 onwards  Mr W was provided with a new loan within weeks of a 
previous one and he often  had multiple loans outstanding at the same time.  
So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr W was having 
to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances and that Mr Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
oMr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 24 
was taken out almost  2 years  after loan 8 (the first in the chain) and it was for 
twice the amount.  Mr W had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect,  
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period;
othese loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by 
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short-term use over an 
extended period  of time;
othe sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on 
Mr Ws ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for 
high-cost loans.
So my provisional decision was to uphold Mr Ws complaint about loans 4 to 7 and loans 13 
to 24.
Ref: DRN10000163Mr W accepted my provisional decision.
Sunny responded to say, in summary  that:
It had assessed  loans 6 and 7 and found them to be affordable:
oMr W had a good repayment history;
oThe repayments were  a small proportion of his disposable income;
oMr W applied  for loan 7 six months after his loan 6 application;
oThe loan amounts were not increasing;
oThere was no indication Mr W was using Sunny loans to finance the 
repayment of previous  Sunny loans;
oThere was no evidence of financial difficulties;
It offered  to uphold  Mr Ws complaint in relation to loans 11 to 24.
Mr W did not accept Sunnys revised offer.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Sunny provided no further  information about  loans 4 and 5, I continue to find they should 
not have been approved because of indications  Mr W was already having  problems 
managing his money.
With regards to loans  6 and 7:
I acknowledge that Mr W had repaid loans 1, 2 and 3 by the time he applied for loan 
6, but the first of these was repaid  on the same day Mr W received loan 5;
Although the repayments were a small proportion of Mr Ws declared  disposable  
income, I consider  Sunny should have been  verifying the information provided at this 
stage in the lending. By loan 6, Mr W still had at least two other short-term loans 
outstanding with other providers along  with his two other  Sunny loans. This does not 
indicate that Mr W could comfortably afford to make  repayments  to further loans;
I accept there was a gap between Mr Ws 6th and 7th applications, but loan 7 was 
taken out just 20 days after Mr W repaid loan 6;
Although loan 6 was no bigger  than loan 1, the scheduled  monthly repayments were  
five times higher  due to the overlapping loans;
With the exception  of the gap in lending between loans 7 and 8, most of the loan 
applications were  taken within days or weeks  of a previous one having  been repaid;
I acknowledge that Sunny  had no evidence of financial difficulties. But had it carried  
out proportionate checks for loan 6, I consider it likely that a full financial review 
would have shown  Mr W did not have the level of disposable income hed declared.
For the above reasons I see no reason to depart from my provisional  decision.
Ref: DRN10000164my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading  as 
Sunny) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr W paid on loans 4 to 7 and loans 13 to 24;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on refunds from payment date to settlement date*;
Remove any negative  information about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Ws credit file;
The number of loans  taken at the point of loans 6 and 7, and from loan 13 onwards, 
means any information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 
and 7 and 13 to 24 should be removed  from Mr Ws credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 December  2019.
