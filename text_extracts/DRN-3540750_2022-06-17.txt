The complaint
Mr B complains that Sabre Insurance Company Limited mishandled his claim on a van
insurance policy.
Where I refer to Sabre, I include vehicle valuers and others insofar as I hold Sabre
responsible for their acts or omissions.
What happened
Mr B had a van first registered in 2005. He is a self-employed tradesman.
For the year from 13 September 2020, Mr B had his van insured on a comprehensive policy
with Sabre. Any claim for accident damage (other than to a windscreen) was subject to a
policy excess of £150.00.
On 10 September 2021, Mr Bs van was parked and unoccupied when a third party hit it and
damaged it.
At first, Mr B got a hire van free of charge to him. Later, Sabre said his van was a total loss.
On about 7 October 2021, Sabre said that the pre-accident value of the van had been
£3,594.00. Mr B asked for a review.
On 14 October 2021, Mr B contacted Sabre about that review. Sabre told him that on 12
October 2021, it had paid him £3,594.00 less £150.00. Sabre said it wouldnt increase that
valuation. Mr B accepted that.
The hire company said it would collect the hire van on 19 October 2021.
Mr B complained to Sabre that the delay in notifying him of the payment had led the hire
company to take back the hire vehicle 5 days rather than having the full 7 days from receipt
of the payment to source and purchase a replacement vehicle.
By a final response dated 20 October 2021, Sabre upheld Mr Bs complaint. It said it was
sending him £20.00 compensation for two days loss of use.
Mr B brought his complaint to us in November 2021. He said Sabre should pay him £600.00
compensation for two days loss of earnings.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. He didnt think
that it would be reasonable to ask Sabre to pay £300.00 per day, because Mr B had re-
booked the relevant jobs. The investigator thought that a payment for inconvenience would
be more appropriate. He recommended that Sabre should pay Mr B £200.00 compensation
for inconvenience.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr B    
and to Sabre on 19 May 2022. I summarise my findings:
Sabres final response offered £20.00 compensation for loss of use. And Sabre 
accepted the investigators recommendation that it should pay £200.00 (before the 
investigator said that this should be in addition to the £20.00).
The balance of £180.00 is somewhat more than I would otherwise have found fair 
and reasonable for the inconvenience that Sabre caused Mr B by depriving him of 2 
out of 7 days notice that he wouldnt have the van after 19 October. Nevertheless I 
found it fair and reasonable to hold Sabre to what it had agreed to pay. 
Subject to any further information from Mr B or from Sabre, my provisional decision was not 
to uphold this complaint in part. I intended to direct Sabre Insurance Company Limited to pay 
Mr B  in addition to the £20.00 it has already paid him  a further £180.00 for distress and 
inconvenience.
Mr B hasnt responded to the provisional decision. 
Sabre agreed with the provisional decision. It says, in summary, that it has already paid Mr B 
the following sums on the following dates:
21 October 2021  £  20.00
17 March 2022  £180.00
22 March 2022  £  20.00
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
From what Mr B has said, it was an accident management company that provided the hire
van to him on credit hire. Ive thought about the period of seven days from the date of
Sabres payment. I think that was the maximum that the accident management company
would allow because it was the maximum that the company would be likely to recover from
the third party.
I dont think Sabre was responsible for providing a hire van  or responsible for the period of
time for which the accident management company provided a credit hire van.
Sabre has accepted that it shouldve told Mr B when it made the payment. Ive thought about
what wouldve happened if Sabre had told Mr B on 12 October, rather than on 14 October
2021. I conclude that the accident management company wouldve wanted its van back on
19 October 2021. So I dont consider that Sabres delay caused Mr B to be without a van on
20 and 21 October 2021.
It follows that I dont consider that Sabres delay caused Mr Bs cancellation of work or his
loss of earnings on those days. So I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Sabre to pay
compensation for loss of earnings.
Nevertheless, I accept that Sabres delay caused Mr B the inconvenience of receiving only 5
days notice (rather than 7 days notice) that the hire van had to go back on 19 October
2021.Sabres final response offered £20.00 compensation for loss of use. And Sabre accepted
the investigators recommendation that it should pay £200.00 (before the investigator said
that this should be in addition to the £20.00). 
In response to the provisional decision, Sabre has said that it paid the £180.00 in mid-March 
and the further £20.00 in late March 2022. Mr B hasnt confirmed or denied such payments.
The total of £220.00 is somewhat more than I would otherwise have found fair and
reasonable for the inconvenience that Sabre caused Mr B by depriving him of 2 out of 7
days notice that he wouldnt have the van after 19 October. Nevertheless I find it fair and
reasonable to hold Sabre to what it has agreed to pay.
So I find it fair and reasonable to direct Sabre to pay Mr B  in addition to the £20.00 it has 
already paid him a further £200.00 for distress and inconvenience (insofar as it hasnt 
already paid him that amount).
Putting things right
The total of £220.00 is somewhat more than I would otherwise have found fair and
reasonable for the inconvenience that Sabre caused Mr B by depriving him of 2 out of 7
days notice that he wouldnt have the van after 19 October. Nevertheless I find it fair and
reasonable to hold Sabre to what it has agreed to pay.
So I find it fair and reasonable to direct Sabre to pay Mr B  in addition to the £20.00 it has 
already paid him a further £200.00 for distress and inconvenience (insofar as it hasnt 
already paid him that amount).
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Sabre Insurance Company Limited to pay Mr B  in addition to the £20.00 it has 
already paid him  a further £200.00 for distress and inconvenience (insofar as it hasnt 
already paid him that amount).
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2022.
