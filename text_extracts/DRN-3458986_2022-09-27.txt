The complaint
Mr K complains that National Westminster Bank Plc applied a payment towards an overdraft 
rather than a secured loan. 
What happened
In 2019, Mr K was a director and shareholder of a limited company I will call E. E had an 
overdraft on its NatWest bank account, and it also had a secured loan from NatWest.
NatWest told us:
In October 2019, Mr K signed a deed personally guaranteeing all of Es obligations, 
up to a limit of £118,840. 
It had further security for Es borrowing, in the form of a second charge on the 
residential property Mr K owned in joint names with his wife, and a second charge on 
a rental property Mr K owned in his sole name.
By June 2020, E had stopped trading and was unable to meet its obligations. E was 
ultimately dissolved  without fully repaying either its overdraft or its secured loan.
Mr K later sold the rental property held in his own name, and it applied the proceeds 
of around £107,000 to Es debt. The result was that Es overdraft was fully repaid, 
and a loan balance of around £34,000 remained. That balance was secured by a 
combination of Mr Ks personal guarantee and the charge on Mr and Mrs Ks 
residential property. 
It is satisfied that it didnt make any errors in allocating the funds it received. 
Mr K told us:
His primary concern is preserving his wifes position. Whilst she agreed that NatWest 
could take a charge over her marital home, she did not sign a personal guarantee for 
all of Es borrowing.
He accepts that NatWest was entitled to use the proceeds of the rental property sale 
towards Es debt. However, he considers that NatWest should have first used that 
money to repay Es secured loan, before making any reduction to the overdraft.
To resolve the complaint, he would like NatWest to apply the proceeds of the rental 
property sale to Es loan, restore Es overdraft balance, and remove interest and 
charges from both accounts.
One of our investigators looked at Mr Ks complaint, but he did not uphold it. He said:
The documents Mr K signed gave NatWest had the right to choose how to allocate 
the funds it received from the sale of Mr Ks rental property.
He saw nothing unfair about the way in which NatWest had chosen to exercise its 
commercial discretion.
He was satisfied that NatWest was charging interest correctly and in accordance with 
the original terms and conditions, and he saw no basis on which he could ask 
NatWest to waive any interest.
Mr K did not accept our investigators findings, so the matter was referred to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to further disappoint Mr K, but Ive come to the same overall conclusions as our 
investigator. I think NatWest treated him fairly, and so Im not going to tell it to pay him 
compensation.
Its clear that Mr K has been through an extremely tough time, and his financial difficulties 
were exacerbated by the pandemic. But I dont think NatWest has done anything wrong 
here. I can see why Mr K would have preferred NatWest to allocate the sale proceeds of the 
rental property to Es loan rather than its overdraft, but I think our investigator was right to 
say that NatWest was entitled to choose how those funds should be applied.
I appreciate that there is a dispute about whether NatWest told Mr K that his wife had given 
a personal guarantee in respect of Es borrowing. Mr K has suggested that he would not 
have sold the rental property if hed realised that his wife had not given a personal 
guarantee. However, given what Mr K has said about his finances, I do not see that he had 
any realistic alternative to selling the rental property  regardless of what NatWest may or 
may not have told him about his wifes position. In any event, I dont think Mr Ks 
disagreement with NatWest about his wifes position makes any difference to whether 
NatWest was entitled to apply the proceeds of the sale of the rental property to Es overdraft. 
If he has not already done so, Mr K may wish to approach an organisation like StepChange 
or Citizens Advice for free debt advice.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about National Westminster Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 October 2022.
