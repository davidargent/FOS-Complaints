K820x#14Complaint
Mr S complains that NewDay Ltd recorded multiple  defaults against him without notice and 
without helping him in light of his circumstances. Mr S also complains that NewDay failed to 
respond to some of his letters  including his subject access request. 
 
Background
Mr S had a House of Fraser credit card account  with NewDay. Towards the end of 2015 
Mr Ss account was passed  to collections due to arrears. Mr S told NewDay  that his 
employment had ended,  and this led to a refund of payment protection insurance (PPI) 
premiums being credited  to his account  in February 2016.
 
NewDay sent several notice of arrears letters to Mr S. In May 2016 a default  notice was sent 
to Mr S and the default was subsequently  recorded in June 2016. 
Mr S says that NewDay failed to respond to some  of his letters. He has specifically 
complained about how long it took for NewDay to respond to his subject access  request  and 
says it ignored some  of his letters.
NewDay says it sent Mr S the information  hed asked for within the appropriate  timeframe. 
But it acknowledged its delay  in responding to Mr Ss concerns about  his default and 
credited his account with £70 as a gesture  of goodwill.
Our investigator found that NewDay hadnt done  anything wrong in recording the default and 
so did not uphold this complaint. He originally said that we could not consider Mr Ss 
complaint about  the delayed subject access request as this is a matter for the Information  
Commissioners Office  (ICO). But, has since shared his findings  with Mr S by explaining he 
has not upheld  this part of the complaint  either because he cant  say any possible delay has 
significantly impacted  Mr S.
Mr S does not agree with the investigators conclusions as he is not satisfied with how 
NewDay and the insurance provider have  handled the whole situation. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I can only consider the complaint about 
NewDay in my decision. I appreciate Mr S also has concerns  about  the insurance  provider. 
But, complaints about  different businesses need  to be considered separately.
 
From everything Ive seen  I agree that NewDay acted  fairly  and in line with the relevant rules 
and regulations when managing the arrears on Mr Ss account.  Im satisfied with the steps
NewDay took to try and help Mr S when it became aware of his financial circumstances and 
based on how the account  was being managed, acted accordingly  by entering a default on 
the account.
When Mr Ss account was passed to collections, some contact took place between both 
parties and NewDay  acted appropriately by sending Mr S an income and expenditure  (I&E) 
form to complete towards the end of January 2016.  This was so it could consider the option 
of reduced payments, charges  and interest.  In the meantime a temporary  hold was placed 
on the account. NewDay sent Mr S a further  I&E form in April 2016 as it had not yet received 
Ref: DRN96023692a completed form from him. A reduced monthly payment of £10 was subsequently agreed in 
August 2016.  
The ICO says when  a consumer is at least three months behind  with their payments  then a 
default may be registered. And it would expect  a default to be registered by the time the 
consumer is six months  behind with their payments.  
NewDay sent Mr S regular notice of sums  in arrears letters detailing the overdue payments. 
These letters were sent in relation  to the amounts due from late 2015  to June 2016. The 
letters asked  Mr S to bring  his account up to date.  They also included an information sheet 
offering advice about arrears and details of free and confidential debt advice organisations. 
I cant see that Mr S made any payments towards  his account from January 2016. NewDay 
sent Mr S a default  notice in May 2016 and the account was recorded as defaulted in      
June 2016. 
NewDay allowed Mr S six months before applying the default.  This allowed time for Mr Ss 
circumstances to improve. NewDay acted  positively and sympathetically to his situation by 
freezing all interest and charges in the meantime.
I appreciate that a PPI refund was credited to Mr Ss account during this period,  but this did 
not affect the outstanding  arrears. Mr S still needed  to make his contractual  payments and 
because he didnt do this the arrears on his account continued to increase. 
Mr S has queried the number of defaults recorded on his credit file. Im satisfied that only 
one default was recorded in June 2016.  Lenders  are under a duty to accurately report  
information to credit reference agencies. So, I cant say that NewDay  has done anything 
wrong here and wont be asking it to do anything.
NewDay agreed to accept a reduced  settlement from Mr S that he has recently paid. 
Therefore the default should  be marked as partially  satisfied. But, the default will remain on 
Mr Ss credit  file for a period of six years from the date it was registered. Our investigator has 
explained the steps for entering  a notice of correction if Mr S wishes  to do so.
Mr S says that he wrote to NewDay on three  occasions in October 2018, November 2018  
and February 2019 to submit a subject access request  and it took months for NewDay to 
respond. NewDay says that it only received the letter Mr S sent in February 2019 and it 
supplied him with the relevant information in March 2019. Mr S has provided  us with copies 
of some of the letters sent but has not provided  us with proof of postage. I cant  be certain  
whether the earlier  letters  were  received  by NewDay or not. So, Ive thought about what  
impact, if any this has had on Mr S.  
Mr S says that he submitted a subject  access  request to help him reverse  the default that he 
feels was wrongly recorded against him. As Ive explained above Ive found  that NewDay  
acted fairly  when recording the default. I appreciate Mr Ss frustration but even if NewDay 
had done something wrong, meaning  the subject access  request  should have been actioned 
sooner, this would  have  no impact on altering the default in any way.  
My final decision
For the reasons  above I am not upholding this complaint.
Ref: DRN96023693Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 October  2019.
