The complaint
Mr M says FUND OURSELVES LIMITED (trading as WeLendUs) irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
This complaint is about four instalment loans WeLendUs provided to Mr M between 
November 2018 and March 2019. Mr Ms borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date 
TakenDate 
RepaidInstalments Amount Repayment
1 23/11/2018 31/12/2018 4 50 22.20
2 31/12/2018 16/01/2019 4 500 245.28
3 19/01/2019 28/03/2019 4 100 48.20
4 31/03/2019 26/07/2019 4 300 145.20
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint and thought WeLendUss checks for the 
loans went far enough. Mr M disagreed and said his other complaints with the same 
circumstances had been upheld. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
WeLendUs needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that WeLendUs should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint. Having done this, Im not upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Mr M disagreed with the adjudicators view because hed had other complaints  with similar 
circumstances  upheld. 
Firstly, I think its important that I explain when we investigate a complaint, we look at it on its 
individual merits. So, I have only considered what has happened with Mr Ms loans with 
WeLendUs. 
WeLendUs has told this service about the checks it carried out before approving any of the 
borrowing. It has said it asked Mr M about his employment status and he confirmed he was 
employed and had a monthly income of between £1,743 and £1,801. WeLendUs also 
checked Mr Ms normal monthly living costs. Mr M declared these to be between £1,225 and 
£1,325 per month. WeLendUs says it also searched Mr Ms credit file. Ive seen a copy of 
those results and there werent any recent adverse entries like defaults, county court 
judgements (CCJs) or excessive borrowing from short-term lenders recorded on it at the 
time each of the loans were taken out. So, there wasnt anything in the results of the checks 
that ought to have prompted WeLendUs to ask for more information from Mr M. 
Mr Ms history of borrowing with this lender was relatively early on  he only borrowed from 
WeLendUs four times over a four-month period. And even though he had to make four 
monthly repayments, the highest repayment would have appeared affordable based on the 
information he declared to WeLendUs. And there wasnt anything in the information Mr M 
provided which would have given WeLendUs cause for concern, so I think it was reasonable 
of WeLendUs to have relied on what Mr M told it. 
I think the time Mr M had been indebted to WeLendUs and the information hed provided to it 
had an impact of what level of checks would have been appropriate for WeLendUs to carry 
out. Given these, I think the checks WeLendUs carried out before lending the loan went far 
enough and I wouldnt have expected it at this stage to undertake any more in-depth checks. The information Mr M declared to WeLendUs at the time of the loans may not have been an 
accurate reflection of his financial circumstances, but I think WeLendUs was entitled to rely 
on that information. At this stage of the lending relationship, and what WeLendUs knew 
about Mr M, I wouldnt have expected WeLendUs to verify the information Mr M gave it. This 
therefore means, I cant say that its done something wrong in lending Mr M these loans.
Ive noted Mr M borrowed new loans within a few days  and on one occasion on the same 
day  of repaying a previous one. Looking at this behaviour in isolation, it could be argued 
that a pattern was beginning to emerge which might suggest Mr M was struggling to repay 
the loans sustainably. But loan 3 was for a lesser amount than loan 2 and although Mr M 
borrowed a larger amount for loan 4, it was still less than loan 2. And Mr M didnt borrow 
from WeLendUs again after he had repaid this loan. So, I cant say WeLendUs was wrong to 
have provided these loans.  
I appreciate that my findings are likely to disappoint Mr M, but I hope my explanation will 
help him understand why Ive reached this conclusion.
My final decision
I do not uphold Mr Ms complaint and make no award against FUND OURSELVES LIMITED.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2020.
