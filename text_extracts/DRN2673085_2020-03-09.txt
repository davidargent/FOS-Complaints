K821x#15complaint
Mrs B says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to her.
background
This complaint is about eight loans Sunny provided  to Mrs B between August 2017  and 
February 2018. Mrs Bs borrowing history  based  on what Sunny  provided is as follows:
Loan Date  Taken Date  Repaid Instalments Amount Highest  
Repayment
1 05/08/2017 30/08/2017 6 £200.00 £59.34
2 08/08/2017 01/09/2017 6 £300.00 £146.42*
3 21/08/2017 31/08/2017 6 £200.00 £211.97*
4 23/08/2017 30/08/2017 6 £150.00 £260.49*
5 15/09/2017 02/10/2017 6 £500.00 £166.67
6 25/09/2017 02/10/2017 6 £150.00 £213.91*
7 12/01/2018 22/05/2018 6 £700.00 £233.33
8 26/02/2018 16/03/2018 6 £50.00 £248.87*
*This figure  denotes the highest  combined monthly  payment that Mrs B would be
charged as she already  had existing loan payments due from Sunny. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mrs Bs complaint and thought loans 4 to 8 should not have been  
given. Sunny didnt  agree  in full  it made  an offer for loans 4 and 8 only.  The complaint has 
now been passed to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN26730852the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs B could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Bs complaint.
Mrs B hasnt disagreed  with our adjudicators opinion on loans  1 to 3 so I wont  be looking at 
these any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Mrs Bs other lending. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided. Having 
looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs B, I think that Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that Mrs B was unlikely  to have been  able to make her payments in a 
sustainable manner  by the time it provided loan 4. 
I say this because  by this stage, Mrs B had already taken out three loans with Sunny and all 
within two weeks. So Mrs B already had an outstanding balance  on existing loans with 
Sunny. As well as this, Mrs B was paying  for at least two other short-term loans with other 
lenders. Im not persuaded that the loan repayments being  less than a certain percentage of 
Mrs Bs income or the fact that Mrs B didnt  say that she was having financial  difficulty  
means that these loans  were sustainable.
So, in these circumstances,  Sunny  ought to have realised it was unlikely Mrs B would have 
been able to sustainably repay loan 4  and any subsequent loans. Sunny continued lending 
to Mrs B even when this pattern was repeated and in circumstances where  it ought 
reasonably to have  realised that any further  loans were more likely than not unsustainable 
for her. 
Mrs B had to pay interest and charges on loans that Sunny  shouldnt  have provided her with. 
So I think that she lost out and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Ref: DRN26730853refund  all interest and charges Mrs B paid on loans 4 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 4 to 8 from Mrs Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs B a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Mrs Bs individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) practitioner may have an interest  in any 
award and Mrs B will be aware of her obligations under that arrangement.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Bs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 April 2020.
