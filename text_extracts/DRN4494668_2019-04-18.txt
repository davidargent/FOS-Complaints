K821x#15complaint
Mr O complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as Quick Quid) irresponsibly lent to him. 
He wants compensation  and to be put back in the position he would have been in without 
the loans.
background
This complaint is about eight payday  loans Quick Quid provided  to Mr O between May 2012  
and May 2017.  Mr Os lending history  is as follows:
Loan 1, 11 May 2012 for £250 (£343.74 with interest)  to be repaid in two periods with the 
largest expected  repayment being £312.50.  Repaid on 6 July 2012.
Loan 2, 6 July 2012  for £350 (£525 with interest) to be repaid in two periods with the largest 
expected repayment being £437.50. Repaid early on 30 July 2012.
Loan 3, 31 March 2014 for £200 (£300  with interest) to be repaid in two periods with the 
largest expected  repayment being £250. Repaid on 27 June 2014.
Loan 4, 18 August 2014 for £100 (£125 with interest) to be repaid in one period. Repaid on 
29 August 2014.  
Loan 5, 15 September 2014 for £100  topped up with a further £125 (£337.50 with interest) to 
be repaid in two periods with the largest  expected  repayment being £281.25. Repaid on 29 
October 2014. 
Loan 6, 25 November 2015  for £650 (£800.80  with interest) to be repaid in one period.  
Repaid early on 1 December 2015.  
Loan 7, 14 December 2015  for £700 (£952  with interest)  to be repaid in one period. Repaid 
on 1 March 2016. 
Loan 8, 10 May 2017 for £350 (£492.80 with interest)  to be repaid in two periods with the 
largest expected  repayment being £436.80.  Repaid on 31 July 2017. 
Mr O repaid all his loans. Our adjudicator upheld Mr Os complaint and thought loans  two, 
six and seven shouldnt  have been  given.  Quick Quid disagreed and the complaint was 
passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Quick Quid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr O 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
Ref: DRN44946682These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Quick Quid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Quick Quid was required to establish 
whether Mr O could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Os complaint.
I can see that there were  significant gaps in Mr Os borrowing from Quick Quid between 
loans two and three,  five and six and seven and eight. So I think it would be reasonable for 
Quick Quid to think that Mr Os finances  had moved on between  these periods and conduct 
the affordability checks that were proportionate  to the start of new chains of borrowing. 
Quick Quid asked Mr O for information about his income and expenditure and it carried out 
credit checks. Given the loan amounts,  what was apparent about Mr Os circumstances at 
the time and his history with Quick Quid, I dont think it wouldve been  proportionate to ask 
him for the amount of information needed  to show the lending  was unsustainable. There  
wasnt anything in the information  Mr O provided or the information Quick  Quid  shouldve  
been aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying  what  Mr O was 
saying. 
Ref: DRN44946683But, as our adjudicator  has explained, a proportionate check for loans two, six and seven  
would most  likely have  shown that the loan repayments represented  a significant proportion 
of Mr Os income.
Loan twos largest  expected repayment was £437.50. Mr O had told Quick  Quid  that his 
monthly income after tax was £920. For loan six, the largest  expected repayment was 
£800.80 from a stated income  of £1,300. And for loan seven, Mr O was expected to repay 
£952 from his monthly  income of £1,300. 
So I think the repayments of loans two, six and seven represented a significant proportion of 
Mr Os income.  In these circumstances, I think there was a significant  risk that Mr O wouldnt 
be able to meet his existing commitments without having to borrow  again. So I think its 
unlikely that Mr O wouldve been  able to sustainably  meet his repayments for these  loans. 
And so I think it was wrong  for Quick  Quid to approve these three loans.
putting things right  what Quick Quid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans two, six and seven;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans two, six and seven from Mr Os credit 
file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. Quick Quid 
must give Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Os 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid) should pay Mr O compensation as 
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 May 2019.
