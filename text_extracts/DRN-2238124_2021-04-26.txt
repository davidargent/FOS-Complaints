The complaint
Miss J complains that a hire purchase agreement with FirstRand Bank Limited, trading as 
MotoNovo Finance, under which a van was supplied to her, was mis-sold to her and about 
issues with the van.
What happened
A used van was supplied to Miss J under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo 
Finance that she electronically signed in April 2017. She complained to MotoNovo Finance 
in January 2018 about some issues with the van but it says that it was unable to contact her 
so her complaint was closed. She contacted it again in May 2018 about her complaint but it 
said that it needed more information to be able to re-open her complaint. She complained to 
it in January 2020 about issues with the van and the hire purchase agreement  but it didnt 
uphold her complaint.
Miss J wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She considered each of the seven issues 
about which Miss J had complained but thought that MotoNovo Finance did what it should 
have done.
Miss J has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that that 
there was no pre-contact or formal sales agreement at the point of sale, MotoNovo Finance 
refused to carry out legal works resulting in unsafe road use as she was unable to exit the 
van due to a faulty door handle and about the way that she was dealt with by the dealer. She 
has explained why there was a delay in her complaint being made and has described in 
detail the difficulties that shes experienced.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
MotoNovo Finance, as the supplier of the van, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss J - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the van and the price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the van must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the van that was supplied to Miss J was more than three years old, had been driven 
for 35,608 miles and had a price of £8,994;
MotoNovo Finance has provided copies of the hire purchase agreement and pre-
contract credit information that were electronically signed by Miss J  those 
documents show that Miss J had agreed to make 59 monthly payments of £167.32 
and a final payment of £326.32 for the van to be supplied to her;
by signing the hire purchase agreement Miss J had agreed to the terms that it 
contained and Ive seen no evidence to support Miss Js claim that an agreement had 
been made for her to make monthly payments of £140;
Miss J says that the dealer had agreed to provide the van with a fuel tank of fuel and 
its service history but that neither was provided to her  but MotoNovo Finance says 
that the dealer paid her £60 for the tank of fuel and provided her with evidence of the 
cars service history;
theres no written record of what was agreed by Miss J and the dealer about the fuel 
and service history but I consider that the dealer paying her £60 for a tank of fuel and 
providing her with evidence of the vans service history was fair and reasonable and 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the dealer acted 
incorrectly in connection with the vans service history, MOT test history or warranty; 
Miss J has complained about some issues with the van but the dealer says that it 
replaced a door handle that had broken in June 2017, Im unable to consider any 
issues about which she hasnt complained to MotoNovo Finance and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the van wasnt of satisfactory 
quality when it was supplied to her;
Miss J has also complained about the way that she was dealt with by the dealer  but 
I cant consider her complaint about the dealers customer service as thats not within 
the jurisdiction of this service;
I sympathise with Miss J for the difficulties that shes experienced but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the hire purchase agreement 
was mis-sold to her or that MotoNovo Finance has acted incorrectly in these 
circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require MotoNovo Finance to 
allow Miss J to reject the van, to refund to her any of the money that shes paid for it, 
to pay her any other compensation or to take any other action in response to her 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Js complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 May 2021.
