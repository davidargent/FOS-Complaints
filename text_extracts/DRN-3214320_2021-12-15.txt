The complaint
Mr B is unhappy with the standard of service he received from NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua,
following him informing them that he had mental health issues and that he was struggling
financially, including that NewDay recorded a default on his credit file.  
What happened
Mr B had a NewDay account that was in arrears. In January 2020, Mr B called NewDay and
advised that he was suffering with mental health issues and was struggling financially.
In February 2020, Mr B called NewDay again and explained that he was now able to make
payments on the account. However, Mr B was told at that time that his account had been
passed to a debt collection company. Mr B wasnt happy about this, so he raised a
complaint.
NewDay looked at Mr Bs complaint, but they felt that theyd followed the correct process
following Mr B not making payments to the account, so they didnt uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Mr B wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, especially as a default was later reported by
NewDay to Mr Bs credit file in relation to this account, so he referred his complaint to this
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also felt that NewDay
hadnt done wrong either in how theyd managed Mr Bs account or in how theyd recorded a
default on his credit file. So, they also didnt uphold this complaint.
Mr B remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final
decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 12 November 2021 as follows:
Its evident that Mr B did call NewDay in January 2020 and did inform them
at that time that he was struggling with mental health issues and struggling 
financially. In such circumstances, what this service would expect would be that 
NewDay would react positively toward Mr B and offer appropriate forbearance.
NewDay appear to have done that here. They placed a 30-day breathing space hold 
on collections activities to enable Mr B to either rectify his position or to contact 
NewDays Customer Care Team. And NewDay tried to contact Mr B by telephone 
shortly afterwards, and then sent a letter to Mr B when the attempted telephone 
contact was unsuccessful which invited Mr B to contact their Customer Care Team 
who could help arrange a suitable repayment plan if necessary.
Mr B did contact NewDay again on 7 February 2020, and NewDays system notes 
record that Mr B advised that he was able to make payments towards the account 
once again. NewDays system notes also record that a six-month payment plan was 
agreed at that time and that Mr B made the first payment against this plan.
Additionally, NewDay have also provided this service with a copy of the letter sent to 
Mr B on this date, which confirms that a payment plan had been set up, and which 
also states that one potential consequence of Mr B not making the payments 
required by this plan would be that his account could be passed to a debt collection 
company.
Mr B didnt make any further payments required by the payment plan. However, Mr B 
did call NewDay again on 11 March 2020  which was after the second scheduled 
payment due date on 7 March 2020 had been missed  and explained to NewDay 
that he had missed the scheduled payment because of mental health issues he was 
struggling with.
NewDay later terminated the six-month payment plan. And I can understand why 
they would have done this, given that the agreed payments hadnt been made. But 
NewDay also then proceeded to transfer Mr Bs account to a debt collection 
company, and I dont feel that it was reasonable for them to have taken this step, 
given that Mr B had advised them of his continuing mental health issues and the 
distress that the transfer of an account to a debt collection company can cause.
The account was later recalled from the debt collection company, and so Im satisfied 
that the appropriate corrective action has already been taken. However, Mr B 
continued to not make payments towards the account, and on 31 July 2020 NewDay 
recorded a default on Mr Bs credit file as a result of this.
While I appreciate that Mr B will disagree, NewDays recording of this default feels 
fair to me, and I note that NewDay had previously sent a default notice to Mr B, dated 
31 January 2020, advising Mr B that his account was at risk of being defaulted for 
non-payment. And while Mr B did enter into a payment arrangement in February 
2020, he didnt meet the terms of that arrangement and didnt make any alternative 
payments towards the account.
And, while I acknowledge that Mr B informed NewDay that he was struggling with 
mental health issues, it doesnt follow from this that NewDay shouldnt make accurate 
reports to the credit reference agencies about the ongoing arrears status of the 
account, or that they shouldnt have defaulted this account when the arrears on the 
account grew to a level where a default was warranted  as was the case in this 
instance.
All of which means that, while Im satisfied that NewDay didnt act unfairly or 
unreasonably in how they managed the arrears on Mr Bs account, including the 
default that NewDay recorded in regard to this account, I do feel that the information 
that Mr B gave to NewDay about his mental health issues meant that it wasnt 
reasonable for NewDay to have transferred Mr Bs account to a debt collection 
company when they did. And I feel that Mr B incurred an amount of distress as a 
result of this.
It follows then that Ill be provisionally upholding this complaint in Mr Bs favour as it 
relates to the passing of his account to a debt collection company only, and Ill be 
provisionally instructing NewDay to make a compensation payment of £100 to Mr B 
because of this.I also note that NewDays 7 February 2020 letter to Mr B, which confirmed the 
payment arrangement agreed at that time, confirmed that no charges would be 
applied to the account during the payment arrangement period, but that £36 of 
charges was applied on the March 2020 statement, including a charge dated for 
February, shortly after the payment plan was set up. As such, my provisional 
instruction will also be that NewDay should reimburse these £36 of charges to Mr Bs 
account.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr B and NewDay the opportunity to provide 
any comments or further information that they might wish me to consider before I moved to a 
final decision. Neither Mr B or NewDay provided any further submissions to this service, and 
so I see no reason not to issue a final decision upholding this complaint in Mr Bs favour on 
the basis described above.
  
Putting things right
NewDay must make a payment of £100 to Mr B to compensate him for the trouble and upset 
he incurred because of NewDay transferring his account to a debt collection company. This 
payment must not take the form of a credit to Mr Bs NewDay account unless Mr B gives his 
permission for it to do so.
NewDay must also reimburse £36 of charges to Mr Bs NewDay account.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, on the 
basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 January 2022.
