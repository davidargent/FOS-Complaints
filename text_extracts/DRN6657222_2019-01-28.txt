K820x#14complaint
Mr M and Mrs B complain about National  Westminster Bank  Plcs  decision to review and 
subsequently close their accounts.  They say this left them  with no access  to money and 
caused considerable stress.
background
Mr M and Mrs B held a number of accounts with NatWest, including a loan in Mr Ms name.
In early July 2018,  NatWest carried out a review  of Mr M and Mrs Bs current  accounts. 
While they carried out their review, the accounts were blocked  so Mr M and Mrs B couldnt  
use them.
Around a week  later, NatWest had completed their review and Mr M and Mrs B had full 
access to their accounts again.
In mid-July 2018, NatWest issued Mr M and Mrs B with a notice to close  letter.  The letter  
gave them 60 days notice  and advised  them to find banking facilities  with another  bank. The 
letter also gave Mr M details on how he could  continue to repay his loan.  The letter didnt  
state the loan would need to be repaid in full by the end of the 60 days.
Mr M and Mrs B complained to NatWest. They said not having  access to their funds caused 
them great stress and inconvenience. And they wanted to know why NatWest had decided 
to close their accounts.
NatWest didnt uphold  Mr M and Mrs Bs complaint. Mr M and Mrs B remained unhappy so 
brought their complaint  to our service.
The investigator who looked into Mr M and Mrs Bs complaint didnt think NatWest had acted 
unreasonably. She said the bank are entitled  to review an account and they did so in line 
with the terms and conditions of the account. She was also satisfied NatWest  gave  
appropriate notice  to close Mr M and Mrs Bs accounts. And she recognised NatWest had 
given Mr M details on how to continue to repay his loan.
Mr M remained unhappy. He said he wanted to know why the account had been closed, and 
he and Mrs M are vulnerable consumers  with severe disabilities.
As an agreement couldnt  be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
investigator for broadly the same reasons. 
I can understand why Mr M and Mrs B are upset.  Im sorry this experience has been  
stressful for them  and to hear of their disabilities. But for me to uphold his complaint I have 
to think NatWest have  done  something  wrong.  And in this case,  I dont consider they have. 
Ill explain  why.

I appreciate Mr M and Mrs M feel strongly  about their complaint. But NatWest are entitled  to 
review the accounts  under the account  terms and conditions. And a bank isnt generally 
obliged to provide an explanation as to why transactions cant  be carried out at the moment  
an account holder  is seeking to make them, or as to why funds are generally not accessible.
Having looked  at the evidence, like the investigator, Im satisfied that NatWest  acted in line 
with their legal  and regulatory obligations  when it blocked and reviewed  Mr M and Mrs Bs 
accounts. I know theyre upset about  not having  access to their accounts and money and 
I recognise that that this caused  them difficulty.  I also understand that theyre frustrated that 
they havent been given  a proper explanation. But NatWest doesnt  have to provide one. So 
I cant fairly say NatWest did anything wrong by not giving Mr M and Mrs B this information.
Having looked  at the evidence, Im satisfied NatWest followed their own procedures when 
they blocked and reviewed Mr M and Mrs Bs accounts. I can also see they carried out their 
review within  a week and then gave Mr M and Mrs B full access. So I dont consider they 
caused any unnecessary delays either. 
I appreciate Mr M and Mrs B want compensation for the distress NatWest  caused them. But 
as Ive found theyve acted in line with their terms and conditions,  Im not going to ask 
NatWest to compensate  Mr M and Mrs B. 
account closure
A bank  is entitled  to close an account with a customer just as a customer may close  an 
account with a bank. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which 
complies with the terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions  of the account  which both NatWest and Mr M and Mrs B had to 
comply with  say that NatWest could close the account by giving them 60 days notice. 
NatWest have done this. So they are entitled to close  the accounts.
I know Mr M and Mrs B are frustrated that they havent been given a proper explanation why 
their accounts were closed. But under the terms and conditions NatWest  doesnt have to 
give a reason for doing so  in the same  way a customer doesnt have to, should  they no 
longer want to bank  with them. So I cant say NatWest  has done anything  wrong  by not 
giving Mr M and Mrs B this information.
the loan
Mr M has said hes tried to contact NatWest to find out how to make  payments to his loan.  
I think the closure letter NatWest issued makes  it clear its the three accounts which were 
being closed.  I say that because NatWest included a separate paragraph regarding the loan.
This gives details on how Mr M can continue to make his loan repayments. So Im satisfied  
NatWest told him.
And I havent seen  any evidence  to show Mr M tried to contact NatWest about this and they 
didnt respond.  And I havent  seen  anything to show that it is the fault of NatWest why some 
of Mr Ms loan payments  havent been  made on time.

In summary,  I know my decision will come as a great  frustration and disappointment to Mr M 
and Mrs B. But having looked at whats happened here I dont think NatWest acted 
unreasonably or outside the terms and conditions of the accounts.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision  before  28 February  2019.
