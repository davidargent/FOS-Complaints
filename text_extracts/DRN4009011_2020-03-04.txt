K821x#15Complaint
Mr G (by way of a representative) has complained about the loans he took out with Elevate 
Credit International  Limited (Sunny).  Mr G says Sunny should have known that he was 
unable to afford the loans. Also, that he had to borrow further  loans in order to make the 
repayments, which resulted in him being  trapped in a debt spiral.
Background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  31 January 
2020. An extract from this is attached  and forms part of this final decision, so I will not repeat 
that information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to partly uphold the complaint. I invited 
both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. Sunny  didnt  agree with the 
provisional decision and it provided  some  further  comments it wanted us to consider. Mr G 
didnt respond  or provide any further  comments.  
Ive carefully considered  everything Sunny has told us. In summary it said:
the repayments that Mr G was expected  to make took up a small proportion of his 
monthly income,
loans 1  9 were  repaid on time without incurring any additional fees or charges,
while a high volume of lending may indicate a problem there was no other  evidence  
in to suggest this was the case for Mr Gs complaint,
there was no evidence of Mr G having any financial difficulties when loan 1  9 were 
approved and 
Sunny  has some  concerns about  removing loan records  from Mr Gs credit  file 
because no evidence  was provided to show that those entries prevented Mr G 
accessing mainstream credit. 
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I acknowledge that Sunny has made  an offer from loan 10 onwards, but the points it has 
raised above seem solely concerned with the decision to uphold loan 9.
 
I explained my reasoning  as to why Mr Gs complaint should be partly upheld  in the 
provisional decision. But Sunny has received a number of final decisions from colleagues 
and our approach  to dealing with these types  of cases  can be found  on website. We would 
expect Sunny to try and learn  from these decisions and from our approach  when considering 
these types of cases. 
So while I accept what Sunny says about Mr G having to use only a small proportion of his 
income to make the repayments he was committed to for loan 9 and up to this point he 
hadnt encounter  any repayment problems. While this is true for Mr Gs case, that doesnt 
mean that Sunny hasnt done  anything wrong.   
As our approach sets out, and for the reasons I explained in the provisional decision, a loan 
being pounds  and pence affordable doesnt  mean  the loan repayments were  automatically 
Ref: DRN40090112sustainable for Mr G. This means  that the pattern of lending in and of itself is sufficient to 
show that the loan repayments were no longer sustainable for Mr G. 
And having reviewed  the evidence in this case,  Im satisfied this point  was reached by loan 
9. Mr G had been  regularly taking out loans over the preceding  months and loan 9 was his 
largest loan to date.  And Mr G also had an outstanding loan (loan 7) with Sunny, this meant 
for this loan he had to make one of his largest contractual  repayments  to date. So by August 
2016 Mr G had been indebted to Sunny for a number of months and his monthly repayments 
werent decreasing.  To me, this indicates  that Mr G may have been having some  wider 
money management problems. 
Ive considered what Sunny says about the interest  rate on these loans   and the amount  
that Mr G had paid up to the point that this loan was taken out. But ultimately, the loans  
provided by Sunny are high cost credit. Indeed, if you look at the loan amounts  taken,  Mr D 
wasnt reducing his indebtedness to Sunny; by loan 9 it had significantly increased.  
Ive also thought about Sunnys comments in relation to the credit file, but as Ive said above, 
this service has issued a number of decisions  explaining why we think  that for some loans 
records should be deleted  from a credit file. And in this case, I think it is appropriate for this 
loan 9 onwards  to be deleted from Mr Gs credit file. 
Firstly, because we are satisfied that Mr G has suffered detriment  because  Sunny approved  
these loans and secondly, I think it is more likely than not that as result of these loans Mr G 
ability to obtain  mainstream credit  has been affected.  
So having  thought about the points Sunny has made, these  havent  changed my mind  about 
which loans I think should be upheld. So, for the reasons Ive outlined above,  and in my 
provisional decision I still think Sunny was wrong to have provided loans 9  18.
putting things right  what I currently  think Sunny  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loan 9 - 18
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from 9 onwards means any information  recorded about
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  loans  9 - 18 should be removed from Mr Gs
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN40090113my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, and in my provisional  decision, I partly uphold Mr Gs 
complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2020.

complaint
Mr G (by way of a representative)  has complained  about the loans  he took out with Elevate Credit 
International Limited (Sunny). Mr G says Sunny should have known that he was unable to afford the 
loans. Also, that he had to borrow further loans in order to make the repayments,  which resulted  in 
him being trapped in a debt spiral.
background
Mr G took 18 loans from Sunny between January 2016 and January 2017. A summary of Mr Gs 
borrowing, based on the information provided to us from Sunny, can be found in the appendix at the 
end of this decision. 
Our adjudicator thought Sunny had made an error  when it provided Mr G with his fifth loan and 
subsequent loans because,  by this time it shouldve seen Mr G was showing signs that he was 
struggling to repay  his loans. And by loan 6, his pattern  of lending shouldve showed Sunny that these  
loans were no longer sustainable.
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  but made an alternative offer to refund the interest on 
loans 10-18.  
Mr G rejected Sunnys  offer and asked for an ombudsman to consider the complaint. As no 
agreement could be reached, the case has been passed to me for a final decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.
Having thought about the above, as well as the evidence available to me, Ive provisionally  decided to 
partly uphold  Mr Gs complaint. Sunny needed  to take reasonable  steps to ensure that it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks in order to 
reasonably conclude Mr G could repay the loans  in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts, and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
In general, Id expect a lender to require  more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
Consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable  way. Certain factors might point  to the 
fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish  that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include, but are not limited to:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time
during which a customer has been given loans  (reflecting  the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN40090115There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
Mr G didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion  about  loans  1 to 4. Because  of this I dont think 
there is any ongoing disagreement about  these  loans. So, I wont be making a decision  about this 
lending. But as they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr G had with Sunny, I will take them into 
account when considering his later loans.
 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Gs fifth loan as he thought Sunny should have  been aware  that Mr G was 
returning for a new loan within a week on repaying  one. And that Mr G was showing  signs that he was 
struggling to repay  some  of his loans.  Sunny  disagreed with the adjudicators points as it believes  
sufficient affordability checks were completed which showed  Mr G could afford the repayments.  
Whilst I think Mr G was showing signs he may have needed to borrow as soon as he repaid a loan,  
Im not persuaded  that this was enough to definitively  say Sunny should have stopped lending to Mr G 
by loan 5 because of the time that Mr G had spent in debt and I dont think  there was an established 
pattern . But that doesnt mean Sunny didnt  do anything wrong. 
Im also not persuaded  that Sunny completed proportionate affordability checks  by this point.  Mr G 
had taken loans with repayments  totalling  a significant  portion  of his monthly  income. Mr G had also 
requested fortnightly repayments which was most likely due to the way he received his income.  
Sunny has only showed  us it enquired  about Mr Gs monthly income and expenditure and due to the 
way the fortnightly repayments fell, at some point over the loan term,  Mr G was due to make  
repayments in excess of nearly a third of his monthly income. So, I think it should  have prompted a 
full review of his circumstances quite early  on in the borrowing relationship,  to ensure he could sustain 
the repayments. But Sunny didnt do this before  approving loan 5 or any of Mr Gs subsequent  loans, 
and so I dont think the checks it made were proportionate.
Mr G has not provided me with any further information about his circumstances  at the time, for 
example a copy of his credit  file or his bank statements.  This means  Im unable  to see if there was 
any information  about  his financial circumstances that would have given Sunny cause  for concern or 
wouldve stopped  it from providing this loan. So based on what Ive seen,  I cant conclude it was 
unreasonable for Sunny to have given  loan 5 to Mr G.
Equally this means I dont think that Sunny  carried  out proportionate checks  for any of the remaining 
loans, but as I do not have  any further information about Mr Gs financial  position at the time, Im 
unable to say that an error was made when  it provided loans 6  8.  
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr G, with a view to seeing  if 
there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful.
Our adjudicator thought Sunny shouldve seen this by the time Mr G applied for his sixth loan. I have 
considered our adjudicators points, but Im not satisfied that Sunny should  have reasonably been 
aware of this by loan 6 mainly because Mr G had been indebted  for only four months and at this point 
I dont there  was an established pattern as to how Mr G was using these  loans. However,  I do think  
Sunny shouldve  realised this at the time it provided  loan 9. I say this because:
When Mr G applied  for loan 9, he had just repaid  loan 6 and loan 8 on the same  day. Loan 9 
was his largest loan to date, so I dont think Mr G was showing any signs that his finances 
were improving.   Mr G also still had loan 7 to repay so his overall indebtedness had increased 
significantly since the first loan. 
Ref: DRN40090116By loan 9, I think a pattern had emerged where  Mr G was provided with new loans quickly 
after he had repaid previous ones and by now the pattern was established.  Sunny ought  to 
have realised it was more likely  than not Mr G was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
the repayment of his previous  loans left in his finances. 
Mr G wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 16 was taken out 
18 months after Mr Gs first but there had been no decrease in Mr Gs monthly contractual  
repayment. Mr G had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.
I think  that Mr G out when  Sunny provided loan 9 onwards because:
These loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness  by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period of time and;
the sheer number of loans  was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Gs
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these  high-cost
loans.
So Im intending to uphold  Mr Gs complaint about any borrowing  taken from loan 9 onwards so 
Sunny should put things right as detailed below.
