The complaint
Mrs M complains that Red Sands Insurance Company (Europe) Limited has unfairly declined 
a claim shes made on her pet insurance policy.
What happened
The background to this complaint is well known to the parties so Ill only provide a summary 
here.
Mrs M has a pet insurance policy for her dog - which Ill refer to as L - underwritten by 
Red Sands
In December 2019, L experienced a period of vomiting and diarrhoea and was 
referred to Mrs Ms vet for investigation and treatment
Mrs M claimed on the policy but it was declined as Red Sands said the medical 
records showed L had experienced vomiting and diarrhoea previously in 2018 and 
this should have been disclosed when the policy was taken out
And because this happened before the start date of the policy, Red Sands said it was 
a pre-existing condition and it placed an exclusion for the digestive system on the 
policy
Mrs M complained to Red Sands but it maintained its position
Our investigator concluded Red Sands hadnt acted unfairly because the previous 
illness and treatment should have been disclosed
Mrs M disagreed and asked an ombudsman to make a decision 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The policy schedule contains a number of declarations which Mrs M agreed to when 
she took out the policy
Included in these is the question Have you ever taken L to the vet for anything other 
than routine vaccinations?
Its clear from the medical notes and from Mrs Ms own testimony, L was taken to the 
vet for investigation and treatment following the bout of vomiting and diarrhoea in 
2018
Im satisfied this should have been declared when the policy was taken out
The underwriting guide shows that if Mrs M made the appropriate declaration, Red 
Sands would have applied the exclusion relating to the digestive system
Im satisfied that Red Sands hasnt acted unreasonably in retrospectively applying 
the exclusion when it found out about the referral to the vet in 2018 and declining the 
claim on this basis
I know Mrs M doesnt consider the application of this exclusion to be fair or 
appropriate but Im satisfied it is in line with the underwriting guidelines 
Ive reached this conclusion Red Sands has fairly declined the claim for the reasons 
Ive explained, so I dont need to consider whether the underlying conditions causing 
the symptoms were the same or not 
I wont be asking Red Sands to do anymore
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 June 2021.
