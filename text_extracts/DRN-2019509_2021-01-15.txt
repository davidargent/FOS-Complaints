The complaint
Mr K has complained that PayPal has been allowing eBay to take money from his PayPal 
account, without his authority or mandate.
What happened
Mr K discovered PayPal had been taking money from his account. Hes explained he has not 
been able to get answers from either PayPal or eBay as to whats happened.
Mr K also finds it difficult to view his historical account balance, so its not easy to keep track 
of payments to eBay. He thinks PayPal is hiding these and paying them secretly. He also 
feels its being done without his permission. He also said that fees have been paid to eBay, 
during a period when he was meant to have a free promotional offer.
PayPal showed Mr K how he could make adjustments to view his account more easily. Mr K 
has also cancelled his mandate with eBay and his account with eBay has been suspended. 
PayPal has advised that Mr K has an account registered with it. Weve also been told that Mr 
K has a billing agreement with eBay.
One of our investigators looked into what had happened. He said that as PayPal are the 
method of payment used when signing up for eBay, it means that payments made this way 
are protected as part of that billing agreement. This means that if eBay reports a dispute or 
problem between a buyer and seller, eBay can collect this payment from one user and return 
it to another, through PayPal. EBay also uses this method to collect sellers fees and other 
fees linked to eBay.
Our investigator explained that PayPal has said it doesn't have any authority over this. This 
is because any dispute around payments through eBay for an issue between buyers and 
sellers need to be raised with eBay directly. PayPal is following instructions provided to it by 
eBay. The billing agreement between Mr K and eBay means hes agreed to this process.
PayPal said that in June 2019, it received an instruction from eBay to return a payment of
Â£54.39.  This was from Mr Ks account to another eBay user. It said Mr K would need to 
contact eBay about this, as it was done on its instructions.
Our investigator explained that this complaint is brought against PayPal. So its PayPals 
actions were looking at. From the evidence PayPal provided, he was satisfied that Mr K had 
signed up to a billing agreement with eBay in March 2009. This agreement means that eBay 
can take pre-approved payments in line with their own terms of service. He was satisfied that 
this is what had happened here  both in the form of a refund to another buyer, and eBay 
fees. So PayPal was acting in line with instructions from eBay, which Mr K had agreed it 
could do. Our investigator noted that Mr K later cancelled this agreement. This would mean 
eBay couldnt take any funds through PayPal.
Our investigator also looked at the problems Mr K was having with PayPals layout. He 
explained he didnt have the power to instruct it to change its layout, and PayPal currently 
cant issue paper statements, as its an online platform. But he was satisfied that it had 
explained how to access the Activity page, and thought this was reasonable.
Mr K disagreed. In summary, he said that he hadnt entered into a billing agreement with 
eBay on 2 March 2009, so any such agreement must be fraudulent. He said PayPal has 
taken money without his authority, and hasnt provided him with a chronology of his account 
activity showing his balance.
Mr Ks complaints now been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator, and for the same reasons. Ill explain why.
Ive not seen any evidence to persuade me that it was not Mr K who entered into the billing 
agreement. He would not have been able to use eBay if he had not done so  and he did 
use eBay. I appreciate that some sellers accept personal cheque, and Mr K made some 
payments this way. But many do not. PayPal was merely acting upon the payment 
instructions it received, which it was entitled to do. If Mr K remains concerned about eBay 
charges, this is something he would need to raise directly with eBay. Im only looking here at 
the actions of PayPal  and Im satisfied it acted in line with instructions, pursuant to Mr Ks 
billing agreement.
As regards account activity and viewing the overall balance, Im satisfied that PayPal has 
explained where Mr K can find this information. Unfortunately, it cant provide paper 
statements, as its a solely online platform. I think this is reasonable, and that its assisted 
Mr K by explaining about the activity page on its website.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, its my final decision not to uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 February 2021.
