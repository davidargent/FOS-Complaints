K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) didnt refund him the money
for a mis-sold item he bought online.
background
Mr S bought a speaker from an online market place  website.  He paid for it with his credit 
card, using PayPal.  When the speaker arrived, it was a different colour from the one 
advertised online. He complained to the seller, who asked Mr S to send the speaker back, in 
order for him to give a refund.  Mr S said he wasnt prepared to pay for the postage  to return  
the speaker and it would  cost him more because he had to drive to the delivery office. The 
seller said he wouldnt cover the cost. Mr S complained to PayPal.
PayPal didnt uphold  Mr Ss complaint. They said under their user agreement the item needs 
to be returned  in order for a refund to be issued. Mr S was unhappy  with their response as 
he wasnt prepared to pay more  money  to return the item. He then complained to us.
Our investigator considered all the issues and thought that PayPal hadnt done anything 
wrong. He said as PayPal  was used as part of the payment chain with his credit card, Mr S 
couldnt make a section  75 claim. He also said that PayPal  wasnt  responsible for paying for 
the drive to the delivery office.
Mr S wasnt  happy with our investigators  view. He said that as hed now sold the item for 
half the price he bought  it for, hed lost even more money. He also said hed originally tried to 
make a complaint  to this service against his credit card provider, but was told that it should  
be against PayPal.  However he was now being told that as he used PayPal he couldnt  
make a claim which seemed like a contradiction. Mr S asked for an ombudsmans decision.
my provisional decision  
In my provisional decision,  I said:
Our investigator correctly  identified that Mr S wouldnt be able to make a section 75 claim, as 
the payment was made through PayPal.  However as this complaint is against PayPal, I need 
to consider whether PayPal have acted  fairly  and within their user agreement  by not 
refunding the money to Mr S.
PayPal said they wouldnt refund  the money  for the mis-sold item as Mr S didnt send it back  
to the seller. I can see from their user agreement that they are correct.  It says in order  to 
issue a refund they do require the buyer to return the item. So theyve acted within  their own 
rules.
I also need to decide if PayPal have  treated Mr S fairly. If PayPal had acted in the way Mr S 
suggests, he wouldnt have returned the item and they wouldve given  him a refund. This 
would mean  Mr S would  have both the item and the money he paid for it and the seller would 
have neither. This doesnt seem  fair, even if the item is not as described. Mr S has also been 
able to sell the item on, even though he only got half the money  he paid for it. This means, 
had PayPal refunded the money, he wouldve been  able to profit  from the original purchase. 
It therefore seems unfair to ask PayPal to refund  the money without having the item 
returned. I therefore think PayPal have acted  both reasonably and within their user 
agreement by not refunding the money.
Ref: DRN27930332Mr S also explains that hes out of pocket for the postage hes already paid for the item and 
would need to pay more to return it. As part of PayPals Buyer Protection terms they say that 
if your claim  is successful  theyll  require the seller  to refund the full amount, including  the 
original postage costs.  This means that if Mr S had returned the item its likely  the original 
postage cost wouldve been  refunded. Therefore he wouldve only had to pay for postage 
once had he returned the item. He wouldve also received a full refund so couldve avoided 
the loss he experienced.
Mr S says hes further out of pocket as he had to drive to the delivery office  to pick up the 
parcel and would have to drive again  to send it back. I appreciate it would be frustrating 
having to drive to the delivery office  to collect the parcel and it incurred extra  costs.  However  
this wouldve  been a consideration Mr S made when deciding  to buy the item.  I dont think  
its PayPals responsibility  to refund their customers costs  for retrieving items theyve 
ordered. Ive considered  the same situation,  but where the item had been bought in a 
physical shop, rather than online.  Its reasonable that the shop wouldnt be responsible for 
the cost of the customers journey  back to the shop to return the item. I therefore dont agree 
that PayPal should refund the money  spent on collecting and delivering the item.
the response to my provisional  decision 
Mr S and Paypal  have  not added anything  further since  I sent my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither PayPal nor Mr S have given me any reasons to depart from my provisional
decision. Having  considered everything again,  I remain of the view that I dont think  PayPal 
should issue a refund if the item is not returned. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, I dont uphold this complaint. I therefore dont require PayPal 
Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to take any action.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 August 2019.
