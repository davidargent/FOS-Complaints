The complaint
Mr F complains that Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as Tesco Bank, wont refund to him 
the money that he paid for some built-in wardrobes. His wife is also involved in his 
complaint. 
What happened
Mr F used his Tesco Bank credit card to make payments of £2,066.80, £4,163.20 and 
£2,450.56 between April and August 2019 for two built in wardrobes. His wife signed the 
order forms but also sent an e-mail to the designer about the plinths that she wanted for the 
wardrobes. The wardrobes were supplied and fitted without plinths so Mr Fs wife 
complained to the supplier and then Mr F claimed a refund from Tesco Bank under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 of the money that hed been paid for the 
wardrobes. He also complained about some issues with the wardrobes and about some 
damage that had been caused. 
The supplier rectified the issues with the wardrobes and Tesco Bank said the signed 
agreement for the wardrobes didnt mention raised plinths and that Mr F hadnt provided 
enough evidence to support his claim that the wardrobes had been misrepresented. Mr F 
wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that she 
couldnt hold Tesco Bank liable for misrepresentation or breach of contract under section 75, 
that the supplier had repaired the issues with the wardrobes and she was unable to conclude 
that the damage to a shutter occurred during installation of the wardrobes.
Mr Fs wife, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. 
She says that the designer confirmed by email that the wardrobes would have plinths and 
would write that on the paperwork, the design drawing was emailed to her which had that 
written on as an extra detail so she signed the contract. She says that this was a 
misrepresentation and that theres been a significant breach of contract. She says that she 
allowed the supplier to proceed with the installation because it had already made substantial 
progress with the work and she was offered significant compensation by the suppliers area 
manager. She says that she doesnt like the finished wardrobes and wishes theyd been 
removed.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Fs complaint about Tesco Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that Tesco 
Banks response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of Mr Fs claim under section 75 as only a court would be 
able to do that;
its clear that Mr Fs wife wanted wardrobes with plinths, thought that shed chosen 
wardrobes with plinths and that, when she received the drawings, she contacted the 
designer about the plinths;
she signed the order form which didnt refer to the plinths but the designer had 
amended the drawings to refer to plinths even though plinths werent available for 
that range of wardrobes;
the installation of the wardrobes took place in two stages with the work on the 
dressing room wardrobe starting in June 2019 and the work on the main bedroom 
wardrobe starting in August 2019;
Mr Fs wife asked the installer about the plinths when work started in June 2019 and, 
even though she was told that plinths werent being installed, she allowed the work to 
continue  she says that she contacted the area manager who offered her significant 
compensation  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
supplier agreed to pay any compensation;
even though the dressing room wardrobes had been installed without the plinths that 
she wanted, she then allowed the wardrobes to be installed in the main bedroom;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mr Fs wife to have asked the 
installer to stop work on the dressing room wardrobe while the issue with the plinths 
was resolved and then to have ensured that the wardrobes for the main bedroom 
were acceptable to her before she allowed that installation to start  but she didnt do 
so and she allowed the work to continue after she knew that plinths werent being 
installed;
Mr Fs wife has provided a report on the wardrobes which says that she requested 
raised profiles around the bottom of the wardrobe doors, the suppler has used infills 
and that she shouldnt have been misled into agreeing to a design that the supplier 
couldnt deliver  but I dont consider that the report shows that theres been a breach 
of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
there were some issues with the wardrobes and the supplier says that it has dealt 
with those issues  and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
the installed wardrobes arent of satisfactory quality;
Mr Fs wife says that a shutter was damaged when the wardrobes were being 
installed  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
damage was caused by the installer so I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for 
me to require Tesco Bank to reimburse Mr F for the cost of the repair to the shutter;
Mr Fs wife says that she doesnt like the wardrobes - and I sympathise with her for 
the issues that shes experienced - but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the wardrobes were misrepresented by the supplier or that 
theres been a breach of contract by the supplier; and
I consider that Tesco Banks response to Mr Fs claim has been fair and reasonable 
in these circumstances - so I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to 
require it to refund to Mr F any of the money that he paid for the wardrobes, to pay 
for any further work on, or repairs to, the wardrobes or the shutter, to pay any other 
compensation to him or to take any other action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 June 2021.
