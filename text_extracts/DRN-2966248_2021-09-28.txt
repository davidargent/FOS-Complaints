The complaint
Mrs W complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) didnt refund her for items she 
bought.
What happened
Mrs W bought some items from an online marketplace and when the delivery arrived some 
of the items were damaged and some hadnt been sent. Mrs W contacted the retailer and it 
said it would refund her if she returned the items.
Mrs W returned the items, using a pre-printed label the retailer sent her. The retailer 
confirmed it received the return and it would refund via the online marketplace. When this 
refund didnt happen, Mrs W contacted the retailer again.
The retailer said Mrs W should either approach her card issuer, to chargeback, or PayPal for 
a refund.
Mrs W approached PayPal but it declined her request for a refund. PayPal said Mrs W had 
returned the item to the wrong address and hadnt followed its instructions to return the items 
to PayPal. Unhappy with this answer Mrs W complained but PayPal still wouldnt refund.
Mrs W brought her complaint to this service and an investigator looked into things. The 
investigator thought the complaint shouldnt be upheld. They thought PayPal had been fair in 
declining the refund, it seemed Mrs W had returned the item before PayPal told her to.
Mrs W wasnt happy with this answer, and said shed never been told by PayPal to return the 
items to it. And Mrs W was still without the items or the money. Mrs W asked for an 
ombudsman to decide this complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have a lot of sympathy for Mrs W, it seems shes been misled by the retailer on a few 
occasions and been promised a refund she hasnt got. Its also clear Mrs W has neither the 
items she ordered nor the refund.
But I have to look at what PayPals obligations to Mrs W are. And I have to decide if PayPal 
has been fair and reasonable when it investigated Mrs Ws complaint. In the circumstances 
of this complaint, I cant decide whether the retailers been fair.
PayPal has a buyer protection scheme which might help people that paid via PayPal get a 
refund for items they didnt receive or for items incorrectly sent. But this protection doesnt 
cover every eventuality or entitle Mrs W to a refund.
PayPals terms say a consumer should try and resolve things with the retailer first, then 
approach PayPal to see if buyer protection might cover them. This is exactly what Mrs W 
did, she spoke to the retailer first.
Ive looked at the messages between Mrs W and the retailer, Im satisfied Mrs W returned 
the items because she was following the retailers instructions. I can also see the promise of 
a refund on several occasions, but it seems the retailer never refunded Mrs W.
I can also see the retailers return address is for a different address to the retailers 
registered address on the online marketplace. I think this is the most important issue for 
deciding this complaint.
For a successful buyer protection claim consumers often have to return the items, normally 
to the retailer but, sometimes, to PayPal. And PayPal needs to know the items have been 
returned to the correct person, the return needs to be sent to the correct address.
When Mrs W approached PayPal about a buyer protection claim shed already returned the 
item. PayPal has said this is a problem because it might have asked Mrs W to return the 
items to it, and therefore hadnt followed PayPals instructions.
I think Mrs W followed PayPals instructions, she tried to resolve things with the retailer 
before trying a buyer protection claim. And its unfair of PayPal to say Mrs W should have 
known, in advance, not to return the items when trying to resolve with the retailer.
And I realise Mrs W followed the instructions of the retailer, so I dont think its Mrs Ws fault 
the buyer protection claim didnt succeed. But I also dont think its PayPals fault.
The retailer appears to have misled Mrs W about the refund, and it supplied the return label. 
Id suggest Mrs W looks for some advice about whether she may have a claim against the 
retailer for not refunding her.
But I dont think PayPal has done anything wrong here. PayPal tried to help Mrs W when it 
realised shed returned the items and it started a buyer protection claim. The claim didnt 
succeed because Mrs W had returned the items to a different address, and I think PayPal 
made a reasonable decision in declining the buyer protection claim for this reason.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 October 2021.
