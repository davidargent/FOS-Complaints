The complaint
Mr A complains that Santander UK Plc (Santander) wouldnt refund the money he lost in a 
scam.
What happened
What Mr A says:
In March 2022, Mr A contacted a  travel company using an online search. He filled out a 
contact form with his contact details to arrange a call with an expert. He then spoke to them 
and was persuaded into booking a holiday. He was asked to make payments in instalments, 
which he thought was normal. He made six payments to the travel agent totalling £2,237.43, 
using his debit card. The payments were:

Total claim £2,088.43
Mr A says he trusted the company and believed they were a legitimate business. But when 
he didnt receive any confirmation of the holiday, nor travel documents, he realised he had 
been scammed and the travel company was fake.
The travel companys invoice was dated 17 March 2022 for £1,089.19. It didnt have any 
payment terms on it, and the two amounts due differed between £1,089.99 and £1,089.19.
Two sums totalling £149.00 were credited to Mr As account on 29 March 2022  so his loss 
totalled £2,088.43.
Mr A reported the matter to the police on 22 March 2022. He contacted Santander on 26 
March 2022.
Mr A says that he hadnt made such payments to the payee before, and six payments were 
made in rapid succession. The payments were therefore unusual. So - Santander shouldve 
prevented them from being made, or at least questioned them. If they had, he says the scam 
wouldve been uncovered and he wouldnt have made the payments. He said Santander 
should refund the money under the provisions of the Contingent Reimbursement Model 
Code (CRM Code). 
Mr A says the episode left him feeling stressed, anxious, and embarrassed. He says he can 
no longer trust anything he sees online.
What Santander said:
Santander said their automated fraud prevention system didnt pick up the payments as 
being unusual or suspicious. Mr A had authorised the payments and customers have a 
responsibility to check they are making payment to a legitimate company before providing 
their card details. Santander said Mr A had no chargeback rights as he had made payment 
to a money transfer service. Santander didnt refund the money.
Our investigation so far:
Mr A brought his complaint to us. Our investigator didnt uphold it. He said that given the 
value of the payments - Santander didnt need to intervene to question or stop them. Each 
time, the payment was for less than 3% of Mr As balance  so there werent any signs of his 
account being emptied. Mr A had also made payments or transfers that were larger than the 
payments in question  so the payments werent unusual. He said the chargeback rules did 
not apply  as the payments were to a money transfer service.
Mr A asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint - and so it has come to me to make a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear that Mr A has lost money in a cruel scam. Its not in question that he 
authorised and consented to the payments in this case  as the payments were made by 
debit card on a phone call with the travel company. The payments were authorised by Mr A 
under cardholder not present processes. And re-confirmed by Mr A in the app. So although 
Mr A didnt intend for the  money to go to a scammer, he is presumed to be liable for the loss 
in the first instance. 
So, in broad terms, the starting position at law is that a bank is expected to process 
payments and withdrawals that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance with the 
Payment Services Regulations and the terms and conditions of the customers account. And 
I have taken that into account when deciding what is fair and reasonable in this case.
But that is not the end of the story. Taking into account the law, regulators rules and 
guidance, relevant codes of practice and what I consider to have been good industry 
practice at the time, I consider Santander should fairly and reasonably:
Have been monitoring accounts and any payments made or received to counter 
various risks, including anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, 
and preventing fraud and scams.Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that 
might indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (among other things). This is 
particularly so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, 
which banks are generally more familiar with than the average customer.  
In some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken 
additional steps, or make additional checks, before processing a payment, or in some 
cases declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect customers from the 
possibility of financial harm from fraud.
The Lending Standards Board Contingent Reimbursement Model Code (CRM Code) doesnt 
apply in this case. That is because it applies to faster payments made to a UK beneficiary 
and in this case, the payments were made by card to an overseas account. 
I need to decide whether Santander acted fairly and reasonably in its dealings with Mr A 
when he made the payment, or whether it should have done more than it did. I have 
considered the position carefully.
I wanted to establish how much Mr As losses were - as the invoice from the travel company 
was for £1089.99. I asked Mr A about this and he said he made three payments totalling 
£2,237.43. He couldnt explain why he paid more than the invoice amount  other than the 
scammer took more payments than needed, and he also confirmed he authorised each one 
in the app. In actual fact, as there were two refunds totalling £149.00, Mr As loss was 
£2,088.43.
I looked at the activity on Mr As account  to see if the payments could be considered 
unusual. There were many bill payments or debit card payments from his account of a 
similar amount to the amounts paid in the scam. For example:
1 October 2021: £388.99 debit card payment
16 October 2021: £983  debit card payment
15 October 2021: £850  debit card payment
12 November 2021: £325  bill payment
1 December 2021: £500  bill payment
15 December 2021: £850  bill payment
22 December 2021: £410  bill payment
15 February 2022 - £450  bill payment
2 March 2022: £368  bill payment
8 March 2022: £300 - bill payment
11 March 2022: £400 - bill payment
So  the payments to the scammer werent out of line with how Mr A typically used his 
account.
Mr A has argued that the payments were unusual  as they were to a new, international 
payee. While I acknowledge that was the case - theres also a balance to be struck: 
Santander has obligations to be alert to fraud and scams and to act in their customers best 
interests, but they cant be involved in every transaction as this would cause unnecessary 
disruption to legitimate payments. And in Mr As case, the payments were of such a low 
value - that we wouldnt have expected Santander to have intervened. 
I also noted that the payments were low in comparison with Mr As balance (less than 3%). A 
typical scam characteristic is to empty, or almost empty an account  and that wasnt the 
case here. So, in this case, I think Santander acted reasonably in processing the payments. Recovery:
Where a scam has taken place, we expect firms to take reasonable steps to try to recover 
the money. But here, as the payments were made by debit card, authorised by Mr A, and 
were made to a money transfer service, this isnt a process that was likely to be successful. 
Santander did try to get the money refunded by using the chargeback process. This is a 
voluntary scheme and refunds can only be made under certain criteria set by Visa and 
Mastercard. And in this case, because the payments were made to a money transfer 
service, the chargeback claim wasnt successful. 
I did see that £149.00 was returned to Mr As account on 29 March 2022. I asked Santander 
about this and they told us that it wasnt the result of any recovery action by themselves.
I was sorry to learn that Mr A lost money in a cruel scam, but having reviewed what 
happened, I am not upholding his complaint.
 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 September 2023.
