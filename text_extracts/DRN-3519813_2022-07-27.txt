The complaint
Mrs F complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt do enough to protect 
her from the loss of debit card payments totalling £1,942.75 to a scam.
What happened
Mrs F has explained that in 2019 she made the following payments using her NatWest Visa 
debit card as a result of what she later realised was an investment scam.
Transaction 
no. Date Merchant Amount (£)
1 23 April 2019 Webtransact 198.72
2 24 April 2019 Jubiter.com 238.45
3 22 May 2019 Webtransact 688.55
4 17 June 2019 Jubiter 408.50
5 17 June 2019 Jubiter 408.50
Total 1,942.72
Mrs F got in touch with NatWest to report shed been scammed. NatWest said there was 
nothing it could do to help her  and it didnt offer to reimburse her funds. Remaining 
unhappy, Mrs F referred her complaint about NatWest to this service. As our investigator 
was unable to resolve the matter informally, the case has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. Ill explain why. 
Should NatWest have prevented the payments in the first place
I dont think NatWest could reasonably be expected to have prevented the payments Mrs F 
says she lost to a scam. This is because at the time generally, banks were expected to 
process payments a customer authorised it to make. And under The Payment Services 
Regulations and terms and conditions of the account, Mrs F is presumed liable for the loss in 
the first instance, in circumstances where she authorised the payments. That said, as a 
matter of good industry practice, NatWest should have taken proactive steps to identify and 
help prevent transactions  particularly unusual or uncharacteristic transactions  that could 
involve fraud or be the result of a scam. However, there is a balance to be struck: banks had 
(and have) obligations to be alert to fraud and scams and to act in their customers best 
interests, but they cant reasonably be involved in every transaction. 
In my opinion, the payments here just werent sufficiently unusual, uncharacteristic or 
suspicious to reasonably say NatWest shouldnt have allowed the payments through without 
first getting in touch with Mrs F to check everything was in order. They werent for unusually 
large amounts. Also, I cant see there were any warnings about the entities Mrs F paid 
(Webtransact, Jubiter.com, and Jubiter) that ought to have concerned NatWest. I understand 
Jubiter.com / Jubiter were involved in cryptocurrency, but not all payments made for 
cryptocurrency are a result of a scam. And in this case I dont think where the payments 
were headed ought to have automatically triggered NatWests attention. 
I understand Mrs F has recently said NatWest did call her before allowing these payments 
through. NatWest has no information to confirm this  and I would normally expect the bank 
to have a record of any calls like this, if they did happen (although not always). Im mindful 
that previously, however, in an email to us dated 13 April 2022, Mrs F said, NatWest did not 
question any of these payments, and it was myself who went into the bank and 
questioned. Taking all of this into account  including what Mrs F has said about this and 
also what Ive said about there not being anything about the payments that would make me 
expect NatWests attention to be drawn to them before allowing them through  Im not 
sufficiently persuaded I can say its most likely NatWest did call Mr F about these payments 
before they were sent. 
This means that as Im satisfied NatWest most likely didnt interact with Mrs F at the time of 
the payments  and Ive concluded that I cant reasonably say NatWest ought to have been 
obliged to have gotten in touch with Mrs F about them  Im satisfied NatWest didnt 
unreasonably miss an opportunity to prevent the payments before they were sent. 
Chargeback
After the payments were made, I wouldnt reasonably expect NatWest to have done anything
further until Mrs F notified it shed been scammed. Then, because these were debit card 
payments, the only recourse for potential recovery of the payments would be via the 
chargeback scheme. Chargeback is a process by which disputes are resolved between card 
issuers (here, NatWest) and the merchant.
In respect of transactions 2, 4 and 5, the merchant was Jubiter (or Jubiter.com). I understand 
Mrs F has said she was asked to pay the scammers crypto via Jubiter. This means for 
chargeback purposes the scammers werent party to these payments Mrs F made from her 
NatWest account to Jubiter. Instead, it appears these three payments would have been 
made to first purchase crypto from Jubiter, before being sent to a wallet address of Mrs Fs 
choosing. I think Jubiter legitimately provided the services (the purchase of cryptocurrency) 
as intended. And any subsequent transfer of the cryptocurrency to a different wallet (made 
as a result of the scam) would be a separate matter to the payments Mrs F made from her 
NatWest account. And therefore not one NatWest would be able to raise a successful 
chargeback on. So I cant see that Mrs Fs chargeback would have been successful, nor 
therefore that NatWest has done anything wrong here or should be obliged to refund Mrs F 
these payments. 
The remaining payments (1 and 3) were to Webtransact which might have enabled NatWest 
to consider chargeback claims under reason code 13.5 (misrepresentation). This particular 
reason code required Mrs F to provide dated evidence that she had an available balance in 
her trading account and that she tried to withdraw sums equal to or less than the available 
balance on the same day. I noted NatWest requested this evidence in its letter dated 30 
March 2021 but Ive not seen that Mrs F provided this evidence, so I dont think it acted 
unreasonably in deciding not to take Mrs Fs chargeback claims any further. I acknowledge 
that Mrs F states she attended a branch in the summer of 2020 and was not given any 
assistance or information to enable her to raise a dispute claim and was instead told shed 
be blacklisted. Ive seen no evidence of this conversation but Im persuaded by Mrs Fs 
testimony and I think its likely she was given incorrect information by the branch. But I dont 
think this makes a material difference to the outcome because Ive not seen any evidence that Mrs F had any available balances in her trading account in the summer of 2020 either. I 
think its more than likely that by the time she approached NatWest, shed lost the money, so 
I dont think NatWest would have been able to assist with chargeback claims for Mrs F even 
if it had given her the correct information in 2020. 
I appreciate Mrs F has said she was refunded similar payments which she made on credit 
cards with a different bank. But apart from anything else, credit cards give different 
protection rights to debit cards. And for the reasons Ive explained, Im satisfied here that 
NatWest hasnt done anything wrong. 
I realise this means Mrs F is out of pocket by £1,942.72, and I naturally sympathise. But I 
think this would ultimately be caused by the scam here, and not NatWest. I cant reasonably 
ask NatWest to refund this to Mrs F in circumstances where I dont think it did anything 
wrong.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2022.
