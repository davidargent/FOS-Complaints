K821x#15complaint
Mr T complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as PoundstoPocket (P2P), was 
irresponsible to give him three instalment  loans  between  2012 and 2015.
background
Mr T took out a total of three loans between May 2012 and July 2015, as follows:
loan number date taken amount borrowed repayment terms
1 11 May 2012 £450 12 x £73.30
2 23 June 2013 £700 12 x £110.03
2a 25 July 2013 £974.95 12 x £161.90
2b 28 July 2013 £1,046.17 12 x £161.90
2c 1 April 2014 £719.44 12 x £109.64
3 19 July 2015 £1,050 6 x £298.26
Mr T changed the term and increased the amount he borrowed for loan 2, so Ive labelled 
these a, b and c.
Mr T doesnt think P2P carried out proper checks. If it had done so, he says it would have 
seen that he couldnt afford to repay the loans.
P2P said it had performed  affordability  checks and carried  out a credit  reference agency 
check for each of the loans. Mr T was employed  and had enough disposable income to 
make the repayments  when they fell due without financial difficulties.
The adjudicator thought  that this complaint should be upheld in part. He didnt think  P2Ps  
checks had gone  far enough for any of the loans. If it had done better checks, he felt Mr T 
could afford  loan two but P2P would  have seen that Mr T couldnt afford the repayments for 
any of the other loans  or the additional borrowing taken after loan 2. He asked it to refund 
the interest and charges for these loans and to pay interest on the refunded amounts. He 
said it should remove any adverse information about  them from Mr Ts credit  file.
P2P agreed that it shouldnt have provided loan one and that it shouldnt have agreed to top 
up and restructure loan two (loans 2a, 2b and 2c). But it believed it had carried out proper 
checks for loan three and concluded the loan was affordable.
my provisional findings
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr T 
and to P2P on 22 October 2018. I summarise my findings:
P2P was required  to lend responsibly.  It needed  to make checks to see whether  Mr T 
could afford to pay back each loan before it lent to him. Those checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr T was borrowing and his lending  history,  
but there was no set list of checks P2P had to do.
P2P agreed that loan 1 and the additional  borrowing  for loan 2 werent affordable.
Ref: DRN74219432I didnt think P2P did enough checks before it agreed loan 2 but, if it had done so, I 
thought it would have concluded that Mr T had disposable income of around £680  which  
was enough to meet the monthly  repayments of £110.
In 2013 Mr T had a default registered against him and in 2014 P2P had sent Mr T a 
default notice  because he was late in making a monthly repayment. So I thought P2P 
should have done  more checks before it agreed  to provide Mr T with the third loan.
P2P had recorded Mr Ts monthly income as £1,500 and his monthly living  expenses, 
including credit commitments,  as £525. From the evidence  of Mr Ts financial 
circumstances at the time, his income  was around £1,600  and his regular outgoings  
were about £900, leaving a disposable income of £700 per month.  Mr T didnt have any 
other short term loans  at the time,  so I didnt  think it wrong for P2P to conclude  that loan 
3 was affordable.
Subject to any further representations from Mr T or P2P, my provisional decision was that I 
didnt think P2P should have agreed  to lend to Mr T for loans 1, 2a, 2b and 2c.
P2P accepted my decision.
Mr T responded to say, in summary,  that he didnt think that the third loan was affordable. It 
didnt seem that his rent and food had been included  in his normal  living  expenses when 
assessing affordability.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Mr Ts concern about  whether  loan 3 was affordable. Normal living expenses or 
regular monthly commitments can include such things as rent, utility bills, mobile phone, 
food, travel,  insurances,  gym membership, broadband and TV packages and any other  
regular financial commitments  such as personal  loans and credit  cards.  Im satisfied that, 
from a review of Mr Ts bank statement from the time that he took the loan, his living costs 
totalled just over £900. This left him with almost  £700 from which  to meet  the monthly loan 
repayments of almost £300. I find that Mr T didnt have any other short  term loans at the time 
he took the loan, so Im not persuaded that it wasnt affordable and I cant conclude that P2P 
was wrong to provide it.
putting things right
I dont think P2P should  have agreed  to lend to Mr T for loan 1, 2a, 2b and 2c. So for each of 
those loans P2P should:
refund  any interest and charges  applied to the loans
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Ts credit file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires P2P to take off tax from this interest.  P2P must give Mr T 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN74219433my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I require CashEuroNet UK LLC to put 
things right as detailed above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 August 2019.
