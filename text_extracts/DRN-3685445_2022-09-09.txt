The complaint
Mr F complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) unfairly restricted and blocked 
the use of his account without explanation.  
What happened
In late 2020, Mr F logged onto his PayPal account and was told the activity was inconsistent 
with PayPals User Agreement, and as a result he would no longer be offered its services. 
He was also told that any money in the account, or later deposited into it, would be held for 
180 days. Mr F did not have any funds in the account at the time. Unhappy with PayPals 
actions, Mr F complained. 
In its final response, PayPal said the limitation was placed on Mr Fs account so that it could 
carry out a review. This resulted in it determining the risk associated with Mr Fs account was 
too great. 
PayPal was satisfied it acted in line with its terms of account when applying a permanent 
restriction to the account. It added that due to the risk of potential chargebacks and other 
reversals, the account was put on hold. 
One of our Investigators looked into Mr Fs complaint. In summary they found: 
- PayPal can place restrictions on the account in the way it has and without 
explanation. Its not obligated to give prior notice of this 
- PayPal reviewed the account in line with its legal and regulatory obligations. And it 
isnt obliged to give an explanation
- PayPal can make commercial decisions as to who it offers its services too 
Mr F did not agree with what our Investigator said. Hes said a clear explanation as to why it 
took these actions must be given by PayPal  as should any financial institution. 
This complaint has now been passed to me  an Ombudsman  to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint. I know this will disappoint Mr F, 
so Ill explain why.
Financial businesses in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to 
meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means regulated firms need 
to restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
Its clear Mr F doesnt think hes breached the terms and conditions of his PayPal account. 
Id like to assure him Ive very carefully reviewed the relevant terms of PayPals User 
Agreement and Acceptable Use Policy. Having done that, I can see they allow PayPal to 
limit or close an account if it wishes to do so, in the way it has. So I dont think PayPal did 
anything wrong when reviewing and then restricting Mr Fs account.
PayPal have given me information which shows why it reviewed Mr Fs account, and why it 
prevented him from using it. I am not aware of any obligation under which PayPal or this 
service must disclose this reason. But, having carefully considered the information presented 
to me, Im satisfied PayPal had concern enough to take the actions it did. Im also persuaded 
that it has fairly applied its terms in doing so. 
I note PayPal explained Mr Fs account activity posed a risk to it, and it needed to guard 
against chargebacks and payments reversals that could be made against it. 
It's fortunate Mr F had inadvertently taken any funds out of his account before PayPal took 
these actions. I can understand how losing access to PayPals services would have caused 
him some inconvenience in carrying on his business activities. But in the way Mr F can 
choose which financial firms he uses services for, PayPal is free to choose who it does 
business with.  
 
Mr F has made complaint points which speak to PayPal and its actions across the broader 
industry. My role is to decide individual complaints based on their individual merits. And that 
is what I have done here.  
My final decision
For the reasons above, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 October 2022.
