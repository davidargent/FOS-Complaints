The complaint
Mr O complains that NewDay Ltd closed his credit card account despite being on an 
arrangement with it.
What happened
Mr O says he agreed what he thought was a payment holiday with NewDay at the start of 
2021. But he says NewDay closed his account before the arrangement had expired on 22 
May 2021. Mr O says he didnt receive any notice of this and kept in contact with NewDay to 
update it on his position and that he had obtained employment. He would like the default 
removed from his credit file.
NewDay says it hasnt made a mistake and tried to help Mr O. It says Mr O broke the 
account terms and conditions and was entitled to close his account. It also says it sent 
required default notices to Mr O in April 2021 and it isnt responsible for the delivery of mail.
Mr O brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld it. The investigator thought Mr 
O had agreed a plan with NewDay in January 2021 and paid £250 towards his debt. She 
also thought Mr O was told a payment wasnt required under the plan and the position would 
be reviewed in May 2021. The investigator thought Mr O had contacted NewDay again in 
April 2021 to tell it he was due to start work and it could have told him about the default 
notice then. She thought Mr O had been told on numerous occasions a payment wasnt 
required and that NewDay should remove the default from Mr Os credit file and buy back 
the debt if necessary as well as pay £150 compensation. The investigator recommended 
NewDay agree a way forward with Mr O.
NewDay doesnt accept that view and says it has not made a mistake. It says it told Mr O 
that interest and charges would be frozen, but arrears would still build up.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I uphold this complaint.
I have listened to the telephone calls between the parties and Im satisfied that Mr O wasnt 
ignoring his financial difficulties or his debt obligation to NewDay. And that he explained to 
NewDay that he was in financial difficulties. Im also satisfied that an agreement was 
reached in January 2021 that would be reviewed in May 2021 and that interest and charges 
were frozen. 
I can see that Mr O updated NewDay when his circumstances changed in April 2021 and 
told it he was about to start work. That is what I would have expected Mr O to have done and 
think it provides additional evidence that he was someone not ignoring his debt but 
responsibly updating those he owed money to. I can also see that NewDay agreed to send 
Mr O an income and expenditure form which suggests strongly that it would carry out a new 
assessment of Mr Os circumstances in the light of the employment.
Im satisfied that Mr O called NewDay again in May 2021 as required to do so but at that 
stage was told the account had been defaulted the previous month. So I appreciate Mr O 
would have confused by the situation and questioned why NewDay sent him the income and 
expenditure form if it had already decided to close the account. Im also satisfied that Mr O 
was reasonably entitled to conclude that NewDay had allowed him until May 2021 a 
payment holiday of some sort and that nothing adverse would happen to his account until 
then.
I find that NewDay are the experts here and I would have expected it to have been clear 
when it spoke to Mr O in January 2021 and told him in clear terms that there was a risk of a 
default despite agreeing the plan. I dont think NewDay was clear and ought reasonably to 
have explained the position when Mr O called it in April 2021 but did not which I dont think 
its explained.
Overall, I find that Mr O was reasonably entitled to conclude that he didnt need to make a 
payment until at least May 2021 and that he updated NewDay with changes in his 
circumstances. I dont think in those circumstances that the relationship between Mr O and 
NewDay had broken down despite there being arrears. It follows that I dont think NewDay 
ought to have registered a default and think it clear that Mr O didnt receive the notice. I cant 
fairly hold NewDay responsible for that, but I have made clear I dont think it should have 
been sent in the first place and in any event, it should have told Mr O about it when he called 
in April 2021.  
Putting things right
NewDay should remove the default from Mr Os credit file and I also think it should in this 
case deduct the £150 compensation I intend to order from the balance owed by him. 
NewDay should try and reach an agreement with Mr O going forward. NewDay should buy 
back the debt if it has sold it.
I agree with the investigator that Mr O was caused inconvenience and distress and that 
NewDay should pay £150 compensation which I think fair and reasonable.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and order NewDay Ltd to remove the default 
from Mr Os credit file. I also order it to pay Mr O £150 compensation which should be 
deducted from the balance he owes and agree with him a way forward for repaying the debt. 
If NewDay has sold the debt, then I order that it be bought back.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 November 2021.
