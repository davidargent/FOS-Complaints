The complaint
Mr L complained that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA had locked his account. Mr L said 
PayPal did this without telling him. Mr L also said that several thousand pounds had been 
sent to his account while it was locked, and he was still unable to access this money.
What happened
Mr L said PayPal blocked his account, and he wasnt able to receive payments which would 
have cleared his outstanding balance. He said that there was about £7,000, maybe more, 
waiting to clear. But he couldnt access the money because of what PayPal had done.
PayPal said Mr L made a number of payments using his account, and when PayPal tried to 
take the money from his bank, it didnt come through. So PayPal tried to charge Mr Ls 
backup payment, which was a credit card, and that didnt pay out either. PayPal said this left 
Mr Ls PayPal account in debt, and thats not allowed.
PayPal said it wrote to Mr L by email in January 2020, about this. It asked him to pay. And 
when he didnt pay and his account had been in debt for about four months, PayPal locked 
his account. 
PayPal said it had passed the balance to a debt collector, and that debt collector would be 
asking Mr L to pay this money back. In the meantime, the debt on his account had been 
cleared, and his account would be unlocked.
PayPal said it had acted in line with the terms of Mr Ls account, and it didnt think it had 
been unfair.
Mr L got in touch again, and said that although his account was now unlocked, the problem 
wasnt yet solved. He said that there was now over £8,000 waiting to be cleared into the 
account. He sent us a list of transactions he said showed as cleared but waiting acceptance 
into his PayPal account. Mr L said hed asked PayPal to verify the payments, but it refused 
to respond. 
PayPal said it didnt recognise any of these transactions. It asked for more information about 
them. It wanted Mr L to send any messages that PayPal had sent him about the payments, 
or information about the sender, or screenshots which showed what he was telling us  that 
the payments were there but couldnt be accessed.
Mr L hasnt sent this information. He said he couldnt. But he named where the payments 
were coming from. 
PayPal said that the payments Mr L had listed werent on his account. But because Mr L had 
been so specific about amounts and times of the payments, as well as about the status of 
the payments and actions he needed to take to claim the funds, PayPal said it was very 
likely that Mr L had been sent this information as part of a scam, claiming that these 
payments had been sent to him. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said PayPal had told Mr L 
he had to pay off the debt on his account, and he couldnt use payments he expected to 
receive in to the account to cover money he owed PayPal. Our investigator said that PayPal 
was entitled, under the terms of Mr Ls account, to lock the account. 
Our investigator understood that Mr L thought a number of payments had gone missing. But 
she said Mr L had provided no supporting evidence to show that these payments were ever 
made. 
Our investigator said she couldnt ask PayPal to do any more. She said the initial decision to 
lock the account was done in line with the terms of the user agreement, owing to an 
outstanding balance. PayPal then agreed to clear the balance and allow use of the account. 
She said that all of this was reasonable. And finally, she noted that PayPal had told us, if Mr 
L did get evidence of the payments made to his account, it would reconsider.
Mr L was very unhappy about this. He said he was given no notice that his account would be 
locked, and there had also been fraud on his account, which no one had looked into. 
Mr L repeated that a number of very large payments had been sent to his account, which 
hadnt credited the account or been returned to the sender. He thought we were allowing 
PayPal to get away with all of this. 
Our investigator said Mr L hadnt complained to PayPal about fraud, and he would have to 
do that before we could look at this point. She said that shed seen a warning which was 
displayed on his account before it was locked. 
Our investigator also said that Mr L had provided no evidence of the payments he said were 
sent. Hed sent us a list of payment amounts, dates and times, but that didnt show that what 
hed said happened, had happened. And without this, our investigator said she couldnt ask 
PayPal to do any more. 
Because no agreement was reached, this case came to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator.
PayPal has shown us that Mr Ls account was locked because he had a negative balance for 
a long time. Its pointed us to the terms that say that it doesnt allow negative balances, and 
to the terms that says it can lock accounts if they are left with a negative balance. PayPal 
has also shown us that Mr Ls account carried a warning about this, which was displayed for 
a considerable amount of time before his account was locked. 
So I dont think that PayPal did anything wrong when it locked Mr Ls account. 
PayPal has now passed that debt to a collection agency. Mr L hasnt complained about that.
When this complaint came to our service, PayPal removed the outstanding debt from Mr Ls 
account, and allowed him to use his account again. PayPal hasnt suggested that this means 
Mr L no longer owes this money. It just says the debt doesnt show on his account any more. I think that was a reasonable step for PayPal to take. 
But Mr L said that a large amount of money was missing, and he wanted us to make PayPal 
give him that money. 
PayPal says it hasnt been sent money for Mr L. It said any money sent to him while the 
account was locked would bounce back to the sender. And it also suggested, because of 
how specific Mr L had been about the payments, that this might be part of a scam. 
Mr L did tell our service where he thought the payments were coming from. I understand that 
this is the name of an app. Searching for that app online shows that it may have been a 
scam which claimed to send cash payments to a users PayPal account, just for playing a 
game. 
I dont know for sure if the payments that Mr L has told us about were part of a scam, or not. 
Without more information on those payments, I couldnt be sure of this. And, again, without 
more information, I couldnt ask PayPal to do more to look into this. Its been clear that it 
hasnt received these payments, and that what Mr L has told it, about payments which are 
pending, isnt how PayPals system works. 
But I am sure that what Mr L has told us just doesnt prove that the payments he was 
expecting to receive were ever sent to his PayPal account. So theres nothing to make me 
think that what has gone wrong here is PayPals fault. 
I know that Mr L will be disappointed, but I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 December 2021.
