K821x#15complaint
Miss M complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  lent to her in 
an irresponsible manner.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in the provisional decision I issued in 
November 2019.  An extract  from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will 
not repeat  that information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to uphold some of the complaint. 
I invited both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. Miss M has said 
she accepts my provisional decision.  Sunny  has partly accepted  what  I said  it has agreed 
with my findings in relation to loans  6 to 36. But it doesnt agree  with what Ive said about  
loans 2 to 5, so it has provided us with some  further comments. Although  I am only 
summarising here what Sunny has said in relation to those loans, I have considered  its 
entire response carefully before  writing this decision.
Sunny considers that Miss Ms use of the open  ended credit facility  (loan  1) was consistent 
with the FCAs definition of short term credit. It doesnt consider that she used  this for an 
extended period  of time.
Sunny says that it did take steps to independently verify the true state  of Miss Ms finances  
as part of each  loan application. It verified  her income using  data from a credit reference 
agency. And it used  the same data source  to check her credit expenditure too. It considers 
this to be the most objective and accurate means of verification.
Sunny doesnt  take into account how a consumer is spending their money  or the purpose  for 
which they are taking the loan. Sunny considers  its legal and regulatory obligation is solely to 
assess whether the credit  is affordable  and whether the repayments are sustainable.  Sunny 
says that over the whole  of the period  in question here Miss M had only to use a small 
proportion of her monthly income to make  her repayments. It says it had no evidence that 
Miss M was facing any problems managing her money, and that she was never late with her 
repayments or in arrears.
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
I thank Sunny for reconsidering its position on loans 6 onwards. And so I will uphold 
Miss Ms complaint about those loans without  any further comment.
I have noted what  Sunny has said about the steps  it took to independently  check  Miss Ms 
financial situation. But I dont think those independent checks  went far enough to satisfy  
what I consider would have been  proportionate by that time. I havent found  that Sunny 
should have intervened sooner than it did on loan 1. But I do think  Miss Ms borrowing 
behaviour should have  put Sunny on notice that it needed to do more  checks  for any 
subsequent borrowing requests.
By the time of loan 2 I think Sunny  needed to have a comprehensive  understanding  of 
Miss Ms finances. And I think that does  include  an understanding of her expenditure and the 
Ref: DRN25939312reasons for her borrowing   I think they are likely to contribute  to a decision on whether or 
not a loan is sustainably affordable. In this case,  better checks  would have  shown that 
Miss M was gambling heavily with signs of this behaviour  being  uncontrolled. And her 
borrowing from other short term lenders would have  made it clear that it was unlikely that 
she was asking Sunny for loans to help meet an unexpected one off emergency. 
So I remain  of the opinion that proportionate  checks would have shown Sunny that Miss M 
wasnt managing  her money, and that these  loans werent sustainably  affordable.  So Im 
upholding Miss Ms complaint about loans 2 to 36. Sunny  needs  to pay her some 
compensation.
putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Miss M after, and including, the loan that 
she took on 9 January  2015 (loan 2). So for each of those loans Sunny should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Miss M on the loans.  
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Ms credit file in relation to 
loans 2 to 5.
The number of loans  taken from loans 6 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 32, and about loans 33 to 36 when they 
have been fully repaid, should be removed from Miss Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss M a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
It seems  Miss M still owes Sunny some of the principal she borrowed on her last four loans. 
Sunny may deduct these amounts from the compensation that is due to her. But, to be clear, 
those outstanding balances should  be recalculated  to remove any interest and charges, but 
taking account  of any repayments  Miss M has made on those loans  as though  they were 
applied against  the principal sums borrowed.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold most of Miss Ms complaint and direct Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things  right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 February  2020

complaint
Miss M complains that Elevate Credit International  Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Miss M was given 36 loans by Sunny between June 2014 and December 2017. The first loan was a 
running account  facility allowing Miss M to make multiple drawdowns up to an agreed credit limit. The 
remaining loans were  due to be repaid in monthly instalments over periods of between 9 and 15 
months but Miss M generally  repaid the loans  far earlier. At times Miss M had up to four loans 
outstanding at the same time. Miss M successfully repaid  the first 32 loans  but a balance  remained 
outstanding on the last four loans when  she made her complaint. A summary of Miss Ms borrowing 
from Sunny is shown as an appendix to this decision.
Miss Ms complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think  that Sunny should  
have given any of the loans to Miss M. So he asked Sunny to pay Miss M some compensation. In 
response Sunny  accepted  that it shouldnt have lent to Miss M from loan 11 onwards. But it still didnt 
think it had been wrong to give the earlier loans to her. So, as the complaint hasnt  been resolved 
informally, it has been  passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure that Miss M could repay  the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for a consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish  whether  
Miss M could sustainably repay her loans   not just whether the loan payments  were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN25939314Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the FCAs Consumer Credit  Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being  without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments.  
And it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower 
wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their 
repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Miss Ms complaint.
Sunny did some checks before it lent to Miss M. It asked her for details of her income, and her normal 
expenditure. And it checked her credit  file before agreeing the loans. Ive seen a summary  of those  
checks and I dont  think  they showed anything that should  have caused additional concerns  to Sunny.
As I mentioned earlier  most  of Miss Ms loans were repayable over an extended period of time. So the 
amounts that Miss M needed to repay each month were smaller than if shed taken  a normal payday 
loan. But of course she was committing to making  those repayments over a far longer period. And at 
times Miss M had several loans outstanding together. So Ive needed  to consider the total amount 
that Miss M needed to repay to Sunny  each  month.
The first loan that was given to Miss M was in the form of an open ended credit agreement. That 
agreement suggested that this form of borrowing wasnt suitable for use over an extended period of 
time. And I think the manner in which  Miss M used the facility,  certainly towards the end of her 
borrowing under this agreement, should have caused some  concerns to Sunny. But, when the facility 
was first granted, the expected  repayment  amounts,  what was apparent about  Miss Ms 
circumstances at the time, and the lack of any borrowing history with the lender, mean that I dont  
think it wouldve been proportionate for Sunny to ask her for the amount of information that would  be 
needed to decide the lending  was unsustainable.
I have thought  carefully about the manner  in which Miss M used the open ended nature of this facility. 
In a little over six months she borrowed nine times. But the majority of that borrowing took place  
towards the very end of that period. In addition Miss M returned  the outstanding balance of the facility  
to zero on a number of occasions before borrowing again. On balance I dont think that there is 
enough for me to conclude that Sunny should have intervened before it did in restricting Miss Ms use 
of this facility.
So I dont currently intend to uphold  her complaint about this loan.
Miss M took her second  loan from Sunny just a couple of weeks  after she had repaid the open ended 
credit facility. This loan was for more  than the credit limit shed been given before. And she was 
making a significant commitment in agreeing to repay the loan over a nine month period. I think that, 
given what had gone before, it would have been prudent here for Sunny to independently  check  the 
true state  of Miss Ms finances before agreeing any further lending.  I dont think it was reasonable for 
Sunny to base  its lending assessment on the information that Miss M was providing about her 
finances.
Ive looked at copies of Miss Ms bank statements from that time to see what better  checks would 
have shown to Sunny.  From  those statements  it is clear that Miss M was facing significant  problems  
managing her money. She was borrowing  from a number  of other short  term lenders  loans that she 
would need to repay  at the same time as any new borrowing from Sunny. And it appears that Miss M 
was spending significant  amounts each month on what seem to be online gambling transactions. 
Having seen  that information I dont think it would have been reasonable for a lender to conclude that 
Miss M was likely to repay any further borrowing  in a sustainable manner.
Ref: DRN25939315Miss Ms financial problems didnt improve  over the following months.  She continued  to borrow from 
Sunny, and other lenders,  on a regular basis. So the above circumstances continued to apply and 
I dont think Sunny should  have given loans  3 to 5 to Miss M either.
By the time Miss M asked for loan 6 I think that the overall  pattern of Miss Ms borrowing alone  should  
have led Sunny to reasonably conclude that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.
By this time Miss M had been borrowing,  with no more than a two week break, for over a year.  And in 
that time shed taken  13 separate advances from the lender. Miss M had repaid  two of the loans 
significantly earlier than she needed to. But then she had borrowed similar amounts  very shortly  
afterwards. I think that pattern of frequent borrowing and repaying early should  have indicated to 
Sunny that Miss M was most  likely having  significant problems managing her money.
When Miss M asked for loan 6 she already had two other loans outstanding with Sunny. The amount 
that she had outstanding had been increasing  consistently over the time she was borrowing. And 
although there was a brief reduction in the amount that Miss M owed to Sunny in the next couple  of 
months she continued to borrow heavily and consistently for a further two and a half years taking 
another 30 loans. Any time that Miss M managed to repay  her loans  she then took another, usually 
larger, loan just a few days  later. I think Sunny ought to have realised that it was more  likely  than not 
Miss M was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loans was leaving  in her 
finances and that her indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
I think  that Miss M lost out because Sunny continued to provide  borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  her indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time. The sheer number of 
loans was likely to have  had negative  implications on Miss Ms ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So I intend to uphold Miss Ms complaint about loans  2 to 36. Sunny needs to pay her some 
compensation.
