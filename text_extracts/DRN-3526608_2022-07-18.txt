The complaint
Mr R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest), treated him unfairly when 
not allowing a transfer of his Help to Buy ISA (HTB ISA) account.
What happened
On 4 November 2020, NatWest wrote to Mr R to inform him it had taken the decision to 
close his accounts including his HTB ISA. It said it would close the accounts in 60 days and 
it asked that he make alternative arrangements for his banking.
Mr R says he was told that he would be able to transfer his HTB ISA to another provider and 
organised this with another bank, Company A. Company A initially tried to transfer the HTB 
ISA from NatWest on 24 December 2020 after receiving Mr Rs instructions to do this. The 
attempt failed due to NatWest not being open and Company A made a number of other 
attempts to transfer the balance to the new HTB ISA with it over the coming weeks. 
On 14 January 2021 NatWest wrote to Company A and said the balance couldnt be 
transferred as the account was now closed.
Mr R says hes lost out on the bonus interest available with the HTB ISA scheme as well as 
huge amount of inconvenience and distress. He complained to NatWest about the service 
received and its actions.
NatWest said the HTB ISA would not have been able to be transferred. As part of its closure 
process it didnt allow customers to switch. So even if Mr R was given incorrect information, 
the account could never have been transferred.
Our investigator looked at the actions NatWest took (a separate complaint considered the 
closure notice and decision) this complaint focused on whether NatWest needed to do 
anything else in relation to the HTB ISA transfer. She felt the time frame indicated by when 
Company A first requested the transfer showed that, even if allowed by NatWest, it might 
have always been unlikely to have completed in time of the 60 day notice expiring.
She didnt believe NatWest had done anything wrong when it didnt allow the transfer to go 
ahead. And because it was not something that would have been possible, she felt the impact 
of the incorrect advice didnt result in Mr R losing out any further. So she didnt think 
NatWest needed to do anything else with the complaint.
Mr R disagreed. He said hes experienced a significant amount of distress and 
inconvenience as a result of trying to chase NatWest to arrange the transfer of his HTB ISA. 
He also spent time dealing with Company A which was effectively wasted time too. 
Because Mr R didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I agree with our investigator that NatWest didnt make an error when it didnt allow the 
transfer to go ahead. This is because the transfer wasnt allowed as part of its closure 
process. The error here is the failure on NatWest to tell Mr R this would not have been 
possible from the outset.
I appreciate Mr R has said he experienced a great deal of inconvenience and distress when 
trying to resolve this issue and organise the transfer of his HTB ISA in vein. And this 
combined with the inconvenience of needing to move all his accounts from NatWest too 
would have been a testing time. 
But I dont think it would be fair to ask NatWest to do anything else to put things right. The 
transfer would never have been available based on the system NatWest has in place so 
Mr Rs HTB ISA would have always been closed and the balance sent out. This means the 
bonus interest on the account would not have been paid anyway so Mr R hasnt lost out as a 
result of this. 
The question is whether I think it is fair that NatWest do anything else to reflect the 
inconvenience Mr R experienced. I dont think it does need to do anything else here. As Ive 
said I think it was likely a stressful time with the need to move all accounts away from 
NatWest following its decision to close these. And the lack of clarity on the options available 
for the HTB ISA would have added to this. But I dont think it is fair to expect NatWest to 
compensate Mr R.
NatWest provided Mr R with a full 60 days notice of its intention to close his accounts on 4 
November 2020. It might be this took a few days to be received as the notices are sent in 
hard copy over being  electronic ones, but I think this still gave ample notice. The timeline of 
events indicates that it wasnt until late into the notice period that Mr R contacted Company 
A with the request to transfer the HTB ISA. (I say this as the first attempt made by Company 
A to complete the transfer was on 24 December 2020). This, as our investigator said left little 
time for the transaction to be successful. This was requested over the Christmas period with 
a number of bank holidays too, so the chances of the transfer being actioned were slim. I 
think it was always likely to be a stressful endeavour with there being a chance, even if the 
account could be transferred, that the deadline would be missed.
Because of this, I dont think its fair to ask NatWest to pay Mr R any compensation for the 
distress and inconvenience of the process. Although I think it should have been clearer from 
the outset on the limitations on the HTB ISA and its transfer process. Mr R needed to 
transfer all of his accounts away from NatWest and incur a level of inconvenience. So while I 
understand the frustration of not having clear information from the start about the HTB ISA, I 
dont think NatWest needs to do anything more.
My final decision
I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 August 2022.
