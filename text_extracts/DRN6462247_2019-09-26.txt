K821x#15complaint
Ms W complains that Provident  Personal  Credit Limited (trading as Satsuma) gave  her loans 
she couldnt afford to repay. She asks that it refunds interest and charges, with 8% interest,  
removes all record  of the loans from her credit file and pays compensation for the hardship  
the loans caused.
background
Ms W took out five loans  with Satsuma between July 2014 and September 2017. All of the 
loans were repayable  in instalments.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. He said it wasnt 
wrong for Satsuma to offer Ms W loans 1 to 3. But it shouldnt have offered loans 4 and 5. 
Our adjudicator said proportionate checks would have shown that Ms W was unlikely to be 
able to repay the loans sustainably. She was having  problems managing her money and had 
loans outstanding with other short term lenders.
Our adjudicator said Satsuma should  refund interest and charges on loans 4 and 5, with 8% 
interest, and remove any negative information  about  them  from her credit  file.
Satsuma didnt agree, saying  it carried  out detailed checks which  showed  the loans were  
affordable. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Ms W took out the following  loans with Satsuma:

3 01.06.2016 £1,000 52 weeks £166 31.01.2017

5 13.09.2017 £440 52 weeks £73 28.09.2018
Satsuma needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
Ms Ws income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages  of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  that Satsuma should have done more  to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for a customer. Such factors include the customers  income  
particularly a lower  income   the amount of the loan repayments and the time over which  the 
Ref: DRN64622472loan is to be repaid,  and the number and frequency  of loans and the time over which the 
customer has been given  loans. Repeated borrowing can signal that the borrowing has 
become, or is becoming, unsustainable. There may even come  a point where the lending  
history and pattern  of lending itself demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Satsuma says it carried out detailed checks to ensure the loans were affordable.  Id note 
here that Satsuma was required  to establish  whether  Ms W could sustainably repay her 
loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence 
calculation.
loans 1 and 2 
When Ms W applied for loans 1 and 2 she said her monthly income was £1,300 and £1,800,  
respectively. Satsuma increased Ms Ws stated expenditure to take account of information 
from its credit checks and internal models.  Given the amounts of the loan repayments and 
that this was the first time Ms W borrowed from Satsuma,  I think the checks  made were 
proportionate. I dont think Satsuma had any reason to think loans 1 and 2 werent 
affordable.
loan 3
There was a gap of more than a year between Ms W repaying  loan 2 and taking out loan 3. 
She told Satsuma her monthly income was £1,550.  It estimated her expenditure using the 
information she provided and its own checks. Given the break in borrowing  and the amount 
of the repayments,  I think these checks were proportionate. I dont think  Satsuma had any 
reason to think Ms W would have  difficulty meeting  the repayments  for loan 3.
loans 4 and 5
When Ms W applied for loan 4, Satsuma  recorded her monthly income as £1,650. Based on 
what Ms W told it and its own checks and models, Satsuma assessed her monthly 
expenditure as about £1,200. Loan  3 was still outstanding at this time.
While the information  Satsuma had suggested  Ms W would be able to afford  the repayments 
for loans  3 and 4, I think that Satsuma should have considered at this point whether further 
lending was sustainable. 
The monthly repayments for loans 3 and 4 were lower (as compared to a loan repayable 
over a shorter period) because they were  to be repaid over 12 months. But this also meant  
Ms W had to be able to sustain the repayments  over this period. This was Ms Ws second 
request for a substantial loan in about  six months. When she asked for loan 4, in December 
2016, Loan 3 was outstanding with a balance of about £920 and six months of repayments  
remaining. I think Satsuma should  have asked Ms W for more information  about her credit  
commitments, including her short term commitments. If what she told it wasnt  credible or 
wasnt consistent with the information it had from its credit check (as seems to have been 
the case here) Satsuma  should have asked  Ms W for evidence  to support what she said.  
Ms W provided a copy of her credit report.  This shows that when she took out loan 4 she 
had seven short term loans outstanding.  
I think if Satsuma had looked into Ms Ws situation  more carefully it would have known about 
her use of short term loans. I think this would have been enough  to alert Satsuma to a 
Ref: DRN64622473possible problem  that Ms W was in financial  difficulties or was dependant  on short  term 
loans. I dont think further borrowing was sustainable.
So Im upholding  Ms Ws complaint about loans 4 and 5. Satsuma  should:
refund  all interest and charges Ms W paid on loans  4 and 5;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Ms Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Satsuma to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Ms W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order Provident Personal Credit  Limited to pay 
the compensation and take the steps set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 October  2019.
