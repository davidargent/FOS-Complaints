The complaint
Mr H has complained that Hitachi Capital (UK) Plc rejected his claim against it under 
Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
  
What happened
Mr H bought solar panels for his home in 2014 when he was 73 years old. The purchase 
was funded by a loan from Hitachi which was repayable over eight years. Hitachi is therefore 
liable for the acts and omissions of the installer under the relevant legislation. In this case, 
that relates to the installer misleading Mr H into believing that the panels would be pay for 
themselves within a few years (our adjudicator described this as being self-funding), which 
they were very unlikely to do.
Mr Hs complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators. They thought that the benefits 
of the panels were mis-represented to Mr H as being self-funding, and that fair redress 
would be for the loan to be restructured to make the panels cost no more than the benefit 
they would provide over an eight-year period. This restructure should be based on evidence 
of the actual performance of the panels, and a number of assumptions on future 
performance. 
Hitachi disagreed, suggesting that Mr H hadnt argued that the solar panels were 
misrepresented as self-funding. Our adjudicator explained why they had used this phrase. 
But Hitachi did not agree, and the complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Hitachi is familiar with all the rules, regulations, and good industry practice we consider when 
looking at complaints of this type, and indeed our well-established approach. So, I dont 
consider it necessary to set all of that out in this decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, for the same reasons as those explained 
by the adjudicator, I uphold this case. In brief, that is because the evidence supports the 
conclusion that a misrepresentation took place and Mr H was not given clear information to 
demonstrate that the solar panels would not be self-funding but would equate to an 
additional cost for him.
Although Mr H didnt use the phrase self-funding in his complaint, he described the 
following:
the representative explained the benefits of the system and advised that Mr H would benefit 
from savings on his electricity bills and payments from the feed in tariff (FIT). The total 
benefits receivable would cover the overall costs associated with the system within a few 
years of installation.
I think it is highly likely that Mr H was told this  given it matches what was shown in the 
sales literature he was given. And, noting that the loan was repayable over an eight-year 
term, I think that provides context for what was meant by a few years. In this context, I 
would expect a few years to be less than the eight years of the loan term. So, to pay for itself 
within the loan term, the benefits of the system (in energy savings and FIT payments) 
wouldve had to at least match the monthly loan repayments during that time. In other words, 
the system would be self-funding. But the benefits of the system did not do this (and were 
never likely to).
So, I think that Hitachi didnt treat Mr H fairly and he lost out because of what Hitachi did 
wrong. And this means that it should put things right.
  
Putting things right
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Mr Hs complaint for Hitachi to put things right by recalculating the original 
loan based on the known and assumed savings and income to Mr H from the solar panels 
over an eight-year period so he pays no more than that, and he keeps the solar panel 
system, and any future benefits once the loan has ended. 
In the event the calculation shows that Mr H is paying (or has paid) more than he should 
have, then Hitachi needs to reimburse him accordingly. Should the calculation show that the 
misrepresentation has not caused a financial loss, then the calculation should be shared with 
Mr H by way of explanation. 
If the calculation shows there is a loss, then where the loan is ongoing, I require Hitachi to 
restructure Mr Hs loan. It should recalculate the loan to put Mr H in a position where the 
solar panel system is cost neutral over an eight-year period.
Normally, by recalculating the loan this way, a consumers monthly repayments would 
reduce, meaning that they wouldve paid more each month than they shouldve done 
resulting in an overpayment balance. And as a consumer would have been deprived of the 
monthly overpayment, I would expect a business to add 8% simple interest from the date of 
the overpayment to the date of settlement. 
So, I think the fairest resolution would be to let Mr H have the following options as to how he 
would like his overpayments to be used:
A. the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and he 
continues to make his current monthly payment resulting in the loan finishing early,
B. the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and he 
pays a new monthly payment until the end of the loan term, 
C. the overpayments are returned to Mr H and he continues to make his current monthly 
payment resulting in his loan finishing early, or 
D. the overpayments are returned to Mr H and he pays a new monthly payment until the 
end of the loan term.
If Mr H accepts my decision, he should indicate on the acceptance form which option he 
wishes to accept.
If Mr H has settled the loan, Hitachi should pay him the difference between what he paid in 
total and what the loan should have been under the restructure above, with 8% interest.
If Mr H has settled the loan by refinancing, he should supply evidence of the refinance, to 
Hitachi and Hitachi should: 1. Refund the extra Mr H paid each month with the Hitachi loan.
2. Add simple interest from the date of each payment until Mr H receives his refund.
3. Refund the extra Mr H paid with the refinanced loan.
4. Add simple interest from the date of each payment until Mr H receives his refund.
5. Pay Mr H the difference between the amount now owed and the amount he wouldve 
owed if the system had been self-funding
Im satisfied that there was sufficient information available at the time that Mr H first 
contacted Hitachi that means the claim should have been upheld. I direct that Hitachi should 
pay Â£100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Hs complaint. Hitachi Capital (UK) Plc 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 February 2022.
