The complaint
Mr E complains that Metro Bank PLC trading as RateSetter (RateSetter) is holding him 
liable for the debt on a loan he says he didnt consent to. 
What happened
The background to this complaint is well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything 
here. In brief summary, in February 2023 a loan was taken out with RateSetter in Mr Es 
name for Â£10,000. Mr E subsequently got in touch with RateSetter to let it know he didnt 
consent to the loan. RateSetter investigated things and ultimately couldnt reach agreement 
with Mr E, so he referred his complaint about RateSetter to us. Our Investigator couldnt 
resolve things informally, so the case has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to not uphold this complaint for materially the same reasons as 
our Investigator.
It doesnt seem to be disputed that at the time of the loan application Mr E was in touch with, 
and being scammed by, a third-party. However, this doesnt automatically mean RateSetter 
should be required to do more than it has offered to (for example, by removing the loan from 
Mr Es credit file and/or writing it off). 
Mr E was fully aware at the time that hed given his ClearScore and banking information to 
the third-party and that theyd applied for the RateSetter loan in his name. The application 
contained Mr Es correct details. And Mr E contacted RateSetter about the loan before it was 
granted (to check when it would be paid into his account). There is no question: Mr E knew 
about the loan, and he knew the funds were paid into his bank account. 
I understand the loan funds, or some of them, were then moved out of Mr Es bank account. 
And Mr E says the whole thing was a trick by the third-party and he therefore didnt consent 
to the loan with RateSetter. But I dont agree: I think its clear Mr E did consent to the loan 
with RateSetter, its just he didnt realise at the time the third-party was otherwise tricking 
him. Mr E has my sympathy in this regard, but I dont think this was RateSetters fault. 
RateSetter granted the loan to Mr E in good faith, in circumstances where Mr E was fully 
aware of the loan and the funds were paid into Mr Es account from where he had use of 
them.
RateSetter has accepted Mr E has been the victim of a scam and it has offered to remove 
the loan fee and interest, on the basis that Mr E would remain liable for the capital. Given 
what Ive said  about RateSetter not having done anything wrong and unfortunately Mr E 
being tricked by a third-party which wasnt RateSetters fault  Im satisfied this is fair and 
reasonable. 
My final decision
For the reasons explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 December 2023.
