The complaint
Mr E complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) reduced the credit limit on his credit card 
and marked his credit file.
What happened
Mr E had a credit card with HSBC. The limit was £8050. The minimum payment due on his 
January 2021 statement was £153.84 and was due by 2 February 2021. He paid £310 in on 
6 February 2021. A late fee of £12 was debited on 3 February 2021. Mr Es limit was 
reduced to £6,500 in February 2021.
Mr E complained. Hed been a loyal customer of HSBC for over 40 years and had always 
paid on time  usually much more than the minimum amount. Now  his credit limit had been 
reduced  when he needed it  and his credit file had been affected. He felt that HSBC had 
acted unfairly and too quickly, particularly in the light of the COVID 19 pandemic  when they 
should be supporting him. 
HSBC said Mr Es limit had been reduced because of the missed payment in February 2021, 
and this was in line with the terms and conditions on the account. He could re-apply for an 
increase in six months time.
Mr E brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said HSBCs terms and 
conditions gave them the right to reduce a credit limit if they thought that the credit risk had 
worsened. Also, Mr E had made late payments in May 2020, June 2020, and July 2020. At 
that point, Mr Es limit had been reduced to £8050. She reviewed what happened in 
February 2021 and could see that Mr E paid late in that month  so HSBC had acted 
reasonably in making the late payment charge and also notifying the credit reference 
agencies. It was within HSBCs commercial judgement in setting the credit limits that they 
felt were appropriate.
Mr E disagreed and asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see where Mr E is coming from. Hes been with HSBC for 45 years. Hes been 
struggling in the light of the pandemic, and yet had still managed to make his payments to 
his credit card  usually more than the minimum needed  he said, without fail. But when he 
paid only four days late  due to an oversight  he feels that HSBC were quick to penalise 
him. And he said his credit file was affected and his credit score had reduced as a result.
Ive looked closely at what happened. I can see that Mr E usually paid in a lot more than the 
monthly minimum amount needed  and that his debt was reducing, as he didnt make any 
purchases. Ive also seen that he did pay four days late in February 2021. I can appreciate 
that he considers that HSBCs actions were unfair in reducing his limit for this. 
But equally, I can see that Mr E paid late on three occasions in 2020  in May, June and 
July. On 7 May 2020 HSBC sent a letter to say that £148.05 due hadnt been made. On 9 
June 2020 a further letter was sent stating that the payment hadnt been made and so the 
overdue balance was then £295.15. On 4 July 2021, HSBC wrote again, and payment of 
£100.15 had been missed. Another letter was sent on 9 July 2020 stating that the overdue 
amount was then £296.34. At this point, HSBC reduced Mr Es limit to £8,050 from £8,100. 
HSBC wrote to Mr E on five occasions  and the letters also asked that he should contact 
HSBC to discuss matters if he was struggling to pay. For example, the letter dated 9 July 
2020 said, if youre experiencing financial difficultythen please contact us and we may 
be able to agree a suitable repayment solution. 
HSBC showed us evidence that they also texted or emailed Mr E on seven occasions 
between May 2020 and July 2020 to discuss his account. So  HSBC had been trying to 
talk to Mr E about his situation and to offer help. HSBC were offering support to customers 
throughout the pandemic in line with government guidelines. We asked them about this, 
and they told us that they would have discussed this help with Mr E if hed contacted them. 
So  Mr E had paid late on several occasions in 2020  and so it seems to me that HSBC 
would have taken what happened in 2020 into account in reducing his limit to £6,500 in 
February 2021. This seems quite reasonable to me. And I agree with our investigator  it is 
for HSBC to make its own judgement on whether it lends money to customers, and how 
much  its not for this service to tell HSBC what to do in that respect.
We asked HSBC again about the impact on Mr Es credit file. In general, lenders must 
advise credit reference agencies (CRAs) of accurate data  thats an obligation. But in Mr 
Es case, as his account was opened before 2003, he hadnt consented that HSBC provide 
data to the CRAs. So  HSBC told us that the late payments were not advised to the CRAs. 
So, his credit score couldnt have been affected by what happened with HSBC  this is an 
important point as Mr E was particularly concerned about that.
I can see that Mr E feels strongly about what happened and so will be disappointed by my 
decision. But in all the circumstances, I think HSBC acted reasonably and I wont be asking 
them to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 July 2021.
