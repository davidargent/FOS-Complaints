K822xComplaint
Mr F is unhappy  that Capital One (Europe) plc used  part of the compensation from a        
mis-sold payment protection  insurance (PPI) policy to clear arrears it says were on his credit 
card account.
Background 
In 2012 Mr F complained  about the sale of PPI on his Capital One credit  card.
In November 2012 Capital One wrote to Mr F. In its letter it agreed to uphold the complaint. 
Capital One said it would  refund all the PPI premiums and associated interest he had been 
charged, it also offered to pay compensatory interest calculated at 8% per annum.  The total 
offer was for £367.52.
For some  reason which isnt clear  the compensation was never  paid to Mr F.
In 2018 Mr F contacted  Capital One again.  
Capital One apologised for not processing  the compensation in 2012. It said it had now 
carried out a new, updated calculation. Capital  One said it was now offering Mr F a total of 
£415.90.
Capital One then wrote to Mr F on 21 December 2018 to say it had used £312.25 of the 
compensation to clear  arrears on the account.  It sent Mr F a cheque for £103.65.
But Mr F says he didnt  owe any amount on his credit card. Mr F says that in 2005 he 
contacted Capital One and it agreed  to remove  from the account all the charges for late 
payment and being over his limit if he paid the remaining £1,030.76.  
Mr F says he paid two amounts in November and December 2005, one of £450.76 and one 
of £580 as agreed. So, Mr F says there should be no outstanding balance on his account.
Capital One says it has no records of what was discussed at the time Mr F made  the two 
payments, but it says the sum of £312.25 remains  outstanding on the account so it is fair for 
it to use part of the compensation to clear  this amount.
An adjudicator from this service said it was fair for Capital One to use part of the 
compensation to remove the outstanding  arrears.
Mr F disagreed with the adjudicators findings, so the complaint was been passed to me.
In November 2019 I issued my provisional  findings  on this complaint and invited  both parties 
to comment and send  me any additional evidence they wanted  me to think  about. A copy  of 
my provisional decision is attached and forms part of this final decision.
Ref: DRN58274872My provisional findings were that I was intending  to uphold Mr Fs complaint, my main 
reasons were:
Taking everything into account  I think it is most  likely Mr Fs recollection is correct  
and in 2005 Capital One agreed  to remove or waive the late payment and over-limit 
charges if Mr F paid the remaining balance. 
It follows that in this case I think the amount  outstanding that Capital One wants  to 
clear by using some  of the compensation is not made up of money borrowed by       
Mr F, or of unpaid PPI premiums.  I think the £312.25 is most likely made up of fees 
added to the account for late payment or for being over the credit  limit.
For this reason, I did not think it was fair in this particular case for Capital One to use 
any of Mr Fs compensation  to offset  against  his account. 
And in any event, I noted  that Capital One agreed to pay Mr F compensation of 
£367.52 in November 2012  without  any mention  of offsetting yet failed to make this 
payment.
I also set out in my provisional findings  what Capital  One needed to do to put things right.
Mr F has contacted us to say he accepts the findings set out in the provisional  decision.
Capital One has also contacted us to say it now agreed to uphold  the complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither Capital One nor Mr F have replied with any new evidence  or points for me to 
consider. Capital One has agreed  to uphold  this complaint. Therefore I see no reason to 
depart from the findings I set out in my provisional  decision  in November 2019.
Putting things  right
I note that Capital One originally made  Mr F an offer of £367.52  in November 2012 which 
was never  paid. I see that offer didnt make any mention of offsetting. So if everything had 
been done correctly in 2012 Mr F would have received £367.52 net of tax in November 
2012.
It follows that to put Mr F in the financial position hed be now in if things had not gone wrong 
Capital One needs to:
Pay Mr F the sum of £367.52.
Work  out and pay Mr F compensatory interest  on £367.52 for the time hes been  out 
of pocket. The interest rate should  be 8% simple per year*  calculated  from November 
2012.
I understand Capital  One has already paid Mr F £103.65, so it can deduct this 
amount from what it owes him.
Ref: DRN58274873* HM Revenue & Customs requires Capital One to take off tax from this interest. Capital 
One must  give Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision  I uphold Mr Fs complaint and 
direct Capital One (Europe) plc to pay Mr F compensation as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 January 2020.

Complaint
Mr F is unhappy  that Capital One (Europe) plc used  part of the compensation from a        
mis-sold payment protection  insurance (PPI) policy to clear arrears it says were on his credit 
card account.
Ref: DRN58274874Background
In 2012 Mr F complained  about the sale of PPI on his Capital One credit  card.
In November 2012 Capital One wrote to Mr F. In its letter it agreed to uphold the complaint. 
Capital One said it would  refund all the PPI premiums and associated interest he had been 
charged, it also offered to pay compensatory interest calculated at 8% per annum.  The total 
offer was for £367.52.
For some  reason which isnt clear  the compensation was never  paid to Mr F.
In 2018 Mr F contacted  Capital One again.  
Capital One apologised for not processing  the compensation in 2012. It said it had now 
carried out a new, updated calculation. Capital  One said it was now offering Mr F a total of 
£415.90.
Capital One then wrote to Mr F on 21 December 2018 to say it had used £312.25 of the 
compensation to clear  arrears on the account.  It sent Mr F a cheque for £103.65.
But Mr F says he didnt  owe any amount on his credit card. Mr F says that in 2005 he 
contacted Capital One and it agreed  to remove  from the account all the charges for late 
payment and being over his limit if he paid the remaining £1,030.76.  
Mr F says he paid two amounts in November and December 2005, one of £450.76 and one 
of £580 as agreed. So, Mr F says there should be no outstanding balance on his account.
Capital One says it has no records of what was discussed at the time Mr F made  the two 
payments, but it says the sum of £312.25 remains  outstanding on the account so it is fair for 
it to use part of the compensation to clear  this amount.
An adjudicator from this service said it was fair for Capital One to use part of the 
compensation to remove the outstanding  arrears.
Mr F disagreed with the adjudicators findings, so the complaint has been passed to me.
My provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  the sale of PPI on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding 
this case. 
Capital One has agreed to uphold the complaint about the mis-sale of the policy.  So I wont 
look into how the PPI policy  came to be sold to Mr F. In this decision I am looking at how 
Capital One has compensated Mr F.
Having done so I dont think Capital Ones approach in this particular complaint is fair and I 
think it needs to do something different. Ill explain why:
What was agreed in 2005?
Ref: DRN58274875Ive firstly  looked into what happened in 2005  when Mr F made  two payments to his Capital 
One account. 
We contacted Capital One to see if it had any contact records  from 2005. Capital One has 
told us it has no records of what was agreed. It says the earliest notes on file date from 
2012.
I can see from the transaction list that Mr F fell behind with his credit card payments in 2005. 
From what  Ive seen he didnt make a payment  from November 2004 until October 2005. 
Then in November 2005 he made a payment of £450.76, followed by another  of £580  in 
December 2005.
Mr F tells us that he had contact with Capital One in November 2005  and was told that if he 
paid £1,030.76 then Capital One would remove the charges it had added to the account for 
late payment and for being over the credit card limit.
Mr F has been  consistent in his testimony and looking at the transaction  history  it does seem 
to me most likely that Mr F made two payments totalling a specific  amount, which suggests 
some agreement was likely  reached  with Capital One at the time. Taking  everything  into 
account I think it is most likely Mr Fs recollection is correct and Capital One agreed to 
remove or waive the charges if Mr F paid the remaining balance.  
Offsetting
 
Ive next considered whether it is fair for Capital One to use part of the compensation to 
offset against the balance  of Mr Fs account.
Generally, Id think it is fair for a business to use compensation from a mis-sold credit  card 
PPI policy  to offset against a balance which may have  been written off in the past.  Or if a 
consumer had short-settled  their account.  Thats  because the amount written off is 
generally made up of money borrowed by the consumer  and not repaid. Some of the    
written-off balance  may also be made up of PPI premiums which  had been added  to the 
account but never actually paid for by the consumer.
However, in this case I think the amount  outstanding that Capital One wishes  to clear by 
using some of the compensation  is not made up of money borrowed by Mr F, or of unpaid 
PPI premiums. I think the £312.25  is most  likely made up of fees added  to the account for 
late payment or for being over the credit  limit.
And I think its likely  Capital  One agreed to remove or waive these charges in 2005. I think 
thats a very different  scenario to it agreeing to write off part of the outstanding debt actually 
borrowed by Mr F in return  for a short settlement.
For this reason, I dont  think it is fair in this particular case for Capital One to use any of        
Mr Fs compensation to offset against his account.  
And in any event, I note that Capital One agreed to pay Mr F compensation of £367.52           
in November 2012 without any mention of offsetting  yet failed to make  this payment.
Putting things  right
I next need to think about how Capital One should  put things right.
Ref: DRN58274876I note that Capital One originally made  Mr F an offer of £367.52  in November 2012 which 
was never  paid. I see that offer didnt make any mention of offsetting. So if everything had 
been done correctly in 2012 Mr F would have received £367.52 net of tax.
It follows that to put Mr F in the financial position hed be now in if things had not gone wrong 
Capital One needs to:
Pay Mr F the sum of £367.52.
Work  out and pay Mr F compensatory interest  on £367.52 for the time hes been  out 
of pocket. The interest rate should  be 8% simple per year*  calculated  from November 
2012.
I understand Capital  One has already paid Mr F £103.65, so it can deduct this 
amount from what it owes him.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Capital One to take off tax from this interest. Capital 
One must  give Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my provisional decision
For the reasons  set out above, but subject to both parties responses to this provisional 
decision, Im intending  to uphold Mr Fs complaint and direct Capital One (Europe) plc to pay 
Mr F compensation as set out above.
