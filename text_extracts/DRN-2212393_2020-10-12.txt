The complaint
Mr V is unhappy with the way PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA dealt with a chargeback 
dispute and would now like the money it deducted from his account to be refunded. 
What happened
Mr. V sold an item using PayPal. He was asked by the buyer to post it to an address other 
than the one on the buyers PayPal account. Mr. V says that, before doing so, he contacted 
PayPal to ask if this would be allowed and was told that, provided it was sent using a tracked 
delivery service and signed for, it wouldnt matter that the payment had been made with a 
different name and address.
Mr. V went ahead and sent the parcel to the alternate address but, shortly after, the owner of 
the PayPal account queried the payment. PayPal reversed the payment of £720 and told Mr. 
V that he wasnt covered by the seller guarantee as hed sent it to an address other than the 
one shown on the transaction details.
 
Mr. V says he followed PayPals advice and feels its unfair to hold him liable for the disputed 
payment. Hes also unhappy that PayPal has declined to provide a recording or a transcript 
of his call of 7 November. 
PayPal says it cant disclose the call or a transcript for privacy reasons but that its listened to 
the call and doesnt agree with what Mr. V has said. It says the terms of the seller guarantee 
are clear that it only applies if the item is sent to the address shown on the PayPal account 
and, as Mr. V didnt do this, he isnt protected.
Our investigator noted what PayPal had said about why it couldnt provide the recording or 
notes of Mr. Vs calls. As a result hed had to rely on the information available and, in the 
absence of any information from PayPal, he considered Mr. Vs account was credible. He felt 
it probable Mr. V had been misinformed and for that reason, it was fair for PayPal to now put 
him back in the position he would have been in if this error hadnt happened. He 
recommended PayPal refund Mr. V the £720 debited from his account and pay him £100 for 
the trouble and upset hed had as a result of what had happened.
Mr. V accepted the recommendation. PayPal however rejected it and repeated its view that 
Mr V hadnt complied with the terms and conditions of the seller guarantee and wasnt 
covered by it. It said it wasnt able to provide recordings of calls externally to protect its 
employees but having listened to the call, it didnt agree it had given incorrect information. It 
asked for the complaint to be referred to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I should explain that where theres no information on any particular point - or the information 
available is incomplete or disputed as it is here on some issues - Ive looked at whats more 
likely to have happened, taking into account the circumstances of the case, and made my 
decision on the balance of probabilities.
Mr V says he called PayPal on 7 November 2019 to check if he could post the item to a 
different address and was told that he could, provided he used a secure and signed means 
of postage. Ive seen he followed this up the next day with an email in which he specifically 
referred to the first call and the advice and asked for reassurance.  PayPal didnt directly 
answer the query in this email but provided further information about the guarantee process 
including some additional requirements you need to meet for Seller protection  which 
stated that a seller must only send the item to the address on the transaction details even if 
the buyer had contacted them direct to ask for it to go elsewhere. PayPal says Mr. V didnt 
comply and as a result, isnt covered by the seller guarantee.
In general Id agree that the terms and conditions are clear but, in this case, Mr. V says he 
specifically raised this issue with PayPal before sending the item and received an assurance 
that it would be allowed. If thats the case, then it would be unfair to hold Mr. V responsible 
for acting on the information he was given.
PayPal doesnt dispute that Mr. V called on 7 November or suggest any other reason for this 
call other than, as Mr V has said, to check the position before posting the parcel.  Although 
PayPal doesnt agree with what Mr. V has said, unfortunately it hasnt provided a copy of the 
call recording or any notes to support its view.  For that reason Ive made my decision on the 
information available. Having done so Im satisfied Mr. V has provided a very clear account 
of what happened, along with precise timings, dates and receipts, and I find its detail, 
consistency and clarity persuasive.
In the circumstances I think it more likely than not that Mr. V understood from this call that 
there wouldnt be a problem in sending this item to a different address provided he used an 
appropriate means of postage and if thats the case, then it would be unreasonable to hold 
Mr. V liable now for following that advice.
Putting things right
I understand from Mr V that PayPal has said it doesnt intend to pursue him for the 
outstanding balance on his account. This seems a reasonable approach but I havent seen 
confirmation of this. To avoid any misunderstanding, therefore, I confirm that my decision is 
that PayPal should now refund Mr. V the £720 it debited from his account so that there is 
nothing further for him to pay in connection with this transaction. Further its clear that the 
ongoing confusion and the time it has gone on has had a significant impact on Mr V and for 
that reason I consider its fair for PayPal to also pay Mr V £100 compensation for his upset 
and inconvenience.My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA , if 
it hasnt already done so, to refund to Mr V the £720 debited from his PayPal account and to 
pay him £100 compensation for his upset and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2020.
