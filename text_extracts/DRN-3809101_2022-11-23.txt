The complaint
Mr F complains that Mulsanne Insurance Company Limited mishandled his claim on a motor 
insurance policy.
Where I refer to Mulsanne, I refer to the above-named insurance company and I include 
intermediaries and others insofar as I hold Mulsanne responsible for their acts or omissions.
What happened
The subject matter of the claim and the complaint is a luxury sports car, with a large engine 
and all-wheel drive, first registered in 2015.
Mr F bought the car in the summer of 2020.
In late July 2021, Mr F used a price comparison website. For the year from early August 
2021, he took out a comprehensive policy branded with the name of a supermarket bank 
acting as an insurance intermediary. 
The certificate of insurance was signed by another company for and on behalf of 
Mulsanne. Any claim for damage (except to a windscreen) was subject to excesses totalling 
£1,300.00.
The policy documents recorded the value of the car as £35,150.00. The premium for the 
year was about £1,100.00.
By late September 2022, the car had a recorded mileage of about 22,000. Unfortunately, the 
car suffered flood damage and Mulsanne said it was a total loss.
Mulsanne told Mr F that when he took out the policy, he gave an incorrect value for the car. 
Mulsanne said that he had made a qualifying misrepresentation under Consumer Insurance 
(Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012 (CIDRA). So Mulsanne said it would make  a 
proportional settlement.
Mulsannes engineers report said the retail value had been £47,420.00. Mulsanne paid Mr F 
on the following basis:
90% of £47,420.00  = £42,678.00 
less £1,300.00 excess  = £41,378.00
Mr F complained to Mulsanne that it hadnt paid him enough.
By a final response dated early December 2021, Mulsanne turned down the complaint.
Mr F brought his complaint to us in late March 2022.
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. She didnt think it had 
been fair and reasonable for Mulsanne to decide that Mr F had made a qualifying 
misrepresentation. She thought that CAP valued the car at £50,750 and Glasss valued it at 
£47,420. She recommended that Mulsanne should:
1. use the average of £49,085.00 to calculate Mr Fs settlement, less the policy excess 
and less the amount that he has already received; and
2. add 8% simple interest from the date of the initial settlement to the date that the 
additional amount is paid to Mr F.
Mulsanne disagreed with the investigators opinion. It asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. It says, in summary, that:
Its underwriting criteria show that it would decline to cover a car over £40,000 unless 
a tracker was fitted.
When you put in a car registration on the comparison website, it doesnt state 
anywhere about the car value. But the complainant did get sent documentation which 
he has a duty to check over to see if everything was correct. He knew what the value 
was and didnt take reasonable care to advise it was wrong at any time. 
Mr F didnt disagree with the investigators opinion. He says, in summary, that:
The used car market value increased significantly during the months before the 
incident happened.
The vehicle had a comprehensive service history with no expense spared on care. All 
keys were present. 
The car itself was in impeccable condition. It had a brand-new windscreen and tyres 
and had been fully serviced at a cost of more than £2,250.00 just weeks before the 
incident occurred.
It would have commanded top price at sale. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr F has shown us that he bought the car in the summer of 2020 and paid £42,000.00 for it.
In the summer of 2021, the policy schedule and the statement of fact included a figure of 
£35,150.00. That was an under-estimate (judging by the valuation in September 2021). And 
 from what hes said  Mr F believed his cars value in the summer of 2021 was about 
£42,000.00. 
The statement of fact started as follows:
Car Insurance - Statement of Fact
Important Information
Please read this document carefully as it is a record of the information provided by 
you that your policy is based on. If you are satisfied that, to the best of your 
knowledge & belief, the information contained below is correct, you do not need to do 
anything however if any of the facts are incomplete or incorrect, you should contact 
us on 0345 . Failure to do so could result in:
any claim you make being rejected or not fully paid
your insurance being cancelled or treated as though it never existeddifferent terms being applied to your policy or your premium increasing.
So  Mr F shouldve contacted Mulsanne to correct the figure of £35,150.00.
But £35,150.00 wasnt a round number, Mr F denies that he suggested it and Mulsanne 
hasnt shown how that figure came to be in the policy documents. Whats more, Im not 
satisfied that Mulsanne had asked Mr F a clear question about the value of the car.
So I dont consider that he failed to take reasonable care to avoid an incorrect answer. Im 
not satisfied that Mr F made a misrepresentation.
Even if he had made a misrepresentation, Mulsanne would have to show that it made a 
difference. Mulsanne has said that if Mr F hadnt given a figure under £40,000.00, it wouldnt 
have offered insurance. But its underwriting criteria dont say that. And Mulsanne didnt 
decline the claim.
Rather, Mulsanne said that the misrepresentation made the difference that Mr F only paid 
90% of the premium that he shouldve paid. But theres not enough evidence of that either. 
So - even if Mr F had made a misrepresentation  it wasnt a qualifying misrepresentation 
under CIDRA. 
I dont consider that it was fair for Mulsanne to pay the claim proportionally. I consider that it 
shouldve paid the pre-loss market value (less the policy excess).
In assessing market value, we expect insurers to look at the retail figures in the trade guides.
Ive noted the make, model, age, specification, mileage and condition of Mr Fs car. For a car 
like his at the time of its loss, the investigator found retail figures in the trade guides as 
follows:
CAPs £50,750.00 
Glasss £47,420.00
Cazoo not available
In other circumstances, I wouldve said that both £47,420.00 and £50,750.00 wouldve been  
reasonable figures. And Im not persuaded that Mr Fs expenditure in the summer of 2021 
had added to the value of the car.
But Mr Fs car was rare and in excellent condition. So he was likely to find it difficult and 
expensive to replace it. Therefore I find it fair and reasonable to say that the market value of 
the car immediately before the loss was £49,085.00.
After it had deducted the policy excess of £1,300.00, Mulsanne paid £41,378.00. 
Putting things right
So I find it fair and reasonable to direct Mulsanne to pay Mr F a further £6,407.00.
Ive thought about whether Mulsannes stance  which Ive found unfair  caused Mr F extra 
distress and inconvenience for which I should direct compensation. But Mulsanne stopped 
short of suggesting that Mr F had deliberately misrepresented the value of his car. And I 
conclude that much of his distress and inconvenience was caused by Mulsannes under-
payment, for which interest is sufficient compensation.As he has been out of pocket since the accident and claim, I find it fair and reasonable to 
direct Mulsanne to pay interest at our usual rate. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I direct 
Mulsanne Insurance Company Limited to pay Mr F:
1. in addition to its payment of £41,378.00, a further £6,407.00 for his damaged car; 
and
2. simple interest on that amount of £6,407.00 at a yearly rate of 8% from the date of 
his claim to the date of its further payment. If Mulsanne considers that its required by 
HM Revenue & Customs to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr F 
how much its taken off. It should also give him a certificate showing this if he asks for 
one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2022.
