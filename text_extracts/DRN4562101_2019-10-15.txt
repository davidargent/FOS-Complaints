K820x#14complaint
Mrs E complains that National Westminster Bank Plc told her it had closed all her accounts 
when it hadnt.  She also believes  shes still owed her money, which  shed like refunded. And 
she isnt happy  a refund of interest  and charges on her personal  loan wasnt paid to her 
directly.
background
Mrs E had a number of accounts with NatWest including a business account,  personal 
account and personal loan account.  In 2009, she defaulted on her personal  loan and says 
NatWest told her it had closed all her accounts.
But NatWest  denied  telling Mrs E it had closed her accounts and said it continued to send 
her correspondence  and statements relating to some of her accounts after 2009. It also said 
after Mrs E defaulted, it transferred all of her accounts to its recoveries department  and that 
Mrs E agreed repayment plans between 2010 and 2015.
In June 2018 Mrs E received a Notice of Sums in Arrears (NOSIA) letter  from NatWest  
telling her that shed  been  overcharged on her loan.  As a result, just over £2,500 of interest 
and charges that had been applied to Mrs Es loan were refunded.  But this refund was used 
by NatWest to offset Mrs Es loan balance, which she wasnt  happy  with as she had wanted 
the funds to be paid to her directly.
She said shortly after this she found out her accounts hadnt been closed in 2009  and she 
complained to NatWest  that it hadnt  closed  her accounts as shed been told. She said she 
wanted them  to remain open and she thought the bank  still owed her money, which  she 
wanted returned to her. 
But NatWest  didnt  uphold  Mrs Es complaint because  it said it hadnt told her it would close 
her accounts  and it didnt  owe her any money.  It also said there was a negative balance  on 
her business  account due to charges, which it had decided to refund a gesture of goodwill. In 
relation to NatWest  using  the NOSIA refund to offset what Mrs E owed on her loan, it said it 
had acted in line with the terms and conditions of her account. So it didnt  think  it had made 
a mistake.
Mrs E didnt agree and brought her complaint to us. While out investigator empathised with 
her, they didnt  uphold her complaint. In relation to her complaint about her business 
account, our investigator  thought it was more  likely  than not NatWest hadnt  told her it had 
closed her account. And they explained  why they werent able to tell NatWest  to reopen her 
account. After they investigated Mrs Es complaint about her personal loan they thought 
NatWest hadnt  done  anything wrong in using the NOSIA refund to offset her loan balance.   
But Mrs E disagreed and asked for the matter to be referred to an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   Having done so, Im not persuaded 
NatWest made a mistake  here or acted unfairly. And Im not going  to be able to help Mrs E 
in the way she would like. Ill explain why.
Ref: DRN45621012Mrs Es brought a number of complaints to our service. Ill deal with those relating to her 
business and loan account within this final decision. And Ill deal with her concerns about her 
personal account separately because Ill need to determine whether that complaint has been 
brought to our service in time for us to be able to consider it.
I invited Mrs E to provide  fresh  evidence or comments not already submitted before I drafted 
my final decision. She hasnt provided  any further  information to this service. So, Ill base  my 
decision here on the evidence Ive already seen from Mrs E and NatWest.  
Business account:
Mrs E complains  that her business account  wasnt closed in 2009,  which she says NatWest 
told her it would do. She wants  NatWest to refund monies she paid into her account.  She 
also wants her account to be reopened as it has now been closed.
NatWest has told our service that it isnt able to provide  any evidence of statements being 
sent out after December 2009 for this account. And it also isnt clear what contact NatWest  
had with Mrs E about this account. This means that NatWest isnt able to demonstrate  how it 
made Mrs E aware that her business  account remained open post 2009. But I dont have  to 
make a jurisdiction decision here because  NatWest has consented  to us considering Mrs Es 
complaint about  her business account. This means I can assess the merits of her complaint.
With that in mind its my view, having carefully  considered what both Mrs E and NatWest  
have said here, that its more likely  than not that Mrs E wasnt  told her account would be 
closed in 2009. Ill explain why.
In 2009 this account was transferred to NatWests recoveries department. This made this 
account non-operational. But there was still a balance, which needed to be repaid. So, Im 
not persuaded that there was reason for Mrs E to think her account would be closed. And I 
dont think NatWest would have said it was closing her account. I think  its more  likely it 
would have told her that her account would remain open but be non-operational and that the 
debt would need to be paid. I can appreciate this may have caused  confusion or 
misunderstanding  especially given the passage of time. 
Mrs E thinks  NatWest  should refund to her what she paid into her account  but she hasnt 
explained why she thinks this. And I havent  seen any evidence demonstrating that shes  
owed any money by NatWest. So I cant ask NatWest  to do anything  more here.
Id like to address the issue of the refunds to this account because Mrs E has queried why they 
were made. I can see that our investigator has already given her a breakdown of the refund 
amounts that NatWest made and explained the reasons why those refunds were given. 
Based on the evidence  Ive considered NatWest credited Mrs Es account with £17.06  in 
December 2013  and £123.48 in January  2014.  These were  refunds of interest and charges. 
The terms and conditions  of Mrs Es account  allowed  NatWest  to apply charges and interest 
while a business  account is in recoveries.  But NatWest  took the view that charges upon 
charges were unfair.  So it refunded them  as a goodwill gesture. 
I think this was a reasonable step for NatWest to take here, especially where  there was no 
obligation on it to adopt this approach. And I can see that a final refund of £15.97  was 
credited to Mrs Es account on 3.9.18  which brought  her account balance to £0 so it could be 
Ref: DRN45621013closed. Given the help NatWest gave Mrs E in reducing her debt by applying  these refunds, 
it wouldnt be fair to criticise it for the action it took here.
Mrs E wants  her account reopened as it has now been closed.  But NatWest has a right to 
close customer accounts. And I havent seen anything  to show  that it hasnt acted in 
accordance with the terms  and conditions that applied to Mrs Es account  when  it closed her 
account. NatWest is entitled to make a commercial decision about  whether or not to offer 
someone banking  facilities. Thats not something  wed generally interfere with. So, I cant tell 
NatWest to reopen Mrs Es account as she would like.
Personal loan account:
Ill turn now to Mrs Es complaint about her personal loan account, which is about a NOSIA 
refund she received from NatWest. This money was refunded because NatWest  didnt send  
Mrs E loan statements  that were required by law. So, it wasnt  entitled to keep the interest it 
had charged during  the period that it hadnt sent those  statements. This refund was used to 
offset the balance she owed on her personal  loan.  But Mrs E wasnt happy about  this as she 
wanted it to be paid to her directly.
Ive thought about what both Mrs E and NatWest  have  said about this NOSIA refund. Having 
done so Im persuaded NatWest was entitled  to use the money it refunded  to Mrs E to offset 
what she owed on her loan. Its acted in accordance with the terms and conditions  of her 
account. And this refund  has gone to reduce Mrs Es debt under her loan agreement.  So, Im 
not persuaded that what happened  caused  any detriment to her. And I dont  think NatWest 
did anything wrong  in taking the action it took here.
Im unsure  whether Mrs E is unhappy  that her loan account wasnt closed while there  was a 
balance outstanding. Her complaint form isnt clear about this. But if I take Mrs Es complaint 
to include this issue Im satisfied it was reasonable for NatWest to keep her loan account  
open while there was an outstanding balance.
So, for the reasons set out above, I don't think NatWest has done anything wrong here. It's 
acted fairly and reasonably and I don't think it would be fair to ask it to do anymore.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 November  2019.
