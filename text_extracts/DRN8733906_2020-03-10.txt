K821x#15complaint
Mr C says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr C says he couldnt  afford the loans and had to borrow  more  to repay them  
resulting in a spiral  of debt. 
background
This complaint is about 37 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr C between October 2016 
and January 2018. Mr Cs borrowing history  is attached as an appendix to this decision.  
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Cs complaint and thought  the loans from loan six onwards 
shouldnt have been given. And she said that all the information about the loans from loan 
six should be removed  from Mr Cs credit  file as it was adverse. 
Sunny disagreed but it did offer to increase its original offer.  It had previously offered to 
uphold loans  35 to 37 but increased  this to uphold Mr Cs complaint  from loan 20.
The offer was put to Mr C but he rejected it and asked for his complaint to be reviewed by an 
ombudsman. 
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me to decide in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN87339062There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr C didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt be upheld.  
Because of this, I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. So I 
wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But the loans were  part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr C had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account  when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by six. 
I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr C was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr C had taken out six loans within just under  six months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr C was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that 
Mr Cs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
When loan six was taken Mr C had repaid  all of his previous instalment loans early.  
And while I appreciate  this saved Mr C interest  charges,  it could equally be an 
indication that Mr C was taking on further  debt to repay current  borrowing. At this 
point Sunny should have considered whether  Mr C was borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income, but rather to meet an ongoing  need.  
From  loan six onwards Mr C was sometimes provided with a new loan within  days  of 
settling a previous  loan or several loans. As an example, loan six was taken out the 
same day that loans four and five were  repaid. This pattern continued  loan 14 was 
taken out the same  day as loan 11 was repaid and it was for more than double  the 
amount. And later on, loan 23 was taken the same day loans 20, 21 and 22 were 
repaid. This was a further indication  Mr C may have been borrowing to repay  his 
existing debts with Sunny.
Ref: DRN87339063Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Mr Cs first loan 
in October 2016 was for £300, the same  amount  as November.   In January 2017, the 
amount borrowed  was slightly reduced  to £200 but in March 2017  he borrowed three 
times totalling £750, the third loan being loan six. 
I appreciate Mr Cs borrowing pattern did fluctuate in amounts  but his penultimate  
borrowing in December  2017  was for a total of £800  more  than double the amount 
of loan six, followed by his last loan of £50 in January 2018. (I note those last three 
loans are outstanding). So, Mr C had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr C borrowed  37 loans in 
15 months  was likely to have had negative implications  on Mr Cs ability  to access 
mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans six to 37 (I appreciate 
Sunny has already offered  to uphold from loan 20) and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do  Ive included loans from loan 20 
onwards for completeness   
It appears there is an outstanding balance on loans 35 to 37. If there is, the outstanding  
balance due on Mr Cs loans may have been  transferred to a third party.  If this is the case, 
Sunny should  buy the loans back if it can. If Sunny  cant buy the loans  back  then it needs to 
work with the third party to make sure the following is achieved: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr C towards  interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Mr C which were 
considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mr C originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges  from the balance on any upheld  outstanding 
loans, and treat any repayments made  by Mr C as though they had been  repayments 
of the principal on all outstanding loans.  
If this results  in Mr C having made overpayments then Sunny should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date the complaint is settled. 
Sunny should  then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step 
E.
Ref: DRN87339064D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should  be paid to Mr C. However if there  is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan 
with Mr C. 
E) The number of loans taken from loan six onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loan six onwards should be removed from 
Mr Cs credit  file. Sunny does not have to remove loans 35 to 37 from Mr Cs credit 
file until these  have  been repaid, but any adverse information  recorded about these 
loans should  still be removed.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 April 2020.
