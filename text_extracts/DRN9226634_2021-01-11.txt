K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as Tesco  Bank, wont  refund to him 
the money that he paid for a holiday and the other costs that hes claimed.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I sympathise with Mr C and his daughter 
for the injuries  that shes  suffered and for the upset  and inconvenience that theyve  been  
caused  these must have been very distressing events for them. But having  considered  all 
of the available evidence and arguments, I agree with the conclusions  reached by the 
investigator for these  reasons:
Mr C used his Tesco Bank credit card in April 2018 to pay £3,036.50  for a package  
holiday for his wife, daughter and himself that was to be taken in May 2018;
his daughter suffered serious injuries  on the outbound flight  and his travel insurer  
arranged for them  to fly home five days later;
a settlement has been reached  with insurers but Mr C has claimed a refund from 
Tesco Bank of the cost of the holiday and other  costs, including his loss of earnings;
it said that the holiday was available to Mr C and was utilised so it was unable to 
raise a chargeback  and it was unable to say that a breach of contract had occurred;
Mr C complained to this service but our investigator didnt  consider  that Tesco Bank 
did anything wrong in rejecting his claim so hes asked for his complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made - but if 
the right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme  rules,  and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
the holiday company  had provided the holiday  to Mr C and I dont consider that there 
was any reasonable prospect of a chargeback  claim  being  successful  in these 
circumstances  so Im not persuaded that Tesco Bank acted incorrectly  in not 
making a chargeback  claim;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit  Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against  the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been  a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Cs complaint  about  Tesco Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract  or misrepresentation  by the holiday company and 
that Tesco Banks response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  
but Im not determining  the outcome of Mr Cs claim under section  75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
Ref: DRN92266342Mr C says that the holiday company breached its contract with him because  it didnt 
provide the holiday with reasonable care and skill because  his daughter was injured 
on the flight;
a payment has been received from insurers but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence  to show that the holiday company has accepted that it failed  to 
provide the holiday with reasonable care and skill;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that Mr Cs daughters 
injuries were caused by the holiday companys failure to provide the holiday  with 
reasonable care and skill or that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company;
I also not persuaded that theres  enough  evidence to show  that Tesco Banks 
response to Mr Cs complaint has been unfair  or unreasonable;  
its clear that the injuries to Mr Cs daughter had a significant  impact on the holiday 
and I sympathise with Mr C and his daughter,  but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these  circumstances for me to require Tesco  Bank to refund to Mr C 
the £3,036.50 that he paid for the holiday or to reimburse him for any of the other 
costs that hes claimed, including  his loss of earnings; and
I also find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Tesco Bank to pay 
any other compensation to Mr C or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 February  2021.
