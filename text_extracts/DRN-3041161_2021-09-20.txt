The complaint
Mr W complains PayrNet Limited blocked his account and took too long to return money paid 
into the account to him. He wants compensation for the trouble and upset the delays caused.
What happened
Mr W had an account with PayrNet account. On 29 February 2020 a payment of just over 
£1,300 was made into Mr Ws account. Following this PayrNet decided to review Mr Ws 
account. Whilst it completed its review Mr W wasnt able to access the funds. 
Mr W contacted PayrNet to try and find out what was happening with his account. PayrNet 
explained to Mr W that under the terms and conditions of his account it was entitled to 
review a customers account. 
Mr W told PayrNet that the money had come from his wifes account and he intended to 
transfer it into another account he held. He explained that his wife was closing her account 
and PayrNet offered the cheapest option to move the money across to his account. 
Mr W sent PayrNet several emails to try and find out what was happening. And what he 
needed to do (if anything) to gain access to the money in his account. Mr W says PayrNet 
were unhelpful and wouldnt give him any useful information other than acknowledge his 
emails. PayrNet decided to close Mr Ws account on 13 March 2020. And it refunded Mr Ws 
funds to him on 17 July 2020. Mr W complained that it had taken him a long time to get his 
money back. PayrNet said hadnt done anything wrong when it reviewed Mr Ws account. 
Unhappy with this response, Mr W brought his complaint to our service. He said he wants 
compensation for the amount of distress and inconvenience being without his money for so 
long and chasing PayrNet caused. 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ws complaint. The investigator asked PayrNet for 
some more information about its review to help decide whether it had treated Mr W fairly  
she asked why it had taken PayrNet as long as it had to complete its review and return 
Mr Ws money to him. But despite repeated requests from the investigator PayrNet didnt 
respond. 
The investigator upheld Mr Ws complaint. She was satisfied PayrNet could review Mr Ws 
account  but based on the limited information PayrNet had provided she didnt think 
PayrNet had treated Mr W fairly and couldve returned Mr Ws funds much sooner than it did. 
She said that Mr W had to go the trouble of emailing PayRnet between March and July 2020 
chasing the return of his money. So, she said PayrNet should pay Mr W £100 compensation 
for the trouble and upset hed been caused. Along with interest for loss of use of his funds. 
Mr W agreed. PayrNet didnt respond. 
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Firstly, the investigator was right to point out that PayrNet has important legal and regulatory 
obligations it must meet when providing accounts to customers. And it must take certain 
actions in order to meet their legal and regulatory obligations. Theyre also required to carry 
out ongoing monitoring of new and existing relationships. That sometimes means they need 
to restrict customers accounts  either in full or partially while they carry out their review. 
While PayrNet are entitled to carry out a review, wed expect them to do so in a timely 
manner and without undue delay. PayrNet initially blocked Mr Ws account in February 2020. 
I can see from the limited information and timeline PayrNet has provided about what it was 
doing at the time in order to comply with its obligations, it could have released Mr Ws funds 
in early April 2020 as its enquires seem to have finished.
Despite being asked by the investigator, PayrNet hasnt offered any explanation for why it 
took until July 2020 to refund Mr W his balance  which I note was around four months after 
it had closed his account. I accept that businesses have administrative processes to 
complete and requests which require approval before releasing funds. But unfortunately, 
PayrNet havent told us why it took as long as it did to give Mr W back his money. And based 
on the information Ive looked at, PayrNet couldve returned Mr Ws balance to him sooner 
than it did. So, in the absence of any explanation from PayrNet to the contrary, I cant be 
satisfied that it treated Mr W fairly and reasonably.
Mr W has told us that he had to keep emailing PayrNet between March and July 2020, to 
find out when he could expect his funds to be returned to him. Hes sent us screen shots of 
numerous emails he sent PayrNet. I can see that he sent around twenty emails to PayrNet. I 
think its more likely than not if PayrNet had returned Mr Ws balance sooner, and Ive not 
seen any evidence that it couldnt do so, then Mr W wouldnt have been put to the trouble of 
having to repeatedly chase PayrNet. So, Im satisfied this caused Mr W inconvenience and I 
consider £100 compensation to be fair in the circumstances along with intertest for loss of 
use of his funds.
My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ws complaint. To put things right PayRnet Limited 
should:
Pay Mr W £100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused by PayrNet not 
returning Mr Ws balance sooner 
Calculate interest at 8% simple per year on Mr Ws closing balance. They should 
calculate this from 1 April 2020 to the date they refunded Mr W.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Wirecard Card Solutions Limited to withhold 
income tax from the above-mentioned interest. PayrNet should give Mr W a 
certificate showing how much is taken off if Mr W asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 October 2021.
