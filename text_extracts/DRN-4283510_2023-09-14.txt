The complaint
Mr E complains National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and later closed his account. He 
suffered distress and inconvenience. He would like compensation and a reason for the 
closure.
What happened
Mr E had accounts with NatWest.
On 6 June Mr E found out he didnt have access to his accounts when he went to use online 
banking. He said NatWest didnt give him any information. Mr E said he was stressed as he 
was in the middle of a house purchase.
Following the review NatWest issued Mr E with a notice to close letter on 22 June 2022 
giving him 60 days notice. The account was due to close 22 August 2022.
Mr E went into branch and accessed his funds and closed the account on 20 July 2022.
Mr E complained to NatWest. They said their terms allowed them to block accounts. They 
were acting in line with their regulatory obligations, and they didnt have to give a reason. 
They confirmed no credits and debits would be processed during the block. They 
acknowledged Mr E had tried to contact them on numerous occasions but whilst the review 
was pending, they couldnt give Mr E any information.
Mr E complained to our service.
One of the investigators looked at the complaint. The investigator asked NatWest to provide 
more information about why it had blocked and closed Mr Es accounts. But NatWest said it 
couldnt provide anything more than it had already provided to us. And maintained that it 
hadnt treated Mr E unfairly.
The investigator said although NatWest were entitled to review the account, they hadnt 
provided enough information to this service to be satisfied they had acted fairy in closing 
Mr Es accounts. Therefore, she thought NatWest should pay £150 in compensation for the 
trouble and upset caused by the account closures.
NatWest agreed. Mr E disagreed he said that he thought NatWest should say what the 
reason was for closing the accounts. He said he wanted the accounts reinstated and 
substantial compensation. He said that he hoped the recent media coverage regarding 
NatWest would prompt a change in the law and provide transparency for customers.
As there was no agreement the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Financial businesses, like NatWest, are subject to a number of legal and regulatory 
requirements. These mean they have to monitor their customers accounts and may need to 
review an account at any time. While that is happening, they may need to block or restrict 
any payments.
This is reflected in NatWests terms and conditions. These say NatWest can block an 
account to meet its legal obligations and delay payments if needed to carry out further 
checks. In this case NatWest have said they were following their regulatory obligations when 
they blocked the accounts. I am satisfied they didnt cause a delay during their review and 
were proactive in their enquiries.
Mr E wants to know the reason why NatWest blocked his accounts. But NatWest doesnt 
disclose to its customers what triggers a review of their accounts. And its under no 
obligation to tell Mr E the reasons behind the account block, as much as hed like to know. 
So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not giving Mr E this information.
NatWest proceeded to give Mr E 60 days notice of its intention to close the accounts.
NatWest needs to provide information to this service so we can fairly decide a complaint. 
NatWest has failed to provide sufficient information about why it blocked Mr Es accounts 
and the reasons why it no longer wanted him as a customer. So, in this particular case, 
because of the lack of information, I cant be satisfied that NatWest has treated Mr E fairly 
when it closed his accounts. Taking this into account, I agree with the investigator that 
NatWest should pay Mr E compensation for the trouble and upset caused by closing his 
accounts.
I know that Mr E wants NatWest to reopen his accounts. Although NatWest havent provided 
this service with the reasons why it no longer wants Mr E as a customer. I am not going to 
ask NatWest to reopen Mr Es accounts. Thats because it has the commercial freedom to 
decide who it wants as a customer.
I have gone on to consider the impact the block and closure had on Mr E. I accept that Mr E 
was in the middle of a property purchase so having his accounts blocked would have been 
stressful. But Mr E has said he was able to borrow money from family. So, Im satisfied he 
did everything he could to minimise the difficulty of the situation and he was able to complete 
his purchase. I know Mr E has said he would want substantial compensation. Having 
reviewed everything I consider that £150 is fair compensation and in line with what we award 
in these sorts of circumstances, and I wont be increasing this. 
Mr E says he wants to know the reason why his accounts were closed; he doesnt think he 
has done anything to justify an account closure. NatWest isnt obliged to provide its 
customers with information regarding the reasons for the closure of their accounts. Mr E has 
mentioned that he hopes that following the recent publicity the law will change. I appreciate 
Mr Es point of view. However, I can only take account of the law and regulations at the time 
the complaint comes to our service. And although there may be plans to change these I 
cannot comment on these plans or consider how they may impact Mr Es complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons stated above I uphold this complaint. To put things right National 
Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr E £150 compensation for the trouble and upset caused 
by the bank closing his accounts. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 October 2023.
