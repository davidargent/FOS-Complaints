The complaint
MRS D COMPLAINS THAT SANTANDER UK PLC HAS REFUSED TO REFUND 
PAYMENTS MADE INTO HER MOTHERS ACCOUNT.
What happened
MRS D SAYS HER MOTHER PASSED AWAY IN DECEMBER 2021. SHE SAYS HER 
MOTHERS PENSION PAYMENTS WERE PAID INTO HER ACCOUNT AND A STANDING 
ORDER WAS SET UP TO THEN PAY THE MONEY INTO HER MOTHERS ACCOUNT. 
MRS D SAYS SHE SPOKE TO SANTANDER ABOUT HER MOTHERS ACCOUNT AND 
WAS TOLD PAYMENTS WOULD BE STOPPED WHICH SHE THOUGHT INCLUDED THE 
STANDING ORDER PAID INTO IT. SHE SAYS THE PENSION PAYMENT AMOUNT WAS 
PAID INTO HER MOTHERS ACCOUNT AFTER SHE SPOKE TO SANTANDER AND IT 
HAS REFUSED TO REFUND HER MONEY. MRS D SAYS THAT HAS CAUSED HER 
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AND WOULD LIKE SANTANDER TO RECALL THE MONEY.
SANTANDER SAYS IT HASNT MADE A MISTAKE AND IT CANT RECALL THE MONEY 
UNTIL THE ESTATE IS FINALISED. IT SAYS MRS D CONTACTED IT AND DIDNT 
MENTION THAT HER MOTHERS PENSION WAS PAID INTO HER ACCOUNT FIRST 
BEFORE BEING PAID INTO HER MOTHERS ACCOUNT. SANTANDER SAYS IT HAS 
PAID MRS D £75 AS A GOODWILL GESTURE TO HELP HER AND HAS EXTENDED HER 
OVERDRAFT FACILITY FROM £1,500 TO £2,500.
MRS D BROUGHT HER COMPLAINT TO US AND OUR INVESTIGATOR DIDNT UPHOLD 
IT.THE INVESTIGATOR LISTENED TO THE CALL BETWEEN THE PARTIES  AND 
DIDNT THINK MRS D TOLD SANTANDER ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENT AND DIDNT 
THINK IT COULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT. THE INVESTIGATOR DIDNT THINK 
SANTANDER HAS MADE A MISTAKE OR MISLED MRS D AND HAS ACTED FAIRLY BY 
TRYING TO HELP HER UNTIL THE ESTATE WAS FINALISED.
MRS D DOESNT ACCEPT THAT VIEW AND SAYS NO ACCOUNT HAS BEEN MADE 
ABOUT HER MENTAL STATE FOLLOING HER MOTHERS PASSING AWAY. SHE 
MANTAINS SHE WOULDNT HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IF SHE WASNT GRIEVING.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
HAVING DONE SO I HAVE COME TO THE OVERALL VIEW THAT I DONT UPHOLD THIS 
COMPLAINT. I APPRECIATE MRS D WILL BE DISAPOINTED BY MY DECISION.
I HAVE LISTENED CAREFULLY TO THE TELEPHONE CALL BETWEEN MRS D AND 
SANTANDER. HAVING DONE SO I AM SATISFIED THAT MRS D WAS TOLD THAT NO 
MONEY WOULD LEAVE HER MOTHERS ACCOUNT BUT PAYMENTS COULD STILL BE 
MADE INTO IT. IM SATISFIED THAT MRS D ALSO SAID THAT SHE WOULD NEED TO 
STOP THE PENSION AND WAS ADVISED BY SANTANDER TO SPEAK TO THE 
PENSION PROVIDERS. SO, I DONT THINK AT ANY STAGE DURING THE TELEPHONE 
CALL THAT MRS D WAS MISLED OR GIVEN INCORRECT INFORMATION. I DONT 
THINK SANTANDER COULD REASONABLY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE PENSION 
PAYMENT ARRANGEMENT UNLESS MRS D TOLD IT ABOUT IT, WHICH SHE DID NOT 
DO. SO, I CANT FAIRLY HOLD SANTANDER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENTS 
MADE BY ERROR.
I APPRECIATE MRS D WOULD LIKE THE PAYMENTS REFUNDED BUT IM SATISFIED 
THAT SANTANDER IS NOT ABLE TO DO SO UNTIL THE ESTATE IS SORTED OUT. I 
UNDERSTAND MRS DS FRUSTRATION IN THOSE CIRCUSMTANCES BUT I CANT 
SEE HOW SANTANDER COULD REFUND THE MONEY AT THIS STAGE, AS 
REGARDLESS OF THE MISTAKE, THE MONEY BELONGS TO THE ESTATE. AND 
WOULD REQUIRE THE ESTATES INVOLVEMENT IN SORTING OUT, WHICH OF 
COURSE MAY INCLUDE MRS D.
IM SATISFIED THAT SANTANDER HAS FAIRLY TRIED TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM 
AND HAS TRIED TO HELP MRS D BY PAYING HER £75 AS A GOODWILL GESTURE 
AND BY INCREASING HER OVERDRAFT FACILITY. I CANT SEE WHAT ELSE IT CAN 
DO IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO TRY AND HELP MRS D.
I CAN SEE THAT MRS D ACCEPTS SHE MADE A MISTAKE BY NOT CANCELLING THE 
STANDING ORDER. I ACCEPT THAT AT THE TIME MRS D WAS DEALING WITH A 
BEREAVEMENT AND I AM SORRY TO DISAPOINT HER. BUT I CANT FAIRLY ORDER 
SANTANDER TO REFUND MONEY IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT WOULD BE 
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO.
OVERALL, IM SATISFIED THAT SANTANDER HAS NOT MADE A MISTAKE OR ACTED 
UNFAIRLY. I ALSO FIND THIS NOW BRINGS AN END TO WHAT WE IN TRYING TO 
RESOLVE THIS DISPUTE INFORMALLY CAN DO.
My final decision
MY FINAL DECISION IS THAT I DONT UPHOLD THIS COMPLAINT.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 March 2022.
