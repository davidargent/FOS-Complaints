K821x#15complaint
Mr R complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr R was given 59 loans  by Sunny  between January 2015  and March  2018. Each of the 
loans was due to be repaid in six monthly instalments but Mr R often repaid the loans much  
earlier than planned.  At times Mr R had up to four loans outstanding  at the same time. 
Although Mr R seems to have faced  problems repaying some of his loans, all of his 
borrowing from Sunny  has been fully repaid. A summary of the loans given to Mr R by Sunny 
is shown as an appendix to this decision.
Mr Rs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think Sunny had 
been wrong to give loans  1 to 5 to Mr R. But he didnt think  Sunny should  have agreed to 
lend the remaining loans. So he asked Sunny to pay Mr R some compensation.
Sunny didnt agree with that assessment. But it did offer to remove  details of loans 6 to 59 
from Mr Rs credit file, and to refund the interest and charges that Mr R had paid on loans 14 
to 59. But Mr R didnt  accept that offer. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved informally,  
it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide. This is the last stage of our process. If 
Mr R accepts my decision it is legally binding  on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr R could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN70024422There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Sunny did some checks before it lent to Mr R. It asked him for details of his income, and his 
normal expenditure. And it checked  his credit  file before agreeing  the loans. Ive seen some 
of the results  from those  checks and I dont think they showed anything  that should  have 
caused additional concerns to Sunny.
As I mentioned earlier each of Mr Rs loans was repayable over a six month  period.  So the 
amounts that Mr R needed to repay  each  time were  smaller than if hed taken  a normal  
payday loan. But of course he was committing to making those repayments over a far longer 
period. And at times  Mr R had a number of loans outstanding together.  So Ive needed to 
consider the total amount  that Mr R needed to repay  to Sunny each month.
I think the fact that Mr R often repaid his loans  much earlier than planned should have 
caused some concerns  to Sunny. That might be the sort of behaviour  that would indicate 
that someone was facing  problems managing their money and needing  to refinance loans on 
a regular basis. So Ive also taken that into account  when  looking  at whether Sunny should 
have given the loans to Mr R.
I think that the checks Sunny did before agreeing  the first four loans were proportionate. The 
amounts that Mr R needed to repay  appeared affordable compared with the income hed 
declared. Given these repayment amounts, what was apparent  about  Mr Rs circumstances 
at the time, and his borrowing history with the lender, I dont think it wouldve  been 
proportionate for Sunny  to ask him for the amount  of information that would be needed to 
show the lending  was unsustainable  before agreeing the first four loans. 
I do think, by the time Mr R asked for loan 5, that Sunny should  have  realised that it couldnt 
safely rely on the information he was providing  about his finances. I think it should have 
taken steps at that time to independently verify Mr Rs true financial position.  We asked Mr R 
for copies  of his bank  statements so we could see what  better checks  would have  shown 
Sunny. He didnt  provide these to us. So Im not able to say that better checks would have  
shown Sunny that it shouldnt have given loan 5 to Mr R.
Ref: DRN70024423But looking  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr R I think  by loan 6 the 
lender should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise  
harmful. And so Sunny  should have realised  that it shouldnt provide further loans. 
I say this because:
This was now Mr Rs sixth loan request in as many months. Each of the loans Mr R 
had taken had been repayable over a period  of six months. But Mr R had paid some  
of those loans  off far earlier  than planned, but borrowed  similar  amounts  very shortly 
afterwards. I think that pattern of frequent borrowing and repaying early should  have 
indicated to Sunny that Mr R was most  likely having significant problems managing 
his money. 
When Mr R asked for loan 6 he wasnt making any inroads to the amount he owed 
the lender. Looking  at the combined  value of the loans Mr R had outstanding, there 
was no evidence of a downward  trend. 
Between loan 6 and loan 59 Mr R had multiple loans active  at the same time. So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr R was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loans  was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Rs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Rs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So I dont  think Sunny should  have  agreed  to lend to Mr R from loan 6 onwards. Sunny 
needs to pay Mr R some compensation.
putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr R after, and including, the loan he took 
on 27 July 2015  (loan 6). So for each  of those loans Sunny  should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr R on the loans.  
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loans 6 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 59 should be removed from Mr Rs credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN70024424my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Mr Rs complaint and direct  Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things  right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 December 2019.
