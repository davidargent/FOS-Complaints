The complaint
Mr G is complaining that Stagemount Limited trading as Quidmarket irresponsibly lent to 
him.
What happened
Quidmarket lent Mr G six instalment loans. Mr Gs borrowing history is as follows;
Loan 
number Loan dateLoan 
amount Term Repayment End date
1 02/03/2019 £600 5 months £211.58 26/07/2019
2 20/04/2019 £400 3 months £211.22 24/04/2019
3 11/05/2019 £400 5 months £133.33 31/05/2019
4 23/08/2021 £500 5 months £230.74 30/09/2021
5 11/01/2021 £1,500 5 months £510.25 31/03/2022
6 05/09/2022 £1,500 6 months £476.18 06/03/2023
Mr G repaid loan 5 late, Quidmarket said Mr G contacted it to say he lost his job due to 
covid 19 and that was the reason for the late payment. Mr G withdrew from the agreement 
on loan 2 within 14 days.
When Mr G complained to Quidmarket, it didnt uphold his complaint but offered as a gesture 
of goodwill to remove the loans from Mr Gs credit file. Mr G didnt accept this and referred 
his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and didnt think Quidmarket was wrong to 
lend any of the loans. Mr G disagreed he said Quidmarket should have taken its checks 
further before lending loans 4  6 and had it done that it would have seen he couldnt afford 
the loan.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman for a 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Quidmarket needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. That is to say Mr G should be able to repay 
his loans without undue difficulties - while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well 
as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Quidmarket should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
The lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income).
The higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income). 
The greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Quidmarket was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  The loan payments being affordable on 
this basis might be an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it 
doesnt automatically follow this is the case. 
Quidmarket has provided evidence to show that before it lent any of the loans, it asked Mr G 
to declare his monthly income, living costs and credit commitments. It also searched his 
credit file before lending any loans and has provided the results of its searches. I can also 
see that for loans 4 and 6, Quidmarket saw Mr Gs payslip and a screenshot of his income 
deposit into his account respectively.
Ive looked at the results of Quidmarkets credit search, I appreciate Mr G has provided a 
copy of his credit file. Im minded to place more weight on the credit search results of 
Quidmarket in this instance because firstly, they were carried out around the time of the 
loans and so give a snapshot of Mr Gs credit at the time. Also, Im aware different searches 
may produce different results and just because something shows up on the credit file Mr G 
sees doesnt necessarily mean Quidmarket saw it. Quidmarket wasnt required to carry out a 
credit search, although many lenders do, and if it did, it wasnt required to carry it out to any 
specific extent.
The results of Quidmarkets searches showed that Mr G had some adverse information on 
his credit file  he had historic defaults from 2013, these had fallen off his credit file by loan 
4. By loans 4 and 5, he had a late payment recorded against his hire purchase agreement, 
but the balance was continuing to reduce, this delinquency had been rectified by the time of 
loan 6.
I can also see Mr Gs credit file showed he was slightly over the credit limit on some of his 
revolving credit accounts, but the payments were largely up to date.Mr G declared his income to be between £2,200 - £5,000 for all loans and he declared his 
living costs including credit commitments between £825 - £2,000. I can see Quidmarket 
adjusted Mr Gs declarations based on its checks. For example, for loan 3, Quidmarket 
estimated Mr Gs income to be £2,024  less than the £2,400 Mr G declared. Quidmarket 
also worked out Mr Gs living costs including credit commitments were between £1,162 - 
£1,808  these figures are higher that Mr Gs declarations.
Based on these figures, Mr G could meet his loan repayments and was left with sufficient 
disposable income after.
I think Quidmarkets checks went far enough, it reacted to the information its checks 
revealed and from what I can see, the repayments for each loan were affordable and 
sustainable for Mr G. While further checks may have revealed Mr G would struggle to keep 
up with the repayments of his loans, the reasonable and proportionate checks carried out by 
Quidmarket in this instance shows it made a fair lending decision. Quidmarket wasnt wrong 
to lend to Mr G and I wont be asking it to do anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 December 2023.
