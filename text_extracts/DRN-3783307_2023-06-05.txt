The complaint
Mr E complains that Vanguard Asset Management, Ltd has failed to provide a satisfactory 
explanation to a query he raised regarding an account fee he was charged.
To put matters right Mr E wants a clearer response to his query and compensation.
What happened
In early September 2022, Mr E asked Vanguard for:
An explanation of the disparity between the external fee payment shown in the statement 
and the advance notice of my direct debit. Whilst the former shows a fee of £27.44 for the 
period 02.06.2022 to 01.09.2022, the latter shows the fee as £26.74 for the period 
03.06.2022 to 02.09.2022.
Vanguard responded to Mr E. It said:
Your regular statement provides you with all of the relevant information relating to the costs 
and charges of your Vanguard account and the funds you are invested in.
For the previous period of 3rd Of March - 2nd Of June, your account fee was £27.44p, the 
previous period of the 3rd Of December 2021 - The 2nd Of March 2022 your account fee 
was £22.53p, you can view this information by going to Transactions > Fees.
Your regular statement shows your account fee that was charged on the 8th Of June 2022 
for £27.44p we have not yet sent you a regular statement for the following quarter.
Our account fee is 0.15%. This is an annual rate, calculated daily based on your account 
value over the quarterly period for which it is charged. As your account balance has changed 
so will your fee.
It also suggested that Mr E could find more information about the fees that applied to his 
account on its website and directed him to the relevant page.
Mr E was not satisfied with Vanguards explanation and asked it again to address the issue 
he had raised. Vanguard responded again, reiterating that there was not a discrepancy 
between the charges as your regular statement shows your account fee that was charged on 
the 8th of June 2022 for £27.44p, please ensure you are looking at the 'Transaction Date' on 
Page 3 and you will be able to see this. 
On your next regular statement, your account fee for September will be included.
Mr E remained unhappy with the explanation Vanguard had provided and his complaint was 
referred to this service.
Our investigator noted that Vanguard had said that the fees it had applied to Mr Es account 
were correct. As this was the case, and in the absence of anything to show that the fees 
applied were incorrect, she said she didnt think Mr Es complaint should be upheld.
Mr E was not satisfied with our investigators response and asked for his complaint to be 
determined by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I am satisfied that the account fees Vanguard has applied have been 
correctly charged. It appears there may be a genuine misunderstanding on Mr Es part about 
when the account fee is payable. Ill explain why.
In the Key Features Document (KFD), under the heading, Vanguard account fee, it sets out:
This is what you pay in return for the provision of account services. These services include 
the fund dealing facility, the recording of transactions and holdings, the safeguarding of your 
investments by our nominee, and other ancillary services. These comprise certain online 
services as well as the provision of access to our personal investor service representatives.
The account fee is an annual charge which we accrue daily and deduct 
proportionately in arrears on a quarterly basis commencing three months after the earlier 
of (i) the date of your first investment; or the opening of your Account where you have 
instructed a transfer or regular monthly savings plan. The amount which you pay is based on 
the overall value of your Vanguard personal investor account, including any cash held. The 
rate of charge is 0.15% per annum of the value of your account holdings up to £250,000, 
such that the maximum annual charge is £375.
(bold is my emphasis)
In the statement Vanguard issued to Mr E, covering the period 2 June 2022 to 1 September 
2022, it set out under the heading Payments in, that an external fee payment for ISA of 
£27.44 had been received. This payment, which it appears was received on 8 June 2022, 
(as per the cash movement records I have seen) was in respect of the account fee for the 
period March to June 2022. 
The account fee, as the key features document I have quoted above sets out, accrues daily, 
and is deducted proportionately in arrears on a quarterly basis. The account fee of £27.44, 
that Mr E paid in early June 2022 and has referred to in his complaint, was to cover the 
period March to June 2022.
The account fee payable for the period 2 June 2022 to 1 September 2022, would have 
appeared in the following quarterly statement.
I also note that the account fee for the period June to September 2022 was lower than the 
£27.44 charged for March to June 2022 because, as the KFD set out:
The amount which you pay is based on the overall value of your Vanguard personal investor 
account, including any cash held. The rate of charge is 0.15% per annum of the value of 
your account holdings up to £250,000, such that the maximum annual charge is £375.
The account fee for June to September 2022 of £26.74, was lower than the previous 
quarterly charge, as the value of Mr Es portfolio reduced in value from £71,504.26 to 
£70,556.76 between 2 June 2022 and 1 September 2022. 
I think a misunderstanding has occurred because Mr E, not unreasonably, has assumed that the account fee of £27.44, set out in the statement he received in early September 2002, 
was the account fee covering the period from June to September 2022. But as the KFD sets 
out, the account fee is payable quarterly in arrears, so would only become payable after the 
June to September account period ended.
Having very carefully considered this matter, I am satisfied that the reason the account fee 
Mr E was charged in early September 2022 (£26.74), was lower than the account fee he was 
charged in June 2022 (£27.44), because the value of his investments had reduced between 
June and September 2022 and the account fee, which accrued daily reflected the reduction 
in the value of his portfolio.
I think the explanation that Vanguard provided to Mr E in early September 2022, when he 
first queried this fee, did explain why the account fee was different each quarter and that it 
was paid in arrears. The charging arrangements for the account fee were also set out in the 
KFD Vanguard has provided for this account. As this is the case, I cant reasonably require it 
to pay Mr E any compensation in relation to any misunderstanding on when the account fee 
for a quarter was charged.
I hope my explanation will satisfy Mr E that the £27.44 account fee he was charged in early 
June 2022, was the account fee for the period March to June 2022 paid quarterly, in arrears. 
And the £26.74 fee he was charged in early September 2022, was the quarterly, in arrears 
account fee for the period June to September 2022.
My final decision
My decision is that, for the reasons I have set out above, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 July 2023.
