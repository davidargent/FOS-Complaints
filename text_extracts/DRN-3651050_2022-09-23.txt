The complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) have closed his account(s) 
unfairly.
What happened
Mr P had a business account with PayPal. PayPal said theyd permanently limited Mr Ps 
account for breach of its Acceptable Use policy as the business associated with the account 
had been dissolved. Mr P said he then opened a personal PayPal account, which PayPal 
also closed. 
Mr P said PayPal had closed his accounts because hed complained to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service about them. Mr P said he provided the identification PayPal had asked 
for, but they refused to reactivate his account. He complained to them.
PayPal said they were satisfied that theyd followed their internal processes and procedures 
correctly and had acted in accordance with their User Agreement. 
Mr P wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred his complain to us.
Our investigator looked into Mr Ps concerns but didnt think his complaint should be upheld. 
He said he was satisfied from the information PayPal had given that theyd acted fairly and 
reasonably. He didnt think PayPal needed to reactivate Mr Ps account(s) or take any other 
action.
Mr P disagreed with our investigators view. He said that PayPal had told him hed been 
blacklisted. And that theyd taken this action because hed previously brought a complaint 
to this service. He also said the new account was for personal use and not a business 
account. He asked for an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not upholding this complaint I ll explain why.
This service was set up to consider individual complaints, so its not the role of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service to make findings about a businesss wider practices or processes  
that is something for the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to do. Our service 
is impartial, we look at the evidence given by both parties. 
PayPal has made a commercial decision to stop doing business with Mr P, and this isnt 
something we can interfere with. In reaching my decision I need to be satisfied that PayPal 
acted within the terms of the accounts User Agreement. For me to say PayPal must do 
something different I must first be satisfied that theyve done something wrong. I cant see 
that they have here which is why I wont be asking them to do anything else.
In August 2021 after a review of Mr Ps account PayPal said they placed a permanent 
suspension on it. They said this was because the business associated with the account was 
no longer active. PayPal said they told Mr P that his agreement didnt allow for a change of 
business. So, if he wanted to open a new business account, he needed to show it wasnt 
linked to the inactive business.
Ive considered the User Agreement Mr P had with PayPal.
PayPal offer two types of account, business and personal. By opening a business account
Mr P would have had to certify he was using it for business purposes. As the business 
associated with the account had been dissolved it would no longer have been possible for 
the account to be used for business purposes. So, I dont think PayPal have acted unfairly in 
closing the business account.
In September 2021 Mr P asked to open a new account but in November 2021 PayPal put a 
limitation on this account as well. On review PayPal said theyd found there was a link to the 
inactive business and suspected buyer abuse. They said theyd also found another business 
account with the same email address given by Mr P for the new account that had a negative 
balance on it.
PayPal has shown a user would be considered to be in breach of the User Agreement if 
they:
Circumvent any PayPal policy or determinations about your PayPal account such as 
temporary or indefinite suspensions or other account holds, limitations or restrictions, 
including, but not limited to, engaging in the following actions: attempting to open new or 
additional PayPal account(s) when an account has a negative balance or has been 
restricted, suspended or otherwise limited; opening new or additional PayPal accounts using 
information that is not your own (e.g. name, address, email address, etc.); or using someone 
else's PayPal account.
 
Having considered the evidence, I think PayPal reached the decision to restrict and then 
close Mr Ps account reasonably and in good faith. From what Ive seen, Im satisfied that 
PayPal has followed their processes and the terms of their User Agreement. So, it follows 
that I dont think PayPal has done anything wrong.
I can see Mr P believes that PayPals have applied an unfair practise and that this should be 
investigated. As mentioned previously, we dont have power to direct a business to change 
their processes  we can only determine if any policies and processes have been applied 
fairly. In this case, I cant say the policy has been applied unfairly. I acknowledge Mr P says 
he knows of other customers who have been subject to this practise and feels there is a lack 
of transparency.  If Mr P remains concerned about PayPals process and would like to take 
this forward, then he can raise this complaint with the regulator.My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 October 2022.
