The complaint
Mrs A complains that TransferWise Ltd blocked her account and did not allow her access to 
her funds. It closed the account with immediate effect.  Mrs A wants TransferWise to return 
her money. Mrs A would like access to her money and her account reinstated.
Mrs A is represented by Mr B.
What happened
Mrs A had an account with TransferWise.
In August 2019 Mrs A carried out a number of exchange rate transactions between Euros 
and another currency. These transactions resulted in Mrs A making a gain of around 
£27,721.06. TransferWise investigated. They froze her account and after investigating 
closed the account with immediate effect.
Mrs A complained to TransferWise.
TransferWise said they were not set up for users to engage in for-profit high frequency 
conversions but were a commercial retail payments platform.
TransferWise decided that Mrs A had breached the terms of the account and their fair use 
policy by carrying out 430 conversions over 4 hours and 2 minutes. TransferWise decided 
not to release the funds. They blocked the funds in the account and closed it. They later 
decided to unwind the transactions. 
Mrs A was unhappy with TransferWise, so she complained to our service.
One of the investigators looked at the complaint. He said TransferWise had applied the 
terms and conditions correctly. He said TransferWise had explained there was an issue with 
their system which meant an historic exchange rate had been displayed in error. Because of 
this glitch on TransferWises system Mrs A was able to make a gain of over £27,000. He 
said he thought Mrs A had engaged in speculative trading and TransferWise hadnt done 
anything wrong by enforcing the terms and conditions.
Mrs A said she didnt breach the terms by engaging in speculative trading. The investigator 
responded that Mrs A had to click on the refresh button in order to access the more 
favourable historical rate and she had refreshed this 2,207 times in 4 hours and 2 minutes.
Mrs A said that he didnt know that there was a glitch in the system and he merely refreshed 
the page to get the best rate. And there was no way of knowing that the rate offered was an 
error. She also said there was no limit on the number of transactions per day or hour.
As there was no agreement the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs A says that she hadnt engaged in speculative trading. TransferWise have relied on the 
following conditions Section 13.3, 15.3; 21.9 and 25.2 in order to block and close the 
account and withhold funds. Ive looked at the terms and conditions to see if TransferWise 
have applied them fairly.
Under the terms and conditions speculative trading isnt allowed.
Section 15.3 states:
You agree that you will not use our Services for speculative trading.
The guaranteed rates terms and conditions dont allow the use of TransferWise services as 
a currency trading platform. 
Section 13.3 states:
 we offer automatic guaranteed rates on certain payment orders based on the table and 
subject to the conditions here, which may be changed from time to time 
The terms and conditions for guaranteed rates state:
 Please note that we are not a currency trading platform, accordingly, you should not use 
our Services for this purpose  If we detect that you are using our Services for this purpose, 
we may suspend or terminate your TransferWise Account. 
TransferWise terms allow it to claim losses and close accounts for breach of the Agreement. 
Section 21.9 states:
21.9 You are liable for breaking this Agreement or applicable laws. In the unlikely event of 
loss or claims or costs and expenses arising out of your breach of this Agreement, any 
applicable law or regulation and/or your use of our Services, you agree to compensate us 
and our affiliates and hold us harmless This provision will continue after our relationship 
ends.
Section 25.2 states:
25.2 We may suspend or close your TransferWise Account without notice in certain
circumstances. We may at any time suspend or close your TransferWise Account and/or end 
this Agreement without notice if:
(a) you breach any provision of this Agreement or documents referred to in this Agreement;
Having looked at the terms and conditions I can see that TransferWise are able to 
suspend and close an account and recover their losses if a customer uses the service 
for speculative trading.
Mrs A has said that she didnt engage in speculative trading. But I disagree. She 
previously had carried out no transactions in her account. Mrs A said that she didnt 
know about the glitch until TransferWise told her about it in their final response letter. Im 
not sure I believe her but even if that is the case, I think Mrs A was more likely than not 
aware that something wasnt quite right with the exchange rate that was being displayed 
because she clicked the button to refresh the rate 2,207 times. This behaviour is very 
different from her usual use of her account. So, I think Mrs A most likely realised that 
there was a glitch in the TransferWise system that displayed an incorrect exchange rate 
on their platform. And she decided to exploit it. She spent 4 hours trading to take 
advantage of this incorrect exchange rate and she made a substantial profit from her actions. So, I think she was using the account as a currency trading platform and she 
was engaging in speculative trading.
 
Im satisfied that TransferWise applied the terms and conditions correctly when they took 
action to freeze and close the account and recover their losses. It follows I wont be 
asking them to do anything else.
My final decision
My final decision is I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2021.
