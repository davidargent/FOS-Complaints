The complaint
Ms B is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, reduced the credit limit on her 
account without any notice and with the service that she received when she tried to contact 
PayPal about this.
What happened
Ms B tried to use her PayPal account to pay for online transactions but noticed that the 
transactions were being declined. When Ms B called PayPal about this, she was told that the 
credit limit on her account had been reduced and that a letter had been sent to her advising 
of this. 
Ms B wasnt happy about this, especially as shed never received a letter from PayPal 
advising that her credit limit was being reduced. Ms B also wasnt satisfied with the standard 
of service that shed received from PayPal when investigating this matter. So, she raised a 
complaint.
PayPal looked at Ms Bs complaint, but they felt that theyd acted within the terms and 
conditions of the account. So, they didnt uphold Ms Bs complaint.
Ms B wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they also felt that PayPals actions 
were permitted by the terms and conditions of the account, so they also didnt uphold Ms Bs 
complaint.
Ms B remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It would have been understandably frustrating for Ms B to have learned that PayPal had 
reduced the credit limit on her account, especially given that Ms B hadnt received the 
notifications that PayPal had sent to her advising her about this.
However, it doesnt necessarily follow from Ms Bs frustration that PayPal have acted unfairly 
here. And having reviewed the terms and conditions of Ms Bs PayPal account, its clear that 
PayPal acting to reduce the credit limit in the way that they did is permitted by those terms 
and conditions  as per section 1.6 as follows:
 We may also reduce your Credit Limit if we believe there is a risk you cannot 
repay, your credit usage is not sustainable or if there is another risk to us. We will 
usually give you notice of this beforehand but may do so without notice if appropriate 
to do so. Your Credit Limit will not be reduced below the outstanding balance, 
including any pending transactions.
PayPal have stated that notifications were sent to Ms B at the time that the credit limit was 
reduced informing her as to what had taken place. However, Ms B has confirmed that she 
hasnt received any such notifications. 
In instances where testimonies differ  such as this  its usually the case that I have to 
decide what I feel was most likely to have happened, on balance, in light of all the available 
information.
In this instance I feel that its more likely than not that the notifications were sent by PayPal. 
But this doesnt mean that Ms B received those notifications, and I have no reason to doubt 
Ms Bs testimony that they werent received. However, it must be noted that this service 
wouldnt hold PayPal accountable for the non-delivery of sent mail.
Furthermore, its clear from the previously listed clause 1.6 of the account terms and 
conditions that PayPal would have been within their rights to reduce the credit limit 
regardless of whether they sent notifications or not.
As such, while I can appreciate that Ms B may have been inconvenienced and frustrated to 
discover that the credit limit on her account had been reduced, I cant conclude that PayPal 
have acted unfairly or unreasonably here regarding this. And this is because Im satisfied 
that PayPal have acted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the account.
Ms B has also expressed her dissatisfaction with the level of service that she received from 
PayPal at the time that she was trying to resolve this matter. 
In their correspondence with our investigator, PayPal confirmed that these events took place 
at a time when they had reduced functionality as a result of restrictions put in place because 
of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Because of this, while I can appreciate Ms Bs frustration here, I dont feel that it would be 
fair of me to censure PayPal for a reduced standard of service given these circumstances, 
and I note that PayPal offered an apology to Ms B via this service for any inconvenience she 
may have encountered at this time. 
All of which means that I find it difficult to conclude that PayPal have acted unfairly or 
unreasonably here, and it follows from this that I wont be upholding this complaint or asking 
PayPal to take any further action at this time. 
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Ms B was wanting here, but I hope that she can 
understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2021.
