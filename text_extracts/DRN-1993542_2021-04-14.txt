The complaint 
Before November 2019, Mrs W held a packaged bank account with National Westminster 
Bank Plc (NatWest). NatWest charged her a monthly fee for the account and provided 
several potential benefits in return. Mrs W then decided to switch to a fee-free account. 
NatWest switched the account but charged Mrs W a final monthly fee. 
Mrs W has complained that during a phone call NatWest said it would refund this final fee 
but then failed to do so. She thinks that it should keep the commitment she says it made and 
pay the refund.
What happened
There is little dispute about the sequence of events that led to this complaint. Both parties 
have agreed that: 
Mrs W closed her packaged account on 11 November 2019.
NatWest charged her a final fee on 29 November 2019.
One of our adjudicators has already looked into Mrs Ws complaint it and didnt recommend 
that NatWest should give her any money back. Mrs W didnt agree with the adjudicators 
findings and asked for an ombudsman to review her case. So, it has come to me to make a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked into everything that Mrs W and NatWest have told us or sent us about the 
complaint, and Ive decided not to uphold it. Ill explain why.
When NatWest investigated Mrs Ws complaint directly, it told her that the final fee she paid 
was for the month upto 8 November 2019. As Mrs W held the packaged account throughout 
this period, it said the fee was fair and correct.
Mrs W now seems to accept that the final fee was within NatWests terms and conditions 
(and I agree) but has explained that at the time she didnt know it raised the fees in arrears 
and so rang NatWest to question the final fee. Shes told us that during this call NatWest 
said it would refund the fee, but then failed to do so. Shes explained to us that the crux of 
her complaint ... relates  not the fact that (she)  was charged  (the final fee)  but to the 
fact that when  (she)  contacted  Natwest  to query  the matter,  the person  (she)  spoke  to 
promised  a refund  of the final monthly  fee and then NatWest  didnt  pay the refund.  
Shes  added  that she is concerned  that Natwest  are happy  to employ  people  who lie to 
customers.
NatWest  hasnt  been  able to send  us a recording  of the phone  call. It hasnt  agreed  that 
it lied to Mrs W but has accepted  that the call took place  and that one of its staff 
misadvised  Mrs W that it would  refund  the final fee. It has apologised  to Mrs W in 
writing  and told her that her complaint  has been  logged  as feedback  to the adviser  
and will be taken  forward  internally .
I wouldnt  expect  NatWest  to disclose  any more  about  its internal  action  and I 
understand  why Mrs wants  it to refund  the final fee. However,  when  NatWest  raised  the 
charge  it was entitled  to do so, and I doubt  that it deliberately  lied to her or set out to 
break  a promise.  It has accepted  it made  a mistake  and apologised;  and as Mrs W 
hasnt  suffered  any material  loss,  I dont  think  NatWest  has any obligation  to refund  the 
final fee to her. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have set out above, I am not upholding Mrs Ws complaint about National 
Westminster Bank Plc. I am not going to tell it to give her any money back. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 May 2021.
