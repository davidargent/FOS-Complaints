K821x#15complaint
Miss W says Global  Kapital Group Ltd (trading as MyKredit) irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about 78 payday  loans  MyKredit provided to Miss W between April 2016 
and August 2018. Miss Ws borrowing history is summarised at the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ws complaint and thought the loans from loan 3 
onwards shouldnt have been  given as Miss W had loans from other short-term lenders as 
well as MyKredit. They  also thought  the pattern of borrowing indicated Miss W was reliant on 
short-term loans. MyKredit disagreed so, the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
MyKredit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure      
Miss W could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MyKredit  should fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So, whilst Ive noted MyKredits comments about  the actual payments Miss W paid,  I think  
that it is important for me to start by saying that MyKredit was required to establish whether 
Miss W could sustainably  repay her loans   not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN45606172Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Ws complaint.  Having done so, Im partially  upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think MyKredit needed  to do more  when  it approved loans 1 and 2.     
Miss W didnt respond directly to the view. As there appears to no longer be a dispute  about 
these loans, I won be making further findings  on them.
MyKredit says it carried out checks before it lent loan 3 to Miss W and the results of these 
checks didnt raise  any concerns. But as this was Miss Ws third loan in under three weeks, I 
think MyKredit  should have been  looking to build a clearer picture about Miss Ws finances 
before lending her this loan. 
Had MyKredit  carried  out proportionate  checks before lending loan 3, its likely to have found 
that Miss W was borrowing from other  short-term  lenders as well as having outstanding 
loans with MyKredit itself. The repayments for these loans would have been increasing her 
monthly outgoings by around £360.  
I think the fact Miss W was taking out overlapping loans in rapid succession ought  to have 
caused some concern  to MyKredit. As that might be the sort of behaviour  that would indicate 
someone was facing problems managing their money and needing to refinance loans on a 
regular basis. For example, loans 2 and 3 were taken out within  three days  of each other 
and loan 1 was still outstanding when both loans were provided. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MyKredits  lending history with Miss W, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which MyKredit  should reasonably have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MyKredit should  have  realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Miss Ws case,  I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I 
say this because:
At this point MyKredit  ought to have realised  Miss W was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss W had taken out seven loans in just over a month. So 
MyKredit ought  to have realised  it was more likely  than not Miss W was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Ws indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ws first loan was for £100 and loan 7 was for the same  amount. At this point 
MyKredit ought  to have known  that it was unlikely Miss W was borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in her income but more to meet an ongoing need.
Ref: DRN45606173From  loan 7 onwards  Miss W was provided with a new loan either within days of 
taking out the previous one or within days or weeks of repaying a previous loan. 
Miss W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed MyKredit.  Loan 78 
was taken out over two years  after Miss Ws first. And it was for a significantly larger 
amount. Miss W had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
MyKredit over an extended period.
I think that Miss W lost out because  MyKredit continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ws indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ws ability  to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
As such,  Im upholding Miss Ws complaint about  loans 3 to 78 and MyKredit  should put 
things right. 
putting things right  what Global Kapital Group Ltd needs to do
If MyKredit  has sold the outstanding debts MyKredit should buy these back if MyKredit is 
able to do so and then take the following steps. If MyKredit cant buy the debts back, then 
MyKredit should liaise  with the new debt owner  to achieve the results outlined below.
A) MyKredit should add together the total of the repayments made  by Miss W towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything MyKredit has already refunded.
B) MyKredit should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual  payments made by 
Miss W which were  considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss W originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint  is settled.
C) MyKredit  should remove all interest, fees and charges  from the balance  on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Miss W as though they had been  
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Miss W having  made  
overpayments then MyKredit should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. MyKredit should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Miss W. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then MyKredit should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan with Miss W. MyKredit 
shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made  up of principal  MyKredit has already written-off.
E) MyKredit should remove any adverse information recorded on Miss Ws credit  file in 
relation to loans  3 to 6. The overall  pattern  of Miss Ws borrowing for loans 7 to 78 means 
Ref: DRN45606174any information recorded about  them is adverse, so MyKredit should remove these loans 
entirely from Miss Ws credit file. MyKredit  does not have to remove any outstanding loans 
from Miss Ws credit file until these have been  repaid, but MyKredit should still remove  any 
adverse information  recorded about these loans.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MyKredit to take off tax from this interest.  MyKredit  must  give 
Miss W a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ws complaint. Global Kapital 
Group Ltd should  put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 April 2020.
