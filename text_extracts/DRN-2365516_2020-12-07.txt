The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) incorrectly recorded his date 
of birth on its records.
What happened
Mr M says he opened his NatWest account in 2006 but recently found out it had incorrectly 
recorded his date of birth on its records. He says a significant mistake has been made and 
says his overdraft balance of about £2,000 should be written off as NatWests agreement is 
with a person that doesnt exist due to the incorrect details. Mr M says NatWests 
compensation offer of £50 is an insult.
NatWest accepts it made a mistake and has corrected it. It says the overdraft debt is a valid 
debt and says it has paid an appropriate compensation amount.
Mr M brought his complaint to us, but our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought this wasnt a significant mistake and that it didnt have any real impact on Mr M. The 
investigator thought the compensation appropriate and didnt think it fair to order NatWest to 
write off the overdraft balance.
Mr M doesnt accept that view and says he suffered depression as a result of the mistake 
and maintains any contract between him and NatWest is now void.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NatWest has paid a fair and reasonable 
compensation amount and I dont require it to do anything further in the circumstances of this 
complaint. I appreciate that Mr M will be disappointed with my decision.
There is no question here that NatWest in 2006 made a mistake in recording Mr Ms date of 
birth on its records. I find that caused no issue until 2020 when it was noticed and I think 
NatWest acted fairly by apologising, correcting the mistake and paying what I think is a fair 
and reasonable amount of £50 compensation.
I dont think Mr M suffered any financial loss as a result of the mistake or that this was a 
significant mistake as he says, as I cant see that it had any impact on Mr M apart from the 
time he would have spent in telling NatWest about the mistake.
I appreciate Mr M says his overdraft is void due to the mistake, but I dont think that is that is 
the case, and, in any event, it would be for a court to decide that. I think Mr M owes NatWest 
the overdraft amount and that has nothing to do with the date of birth issue.
I also appreciate Mr M says he has suffered depression as a result of what took place. I 
dont know why that would be the case as I have explained this mistake was not noticed for 
14 years and in any event, I dont think for the reasons I have explained, it had any real 
impact on Mr M.
Overall, I find NatWest fairly correctly this mistake as soon as it knew about it and that it was 
a minor mistake that had little if any consequences. For those reasons I cant fairly order 
NatWest to increase the compensation or write off the balance of the overdraft.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2021.
