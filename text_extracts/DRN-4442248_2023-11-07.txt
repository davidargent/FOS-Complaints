The complaint
Mr R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) did not fairly compensate him 
after he complained about a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy.
I know Mr R has three complaints with us about PPI compensation. Just to be clear that this 
complaint is about his NatWest credit card ending 06.
What happened
Mr R had a credit card with NatWest and his repayments were covered by a PPI policy. In 
March 2005, Mr R tried to make a claim on the PPI policy and the claim was rejected. 
In or around 2019, Mr R complained to NatWest about the sale of PPI. NatWest agreed that 
it had mis-sold PPI to Mr R and it offered to pay him £541.10 to compensate him for that 
mis-sale.
Sometime later, NatWest said it had looked again at Mr Rs PPI claim from 2005. It said it 
now thought the claim should have been paid and it offered to compensate Mr R. It worked 
out that if the claim had been paid back in 2005, £26,231.16 would have been paid off the 
credit card balance. NatWest also calculated simple interest at the rate of 8% per year which 
came to a net amount of £32,857.79. In total, NatWests total offer to compensate Mr R was 
£58,647.40.
However, NatWest said there was still an outstanding balance on Mr Rs credit card account 
of £23,176.59. NatWest said it was going to keep some of the compensation back to pay 
that balance off. In September 2022, it paid £35,470.81 directly to Mr R and paid £23,176.59 
into his credit card account to clear the balance.
Mr R didnt think any deductions should have been taken from the compensation. He said 
NatWest had previously told him that the outstanding credit card debt was statute barred. In 
other words, it was too late for NatWest to take any action to recover the outstanding 
balance on his credit card. In response, NatWest said the debt was not statute-barred 
because payments were still being made towards the account in August 2019. NatWest 
offered to pay £50 to Mr R because it had given him incorrect information on that point.
Mr R complained to this service. He told us NatWest shouldnt have deducted anything from 
the offer of compensation. He said he hadnt made any payments towards NatWest debts in 
2019 and NatWest hadnt provided any proof that he did. He raised several customer service 
issues with NatWest and said he thought he should be compensated for those failings.
Our investigator looked at the complaint. He said he thought it was fair for NatWest to use 
some of Mr Rs compensation to pay off the outstanding balance of the credit card. Mr R did 
not accept that view. He said he had made over 300 telephone calls to NatWest and that he 
thought NatWest should pay him compensation for the inconvenience he was put to.
As Mr R did not agree with our investigators view, the matter was passed to me for an 
ombudsmans decision.
I then issued a provisional decision in which I said I didnt think the complaint should be 
upheld. I said: 
The first thing Ive looked at is whether it was fair for NatWest to keep some of    
Mr Rs compensation back to pay off what it said was an outstanding balance on his 
credit card.
As I said above, NatWest said Mr R owed £23,176.59 on his credit card. NatWest 
provided us with some of Mr Rs account data and Im satisfied that this balance was 
outstanding at the time the deduction was made. Im also satisfied that NatWest 
cleared this balance on 29 September 2022.
I know Mr R feels strongly that this debt was statute barred and that NatWest could 
not take action to recover it. But even if Mr Rs debt was statute barred, that doesnt 
mean the outstanding balance had disappeared  Mr R would still have owed that 
money even if NatWest had left it too late to take court action to get it back.
In a situation like this, we generally say that where two people  or a person and a 
business  owe each other money, it is fair that they each pay what they owe. So, in 
this case, when NatWest calculated Mr Rs compensation, it worked out it owed him 
some money. But as he still had an outstanding balance on his credit card, Mr R also 
owed NatWest some money. In that situation, I think it is fair for NatWest to keep 
back enough of the compensation to pay off the outstanding balance on Mr Rs credit 
card account.
I think thats especially so in this case as NatWest decided to pay compensation to 
Mr R because it thought his PPI claim should have been paid back in 2005. So, if 
things had gone as they should have done back in 2005, Mr Rs credit card balance 
would have been settled at that time. I think its unlikely any of the claim would have 
been paid directly to Mr R.
With all of these things in mind, my provisional view is that it is fair for NatWest to 
keep some of Mr Rs compensation back to settle the outstanding balance on his 
credit card.
I know Mr R feels very strongly that NatWest should pay him further compensation 
for all the trouble he was put to in making a significant number of calls in connection 
to his complaint. And Im sorry to learn that all of this has had a detrimental impact on 
Mr Rs health. 
Ive thought carefully about this matter, but I dont think it would be fair for me to tell 
NatWest to pay any more compensation here. I say this because I think the 
compensation NatWest has paid to Mr R is very significantly more generous than I 
would expect. As I said above, NatWest calculated net simple interest in this case to 
be over £32,000 and it paid over £35,000 to Mr R in September 2022.
However, I would only expect simple interest to be paid to Mr R where he had been 
out of pocket because of a mistake made by NatWest.
What that means in practice is that Id only expect NatWest to pay simple interest to 
Mr R from the point his credit card balance had been repaid in full. However, in this 
case, there appears to have been an outstanding balance on the credit card up to 
September 2022. In those circumstances, I wouldnt have expected NatWest to pay 
simple interest from 2005, which it did in this case.
With that in mind, NatWest appears to have paid Mr R over £32,000 in simple 
interest from 2005. As it has paid several thousands of pounds more than Id expect 
it to pay, I dont think it would be fair for me to make a further award to compensate 
Mr R for the customer service issues he may have encountered when pursuing his 
complaint.
On that basis, my provisional view is that it wouldnt be fair for me to tell NatWest to 
take any further action to put things right for Mr R.I asked the parties to provide me with any further information or evidence they wanted me to 
consider before I issued a final decision. NatWest did not have any further comments. Mr R 
responded by email and by phone. Before making this final decision, I have listened to all the 
calls Mr R made to this service and I have also considered the content of his emails in 
response to my provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I do appreciate Mr R feels very strongly about his case, but I am afraid after considering the 
additional representations at some length, I have not upheld the complaint. 
I note from Mr Rs email of 2 November 2023 that he said NatWest should and could 
compensate [him] for the trauma caused due to them mis-selling [PPI]. However, I need to 
make clear that the issue before me is not about whether PPI was mis-sold to Mr R. 
NatWest issued its final response about the mis-sale back in 2019. The issue before me is 
about the compensation NatWest paid to Mr R in 2022 after it said his PPI claim was 
wrongly rejected in 2005. 
I have listened to the telephone call between Mr R and this service on 2 November 2023. I 
note that Mr R said it was not for me to determine whether NatWest had paid him more than 
it needed to. I also note from Mr Rs email that he said he was seeking compensation for the 
time hed taken to pursue his complaint and for the upset NatWest caused him. 
I have no reason to doubt what Mr R told us about the customer service issues he 
experienced. However, when I am considering whether to make an award, I must determine 
what I consider to be fair compensation after taking account of all the circumstances in the 
complaint. Im satisfied that the amount of compensation NatWest already paid to Mr R is 
highly relevant and it is something I should consider when deciding a fair outcome to this 
matter. 
I do appreciate what Mr R told us about the calls he said hed made to NatWest and that he 
was put to some upset and inconvenience in pursuing his complaint. However, I explained in 
my provisional decision why I thought NatWest had refunded considerably more than it 
needed to. When balancing this against the customer service issues Mr R had with NatWest, 
I am not satisfied that it would be fair to require NatWest to pay further compensation here. 
I am sorry that Mr R will be disappointed with my decision, but for the reasons set out above 
and in my provisional decision, I have not upheld the complaint. I do not require NatWest to 
take any further action in this matter. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint about National Westminster Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 December 2023.
