K820x#14complaint
Ms S is unhappy National Westminster Bank  Plc (NatWest) told her it couldnt amend the 
date unarranged overdraft charges debited her account. Ms S says NatWest  has an 
obligation to tell its customers the charging date can be changed. 
Ms S wants NatWest  to refund unarranged overdraft charges shes  incurred since             
August 2014.  
background
Ms S opened a bank account  with NatWest in November 2012.  An arranged  overdraft  was 
added in August  2014. 
In August  2018,  Ms S called NatWest and asked  if she could change  the date unarranged 
overdraft charges debited her account. She said having the fees charged to her account on 
or around  the 16th of each  month caused  her to go beyond her arranged  overdraft limit - as 
there were often insufficient funds in her account at this time of the month. 
NatWests adviser changed the charging period, which  in turn changed the date unarranged 
overdraft charges left her account to on or around the 26th of each month. During the call Ms 
S complained that shed asked NatWest  to do this a few times but had been  told it wasnt 
possible.  
NatWest looked  into Ms S complaint and agreed  that shed been given incorrect advice on a 
few occasions,  the first being in August 2017. So it agreed to refund unarranged  overdraft  
charges from this time.
But NatWest  didnt  think it should  refund unarranged  overdraft charges prior to August 2017  
because it couldnt  see that Ms S had raised  the issue before this time. It said Ms S had a 
duty to manage  her account and make  provision for the charges. It added that her bank 
statements showed the charging  period and so it was satisfied itd brought it to her attention. 
But Ms S thinks NatWest should  refund  all the unarranged overdraft charges shes incurred 
from the time her arranged overdraft was added to her account. She says NatWest  
shouldve brought it to her attention that the charging date could be changed and feels it 
deliberately didnt disclose this. 
Our investigator looked at the complaint and thought  NatWest  had acted fairly.  From  the 
information shed  seen she was satisfied that Ms S first asked NatWest  to change the 
payment date in August 2017.  So she thought  NatWest had acted  reasonably by refunding 
unarranged overdraft charges from this date. 
She added that a previous refund  dated 2014  - was in connection with a packaged bank 
account fee, and so wasnt related to unarranged  overdraft charges. As such our investigator  
said this didnt support  Ms S argument that shed  asked  NatWest to change  the charging  
date prior to August 2017. 
And she didnt feel NatWest had to make Ms S aware that she could change  the charging 
date when writing  to notify her of unarranged overdraft charges.
Ref: DRN68541852Ms S didnt accept our investigators  findings.  She said NatWest had repeatedly denied her 
requests to change the charging date.  She said the investigator hadnt considered all the 
evidence  including a visit she made  to a NatWest branch in August 2016,  and a telephone 
call with NatWest in August 2018.  
Because Ms S didnt  agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms S has been given  the opportunity to provide further information  and an extension  was 
granted to allow her to do this. As weve not heard from Ms S since, Ive considered the 
complaint based  on the information I have.  
Ms S isnt disputing whether the unarranged  overdraft charges are unfair. She understands 
that if she goes  beyond her arranged overdraft  limit shell incur charges. But shes  unhappy 
with how NatWest handled her request to change  the date these charges debited her 
account.
Ms S says shed asked  NatWest about changing  the charging  date prior to August 2017, but 
was told this wasnt possible. Ive carefully considered the evidence,  and having done so, 
Ive not seen enough to persuade  me that this happened. 
Ive listened to the calls Ms S had with NatWest in August 2018. In the first call she says 
shed raised the issue a few times  over the past two years. In the second call, she details 
when this happened and refers to visiting a NatWest branch  in September and                  
November 2017.  Ms S also said that shed called  and complained  about the issue  and was 
given a refund of her unarranged overdraft charges from NatWest,  but it was positioned  as a 
gesture of goodwill. But as these instances  happened after August 2017,  I cant  conclude  
that Ms S had raised the issue prior to August 2017.  And Ive not seen evidence  of a branch 
visit in August 2016, so Im not persuaded that Ms S had raised the issue at this time. 
 
Ms S also said she received a refund in 2014  for what she thought was unarranged overdraft 
charges, but as our investigator  has explained, this was in relation to packaged  bank 
account fees. A packaged bank account is generally a normal  current account with a range 
of insurance policies and other benefits  added to it, for which a consumer pays a premium 
on a monthly basis. So this doesnt  prove that Ms S asked  NatWest to change  the charging  
date at this time. So from what Ive seen, I think NatWest has acted fairly  by refunding 
unarranged overdraft charges from August 2017.
Ive considered Ms S concern that she feels NatWest deliberately didnt disclose in its letter 
of 20 August 2018 that the charging period could be changed. Ive looked at the letter  and it 
says the charging  period runs month to month,  usually from the date you opened  your 
account.  I accept that it doesnt say the charging  period can be changed, but thats not 
something NatWest has to do  and having  looked at relevant regulations, Im not satisfied 
its breached any obligations by not doing  so. So I cant  say that NatWest has done anything 
wrong in respect  of this.
Ref: DRN68541853Its not clear if Ms S is in financial difficulty. Shes  said that NatWest  contacted  her following  
her complaint to see if it could help but she declined  its offer.  Ms S is under the impression 
that NatWest only got in touch with her because  shed  made  a complaint. Regardless of 
what led to NatWest contacting her, if Ms S finds herself in financial difficulty,  I recommend 
she speak to NatWest  to discuss her situation  further. I would expect NatWest to meets  its 
obligations to treat her situation  positively  and sympathetically.
Taking everything in to account, Im satisfied NatWest has acted fairly  and so it follows that I 
wont be asking it to do anything further.
I know this outcome will be disappointing  for Ms S but I hope  she understands the reasons 
for my decision.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 June  2019.
