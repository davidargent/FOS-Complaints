Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint about loans 6 onward  and thought that these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed, and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN35195482refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think loans 1  5 should  be upheld, and Mr H seems to have  agreed  
with this opinion.  So as these loans are no longer  in dispute, I havent  considered  these 
loans further.  But I have kept all of Mr Hs loans in mind  when  looking at his overall lending 
history with Sunny.  
Having considered the pattern of Mr Hs overall lending history  with Sunny, I thought about 
whether there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
Loan 6. I say this because  I think  at this point Sunny ought to have  realised Mr H was not 
managing his finances well. Mr H had taken out five loans in nine months. Loan 1 was for 
£300, and then loans 2  5 were each for between £100 and £150 - so at this point it might 
have looked like Mr H was becoming  less reliant  on this type of lending. However, Mr H then 
applied for loan 6 for £200,  which is an increase from his previous 4 loans so at this point 
Sunny ought to have realised that Mr H was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in their income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
 
Sunny says that there  was a gap in the lending of almost five months between loans 4 and 
5. I have seen  this gap and have  considered  whether this was significant enough to break 
the chain of lending. But I dont think the gap is long enough in this case to signal a gap in 
lending, especially considering loans 3 and 4 were overlapping loans. So, I have considered 
these loans to all form part of the same chain.  
As mentioned above, loans 3 and 4 were overlapping loans. Loan 5 was taken off after all 
previous loans were  paid off, but less than a month after paying off loan 5, Mr H requested  
loan 6. So, I do think the evidence suggests Mr H was becoming reliant on short  term 
lending and over the course of the lending history Mr H had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended period  over 20 months
Ref: DRN35195483I think that Mr H lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr H s indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 onwards and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 6 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loans  6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 - 9 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 April 2020..
