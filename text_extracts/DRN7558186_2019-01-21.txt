K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wouldnt honour a cheque  hed paid to 
an overseas bank account  he holds. Mr B lost money because of exchange rate fluctuations.
background
Mr B paid a cheque from his NatWest  account  to an account he holds overseas. NatWest 
returned the cheque unpaid because  it didnt think the cheques  signature matched the 
mandate it held for Mr B. When the money  was returned to his NatWest account, Mr B 
suffered a loss because  of exchange  rate fluctuations.
Our investigator didnt  think the complaint should be upheld. She wasnt persuaded that 
NatWest had acted  unreasonably by stopping the cheque,  because  she thought it had acted 
within its security  procedures.  
She also found that the overseas bank had credited the money  to Mr Bs account  before the 
cheque had been authorised by NatWest. So she wasnt  persuaded that NatWest  had 
caused the loss Mr B had suffered. 
Mr B didnt agree with the investigators conclusions, so the complaint has been  passed to 
me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest returned  Mr Bs cheque unpaid because  it wasnt satisfied that the cheques 
signature matched  the mandate it held for Mr B.
The mandate in question  was signed  in 1989. Mr B doesnt consider the signature on the 
cheque differs significantly from the mandate. He also points out that NatWest  had recently  
accepted his signature on tax forms hed had to sign. Mr B also mentioned another cheque  
hed signed, around a year earlier, which NatWest had paid without question.
Ive thought carefully about everything Mr B has said and provided. Ive also looked closely 
at the signatures  on the cheque in question, and the 1989 mandate. 
The cheque at the centre of this complaint concerned a large  withdrawal from an account 
that I understand Mr B doesnt use frequently.  Keeping that in mind,  I dont think  it was 
unreasonable for NatWest to ensure that the cheque had been  properly  signed  by Mr B. And 
even though I accept that there  are similarities  between the signatures  on the cheque and 
the mandate, I think there are enough  differences to make it reasonable for NatWest to stop 
the cheque. In particular,  I think the formation of Mr Bs first name  and middle initial on the 
cheque and mandate are different. And on the mandate  his middle initial  and surname are 
linked, whereas on the cheque they are separate.
Mr B points out that NatWest accepted the signature on his tax residency form without 
question. And hed also successfully paid a cheque from the same account  the previous year 
(albeit for a very much smaller amount). So I can understand why Mr B might consider 
NatWest shouldve also accepted the signature on the cheque  in question.
Ref: DRN75581862But as Ive already said,  the amount being paid from Mr Bs account was large, and 
NatWests main aim is to protect its customer.  And in doing so its reasonable for its level of 
checks to be proportionate  to the sums  of money involved. So even though  there may have 
been other occasions where Mr Bs signature had been accepted, none of these involved 
such a large sum of money. So in this case I dont think it was unreasonable for NatWest to 
return the cheque  unpaid for security reasons.
It follows that I dont find NatWest responsible for the loss Mr B suffered on his overseas 
account.
I realise that my decision will be disappointing for Mr B, but I hope he will understand why 
Im unable to uphold his complaint on this occasion.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 February  2019.
