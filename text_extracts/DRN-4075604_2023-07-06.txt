The complaint
Mr K complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) allowed a payment to be taken 
by a third party without his input and approval. 
What happened
On 28 March 2020 Mr K entered a contract with a third party and paid for this using his 
PayPal account. He raised an unauthorised activity dispute with PayPal after the third party 
took a second payment from his bank account, via his PayPal, in April 2021. PayPal denied 
the claim as they said there was no evidence of unauthorised activity on the account. Mr K 
brought his complaint to us.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She thought PayPal acted in line with the user 
agreement. She said when Mr K entered into a bill payment agreement, he made the 
recipient third party a trusted beneficiary of all payments, so PayPal wouldnt ask him to 
login - with a password pin or similar - to approve subsequent payments when they were 
made. So, she couldnt ask PayPal to do anymore.
Mr K didnt agree. He asked for the matter to be escalated to an ombudsman. He said the 
agreement didnt take place, there were no records conversations or emails showing this 
happening. He said his contract was with the third party and he paid an agreed price to them 
using his PayPal account but there were no conditions or commitments attached. He thought 
PayPal should police how their contract of use was being used. Mr K accepted there were 
pathways to set billing agreements on his payments which were in his control but there were 
not being policed by PayPal in line with the requirements of their contract of use.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive come to the same outcome as our investigator. Ill explain why.
I realise that Mr K was unhappy with the third party who took the funds from his account. 
And I understand, although hes now been refunded in full, he wants to hold PayPal to 
account for what he considers to be their wrongdoing. 
As our investigator has already explained what I Iook at is the dispute between Mr K and 
PayPal, not that third Party. And, Im afraid, I dont think PayPal have acted unfairly or made 
any errors here. 
Where facts have been in dispute, incomplete or inconclusive and I cant know exactly 
whats happened, Ive decided whats more likely to have happened, at the time, on a 
balance of probabilities.
The records from PayPal satisfy me that a billing arrangement was set up here on 28 March 
2020. So, the third party, was a trusted beneficiary. And when the third party requested 
funds in April 2021 PayPal did nothing wrong when it made that payment.
The issue here is who set that billing arrangement up. Mr K is adamant, he didnt give 
authority for any future payments to be taken. But PayPal is a user initiated service, they 
cant create a billing agreement on behalf of a customer or change the payment method.
That means whatever billing agreement was in place between Mr K and the third party was 
one the user would have set up at the checkout. And the records show that Mr Ks PayPal 
account was accessed on 28 March 2020 using his username and password to make the 
payment. So, on balance, Im satisfied this arrangement was set up by him. 
Mr K would have been reminded of this - or alerted to a problem if he didnt think a recurring 
payment had been authorised - when the third party wrote to him on 19 March 2021. That 
was before the second payment was taken and it explained Mr Ks purchase would 
automatically renew. And that - unless he contacted them - payment would be taken from 
your  PayPal account used last year. 
I understand this is not the answer Mr K was hoping for but I hope Ive been able to explain 
my reasons for coming to this view.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2023.
