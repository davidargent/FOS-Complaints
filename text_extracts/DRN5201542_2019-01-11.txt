K822xcomplaint
Ms Z complains that WorldPay  (UK) Limited  unfairly stopped a payment from her client  and closed 
her account.  She said WorldPay  should  compensate her for damaging  her business and the stress 
it had caused.  And said WorldPay shouldnt charge fees for the transaction. 
background 
WorldPay said it recalled the funds for a large transaction to Ms Z in response to a request from 
the card holders bank  and it requested  more  information from Ms Z. It later said it had concerns 
about the transaction and decided  to investigate further. Ms Z said the transaction  was carried out 
on behalf of her client via her WorldPay terminal and WorldPay  said it would return the funds to the 
card holder,  but the refund was delayed.  She said her client hadnt recalled the funds and the 
money was being  held by WorldPay. Ms Z said WorldPay then suggested  she refund her client 
from her own funds,  but she said this wasnt the correct thing to do and declined.  WorldPay opted 
to close Ms Zs account and wrote to tell her this.
Ms Z questioned WorldPays  transaction charges.  WorldPay  said its fees were chargeable for 
processing the transaction regardless of whether the transaction is charged back  or not. It said it 
had cleared the other associated charges but Ms Zs account  would  remain  closed.
Our investigator recommended the complaint  be upheld saying WorldPay  had no money  
laundering concerns but felt the transaction was outside Ms Zs normal trading pattern. He said the 
transaction appeared to be genuine and WorldPay shouldve verified it and returned the funds  to 
Ms Zs client.  He said WorldPay should waive its transaction fees.  
WorldPay reversed the transaction.  It accepted it had caused delay and agreed to waive  its fees of 
just over £1,000.  Ms Z said her business losses should also be covered by WorldPay  as well as 
compensation for her stress and inconvenience, and her clients  bank  charges.
A second investigator said it wasnt wrong  for WorldPay to question  the transaction,  but once 
accepted as genuine it shouldnt have taken two months to refund. She said WorldPay  wasnt  
consulted about  the method of payment and it was likely to fail due to the amount; the cardholder 
not being present and the description of the service. She said even  if a refund had been made 
immediately the charges  would apply and Ms Zs clients bank  charges  werent  WorldPays 
responsibility. She said Ms Z hasnt shown evidence of business losses, but has obviously suffered 
inconvenience and WorldPay  should pay her £500 compensation. 
Ms Z disagreed, saying the investigator is biased  to WorldPay. She said that before she was 
diagnosed with a serious illness her business had a substantial turnover, but her health  and 
subsequent losses  werent considered by the investigator. She said her rental of a studio  that she 
hadnt been able to use and her clients bank charges should be repaid. Ms Z said compensation 
of only £500 is totally unacceptable and she feels persecuted  by WorldPay, and our service about 
proving losses. Ms Z requested an ombudsman  review her complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. This includes the business  information relating to Ms Z, 
including the letter from Ms Zs supplier  and invoices from her suppliers.
Ive looked carefully  at WorldPays handling of Ms Zs account to see if it treated her fairly. In order  
to comply with regulatory responsibilities banks are required to question transactions that may 
pose a risk to the lawful transfer of funds.  Ive seen that WorldPay investigated the transaction in 
Ref: DRN52015422accordance with the procedures set out within  the terms  and conditions  of the account. The 
transaction was for a different type of business than that which Ms Z had described  to WorldPay 
and was for a much  greater amount than her previous  payments. Im of the view that it was 
reasonable for WorldPay to question the transaction.
WorldPay closed Ms Zs account,  which she said was unfair. I can see that Ms Z operates a 
bespoke business  which hasnt been  correctly  classified  in her relationship with WorldPay. The 
description of her business activities is set out within hire agreement for the payment terminal with 
WorldPay and appears to bear Ms Zs signatures. So its not clear how this mistake  occurred,  but I 
dont think this was the only reason why WorldPay closed her account. In any event I can see that 
WorldPay has acted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the account  and so hasnt 
done anything  wrong. Banks arent  required to provide an account and dont have to give specific 
reasons for declining to do so. 
Ive looked at the communications between the parties and can see that WorldPay gave Ms Z 
misinformation about  the transaction  and its refund.  I dont think  it was fair for WorldPay to give Ms 
Z the impression that she should make the refund herself. WorldPays  communications  were also 
very poor in that it didnt make  call backs when required and Ms Z found  it impossible  to make 
contact on occasions   Ms Z made  many  calls in an attempt  to resolve the problem. 
Ms Z was made aware that she needed  a new terminal provider but didnt arrange  this for over two 
months. During this time WorldPay advised Ms Z to open a second  account because her payment 
terminal couldnt be used  for transactions outside of the category of business aligned to her 
account, which she said wasnt  her main line of business. Unfortunately WorldPay  wouldnt open  
another account for Ms Zs business.
WorldPay took two months  longer to return the funds to Ms Zs client than it needed to, and I think 
this was far too slow. Ms Z said that the holding up of this transaction and the closure of her 
account caused her business a lot of damage. I can well understand the frustration and 
inconvenience to Ms Z in dealing with WorldPay, but it was entitled to close  her account and told 
her it would do this and so I wont award  compensation  for the problems the account closure 
caused Ms Z. I have  considered compensation for the problems for Ms Z from the delayed refund 
to her client.
Ms Z said WorldPays  actions meant she couldnt pay her suppliers on time, which damaged her 
reputation, and she had to refund  a client for a job she didnt complete. As Ms Z is claiming  for 
commercial losses we said we need  to see clear  supporting evidence.  Ms Z has shown us some 
information about her sales,  which vary considerably from month  to month,  and her daily rate, at 
which she claims 78 lost days.  Ive considered Ms Zs information but I dont think it shows that 
WorldPays delayed handling of the transaction caused her to lose this business, or that it 
damaged her reputation. It seems excessive  to say that 78 days  of work were lost through non-
payment of single transaction. The work for this transaction appears to be going ahead and there is 
no evidence of other losses. Ms Zs business  records show she received payments from clients by 
other means  so her business  wasnt frozen.
Ms Z said WorldPay  should refund her clients transaction bank charges. I dont think this would be 
fair as Ms Zs client isnt WorldPays client or responsibility and the charges wouldve been  incurred  
by her client whatever  the outcome of the transaction. Ms Z claimed for studio rental costs, which 
she said she wasnt able to use for several  weeks following repayment  of the transaction.  I cant be 
certain from the business information Ms Z has provided that she was unable to use the studio 
because she couldnt afford any stock, and so it wouldnt be fair for her to be compensated for this.
Ms Z has shown that shes  been  very unwell and the problem with the transaction  has been difficult  
to handle. I agree with the investigator that WorldPay  made things much more  difficult  for Ms Z 
Ref: DRN52015423than was necessary  and compensation of £500 would be fair. WorldPay  has agreed  to waive all of 
its charges even though it wasnt unreasonable for it to decline the transaction, and this amounts to 
around a further  £1,000.
I sympathise with Ms Z for the problems she faced in dealing with the declined  transaction from her 
client, and with her client  for the delayed refund of her funds. I can see that this would have  added  
to the stress Ms Z was experiencing  as a consequence of a serious illness  with which  she was 
coping.
I was also sorry to learn that Ms Z feels persecuted. This is certainly  not our intention, but we do 
need proof that clearly demonstrates  business losses for which  we are requested  to award 
compensation. As I have said I dont think the information Ms Z has provided does this and so I 
dont require WorldPay to pay her the compensation she has requested. I realise she will be 
disappointed, but overall I think  the compensation recommended is fair in the circumstances. 
I recommend that Ms Z accepts the compensation I have set out here. However,  she should note 
that if she wants to reject  this Final  Decision she can pursue her complaint  by means of legal 
action.
my final decision
For the reasons  I have  given it is my final decision that the complaint  is upheld.  I require WorldPay 
(UK) Limited to pay Ms Z £500  compensation for the poor service it gave her.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms Z to accept or reject 
my decision  before 11 February 2019.
