K820x#14Complaint
Mr J complains that MoneyGram International Limited wouldnt process  a transaction  he 
wanted to make to his brother abroad. He also says MoneyGram didnt make it clear  to him 
that he would have been able to make the transaction at one of its stores.  
Background
On 27 December 2017, Mr J set up an online account with MoneyGram  and he tried to send  
£500 to his brother who was overseas. But MoneyGram rejected the payment and returned it 
to him. Mr J says he hasnt done anything wrong  and MoneyGram wouldnt explain why it 
didnt process his payment. 
Mr J also said MoneyGram have provided  him with different explanations for its actions 
which he found confusing. And when he called MoneyGram to find out what  was wrong with 
his payment it incorrectly told him that he was banned from using all its services. And it didnt 
make it clear  to him that the only service he couldnt  use was its online services.  So, Mr J 
visit another money transfer service,  which  was more  expensive  and further away from his 
home address than his nearest MoneyGram store. 
MoneyGram said that all its transactions are put through routine monitoring and security 
checks. It said it actively reviews transaction amounts and frequencies and will, from time to 
time, put restrictions in place to safeguard its consumers.  And if it doesnt feel comfortable 
with the send or receive activity, or with the purpose of the transaction, the service could be 
declined. MoneyGram  also explained  that it was concerned Mr J had been the victim  of a 
scam or fraud regarding the payment  he wanted to make to his brother. So, it stopped the 
payment. 
MoneyGram also said that it believes it wouldve made it clear  to Mr J, when  he called, that it 
was referring to Mr Js ability to use its online service when it told him he couldnt use its 
services. And said Mr J couldve made  his payment from one of its stores  by going in with 
the cash and some identification.
Mr J wasnt happy with this explanation.  He said MoneyGram didnt make things clear. And 
he was inconvenienced. So, he brought his complaint to our service.
One of our adjudicators investigated Mr Js complaint. He said MoneyGram hadnt done  
anything wrong  and had acted in accordance  with the terms and conditions. And that it had 
complied with its legal and regulatory  obligations when it decided to review and reject Mr Js 
payment. The adjudicator  also said that MoneyGram  didnt have  to provide Mr J with an 
explanation and had the right to choose  who it decided  to do business  with. 
In response, Mr J said he accepted MoneyGram could stop his payment. But said had 
MoneyGram asked him some questions it would have understood his payment was 
legitimate. Mr J also maintained that MoneyGram  told him he was banned from using all its 
services. 
As no agreement could be reached  the matter was referred to me to decide.
My provisional decision
Ref: DRN41769782After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 3 
December 2019.  In my provisional decision I said as follows:
Mr J says he hasnt done anything wrong and he hasnt been the victim of a scam. That may 
well be the case.  But a business  like MoneyGram has to have in place security  measures  
and procedures in order to try to prevent  fraud and safeguard its customers  accounts.  And 
its not for this service to interfere with these processes. Thats a matter for MoneyGram.
There is a balance to be achieved between MoneyGram assisting individuals  who contact  it 
to make payments  and it providing protection from fraud. Having put a fraud detection  
system in place, when  it flags up a transaction as potentially suspicious, its not 
unreasonable for MoneyGram to act on that. And thats what happened  here.  MoneyGram 
believed Mr J had fallen  victim to a scam. 
Its for MoneyGram  to decide what factors their system should look at when reviewing 
transactions. And I havent  seen anything  which suggests it was used unfairly  or incorrectly  
here. So, I cant say MoneyGram did anything  wrong when it declined  to process Mr Js 
payment in December  2017.
Mr J says MoneyGram hasnt fully explained why it wouldnt process his payment. 
And I can understand that hes frustrated that he hasnt been  given a proper explanation.
But MoneyGram doesnt have to provide this information to him. So, I cant say it did 
anything wrong  by not giving this to him. 
Mr J says MoneyGram didnt make it clear  to him that it was only his access to its online 
services which  were  blocked. He says when he called  MoneyGram  on 27 December 2017, 
he was told that there  was no point in attempting to use any of their services  as anything  
connected to my address would trigger the block, even  if I used  a different debit card. 
Unfortunately, MoneyGram  hasnt  been  able to provide a copy  of its recording of the call it 
had with Mr J. So, I cant be sure what was said during the conversation. I note MoneyGram 
has told our investigator that it strongly believes the phone representative was referring to 
his ability  to use MoneyGram online services, during the call. MoneyGram also confirmed 
that Mr J would have  been able to make his payment  from one of its stores  with valid 
identification and cash. And that it was only its online services Mr J couldnt use.
Where evidence is incomplete or contradictory,  as it is in this case,  Ive reached my 
conclusions on the balance of probabilities. That is what I think  is most likely to have 
happened. In doing so, Ive considered Mr Js actions after his payment was rejected by 
MoneyGram.
Mr J says he travelled to another money transfer service, which was located further away  
than his nearest  MoneyGram store. And that the transaction cost Mr J £25, which he says 
was more expensive  than if hed used MoneyGram.  I dont  think  its likely he wouldve taken 
this action unless  hed believed he was banned from using all MoneyGrams services. So, 
on the balance  of probabilities, I think its more likely that MoneyGram didnt make it clear  to 
Mr J, that he wouldve been able to use its services in store.  
As a result, I consider  that Mr J has been  caused  some trouble and upset. And he is entitled 
to some compensation caused by MoneyGram not providing clear information  to him about 
his access to its services. 
Ref: DRN41769783I can see that Mr J had to travel to make  his transaction and spent several hours on the 
phone with MoneyGram trying to sort things  out. He also paid £25 to send money to his 
brother using another payment services  provider. So, Im currently minded  to uphold Mr Js 
complaint in part, and direct  MoneyGram to pay Mr J £25 for his financial loss and £75 
compensation - £100 in total for what took place. I think that amount fairly reflects the level of 
trouble and upset  caused to him. 
So subject to any further representations by Mr J or MoneyGram, my provisional decision 
was that I was minded to partly  uphold this complaint.
Mr J responded to my provisional decision.  In summary he said that the level of 
compensation doesnt reflect the amount of distress and inconvenience  hes suffered. He 
wants more money, an apology and to be able to use MoneyGrams online services.  
MoneyGram didnt respond to my provisional decision.
My findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not persuaded that I 
should change  my provisional  decision.
As I set out in my provisional  decision, its for MoneyGram to decide what  factors their 
system should look at when reviewing transactions. And I havent seen anything  which  
suggests it was used unfairly or incorrectly here. So, I cant say MoneyGram did anything  
wrong when it declined to process Mr Js payment  in December 2017.
Im also satisfied that MoneyGram  hasnt done anything wrong by not providing Mr J a 
detailed explanation about why it declined to process his payment. MoneyGram doesnt 
have to provide  this information to him. So, I cant say it did anything  wrong by not giving this 
to him. As much as hed like to know.
For the reasons  Ive already given  in my provisional  decision, Im satisfied that MoneyGram 
didnt make it clear to Mr J, that he wouldve been able to use its services in store.  And as 
result Mr J was caused some trouble and upset. 
I know Mr J wants  MoneyGram to allow him to use its online services.  But businesses  can 
make commercial decisions  about who it offers services to. And they can say they no longer 
wish to business with individuals.  Thats because theyve got the commercial freedom to 
decide who they want to contract with. Im satisfied  that MoneyGram has exercised its 
commercial decision legitimately. So, I wont be asking MoneyGram to reopen Mr Js online 
account. 
I acknowledge Mr J says that £100 compensation doesnt reflect the amount  of distress hes 
suffered. And the time and effort hes spent trying to sort things out. But hes not provided 
any compelling evidence  in support of why the compensation should be so much  higher. So, 
I think that £100 fairly reflects the level of distress  and inconvenience caused  to him. And Im 
not going to ask MoneyGram to do anything  more.
My final decision
Ref: DRN41769784For the reasons  set out above, my decision is that I uphold Mr Js complaint in part. And I 
direct MoneyGram International Limited  to pay Mr J 100 compensation for providing him with 
misleading information.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 January 2020.
