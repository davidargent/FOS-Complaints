K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains at the actions PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA took when a chargeback of a 
payment hed received had been made.
background
Mr C received a personal payment of £50 through PayPal. The element of this that had been 
made by credit card (£42) was charged back on behalf of the buyer. Mr C said that hed 
been told that the chargeback had been cancelled. And he was unhappy that PayPal  did not 
do more to get the money back and that it started collections activity.  The money was 
refunded and PayPal waived  its chargeback fee of £14.
Our investigator did not recommend that the complaint be upheld. He said that:
-The actions of PayPal  in dealing with the chargeback were  limited by the rules of the 
relevant chargeback scheme. It was not able to stop the chargeback and could only 
respond to requests  for information about  the payment through  the scheme.
-It was not PayPal that made a decision on the outcome of the chargeback but the 
card issuer. And this meant that PayPal was not in control  of how long things would 
take to resolve.
-PayPal put a hold on the funds and as Mr C had withdrawn the money his account  
had a negative  balance. That meant  his account was in arrears and PayPal had 
explained this to him.
-He noted that the collections activity had started and the account had been referred 
to a debt collector.  He thought that this hadnt  taken account of the chargeback.
-When Mr C referred  this to PayPal it ceased  the activity. So he thought it had done  
enough to put things  right.
Mr C did not agree. He said that he had raised  the issue of collections activity  on two 
occasions. And it was only after hed needed to get legal advice that this stopped. The 
chargeback amount was a disputed not actual liability so PayPal took action too quickly.  And 
if he hadnt had to spend time dealing with this he could have earned income. He wants  £40 
in compensation.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that the payment was made on 19 January 2018 and a chargeback raised - based  
on this not being authorised - on 19 February 2019.  PayPal says it did not receive any 
confirmation that the chargeback was cancelled. Thats even though  Mr C says he was told 
by the sender that the chargeback was an error.  So I agree with the adjudicator that the 
chargeback process  had to be followed.  Mr C received a refund of £42 on 6 May 2019.
Under the terms of his agreement with PayPal a temporary hold was put on this money.     
Mr C had already withdrawn it from his account. In addition a charge of £14 for the 
chargeback was applied. So Mr Cs account had a negative  balance.  That in itself was a 
breach of his agreement  with PayPal.
Mr C complained first on 2 April 2018  about  the process including  a call on 28 February 
2018 hed had with an agent in the collections team and the fee. The call notes from that day 
Ref: DRN80243072record that hed been told that even if the chargeback came back in his favour then there 
would still be a negative  balance. After that voicemails were  left for him about  payment. 
The response to him from PayPal  on 5 April 2018  was to state that it was correct procedure  
hed been contacted about the negative  balance. And this was to ensure that there was no 
financial loss. PayPal  agreed to waive the fee to reflect the negative experience Mr C had. It 
asked that he get in contact if he wanted to accept the offer.  Mr C wrote on 13 April 2018 to 
say that he would accept the offer. But that hed discussed the situation with his lawyer. 
Thats because hed received a letter from a debt collector on 12 April 2018 and he said he 
had not had warning about  this. On 13 April 2018  PayPal said it had stopped  collections 
activity and recalled  the debt collector.  It said that the collections action was taken because 
until the chargeback  fee had been refunded  there would have been a negative  balance on 
the account irrespective of the way that the chargeback  was determined.
I understand why Mr C was frustrated  about  what happened. Especially as he thought things 
had been resolved with the person whod asked  for a chargeback.  Unfortunately  that person 
hadnt cancelled  the chargeback with the card issuer. So the process continued. PayPal  did 
get the money back for him but not as quickly as hed have liked.  And there  was no 
guarantee this would have been  successful. If there  had been a credit  balance on the 
account then funds would have been put on hold to cover this. As I set out there  wasnt so 
there was a negative  balance  created. I dont  think it was unreasonable  for PayPal to expect 
Mr C to cover this amount  in the meantime. And it seems here that because  of the 
chargeback fee which was not going  to be recovered then collections activity  commenced. 
Im not entirely clear why Mr C felt he needed  legal advice. But Mr C explained to PayPal 
that he felt its actions were heavy  handed.  PayPal took account of what he said and when 
he accepted the refund of the fee stopped collections  activity.  That was a fee which  hed 
always been liable to pay. Taking  account of this refund and that PayPal responded to what 
he said I dont consider I have a reasonable basis to require PayPal to do anything further.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint in the sense that PayPal Europe  Sarl & 
Cie, SCA need take no further action.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 April 2019.
