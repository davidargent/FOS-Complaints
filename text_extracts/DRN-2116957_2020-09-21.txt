The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plcs staff misled him about the process for 
clearing security on its web chats.
What happened
Mr C said hed complained to NatWest. There was confusion over the date that a payment 
plan was set up. Mr C said that was a misunderstanding on his part. Mr C said that hed had 
several webchats, and on one of these, hed been told that it was NatWests policy to 
complete security with him before he could be passed to another department. But then 
NatWest confirmed that wasnt its policy at all. Mr C said that was wasting his time. He told 
us that NatWest had accepted this couldve been handled better, but it was only proposing to 
give feedback. Whenever he complained again, NatWest said it would take 59 days to look 
into issues. 
Mr C said this had taken a great deal of time to deal with. Hed made clear that he wouldnt 
be making any payments until this was dealt with, and NatWest had threatened to affect his 
credit file. Mr C said he wanted NatWest to apologise, and pay compensation for his wasted 
time and for the conduct of its agents.
NatWest has explained that its policy is that it does need to identify its customers before any 
sensitive issues are discussed. Its agents are able to pass someone to another department 
without going through security first, if there are no sensitive details discussed. But that 
security check has to be done at some point, before secure issues can be discussed.
NatWest accepted that on the particular conversation Mr C complained about, it wouldve 
been possible for the agent to pass Mr C through to another department without clearing him 
through security first. So it said that this couldve been handled better, and it would give the 
relevant agent feedback about that. It also set out for Mr C the dates that his plan was set 
up, which Mr C accepts he made a mistake about. When Mr C said he wasnt going to make 
his next payment, NatWest warned him that this could break his repayment plan,  and that in 
turn could affect Mr Cs credit file. NatWest said it may not simply be able to set up a new 
plan for him. It noted Mr Cs complaint that he hadnt been sent a letter confirming the details 
of his repayment plan.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He noted Mr Cs complaint 
about being asked to go through security, then different agents saying different things, and 
NatWest saying it would deal with this through feedback. But our investigator didnt think that 
Mr C had been impacted by this. Our investigator said NatWest hadnt made any mistake 
about the date of Mr Cs payment plan. And our investigator said NatWest was trying to 
resolve issues when Mr C was contacting it. Our investigator didnt think that NatWest had 
been unfair or unreasonable. 
Mr C didnt agree. He said that NatWest lied about its security policy. It set payment plans 
then failed them because of its own mistakes. He said he told NatWest that it failed his plan 
because of an error on its side and it said that if he didnt stick to the plan it would affect his 
credit file. Mr C didnt think it should do that, if he had disputed the plan and had an active 
complaint regarding it. And Mr C said NatWest had now said it closed his accounts because 
he made too many complaints. 
Our investigator said that a complaint about NatWest clearing the debt itself, then closing Mr 
Cs account, would be a fresh complaint, and he would have to raise that with NatWest first. 
If Mr C was intending to take this matter to court, then we wouldnt be able to keep looking 
into it for him.
Mr C said he wanted his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He said hed take a 
decision about what to do about account closure once our service had finished dealing with 
the current issue. This complaint was then passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
Mr C complained that hed been told he had to go through security before he could be 
passed to the team he wanted to speak to. 
Im satisfied that this is a matter of judgment for the relevant agent, not a strict requirement 
of NatWests policy. But Im also satisfied that if Mr C wasnt required to clear security before 
being passed through to the relevant team, he would simply be required to clear it 
afterwards. So I dont think there was any significant detriment to Mr C from this. I think that 
giving feedback to the relevant agent about the banks policy, and apologising to Mr C, is 
enough to make up for whats gone wrong here. I think that provides a fair and reasonable 
outcome to this part of Mr Cs complaint.
Mr C has accepted that he made a mistake about the dates of his plan. But he said that 
NatWest broke the plan, because of its mistakes. 
The complaint response letter I have seen is dated 3 June, and it says that Mr C hasnt yet 
made the overdue payment for May. it warns that if this payment isnt made, the payment 
plan may break, and Mr Cs credit file may be affected. That isnt unreasonable or unfair. 
I have seen the web chat where Mr C was told he needed to make this payment. Ive not 
seen anything to suggest to me that Mr C hadnt paid, by the date of this letter, because of 
an outstanding complaint. And its reasonable for NatWest to warn Mr C about the 
consequences of a missed payment. 
If Mr C wants to complain that his plan did subsequently break, then he would need to raise 
that with NatWest.
I know Mr C will be disappointed, but I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or reject my decision before 19 October 2020.
