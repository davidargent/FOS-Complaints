K821x#15Complaint
Company T is unhappy with the service  it received from PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA
after it fell victim to fraud.
Background
Company T sell products on a well-known buying and selling website. In May 2018
Company Ts account was compromised  on this website and a fraudster was able to change
the linked  PayPal account from Company Ts, to one of their own.  The email address used
was just one digit different  from Company  Ts genuine one. This meant that all proceeds
from Company Ts sales were crediting  the fraudsters PayPal account.  In total, Company T
has lost around £14,000.
The director  of Company T, Mr F, has explained that he usually does the accounts every
quarter. However, he skipped  the accounts  in August 2018 due to illness and holidays.
When he did the accounts in November 2018, he noticed a large discrepancy in the figures.
Coincidently, PayPal  contacted Company T around the same time  on 5 November  2018  -
to flag that it had come across a very similar email address being used on one of Company
Ts listings.
Mr F says PayPal  told him several different things around whether Company T would be
able to get the money back and led him to believe this would be possible. He says it told him
at one point the money would be refunded. But it also told him it wouldnt be able to refund
the £14,000 directly.  Instead it recommended Company T contact  the customers  involved
and asks them to raise item not received claims.  Company T pointed out that its customers
did get their goods  though. PayPal explained that if they raised  item not received claims,
PayPal would ask the fraudulent seller for proof of delivery, and as it knows theyre  a
fraudster, the claims would be successful. Company Ts customers would then be refunded
by PayPal and they in turn could  refund  Company T.
Company T asked what would happen if the fraudsters  account didnt have any money in to
return. PayPal  explained  that it would put the account in a negative balance to ensure the
buyers received  a refund.
Company T went ahead  and emailed around 800 customers, letting them know  what had
happened and asking them to raise a claim with PayPal. Unfortunately, the claims didnt
work and the customers who did raise  them,  had the claims rejected. Some of Company Ts
customers were  also very unhappy  to be asked to raise a claim for non-receipt  of goods,
when they had received them. They believed Company T was acting fraudulently in asking
them to do this. There were a few instances  where  Company  T was reported to the
marketing platform it uses and customers said they would not buy from them  again.
Company T was unhappy with the advice it was given, saying it was negligent  and caused  a
great deal of inconvenience  and reputational damage to its business. It was also unhappy
that PayPal admitted willingness to send the fraudsters  account into a negative balance  to
refund Company Ts customers,  but wouldnt just refund its account directly.
PayPal responded  to Company Ts complaint explaining that the compromise had occurred
on the buying and selling  website, so Company T would need  to contact them  for assistance
in claiming the money back.
Ref: DRN59826952Company T referred its complaint to our service.  Our investigator didnt uphold the
complaint. She concluded that PayPal  blocked  the fraudulent account as soon as it realised
something wasnt right and by that point, following refunds being processed, there  was no
money remaining  in the account. She also acknowledged that PayPals recommendation for
Company T to ask its customers to raise item not received claims didnt have the desired
outcome and caused inconvenience. However,  she said that PayPal was just trying to be
helpful and wasnt  to know how Company Ts customers would react.
Company T disagreed. It said the main issue is the fact that every  step of the way PayPal
led it to believe the money  was recoverable and would be returned  via various methods.
Company T says if PayPal had just told it not to bother from the start, it wouldnt be here and
have wasted so much time.
Because Company T disagreed, the complaint  has been passed to me to decide.
My provisional findings  
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on
8 February 2021.  I provide a copy of my findings  from that decision below:
Recovery of funds
Company T is able to bring its complaint as a customer of PayPal  and in this situation, I
would expect PayPal  to try and help Company T recover any money  it may have lost, as
everyone is in agreement it fell victim  to fraud. PayPals ability to help recover funds
depended on whether any of Company Ts money  remained  in the fraudsters  account  once it
was on notice of what had happened.
I appreciate Company T is unhappy  that PayPal indicated it would put the fraudsters account
into a negative balance  should Company Ts customers  raise  claims for the money  but
wouldnt do that to refund Company T the £14,000 it had lost. Whilst PayPal said the
account would be put into a negative  balance should  a buyer  raise  a claim, this isnt
something it is required to do for Company T. It has an obligation, under the User
Agreement, to deal with claims when raised  by a buyer and in certain situations, refund them
despite there being no money in the sellers account. However, Company T wasnt  a buyer  in
this situation and the fraud didnt stem from its PayPal account  rather  a fraud on the buying
and selling website  it uses. And unfortunately for Company  T, the fraudulent  activity  in itself
doesnt oblige PayPal  to reimburse  it.
I appreciate this must seem wholly unsatisfactory to Company T given whats  happened and
Im very sorry it fell victim  to a fraudster. But I cant say in these  circumstances that the
fraudulent activity in itself obliges PayPal  to reimburse Company T. Instead, as Ive
explained, its obligations extend in as far as to help Company  T recover  any money that may
remain in the account.
Unfortunately, by the time PayPal blocked the fraudulent  account   following a routine
review - there was only £165.60 left in it. This remaining  amount  was refunded back  to the
senders of the money (the buyers).
PayPal has told us it didnt initiate these refunds, rather  this was done  by the account holder
(so the fraudster). It has explained that although  a block on the account would prevent the
account holder  from transacting on the account,  and removing any of the money  for
Ref: DRN59826953themselves, it doesnt prevent refunds. This is so the buyers,  as innocent parties, arent
prejudiced by the block and prevented from receiving  refunds.
PayPal blocked  the account on 4 November 2018, and all the refunds were processed  the
following afternoon.  From  the contact notes  provided by PayPal and Mr Fs testimony, it
seems a conversation  had already  taken  place between PayPal and Mr F prior to these
refunds. So, by the time the refunds were processed, PayPal was on notice that Company T
had fallen victim to a fraudster and was out of pocket as a result. Given what  Ive said about
PayPal trying to help Company T recover its money,  Im not persuaded it did the right thing
in allowing the refunds  to be processed.
PayPal was aware by that point that Company  T was the one to have lost out here - not the
buyers who had received  the products theyd paid for. So, it seems  reasonable to conclude
that following  its call with Mr F, PayPal couldve taken  additional  steps to ensure  the money
left in the account was protected, and ultimately returned this to Company T.
Im therefore  minded  to direct PayPal  to refund the £165.60 to Company T.
Customer service
PayPal has explained  that it was trying  to be helpful when it informed Company T to ask its
customers to raise  item not received claims.  While Ive no doubt  PayPals intentions were
entirely honourable  in this respect,  it seems  to me it went about things the wrong  way,
causing difficulty to Company  T. PayPals approach put Company T in the awkward position
of contacting its customers to suggest they submit  a claim in respect of goods theyd paid for
and received. Considering this, I can understand why some of the customers  were
suspicious of Company Ts request to raise the item not received claims.
PayPal should  be the expert in this situation, and it shouldve reasonably foreseen  the
consequences and implications of what it was suggesting Company T do to try and claw its
money back. Given what was at stake for Company T and the amount of money it had lost, I
think it reasonable that it relied on PayPals knowledge and expertise here.
Company T has provided some emails it received back from its customers. In these emails
the customers expressed concerns that the email to them asking them to raise item not
received claims was fraudulent and as a result, they wouldnt be shopping with Company T
again. Company  T also received numerous calls questioning the emails validity and was told
by one customer he was going to report the company to Action Fraud.
I think PayPals recommendation caused  Company T reputational damage and a great deal
of inconvenience.  Not just in the time it took to send  the email  to its customers, but also in
dealing with the fallout from this. And while I appreciate PayPal  was trying to be helpful, I
think its actions had the opposite effect and this is something it shouldve easily foreseen.
PayPal should  therefore compensate Company T for this.
When deciding on the level of compensation Ive taken into account that not all of the
customers who were contacted raised  concerns,  and whilst there is no doubt the email
request damaged Company Ts reputation with a portion of customers, luckily none  of them
left a negative  review on the buying and selling website. So, the long-lasting impact wasnt
as substantial as it couldve been.
Mr F has explained  the impact the matter has had on him personally, as Company Ts sole
Ref: DRN59826954director  explaining how PayPals actions raised  his expectations around getting the money
back. And whilst I fully empathise with the stress and upset this matter has caused,  Im not
able to take this into consideration when making  my direction  to PayPal. I can only consider
the impact on Company  T, and not Mr F personally.  And as a limited  company cant suffer
distress, this cant have  an impact  on the level of compensation  Im directing PayPal to pay.
So, subject to any further representations from Company T or PayPal I was minded to 
partially uphold  the complaint.
Company T accepted the provisional decision. 
PayPal accepted my provisional decision to pay Company T £400  compensation. It 
explained that the intentions of the PayPal representatives involved were  entirely  
honourable. It said that whilst it accepts that inconvenience was caused, it didnt feel that its 
actions caused  reputational damage. So, it agreed  to pay the £400 as a gesture of good  will 
for the inconvenience  caused. 
PayPal did disagree  with some of the statements made by Company T, namely that it told 
him the money  would  be recoverable and refunded to them. 
PayPal didnt agree that it should refund the £165.60 to Company T, along with the 
associated interest. 
It argued that on 4 and 5 November the situation was still very new.  It said the third-party 
account could  receive  funds  from any number of sources and any number of listing  from the 
buying and selling website. It pointed out that hundreds  of payments had been received and 
these arent  segregated into different categories  to show which listing  they came from. 
Therefore, without going over each individual transaction,  PayPal wouldnt have known what  
came from Company Ts listing.  
In addition, PayPal  pointed out that there was no concrete evidence  that all of Company Ts 
customers had received their items  and indeed  transactions had been being  processed 
right up to that point  - so it wouldve been  completely  unfair of PayPal to block  them from 
receiving a refund.  Plus, it wasnt sure at that point  that all the payments were  from 
Company Ts listing, and so it couldve been blocking unrelated payees from receiving 
refunds. 
PayPal says that undertaking an investigation  into the source  of the funds couldve taken a 
huge amount  of man hours and it wouldnt be fair to prevent customers from receiving a 
refund during this time. 
My findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand PayPals  reluctance at that early stage to block  refunds from the third-party 
account. I accept there is a balance to be struck here between  protecting Company Ts 
interests and those of the people who had paid money into the third-party account. 
But Im still of the opinion PayPal shouldve  ensured  refunds  couldnt  be processed  and 
investigated the account activity in full. The fact remains  that PayPal was on notice that a 
Ref: DRN59826955fraud had taken place  against Company T, not the people who had paid money  into the 
account  indeed Ive not seen anything to suggest any of these people had raised claims 
with PayPal prior to this. So, the victim  based  on the evidence at that point was Company T 
and I believe PayPal  shouldve taken the appropriate action to reflect  this. 
Im not persuaded it wouldve taken a great deal of time for PayPal to establish  that the 
transactions in the account were  from Company Ts listing. Company T couldve  provided  
evidence of this quickly if asked, as the buying and selling website had sent them a list of all 
the payments  on 5 November 2018. So, any inconvenience to payees wouldve been 
minimal had the outcome  of the investigation turned out differently.  
In conclusion, Im not minded to change  the outcome from what I said in my provisional 
decision and I still partially uphold Company Ts complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  Company  Ts complaint against PayPal Europe  
Sarl & Cie, SCA and require it to do the following:
Refund £165.60;
Pay 8% simple interest on this amount from 5 November 2018 to the date of
settlement;
Pay £400 compensation for the trouble  and reputational  damage caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Company T to 
accept or reject my decision  before  4 April 2021.
