The complaint
Mrs R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) blocked an international 
payment she tried to make from her bank account. Shes also unhappy that NatWest didnt 
explain their decision to her when she asked them to.
What happened
Mrs R called NatWest in September 2020 to check if she could send some money to a 
relative in Cuba. She says she was told she could. So the next day, Mrs R went online and 
told NatWest to send her money to a specific account in Cuba. But NatWest stopped the 
payment going through. The issue  the payment was to be in US dollars. 
Mrs R complained, feeling NatWest shouldnt have said she could send money to Cuba, 
when in fact she hadnt been able to. NatWests response said it was possible to send 
money to Cuba, but said Mrs R hadnt been able to pass their checks. They said security 
purposes meant they couldnt give the full reasons for the payment being rejected.
Unsatisfied with this response, Mrs R came to us. I wrote a provisional decision in March 
explaining why I upheld her complaint. I found NatWest should have told Mrs R when she 
called that she wouldnt be able to make the payment in US dollars. And they should have 
explained to her when rejecting the payment that this was the problem.
NatWest responded, saying they couldnt be sure if Mrs R had said when she called that she 
wanted to make the payment in US dollars. They said if she hadnt, then they couldnt have 
told her that wouldnt be allowed. 
Mrs R responded, explaining the impact the matters had on her emotionally. She felt the 
compensation I awarded should be higher, and noted she still wasnt sure if NatWest would 
let her make the payment in pound sterling. 
With these comments, Im now able to make a final decision for this case.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im still of the opinion NatWest treated Mrs R unreasonably. Ill explain why.
I dont have a copy of the call between Mrs R and NatWest in September 2020  NatWest 
have said they havent kept a copy. So I dont know exactly what was said. But I accept 
Mrs Rs comment that she was told she could make the payment. Its consistent with what 
NatWest said in their response to the complaint  that a payment could be made to Cuba. 
The issue though is that NatWest have a policy that says  in certain circumstances  
payments wont be allowed. Thats what they should have explained to Mrs R. They could 
have done this by explaining the policy to her over the phone when she called. Or  when 
she asked about sending money to Cuba  they could have asked her for more details about 
what she planned to do, and then explained how that would be affected by the policy. 
It wasnt enough to simply tell Mrs R she could send the money to Cuba, given there were 
conditions and policies that meant she might not be able to. 
Similarly, Ive not seen a reasonable explanation of the security purposes NatWest referred 
to when Mrs R raised her complaint. I find it unreasonable she wasnt told that making the 
payment in US dollars had prevented it going through. Thats a policy of NatWests, not 
something unique to Mrs R. 
Putting things right
As I explained last time, my aim is to put Mrs R in the position she should have been in, if 
NatWests service had been reasonable. 
The policy of blocking payments in US dollars is what stopped the payment going through. I 
find it reasonable for NatWest to have that sort of policy. So the actual decision to block the 
payment doesnt need to be put right.
But if the service had been reasonable, that decision wouldnt have been a surprise and then 
a mystery to Mrs R. I cant undo that impact, but Im still of the view having NatWest pay 
some compensation will at least acknowledge it. 
Picking an amount of compensation is a matter of opinion. I wrote last time about balancing 
the upset caused for Mrs R against the fact she wasnt left out-of-pocket. Ive thought about 
the extra details Mrs Rs now given to me. But I feel my earlier decision already considered 
the impact being at the scale shes described. 
So my decision is still that compensation of £150 is the right amount in this case.
Mrs Rs talked about not knowing whether she could make the payment to Cuba in pound 
sterling. She should be able to ask NatWest about that, and get a clear answer. If she 
doesnt, and a similar thing happens, my view is that would be a new complaint as it would 
be a new incident, separate to the payment in US dollars. 
My final decision
I uphold Mrs Rs complaint about National Westminster Bank Plc. They should pay her £150 
compensation to put right the trouble and upset caused. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 May 2021.
