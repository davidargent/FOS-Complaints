K820x#14complaint
Mrs B says Financial Insurance Company Limited  (FICL) mis-sold her a payment protection  
insurance (PPI)  policy.  
background
Mrs B bought the policy over the phone  in 2003 sometime after she took out a credit  card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs B disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Bs case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Bs complaint because:
 From  what we know of how FICL  sold PPI over the phone  at the time, I think  its most  
likely that FICL  made  Mrs B aware  that she had a choice about buying the PPI, and 
that she chose  to take it. 
 FICL  didnt recommend the PPI to Mrs B so it didnt have to check if it was right for her. 
 Its possible the information FICL gave Mrs B about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. Although  Mrs B had a medical condition that wouldnt have been 
covered, she has told us the condition was well controlled. She didnt  require regular 
check-ups, which suggests she wasnt considered to be at much risk of complications. 
And although she had some  concerns  due to her family history, I dont  think that better  
information about the limitations of the PPI cover wouldve stopped  her buying it. 
 Mrs B was also self-employed at the time of sale.  But I dont think this wouldve made  it 
harder for her to claim. 
Ive taken into account Mrs Bs comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 September  2019.
