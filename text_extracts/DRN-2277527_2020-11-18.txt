The complaint
Mrs B complains that TransferWise Ltd (TransferWise) incorrectly sent her currency 
payment back to the account from where it was sent. 
What happened
Mrs B made arrangements with TransferWise to send Euros from her Spanish bank account 
to her GBP bank account. Mrs B realised that TransferWise had in fact sent the payment 
back to her Spanish Euro account after converting the funds into sterling which created an 
exchange rate loss.
Mrs B says in view of the error made by TransferWise they should refund her the amount 
she has lost. 
TransferWise says Mrs B set up the account details of her GBP bank account incorrectly and 
instead of inputting her GBP bank account details she used her Spanish bank IBAN 
(International Bank Account Number) in error. TransferWise says while they are sympathetic 
to Mrs B, they were not at fault at any point of the transfer process, although as a gesture of 
goodwill have given her GBP49.50 worth of fee credits. 
Mrs B wasnt happy with TransferWises response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the information available but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator says from the information seen Mrs B incorrectly set up the bank account details 
herself and TransferWise cant be held responsible for that. 
Mrs B wasnt happy with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision.
What Ive considered here, when looking at this complaint, is whether TransferWise were 
responsible for the error with the transfer from Mrs Bs Euro bank account to her GBP bank 
account.
I can understand it would be upsetting for Mrs B to see the transfer she thought she had 
made to her GBP account returned to her Spanish Euro bank account showing an exchange 
rate loss. What happened here was Mrs B used TransferWise service to arrange a transfer 
from her Spanish Euro bank account to her GBP bank account. 
Mrs B believes that TransferWise are at fault here because the GBP bank account she was 
sending the payment to was designated as that, and it should be clear thats where she 
wanted the payment sent.
I have considered this point made by Mrs B and have looked at various screen shots and 
documents provided by TransferWise to establish what happened here. I can see that Mrs B, 
although she may not recall this, set up her GBP bank details a short time before initiating 
the payment request. 
Unfortunately, from what I have seen, Mrs B input her Spanish Euro bank account IBAN 
rather than her GBP bank account details, this is something only she could have done, and 
evidence has been provided by TransferWise to show this was the case. Following from this, 
Mrs B saved these payee details and then shorty after used these same details to send the 
payment. As Mrs B had requested the payment to be sent in GBP this meant it was 
converted from Euros to GBP and as the recipient bank account was held in Euros it was 
converted back to that currency, which resulted in the exchange rate loss incurred by Mrs B.  
While Mrs B believes that TransferWise should have known she wouldnt want to send the 
payment to and from the same account, I am satisfied that they can only carry out the 
instructions they were given here. Under the terms of the agreement with TransferWise it 
says: 
You must ensure the information you provide to us is correct. You must make sure that the 
information you provide when setting up a payment order is accurate. If we have processed 
your order in accordance with the information you have provided to us it will be considered 
correctly completed even if you have made a mistake"
While it seems Mrs B made a genuine error here when inputting the incorrect account 
details, I cant see that I can hold TransferWise responsible for this mistake. TransferWise 
have given Mrs B, as a gesture of goodwill, GBP49.50 worth of fees credits although they 
had no obligation to do so and I feel this is fair and reasonable given they have made no 
errors here. 
While Mrs B will be disappointed with my decision, it follows, I wont be asking anymore of 
TransferWise. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 December 2020.
