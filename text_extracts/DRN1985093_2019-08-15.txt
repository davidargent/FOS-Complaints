K820x#14complaint
Mr S says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr S had three loans  with QuickQuid. Ive set out some of the information  QuickQuid 
provided about the loans  in the table below.
Loan  no. Amount Start date End date
1 £100 01/04/2017 30/06/2017
2 £100 30/06/2017 28/07/2017
3 £250 25/08/2017 22/12/2017
An adjudicator considered  Mr Ss complaint but didnt recommend it be upheld. He didnt 
think QuickQuid had lent irresponsibly. Mr S disagreed with the adjudicator, so the complaint 
was passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
For each of Mr Ss loans, QuickQuid obtained  information about his income  and expenditure. 
For loans 1 and 2 Mr S said his net monthly  income  was £947 and for loan 3 he said it was 
£1,800. For each loan Mr S declared  monthly expenditure of £325-£375   this included  
monthly credit commitments  of £50. On this basis, QuickQuid says each loan was affordable 
and that its checks  were proportionate.
Having thought about everything, I consider  QuickQuids checks  were proportionate in the 
circumstances of each  loan  and that the loans  look affordable based on those  checks. 
I therefore cant fairly uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Ive thought about the points Mr S raised  in response to the adjudicator. He says he had 
seven loans when  he borrowed from QuickQuid, so it shouldve  known new loans would be 
unaffordable.
Ive seen no evidence  Mr S had seven active loans  each time he borrowed from QuickQuid. 
Mr S has provided a short extract from his credit  file showing a total of seven  loans or credit 
cards. But the extract  doesnt  show the start date of the loans and cards.  Neither does it 
show the balance  of the cards at the time he borrowed from QuickQuid. So I cant  say 
whether or how this information should  affect  the outcome of his complaint.
Ref: DRN19850932Additionally, of the seven entries  five are regular (non-payday)  types  of credit,  like credit  
cards and personal loans.  So I think Mr S ought  reasonably to have been  aware  he was 
expected to include the relevant payments towards  these  on his applications to QuickQuid  
and cant hold QuickQuid  responsible if he didnt  do so.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I do not uphold this complaint against CashEuroNet  UK LLC.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 September  2019.
