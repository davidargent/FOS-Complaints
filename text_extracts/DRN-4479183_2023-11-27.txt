The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA withheld his money and closed his 
account.
What happened
Mr B contacted us on 19 September 2023 following payments made into his account for him 
to use for an accommodation deposit. He says PayPal said he was using the account whilst 
acting as an escort which he says was incorrect. Mr B says the money was sent by family 
and friends and was not a business transaction. He says PayPal unfairly closed his account.
PayPal says it released the money but says Mr B breached its user agreement. It says it has 
a letter from Mr B regarding a different complaint. That letter, it says, provides evidence the 
account was being used for a prohibited activity and so was entitled to close the account. It 
also says its entitled to review a transaction.
Mr B brought his complaint to us and confirmed his money had been released on or before 2 
October 2023. Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The investigator thought it up to 
PayPal to decide with whom it wished to have a business relationship and hadnt made a 
mistake or acted unfairly.
Mr B doesnt accept that view and says there have been crimes committed by PayPal. He 
says he has other evidence that he can provide about the way in which PayPal has acted.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I dont uphold this complaint.
I have looked carefully at PayPals user agreement which I am satisfied Mr B would have 
agreed to when the account was first opened. That agreement says that the account cant be 
used for certain activities. I appreciate that Mr B says that the blocked transaction here was 
from friends and family for a deposit. But I dont think that is relevant for the reasons I will 
explain.
Im satisfied that in line with the user agreement, PayPal is entitled to review any transaction 
and satisfy itself what it was about. And that PayPal in any event was entitled to consider the 
evidence provided by Mr B himself regarding a separate complaint in which he asked PayPal 
for a refund for a transaction. I have looked at that complaint letter and its clear Mr B 
accepts using his account, for both a payment and receiving a payment for what is described 
as a prohibited activity. I can see Mr B told PayPal he sent a deposit for a service via 
PayPal. So, Im satisfied that PayPal was entitled to close Mr Bs account in these 
circumstances and didnt act unfairly by doing so. I also think that PayPal having reviewed 
that complaint letter was entitled to reasonably review any further transaction which is what 
happened here regardless of the transaction type or origin.
I have made clear that PayPal was entitled in these circumstances to review a transaction 
for the payment into Mr Bs account. I appreciate Mr B was caused inconvenience and was 
worried about how long any review would take, But I dont think PayPal made a mistake or 
acted unfairly by carrying out the review which I can see took some days and was carried 
out relatively quickly, before Mr B was able to access his money.
I appreciate Mr B says PayPal has committed a crime. I make clear to Mr B that I dont think 
it acted unfairly by reviewing the transaction or by closing the account. It would be for a court 
to decide in any event not us if a crime has been committed. I also appreciate Mr B says he 
has other evidence he would like us to consider but Im satisfied he has had ample 
opportunity to provide it to us for consideration.
Overall, I appreciate Mr B was unable to access his money, but I cant fairly conclude that 
PayPal acted unfairly and find it acted in line with an agreed user agreement. I also think its 
up to PayPal when exercising its commercial judgement to decide with whom it wishes to 
have a business relationship.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 December 2023.
