The complaint
Mr H is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have added an incorrect address to 
his PayPal credit account which has now been reflected on his credit file and has impacted 
his ability to get credit.
What happened
Mr H had a PayPal account as well as a PayPal credit account. After closing his PayPal 
accounts, he noticed that PayPal were reporting an incorrect address on his credit file, which 
was adversely impacting his ability to get credit. Mr H wasnt happy about this, so he raised 
a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr Hs complaint. But they noted that while he held a PayPal account, Mr 
H had changed the address to the address that Mr H was now disputing. As such, PayPal 
didnt feel that theyd acted unfairly towards Mr H by considering that address to be 
associated with him, and so they didnt uphold his complaint.
Mr H wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also didnt feel that PayPal had 
acted unfairly towards Mr H by associating the disputed address with him, and so they also 
didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr H remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I feel that its important to confirm immediately here that this service isnt a regulatory body 
or a Court of Law, but rather is an informal dispute resolution service. 
As such, it isnt within the remit of this service to determine whether Mr H has or hasnt 
resided at the address under dispute here. Instead, the remit of this service is focussed on 
whether its reasonable and fair for PayPal to have acted as they have, given the information 
and evidence available.
In this instance, PayPal maintain that Mr H himself changed the address on his PayPal 
account and his PayPal credit account to the disputed address in June 2021, and that while     
Mr H changed the address on his PayPal account back to the previously listed address a few 
days later, the disputed address remained listed as Mr Hs address on his PayPal credit 
account until September 2021, when Mr H then changed the address on that account back 
to the previously listed address.
Conversely, Mr H maintains that the disputed address is his daughters address, and that he 
only ever changed the delivery address on his PayPal account to have items delivered to his 
daughter that hed purchased for her. Mr H also maintains that he never changed the 
address to show that it was his address on either his PayPal or PayPal credit accounts, and 
that any changes to that effect can only have been actioned by PayPal themselves.
In circumstances such as this, where the testimonies of both parties at odds with each other, 
I have to decide (if its possible to do so) which version of events I feel is most likely, to have 
occurred, on balance, and given all the information and evidence available to me.
In this instance, I find the screenshots of their internal systems that have been provided by 
PayPal to be persuasive. This is because these screenshots show that the address changes 
were implemented by an external source which includes Mr Hs email address as an 
identifier. And Im satisfied that if it had been PayPal themselves that had actioned these 
address changes, the source identifier would clearly show that.
Im aware that Mr H feels that because several of the changes include an internet address of 
0.0.0.0, rather than a valid address, that this must mean that the changes were actioned by 
PayPal internally. But there can be several reasons why the internet address wasnt 
accurately recorded, and I feel that Mr Hs email address being the recognised identifier for 
the change of address action source means that it is reasonable here for PayPal to consider 
that Mr H did authorise and action those changes himself.
Like all credit providers, PayPal are required to make accurate reports to the credit reference 
agencies of a customers management and maintenance of a credit account, including any 
changes of address. And so, given the above, I dont feel that I can reasonably conclude that 
PayPal have acted unfairly towards Mr H here in the manner that he contends.
However, I must confirm again that this doesnt meant that Im saying that Mr H ever resided 
at the disputed address, but only that I dont feel that its unreasonable for PayPal to have 
associated that address with him, given the changes of address that have taken place on the 
PayPal accounts.
As such, Mr H may be able to effectively disassociate himself from the disputed address by 
other means, which would fall outside the remit of this service. However, for the purposes of 
this complaint, I dont feel that PayPal have acted unfairly towards Mr H by associating him 
with the disputed address for the reasons explained above. And it follows from this that I 
wont be upholding this complaint or instructing PayPal to take any further action at this time.
I realise this wont be the outcome that Mr H was wanting, but I hope that hell understand, 
given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2022.
