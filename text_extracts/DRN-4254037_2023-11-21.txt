The complaint
Ms B complains NewDay Ltd (NewDay) defaulted her credit card account without her 
knowledge.
What happened
Ms B says she took out a credit card account in early 2018, with an online retailer she had 
held a relationship with for some time, as a back-up facility for emergencies. Ms B says in 
January 2023 she discovered the back-up credit card had been defaulted with a relatively 
small outstanding balance - something she knew nothing about. Ms B says she complained 
to NewDay, who apologised to her but refused to remove the default from her credit file. 
Ms B says she never received any correspondence either by email or post from NewDay 
and cant understand why the subscription payment for the online retailer changed to be paid 
from her new back up credit card without her authority or knowledge, given it had previously 
been paid via her bank account.  
Ms B wants NewDay to remove the default from her credit file as it has prevented her from 
obtaining favourable credit terms and caused her considerable stress and upset. 
NewDay says when Ms B signed up for the credit card for the online retailer, she was 
informed that all transactions via that retailer would be debited from her new credit card as 
this was now the default payment method for that retailer. NewDay says it wrote various 
letters to Ms B explaining the credit card account was in arrears and the consequences of 
that, and additionally it sent a default notice in writing to Ms B also informing her the debt 
was being sold to a debt collection agent. 
While NewDay accepts it didnt explain the complaints process clearly to Ms B when she 
contacted them about the matter, it has offered her £55 by way of apology. That said 
NewDay didnt feel it made any errors by defaulting Ms Bs credit card account. 
Ms B wasnt happy with NewDays response and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator says he can only consider NewDays involvement here as a financial service 
provider and not the online retailer. The investigator says as part of the credit card account 
opening process, Ms B would have been informed the new card provided would now 
become the new default payment method for the online retailer. 
The investigator says he also had evidence that NewDay had written several letters to Ms B 
regarding the arrears on the credit card account and it had acted fairly when it defaulted her 
account in July 2019, when no response was received. The investigator pointed out NewDay 
has a responsibility to accurately report its customers account activity to the relevant credit 
reference agencies. The investigator says no errors have been made by NewDay so he 
couldnt ask it to remove the default here. 
Ms B didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding this complaint and I will explain how I have come to my 
decision.
I can understand it would have been upsetting for Ms B to discover her online retailer credit 
card account had been defaulted even though she had never intended to make use of the 
account.
When looking at this complaint I will consider if NewDay acted fairly when it defaulted Ms Bs 
credit card account and registered this with the relevant credit reference agencies. 
Both Ms B and NewDay are aware of the background to this case so I dont intend to repeat 
everything thats been said before - other than to say Ms Bs complaint centres around the 
fact NewDay defaulted her credit card account even though she had no knowledge that it 
would be used for the online retailers subscription and was never informed of any missed 
payments by NewDay.
While I have some sympathy with Ms B here as its clear it wasnt her intention not to make 
the payments to her credit card account, my role here is to determine whether or not 
NewDay have made any errors when it defaulted Ms Bs credit card account and here I cant 
say it has. I say this because I have been provided with evidence from NewDay that shows 
when Ms B opened her online retailer credit card account, a welcome pack was sent to her 
home address, which stated that this new credit card would become the new default 
payment method for that retailer. So here its fair to say even if Ms B previously paid any 
subscriptions or purchases by a different payment method, this wouldnt be the case going 
forward.
Additionally, I have been provided with further evidence by way of copies of letters written to 
Ms B and importantly screen shots of back-office records from NewDay, that again confirm 
multiple letters were sent to Ms Bs home address, starting in January 2019 through to 
March 2019 which explained the missed payments, arrears and defaulting of the account. 
While Ms B says she never received any of these letters or welcome pack, I cant hold 
NewDay responsible as to why none of these written communications were received by Ms 
B and Im satisfied in all probability these were sent to Ms B. 
While Ms B has told this service she never registered for an online account with NewDay, 
which is why she never received email correspondence, it still remains her responsibility to 
manage and monitor her credit card account  in any event the arrears and notice of default  
letters and communications were sent by NewDay here in writing, as previously explained.
Ms B says NewDay agreed with her complaint but have refused to remove the default, but 
thats not the case here as NewDay have only accepted it didnt handle the telephone call 
when the complaint was made as it should have, and it offered Ms B £55 by way of apology 
for that - not any wrong-doing concerning the default. 
Like the investigator, I can only consider NewDays actions here and not if the online retailer 
has justifiably claimed the payments it did  that would be something for Ms B to take up 
directly with them given the time that has passed. While I have some sympathy with Ms B here, I am satisfied NewDay acted reasonably, for 
the reasons I have already explained, and while Ms B feels strongly about the account 
opening process and communication of that, its not my role to tell NewDay what procedures 
and processes it must adopt in those circumstances. 
While Ms B will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of NewDay. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 December 2023.
