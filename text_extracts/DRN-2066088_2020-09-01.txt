The complaint
Mr M says Evergreen Finance London Ltd  trading as MoneyBoat (MoneyBoat) - 
irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
This complaint is about two loans MoneyBoat provided to Mr M between May and June 
2019.  The loan amounts were for £500 and £1,500 and Mr M needed to repay these loans 
over several months with repayment of £186 for loan 1 and £429 for loan 2. At the time of 
writing this decision, loan 2 is outstanding. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ms complaint and thought loan 2 shouldnt have been 
given. They said this because the information MoneyBoat had gathered about Mr M showed 
he was having problems managing his money as he had other short-term loans.  
MoneyBoat disagreed. It said its checks were proportionate given the early stages of the 
lending relationship. It also said it would be unrealistic to review every line of a credit file 
prior to lending. It asked for the complaint to be decided by an ombudsman, so it has been 
passed to me.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure     Mr 
M could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MoneyBoat was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint. Having done this, Im partially upholding Mr 
Ms complaint. Ill explain why.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint about loan 1. Mr M didnt respond to the 
opinion. As there appears to be no dispute about this loan, I wont be making any further 
findings on it. 
MoneyBoat has said the before it agreed to lend loan 2 to Mr M, it carried out an income and 
expenditure check, an affordability check as well as a credit reference check. It has given us 
a copy of those checks. I think the information contained in the credit report would suggest 
Mr M was having problems managing his money. As explained by the adjudicator, Mr M had 
other short-term loans which would have been increasing his monthly outgoings. There was 
also evidence of delinquent accounts, including his mortgage. All of which suggests that    
Mr M was struggling financially. 
MoneyBoat has told us it would be unrealistic to review every line of a credit file prior to 
lending. And particularly at the early stages of a borrowing relationship. But I disagree. 
MoneyBoat was already in receipt of that information about Mr Ms financial circumstances. 
And I think it should have used that information it was already in receipt of when considering 
whether it should lend to Mr M. The evidence given in that report suggested that Mr M was 
having problems managing his money and bearing in mind the number of other accounts he 
had, the lending looked unsustainable. 
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loan 2 and MoneyBoat should put things right. 
Putting things right
If MoneyBoat has sold the outstanding debt MoneyBoat should buy it back, if MoneyBoat is 
able to do so and then take the following steps. If MoneyBoat cant buy the debt back, then 
MoneyBoat should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) MoneyBoat should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on loan 2, and 
treat any repayments made by Mr M as though they had been repayments of the principal on 
the loan. If this results in Mr M having made overpayments then MoneyBoat should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled.
B) If there is still an outstanding balance then MoneyBoat should try to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Mr M. MoneyBoat shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of 
principal MoneyBoat has already written-off.
C) MoneyBoat should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ms credit file in 
relation to loan 2. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat must 
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
My final decision
I am upholding Mr Ms complaint. Evergreen Finance London Ltd should put things right as 
set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 September 2020.
