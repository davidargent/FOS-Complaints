K821x#15complaint
Through a claims management  company (CMC), Mr C has complained about fees and 
charges added to his mortgage account by Rooftop  Mortgages Limited.  They claim the fees 
and charges breach the Unfair Terms in Consumer  Contracts Regulations 1999 (UTCCR).
background
Mr C has a mortgage with Rooftop  taken out in August  2006.  By December 2006 Mr C 
began to miss payments,  as a result  of which arrears fees and the cost of possession 
proceedings were  added to the account. Rooftop  also added fees when direct debits were 
returned unpaid.
In 2018 Mr C instructed  solicitors to reclaim the fees and interest  added  to the account. 
Rooftops solicitors said that it didnt agree  the fees were unfair  or in breach of UTCCR. They 
also said that fees and charges had been  correctly applied, in accordance  with the account 
terms and conditions and Rooftops tariff of charges.
In October  2018 Mr C instructed the CMC to contact us to complain  that Rooftop had 
refused to refund fees and interest of over £9,000.
An adjudicator looked at the complaint. He noted that Rooftop hadnt consented to us 
looking at any fees and charges applied more than six years  before the complaint  had first 
been raised with Rooftop on 26 June 2018. This was explained to the CMC, who didnt  
contest this point.
After looking at the account history, the adjudicator recommended Rooftop  should refund 
fees and charges back to the mortgage  account of £1,500 for arrears fees and £55 for 
unpaid direct debit  fees.
Rooftop disagreed  it should refund this many fees,  but it offered to refund 14 arrears  fees.  
Thirteen of these  were included in the adjudicators list of charges he thought  should be 
refunded, plus one additional one. Rooftop also said it would refund three more direct debit 
fees totalling £80.
Because Rooftop didnt agree with the amount of the refund the adjudicator  thought it should 
make, the case has come  to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have considered all that Rooftop has said and provided. In particular, I note that it says its 
terms and conditions allow it to charge  arrears  fees.  This service takes into account the 
terms and conditions for customers account, but we also consider whether we think a 
customer has been treated fairly.
Rooftop has agreed to refund some fees,  but there  are some  which  it disputes should  be 
refunded, due, it says,  to the amount of work it still had to do on the account.
Ref: DRN57253012Theres no dispute Mr C was in arrears when the arrears fees were charged. The question is 
whether its fair to charge  an arrears fee to a consumer in financial difficulties when hes paid 
the monthly mortgage payment. This services view is that it isnt fair.
In the circumstances, Im satisfied that Rooftop  should refund the arrears fees and charges 
incurred during the months when Mr C made his repayment, notwithstanding  any work 
Rooftop had to do to manage  the arrears  on the account.
Im also satisfied that unpaid direct  debit fees should  be refunded for the six fees identified  
on the attached schedule.  I agree with the investigator that, where a monthly arrears  fee has 
been legitimately  charged,  it is unfair  for Mr C to also be charged  an unpaid  direct debit fee.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint.
In full and final settlement  Rooftop Mortgages  Limited must  refund to the account the arrears 
fees and unpaid direct  debit  fees set out on the attached schedule totalling  £1,685  and 
rework the mortgage  account to remove any interest  added  to those fees.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 October  2019.
