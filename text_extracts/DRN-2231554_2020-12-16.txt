The complaint
Mr A is unhappy Chetwood Financial Limited trading as LiveLend collected his regular 
payment when he thought hed repaid it in full. He then received incorrect information about 
when he could expect to receive the refund and was left without his money for two weeks.
What happened
Mr A had a loan with LiveLend, paying £150.28 at the start of each month by direct debit. At 
the beginning of May 2020, he got an online settlement quote which was valid until 1 June. 
Mr A made a payment of £899.94 on 29 May 2020 which seems to have reduced his 
balance to £0.01 but on 1 June 2020, LiveLend took payment of £150.
LiveLend have provided a copy of a live chat between Mr A and LiveLend which is dated 1 
June 2020. I can see Mr A contacted LiveLend to ask why the payment was taken. He was 
told the direct debit had already been requested a couple of days prior to him clearing the 
balance so it couldnt have been stopped. Mr A asked how long it would take for the money 
to be returned and was told hed need to wait seven working days for his payment to clear 
and then a refund would be arranged. 
Mr A said he was unhappy and on 9 June LiveLend sent him a response explaining his loan 
account was in credit and the money would be refunded into his bank within seven days.
On 15 June Mr A chased his refund as he was unhappy hed been told twice it would only 
take seven days to refund his money, but he said it was now longer than that. He also 
provided a screenshot showing the online settlement quote and explained this didnt give a 
caveat to say the direct debit could still be taken. 
On 19 June LiveLend sent a final response and apologised that Mr A had been given wrong
information about the refund timescales. Mr A responded to say he was expecting 
compensation for being without his money. He also said he was unhappy about a security 
question he was asked by telephone which he felt was ambiguous.
On 23 June LiveLend explained their timescales for refunding money was seven to ten 
working days, and the money was returned on 15 June which was within these timescales 
so LiveLend wouldnt do anything more. 
Mr A responded saying he didnt dispute the system timescales, but the online system didnt 
give clear information and two of their staff had given him wrong information. LiveLend 
looked into this again and accepted their online system couldve been clearer. They
said the money was returned within their timescales, and this was only three days longer
than he was originally told. But they offered him £20 as an apology for the online information 
not being clear. Mr A didnt agree with their response and brought the complaint to our 
service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. 
He said it was standard practice for companies collecting a direct debit to approach their 
customers bank a few days beforehand to request the funds. Whilst the balance was paid in 
full before the due date, the direct debit was already in progress so he concluded LiveLend 
hadnt made an error. 
Our investigator acknowledged LiveLend gave Mr A wrong information twice about the 
refund times, giving Mr A a false expectation. But he didnt think LiveLend made the refund 
any more difficult, or that it took longer than it really should have. So he didnt uphold the 
complaint. LiveLend offered £20 as an apology for the unclear information on the online 
system, and our investigator didnt think this should be increased.
Our investigator also considered the security questions LiveLend asked Mr A, as Mr A 
complained these were ambiguous. Our investigator said we cant tell a business how it 
should operate, and its up to LiveLend to decide what to ask their customers to help verify 
them. So he didnt uphold this aspect of Mr As complaint.
Mr A didnt agree with the outcome reached by our investigator. He explained the financial 
impact that this caused him, in particular that he was left with only £210 for the month and 
that this was a stressful situation to be in. He asked for an ombudsman to review his 
complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see Mr A made payments of £150.28 each month towards his loan. On 29 May 
LiveLend received a payment of £899.94. Although our investigator said this cleared the 
balance in full, it would seem this payment reduced the loan balance to £0.01. But I dont 
think this makes a difference because the direct debit was still taken. The loan transactions 
show on 1 June 2020 a direct debit for £150.28 was taken. 
LiveLend have explained the direct debit process had already begun when Mr A made the 
payment on 29 June 2020. They explained the direct debit request was already in process 
and couldnt be stopped. 
It is standard practice for companies collecting a direct debit to approach their customers 
bank a few days beforehand to request the funds. This is because the process can take a 
number of days. I think the timing here was unfortunate as Mr A made his payment of 
£899.94 by the time LiveLend had already started to process the direct debit. And I can 
appreciate this mustve been frustrating for Mr A.
Having looked at the live chat Mr A had with LiveLend on 1 June, I can see he was told it 
could take seven working days and LiveLend would refund it the day after that. Mr A was 
also told by LiveLend on 9 June that the timescale would be seven days. But LiveLend later 
explained refunds can take seven to ten working days to be received. So its clear Mr A was 
given incorrect advice - he should have been told it could take seven to ten working days, 
rather than seven days. 
Having looked at Mr As loan history, this shows LiveLend issued the refund on 15 June, a 
total of ten working days from the payment being received on 1 June. Whilst I understand Mr 
A was expecting a refund sooner than he did LiveLend did refund this to him within their 
timescales, and this was three days later than he was initially expecting. I know this was 
disappointing for Mr A but given this was only three days later, I dont think LiveLend need to 
award any compensation for this aspect of his complaint.Ive also taken into consideration that LiveLend needed to wait for the funds to clear from Mr 
As account to their account in order to make sure that the direct debit wasnt recalled before 
sending the money back to him. And I dont think this is unreasonable. As explained above, 
the refund was made within ten working days, so had LiveLend given the correct information 
to Mr A, they wouldve returned the money to him in time.
Mr A has said he was without his money for two weeks and that he was only left with just 
over £200 after his monthly bills for the entire month. Mr A has understandably said this 
caused unnecessary stress and that he had to be extremely cautious with his remaining 
balance that month.
I have taken this into consideration and that Mr A didnt know when his refund would be 
processed. Whilst I acknowledge Mr A wouldve liked to have received this sooner and that 
he was given false hope about receiving his refund earlier than he did, LiveLend did refund 
the money to him within ten working days. I dont think this is an unreasonable length of time 
and I therefore dont think this warrants further compensation.  
Mr A provided a screenshot showing LiveLend didnt make it clear a direct debit could still be 
claimed if this was already in process despite having repaid the balance. Like the 
investigator, I think had this information been clearer Mr A wouldve paid £150.28 less on 29 
May to avoid overpaying on his loan, and he therefore wouldnt have ended up in the 
situation that he did. 
But LiveLend have acknowledged they couldve provided clearer information, theyve given 
feedback to the relevant department and offered £20 so I dont think they need to do 
anything further here. And as Ive explained above, I think LiveLend returned Mr As money 
to him within a reasonable period of time. So overall, I dont think any further compensation 
is due. 
Mr A has also complained about the security questions LiveLend asked in order to verify him 
over the phone, and I can see in his complaint correspondence Mr A referred to one 
particular question he felt was ambiguous. I do empathise with Mr A as he wanted to resolve 
the issue with LiveLend and this probably added to his frustration when he couldnt pass 
these questions. But as our investigator explained, we cant tell a business how to operate 
and its up to LiveLend to decide what security questions they ask in order to verify their 
customers. So I cant conclude LiveLend did anything wrong by asking the security question 
that it did.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. I do not think Chetwood Financial 
Limited trading as LiveLend need to do anything further. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or reject my decision before 
13 January 2021.
