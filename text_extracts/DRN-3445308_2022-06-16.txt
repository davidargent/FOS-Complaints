The complaint
Mr C complains that Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) defaulted and closed his account.
What happened
Mr C had a current account with Lloyds. In September 2020, it went overdrawn. On 10 
November 2020, Lloyds made formal demand for the repayment of the debit balance of 
£275.98. On 18 November 2020, Lloyds froze interest on the account and placed a 30 day 
hold on it. On 18 December 2020, Lloyds wrote to Mr C with the balance £275.98. Credits 
were paid in on 23 October 2020 (£50), 18 December 2020 (£30), 15 January 2021 (£30). In 
January 2021, the balance was £215.98 and the account was defaulted and sold to a debt 
collection agency (DCA).
Mr C complained. He said he had no warning of what Lloyds intended to do. And he said 
their letters said he only needed to pay in a partial amount towards the debt to prevent the 
account closure - which he did. He now had a default on his credit file for six years, which 
was unfair. He wants his account re-opened and compensation paid.
Lloyds said Mr Cs account went overdrawn on 17 September 2020 and the balance was 
then £325.98. On 17 November 2020, Mr C contacted them by mobile messaging and they 
put a hold on the account for 30 days and asked Mr C to compete a budget. Mr C did pay in 
a total of £110, but Lloyds letter dated 10 November 2020 asked for full repayment of the 
balance to avoid further action. They said they wrote to him on 18 December 2020 to say Mr 
Cs account would close after another 30 days. The account was closed on 22 January 
2021, the debt sold to a DCA and a default marker put on Mr Cs credit file. Lloyds said Mr C 
should contact the DCA to discuss repayment of the balance.
Mr C didnt agree and brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Lloyds acted 
reasonably. She said Lloyds letter dated 18 December 2020 was clear and asked that Mr C 
repay the full balance of his account (£275.98) by 1 January 2021  or his account would be 
closed. Unfortunately, Mr C hadnt done that, or contacted Lloyds.  Lloyds were entitled to 
end their agreement with Mr C if they wished to do so.
Mr C didnt agree. He said that Lloyds letters said that only a partial payment was needed to 
stop the account being closed. He asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Lloyds terms of business say that they can close an account if they want to. Thats a 
commercial decision they can take - we cant contest that. But what I will look at here  was 
Mr C treated reasonably in the circumstances of his complaint. And the important thing here 
is how clear Lloyds were in their communications with Mr C.
I can see that on 18 November 2020, Mr Cs balance was £275.98 overdrawn. Lloyds had 
some concerns about it and wrote to him on 22 October 2020  the letter asked him if 
everything was OK and if he was in financial difficulty, to get in touch. Mr C didnt contact 
Lloyds and they sent a letter of formal demand on 10 November 2020  the balance was 
£275.98. This letter said,  this is a Formal Demand to repay the full overdraft balance shown 
above.  It also said If you can't bring your account up to date or pay the amount you are 
overdrawn by 24 November 2020, or agree a suitable way forward with us, we:
will close your account two months from receipt of this letter.
will update your credit file with a default.
It didnt say that partial repayment was acceptable. And the letter said Mr Cs account would 
close in two months time if the balance wasnt repaid, or if he didnt get in touch. 
Mr C contacted Lloyds on 17 November 2020 to say his income was affected by the Covid-
19 pandemic. Lloyds then wrote to Mr C on 18 November 2020 to say theyd stopped 
interest on Mr Cs account and placed it on a 30 day hold. It asked that Mr C get in touch 
about his situation by 18 December 2020. I cannot see that Mr C did get in touch with Lloyds 
during that time. Mr C says he called but couldnt get through. We asked him for some 
evidence of those calls but unfortunately, he couldnt provide that. But also  I didnt see that 
he used, for example, mobile messaging either.
Lloyds then wrote to Mr C on 18 December 2020  and this is the letter which Mr C says told 
him he could make a partial payment to avoid any further action, So I looked at it closely. It 
says We haven't received a payment so far to bring your account into credit or within your 
arranged overdraft limit. This means there's £275.98 owed. If we don't hear from you or 
receive a payment within the next 30 days, we'll close your bank account. If you've made a 
payment in the last few days to pay off what's owed, you can ignore this letter. If you haven't, 
or you think there's been a mistake, please get in touch.If you're able to, please make a 
payment for at least £275.98 by 1 January 2021. This will stop us closing your account  
We need to let you know that we may have to tell the CRAs about your overdraft balance. If 
they lower your credit score, it could be more difficult for you to borrow from banks, building 
societies and other credit providers
I think the letter is clear  Lloyds asked Mr C to pay the whole amount of £275.98, or the 
account would be closed after 30 days, and his credit file would be marked. There is no 
suggestion that a partial payment would be acceptable to Lloyds. I can see that Mr C paid in 
£30 on 18 December 2020 and £30 on 15 January 2021  but that wasnt enough to stop the 
closure of his account. 
Mr C said to our investigator that Lloyds altered the letter that they sent to us. We asked Mr 
C for a copy of the letter that he received  but he didnt send it to us.
Also, I cant see that Mr C did get in touch with Lloyds after the letter dated 18 December 
2020  and his account was closed and defaulted on 22 January 2021.
I accept that Mr C will disagree and will be disappointed by my decision. But Im not going to 
ask Lloyds to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or reject my decision before 14 July 2022.
