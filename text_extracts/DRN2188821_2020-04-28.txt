In our most recent review of this complaint, our adjudicator upheld Mr Ks complaint about 
loans 5 onwards  and thought these loans from shouldnt have been given. Sunny didnt 
respond, so the complaint  was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr K could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN21888212the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr K could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint.
Sunny says it carried out an affordability  check before lending Mr K any of his loans  which  
involved checking Mr Ks income and expenditure and enquiring  into his short-term loan 
commitments. And I think the information it collected was sufficient for loans 1  4. However, 
by the time Mr K was applying for loan 5 I think Sunny shouldve completed  a full review  od 
Mr K circumstances, and had it have done  this it wouldve realised that he was not managing 
his finances well. I say this because Mr K had taken out loan 4 just a few days earlier for 
£300. And had Sunny  completed a full financial review, it wouldve seen that Mr K also had 
short-term loans outstanding with other providers. As our adjudicator explained, even though 
Sunny has a record stating that Mr K didnt have  any other short-term commitments  at the 
time, the evidence Ive seen suggests otherwise. So, I think its unlikely Mr K wouldve been 
able to repay this loan and I dont think Sunny shouldve lent Mr K loan 5, or any subsequent 
loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr K, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ks case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr K was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr K had taken out eight loans within four months,  had loans 4 and 6 still 
outstanding and had only paid off his previous loan a few days  earlier. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr K was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that 
Mr Ks indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Ref: DRN21888213Mr Ks loans  ranged from £50 to £400,  but the amounts borrowed werent 
significantly reducing over time.  So Sunny ought  to have known that Mr K was not 
likely borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing  
need. 
Mr K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny.  Loan 4 was 
taken out eleven  months  after Mr Ks first, and Mr K had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr K lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 8 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ks indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr K borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 - 10 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans 5 - 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5, 6 and 7 from Mr Ks credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  8, 9 and 10 should be removed 
from Mr Ks credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr K a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ks complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr K compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 May 2020.
