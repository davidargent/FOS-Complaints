K821x#15complaint
Mr N complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly. 
He also complains about the late fees charged.
background
QuickQuid approved Mr Ns loan in November 2012.  It was for £400 and repayable over 58 
days in two instalments.  On 21 December 2012  £40 was due. On 22 January 2013  £440 
was due.
A loan extension was granted  on 17 January 2013  which led to £40 being due on 
22 January 2013  and £490 due on 22 February  2013. Mr Ns payday date was changed to 
25th of each month  so Mr N received a reminder that he needed to repay £490 on 
25 February 2013. 
Mr N extended his loan and paid £90 on 25 February 2013 and was due to repay £490 on 
25 March 2013.  
Around the end of March  2013 Mr N told QuickQuid he was in financial difficulty and not able 
to repay  the loan.  He told QuickQuid on 2 April 2013 that the coordinator  of his debt 
management plan would  be contacting it. QuickQuid acknowledged this on 3 April 2013.  
QuickQuid has informed  us that the debt was sold to a third party in January 2014 but has 
not been able to tell us whether it remains outstanding. 
Our adjudicators have  looked at this complaint  twice. Both had the opinion  that QuickQuid  
had done nothing wrong approving Mr Ns application based  on the information it had at the 
time and the fact that this was the first loan with QuickQuid. Our second  adjudicator  also 
thought that £24 of late fee charges were unfairly charged and has recommended  that £24 
be deducted from the sum owed by Mr N.
Neither Mr N nor QuickQuid have replied to the second view letter.  So it remains  unresolved 
and has been  passed to me.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what I consider  to be 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general 
approach to complaints about  short-term  lending - including  all of the relevant rules, 
guidance and good industry  practice  - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr N 
could repay  the loan in a sustainable manner.  These  checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. 
Mr N did apply for the loan for £400  in November 2012. Mr N thinks it was a loan for a lesser 
sum and that it was approved later in 2013.  But I do not agree.  
Ref: DRN02339652I don't think the checks for Mr Ns loan went far enough. I think proportionate  checks  would 
have included asking  more questions about  his finances - and specifically about  any other 
short term credit  commitments which were due to fall due over the same period as this loan.
But having  looked at Mr Ns financial circumstances in November 2012  when  he applied for 
the loan, and the information Mr N gave to QuickQuid when he applied, I don't think  the 
checks would've shown  that he couldn't afford the loan. I dont uphold Mr Ns complaint that 
this was lent to him irresponsibly.
I do accept the second  adjudicators views on the two late fees charged. I think  that the 
charges were unfair as Mr N had taken time and made efforts  to explain to QuickQuid that 
he was not in a position  to repay and gave good reasons why. So I do not think that 
QuickQuid had treated  him in a positive  and sympathetic manner when  it had been  informed  
on both occasions  Mr N was having difficulties with the payments. 
So I direct that QuickQuid put things right by 
refunding the £24 late fees plus any loan interest that was charged on those fees;
apply 8% simple interest  per year to any interest  and charges refunded from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
If the debt has been  repaid then QuickQuid  needs  to calculate the refund plus 8% simple 
interest* and pay it directly to Mr N.
If the debt remains  outstanding  QuickQuid  will have to inform  the third party  of the reduction  
in the balance owed. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest and it must  
give Mr N a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I am upholding Mr Ns complaint in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid  should do as I have set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 September  2019.
