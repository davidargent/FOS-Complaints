K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that TransferWise  Ltd has failed to recover his money  following  a transfer 
he made.
background
Mr M transfered money from his account on 30 November 2018. On 1 December he e-
mailed TransferWise and told it that he had used an incorrect account  number but the other 
details were correct such as the name  and e-mail of the intended recipient. Mr M says 
TransferWise didnt  recall the money and hasnt taken any action to recover his money. He 
says the situation meant a holiday was lost and that hes been  caused anxiety about his 
missing money.
TransferWise says Mr M made a mistake with the account details and under the account  
terms and conditions it says its not liable for that mistake.  It says its tried to retrieve the 
money but the recipient  of the money withdrew it within  an hour of the money  being  sent.  
TransferWise doesnt accept making a mistake.
Mr M brought his complaint to us but our adjudicator  didnt uphold it. The adjudicator  thought 
that TransferWise had acted in line with the account terms and conditions and that Mr M had 
an opportunity to review  the information he inputted. He also thought  TransferWise  had tried 
to retrieve Mr Ms money and thought Mr M may wish to consider contacting  the police about 
what had happened.
Mr M didnt  accept that view and says TransferWise  should have checked the account 
details against  the beneficiaries name and as it didnt then he cant be liable for that mistake.  
He says if TransferWise had sent an e-mail  to the intended recipient of his money then the 
incorrect information would have been noticed and he questions how the person who did 
receive the money knew it was in their account. Mr M says the bank  that the recipient sent 
the money to should also be able to block the account.
The adjudicator looked at the case again  and said that he couldnt comment  on 
TransferWises internal processes and policies and even if TransferWise had contacted the 
intended recipient then that wouldnt have changed his view.
Mr M has asked  that his complaint be reviewed and says there  was no way to contact 
TransferWise outside its published  opening hours  and maintains its systems should be able 
to check an account  number against an account  name.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall conclusions  as the adjudicator  for the same  reasons. I realise that Mr M will be 
disappointed by my decision and I appreciate how strongly he feels  about  whats  happened.
Im satisfied that Mr M made a mistake in inputting the correct recipients account details. In 
those circumstances  Im also satisfied that TransferWises terms and conditions make  clear 
that Mr M is responsible for that mistake  and that it is not responsible for any loss that 
results. I think that TransferWise also allows its customers  to review the information and in 
this case the account  details  before any transaction is completed. So I cant fairly hold 
TransferWise responsible for the mistake.
Ref: DRN98932532I appreciate that Mr M says that TransferWises systems should  have detected  that an 
account name didnt  match the account  number. But I dont think its the role of this service 
to tell a business how it runs that business or how it exercises its commercial judgement. For 
the reasons Ive explained Im satisfied  the mistake was caused by Mr M inputting  incorrect  
details.
I can see that Mr M contacted TransferWise some days after the transaction but the recipient 
of the money  had withdrawn it within an hour of the mistake. So I dont think  it matters that 
Mr M says he had no way of contacting TransferWise outside  of its published hours. As I 
think the money had been withdrawn before Mr M had even realised there had been a 
mistake.
Its not clear how the recipient of the money knew it had been deposited in their account.  I 
accept it may have been the case that TransferWises  systems automatically send an e-mail 
in those circumstances. Again  I cant fairly  interfere in how TransferWise operates its 
business but Im satisfied  its done everything it can to retrieve Mr Ms money. I can see that 
its repeatedly called and e-mailed the person that wrongly received the money. I appreciate 
that Mr M says TransferWise should ask the bank where the money  ended  up to block that 
account. I think it would be up to that bank  to consider that but I hope that TransferWise will 
speak to that bank.
Overall I dont think TransferWise has made  a mistake here and has acted in line with the 
account terms and conditions. Whilst Im satisfied  Mr M made  the mistake that led to the 
money being sent to the wrong account I understand his frustration and distress. I hope  he 
understands that as we are not the regulator  of TransferWise I cant  fairly order it to change 
its systems and procedures on these matters.  No doubt Mr M will approach the police and 
make a complaint  about the person who received his money and has refused to return  it.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 May 2019.
