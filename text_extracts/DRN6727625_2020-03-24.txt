K821x#15complaint
Mr T says Elevate  Credit  International Limited  trading as Sunny  irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 46 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr T between  May 2015 and 
August 2018.  Mr Ts borrowing history  is summarised at the end of this decision. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ts complaint and thought the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because Mr T had a few loans with Sunny as well as other short-
term lenders and the pattern of his borrowing seemed to indicate he was reliant on these 
types of loans. Sunny disagreed but offered to uphold Mr Ts complaint about loan 27 
onwards. Mr T declined Sunnys offer. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr T could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period during which  a 
customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may signal 
that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN67276252Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.  Having  done so, Im partially  upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 5. Mr T 
didnt respond  to the view. As there is no longer a dispute about these loans, I wont  be 
making any further findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 6 to Mr T and the results  of these checks  
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Ts sixth loan in just under four months,  I think  
Sunny should  have  been looking to build a clearer picture about  Mr Ts finances before 
lending him this loan. 
Had Sunny  done  proportionate checks, its likely to have seen that  as well as having two 
outstanding loans with itself  Mr T was also borrowing from other  short-term  lenders as well 
as having credit card commitments. The repayments  to the other  creditors were increasing  
his monthly outgoings  by around £670.  Sunny  would  have also likely seen that Mr Ts stated 
income and essential outgoings were not accurate.  His actual income  was less than he 
stated, and his actual essential  outgoings were more. 
All of this indicated that it was unlikely Mr T wouldve been able to make  the repayments  to 
this loan without  having to borrow again.  I think this was proven when Mr T borrowed his 
seventh loan two weeks later.   
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think that this point was reached by loan 9. I say 
this because: 
at this point Sunny  ought to have  realised Mr T was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr T had taken out nine loans in six months and he had been  indebted 
to Sunny for the whole of this period. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more  
likely that Mr Ts indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
Ref: DRN67276253Mr Ts first loan was for £100 and loan 9 was for £150. At this point Sunny should  
have known that it was unlikely Mr T was borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall  in 
his income but more  to meet an ongoing  need.  
From  loan 9 onwards,  Mr T was provided with new loan either shortly after paying off 
or taking  out his previous  one. 
He also wasnt really  making any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 46 
was taking out over three years after he took out his first and it was for a larger  
amount. Mr T had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny  
over an extended period.
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny provided  borrowing for loan 9 onwards because:
These loans had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The number  of loans and length  of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely to have 
had negative  implications on Mr Ts ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him 
in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr T paid on loans 6 to 46;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative  information about  loans 6 to 8 from Mr Ts credit file;
the number of loans  taken from loan 9 onwards means any information recorded about  
them is adverse.  So, all entries  about loans  9 to 46 should be removed from Mr Ts 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr T a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ts complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 April 2020.
