The complaint
Mrs A complains that Marks & Spencer Financial Services plc, trading as M&S Bank, wont 
refund to her the money that she paid to rent some equipment. 
Background
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
In certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a consumer an 
equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier. To be able to uphold 
Mrs As complaint about M&S Bank, I must be satisfied that theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the equipment and that M&S Bank's 
response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable. Im not determining the 
outcome of Mrs As claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs A used her M&S Bank credit card in November 2018 to pay £168 to the supplier 
to rent a "cherry picker" but she says that when it was delivered it wasn't suitable and 
damage was caused to it; 
she claimed a refund from M&S Bank and it considered her claim under the 
chargeback rules and then section 75 but didn't uphold her claim;
the supplier had delivered to Mrs A the equipment that she'd ordered and I don't 
consider it to be likely that a chargeback claim would have been successful in these 
circumstances;
to be able to uphold Mrs A's section 75 complaint about M&S Bank I must be 
satisfied that there's been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
Mrs A chose to hire the equipment from the supplier and I'm not persuaded that 
there's enough evidence to show that the equipment was misrepresented to her;
she says that the equipment wasn't suitable, it was delivered late, operating 
instructions weren't given and the roofer who was using it lost control of it which 
caused damaged to it;
the supplier has claimed the cost of the damage from the roofer's insurance company 
and Mrs A says that the roofer thinks that the damage is covered by his insurance-
 but she's concerned that a claim will be made against her because she hired the 
equipment;
Mrs A says that the equipment wasn't suitable but it was being used by the roofer, he 
lost control of it and she says, in the summary that she submitted as part of her 
complaint, that the roofer signed for the damage and said that any claim should be 
met through his business liability insurance;I don't consider that it's likely that the roofer would have signed for the damage or 
said that any claim should be met through his insurance if he considered that the 
equipment had been supplied in breach of Mrs A's contract with the supplier;
Mrs A clearly feels very strongly that the equipment wasn't suitable and that proper 
operations instructions weren't given to her - but I've seen no evidence to show that 
the equipment was faulty and I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to 
show that there's been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
I consider that M&S Bank's response to Mrs A's complaint has been fair and 
reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
M&S Bank to refund to Mrs A the £168 that she paid to the supplier to rent the 
equipment -or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mrs As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 June 2020.
