K820x#14complaint
Mrs K complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has changed the terms of 
her loan agreement.
background
Mrs K says she took out a NatWest loan in 2014  for £10,000 over five years with an interest 
rate of 3.85%. She says she recently  noticed  that the loan terms had been changed to seven 
years at 18% and so asked NatWest to investigate. Mrs K says she no longer has the 
original agreement but NatWest has told her it doesnt have the original  agreement  either.
NatWest accepts it no longer has the original loan agreement but it says its internal records  
created at the time the loan was taken  out confirm that the loan was over seven years  with 
an interest rate of 18%. It says Mrs K applied for a number of loans in 2013  and 2014 which  
were declined with interest rates of between 11.9% and 12.9%. And that she also applied for 
a loan in 2014 for £10,000 at 19.9%  which was approved but not proceeded with. NatWest 
says its advertised interest  rate at the time may have been about  3.4%  but the offered rate 
would depend  on an individuals circumstances.
Mrs K brought her complaint to us but our adjudicator thought NatWest had dealt fairly with 
it. The adjudicator  thought  it regrettable  that the original  agreement wasnt  available but 
thought NatWests internal records suggested  it hadnt made  a mistake.  She also thought 
Mrs K had been given  an account summary every  year.
Mrs K doesnt accept that view and says NatWest couldve fabricated  its internal records  to 
change the length of the loan and the interest  rate. She would like the loan terms changed  to 
what she says was originally agreed.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to a similar 
overall conclusion  as the adjudicator for the same  reasons. I realise Mrs K will be 
disappointed by my decision and I also accept that its very regrettable that NatWest no 
longer has the original  agreement.
As neither party has the original agreement I have  to decide what  I think is more likely to 
have happened  based on all of the other  evidence Ive seen. Ive looked at NatWests 
internal records of the loan and Mrs Ks account  history. I can see that NatWest has 
recorded the loan period as being  seven years and the amount  as £10,000 at 18%. Ive not 
seen any evidence that NatWest backdated  those documents or fabricated them.  Ive also 
looked at Mrs Ks other loan applications and can see that two were declined  and that she 
was offered a loan for £10,000  at or around  the time this loan was taken out in 2014 at a 
very similar interest rate(19.9%) to the rate NatWest say was agreed of 18%.
So in those  circumstances  I think on balance that NatWest hasnt made a mistake  or 
changed the loan terms and conditions.  I also think it very unlikely that NatWest would have 
declined Mrs Ks previous  loan applications at interest rates of between 11.9% and 12.9% 
and then offered  her a loan at 3.85% whilst at the same time offering her a rate of 19.9% on 
another application.
Ref: DRN71285552I appreciate Mrs K says that she was offered that preferential  lower rate as a result  of her 
account benefits. But I agree with the adjudicator  that it appears that Mrs K opened that type 
of account some time after the loan was taken out. I also dont think  having that type of 
account would have led to such a substantial  reduction in the interest  rate offered.
Overall Im satisfied that NatWest hasnt made a mistake about  the loan agreement  or 
altered the terms  of it.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 May 2019.
