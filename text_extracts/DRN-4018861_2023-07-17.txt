The complaint
Mr A complains that Skyfire Insurance Company Limited mishandled his motor insurance 
policy. 
What happened
In mid-October 2020, Mr A had been involved in an incident (according to the Claims 
Underwriting Exchange database).
For the year from 22 June 2022, Mr A took out a comprehensive policy for a car. The policy 
was issued by an insurance intermediary. Mr A paid a deposit and agreed to pay the balance 
of the yearly cost (including interest) by instalments. 
Skyfire was the insurer that was ultimately responsible for setting the charge for time on 
cover, dealing with any claim and dealing with any cancellation of the policy.
By about 24 June 2022, a third party reported that Mr As car had hit their vehicle.
In late August 2022, the intermediary asked Mr A to provide documents including the V5 
registration document for the car.
Mr A sent the intermediary certain documents including a green slip from the V5. By a letter 
dated 24 August 2022, the intermediary said he needed to send the whole of the V5, 
otherwise it might amend or cancel the policy.
On 7 November 2022, the intermediary sent Mr A two emails. 
In the first email, the intermediary said that there were discrepancies in the information Mr A 
had provided. It said Mr A had told it he had purchased the vehicle in April 2021, but he had 
actually purchased it in April 2022. Also, the intermediary said that Mr A hadnt disclosed the 
incident from October 2020. It said that if Mr A wanted to continue the policy, he would have 
to pay an additional premium of about £1,000.00. Alternatively, it would cancel the policy 
with effect from 14 November 2022.
In the second email, the intermediary gave Mr A seven days notice of cancellation of the 
policy with effect from 14 November 2022. It said the balance outstanding was about 
£1,950.00.
Mr A complained to the intermediary that it was treating him unfairly.
The intermediary said that it hadnt responded to the complaint within eight weeks, so Mr A 
could bring the complaint to us.
Mr A brought his complaint to us in late January 2023. He asked that we should cancel the 
request for payment of the balance. 
Our investigator treated that as a complaint against Skyfire. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She thought that:
The cancellation was a fair outcome. 
There was an undisclosed incident which wouldve increased the premium. Skyfire 
chose to continue to cover Mr A at an increased premium. 
Because Mr A had an ongoing claim with Skyfire, it wouldnt be offering a refund, and 
an outstanding £1,947.30 needed to be paid.
Mr A disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says, in summary, that:
He did disclose the incident. 
There will be a phone call in which the green keeper slip was approved.
His policy was validated and allowed to carry on for an additional 3 months.
His policy was unfairly discontinued. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen a Statement of Fact document that includes the following question and answer:
5. Accidents - Has any driver had any accidents, claims, thefts, incidents or losses 
regardless of fault or blame in the last five years? No
So I dont accept that Mr A disclosed the October 2020 claim when he took out the policy in 
June 2022.
The statement of fact also said that the date of purchase of the car had been 01/04/2021. 
But Ive seen a DVLA vehicle check. It says that the car was made in 2017 but not registered 
with DVLA until July 2021. I find that unusual. I find it likely that DVLA issued a V5 in July 
2021. Ive also seen that DVLA issued a V5 in early April 2022.
Ive seen a policy schedule dated 22 June 2022. It says that the premium for the year was 
going to be £3,077.71 plus an arrangement fee of £50.00.
The policy terms included the following:
10.7 Cancelling your policy

If any of the following apply, you may not receive any refund and you may still have 
to pay the balance of the full yearly premium. This applies in all circumstances no 
matter what payment method you use.
 You have made a claim in the policy year or a claim has been made against your 
policy.
 You have been involved in an incident which might give rise to a claim under the 
policy
That meant that - notwithstanding that Mr A was paying by instalments - he might still have 
to pay the balance of the full years premium if there had been a claim against the policy and 
the policy was cancelled before the end of the policy year.The policy terms also included the following: 
10.7b If we cancel your policy
The insurer can authorise us at any time to cancel your policy by sending you seven 
days written notice to the last postal or e-mail address we have for you on our 
system. Examples of when we can do this include:-

 if you fail to respond to reasonable requests for information by your insurer or us or  
an agent acting on behalf of the insurer
That meant that the insurer could authorise the intermediary to cancel the policy on seven 
days notice if Mr A failed to respond (positively) to reasonable requests for information.
I accept that the email to Mr A dated 24 August 2022 started by saying the following: 
So far we have received:
Proof of Claims History
However, I dont accept that this shows that Mr A had disclosed the October 2020 claim 
when he took out the policy in June 2022.
I find it unlikely that an insurer would accept a keeper slip from the V5. I dont accept that the 
intermediary or Skyfire said that in a telephone call.
I find that Mr A failed to respond positively to the intermediarys reasonable request for the 
V5.
I accept that a few months passed before the notice of cancellation in November 2022. I 
dont consider that this shows that the intermediary had received the information it needed to 
validate the policy. In the meantime, Mr A had the benefit of cover at the cost quoted in June 
2022. So I dont consider that he suffered any disadvantage from the delay.
The notice of cancellation said that the balance would be as follows:
146 days cover £3,077.71
interest £   296.22
arrangement fee £     50.00
sub-total £3,423.93
deposit paid £   284.62
instalments paid £1,192.61
sub-total £1,476.63
balance £1,947.30
146 days is the period from the start of the policy on 22 June 2022 to the cancellation in mid-
November 2022. Its about 21 weeks or 40% of the intended policy year. Yet the charge for 
that period is 100% of the charge for the intended year - £3,077.71. 
The explanation for this is that by late June 2022, Mr A had already made a claim on the 
policy. And by August 2022, Skyfire had paid out on that claim. So - keeping in mind the 
policy term quoted above -  I dont find it fair to direct Skyfire to waive the balance of the 
premium for the remaining 60% of the policy year. From its file, Im satisfied that the intermediary confirmed the cancellation of the policy with 
effect from mid-November 2022.
In conclusion, I dont find the cancellation unfair. And I dont find the charge for time on cover 
unfair. The interest and the arrangement fee were charged by the intermediary rather than 
by Skyfire. And Im dealing with a complaint against Skyfire. So l will stop short of saying that 
Mr A should pay the intermediary the balance of £1,947.30. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Skyfire Insurance Company Limited to do any more in response to this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 August 2023.
