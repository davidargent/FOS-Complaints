K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that PDL Finance Limited  (trading  as Mr Lender)  was irresponsible to lend to 
him.
background
Mr C applied for four loans from Mr Lender  between December 2014 and January 2016:
Loan Date Amount Term Max Instalment Due Repaid
1 11 Dec 2014 £750 6m £275 29 May 2015 13 Mar 2015
2 9 Aug 2015 £700 6m £270.66 29 Jan 2016 21 Nov 2015
3 15 Jan 2016 £400 6m £207.06 29 Jul 2016 Cancelled
4 18 Jan 2016 £1,000 6m £494.26 29 Jul 2016 5 Dec 2017
Mr C says he doesnt believe proper  affordability checks  were  carried out as he was 
borrowing from multiple lenders and could not afford the repayments.
Mr Lender says each application was subject  to affordability and credit checks. It says the 
results of the credit checks  were  acceptable  and the income and expenditure data indicated  
the repayments were  affordable. It says Mr C contacted it before the first instalment was due 
on loan 4 and advised the repayment would be late. Mr Lender then set up a repayment plan 
on 3 March 2016 when Mr C said he was in financial difficulties. Mr C finally repaid loan 4 on 
5 Dec 2017 and Mr Lender says he received an interest discount of £649 on the loan.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She was satisfied Mr Lender 
did enough checks before  loans 1 and 2, but that it shouldve asked Mr C about short-term 
loans before approving loan 4. She said that, had it done so, Mr Lender wouldve found Mr C 
owed over £2,000  so wouldnt  have  approved  loan 4. She said it should  refund  interest  on 
loan 4 (plus 8% statutory  interest)  and remove  negative information from his credit file.
Mr C responded to say, in summary, that he was also borrowing from other lenders at the 
time of the first three loans and this would have  shown  on his credit file.
Mr Lender said that the highest repayment  for loan 4 was £494 and Mr Cs calculated 
disposable income was £967. It says its credit checks  didnt show any other short-term loans 
and that Mr C declared £150  of Other loan commitments when asked about expenditure.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Lender was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make  sure Mr C 
could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr C was borrowing, and his lending  history.  But 
there was no set list of checks Mr Lender  had to do.
Loans 1 and 2
When Mr C applied for the first two loans, Mr Lender  asked him for information about income 
and expenditure  and did credit checks.  The highest repayment on either loan was under 
£300, and Mr C declared his income to be £2,500, so I consider the checks  went far enough.
Ref: DRN33373712I acknowledge that Mr C says he had other  outstanding short-term loans at the time, but Ive 
seen the information Mr Lender had and Im satisfied it would have found the repayments to 
be affordable based  on his disposable income. There  was also nothing  on Mr Cs credit 
checks that showed he had other outstanding  loans  or that indicated financial difficulties.
Loan 3
As this loan was cancelled the same day, and the capital  repaid without any interest or 
charges applied, I wont consider this loan further here.
Loan 4
When Mr C applied for this loan, the largest  monthly instalment was almost £500. As this 
was Mr Cs fourth loan application  with Mr Lender, and it was quite a large proportion of his 
income, I consider  a proportionate check should have included asking him whether  he had 
any other short-term loans.
In the week before Mr C applied for loan 4, I can see from his bank  statements that he 
received £1,000 loans from two short-term loan providers. Im satisfied that, had Mr Lender 
known about these loans, it would have  found a further repayment of almost £500 to be 
unaffordable from a calculated disposable income  of £967. I say that because  Mr C was 
scheduled to repay  over £600 in total per month to these two lenders which would have left 
him with insufficient  disposable income  to make the first Mr Lender repayment.
I accept Mr Lender says its credit check didnt show any outstanding short-term loans, but 
credit files take a few weeks  to update. I also acknowledge that it says Mr C should have 
declared these loans in the expenditure breakdown, but I cant see it specifically asked about 
short-term loans. Indeed, the £150 loan expenditure that Mr C does include in his figures 
seems to relate to a regular loan repayment that Ive identified  on his bank  statements.
So, in summary,  I think Mr Lender  should  have done better checks before approving loan 4 
and, had it done so, Im satisfied it wouldnt have approved it.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. PDL Finance Limited  (trading as Mr 
Lender) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr C paid on loan 4;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from payment date to settlement date*;
Remove any negative information  about  loan 4 from Mr Cs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender  to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.
