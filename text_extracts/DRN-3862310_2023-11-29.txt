The complaint
Mr and Mrs L complain that Vacation Finance Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for some holiday club membership credits. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs L say that theyd owned holiday products provided by a holiday company since 
2004 and they then bought 20,000 holiday club membership credits from the holiday 
company in May 2018. The membership price was £45,130, they made an advance payment 
of £7,050 and they entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance for a loan 
of £38,080. They agreed to make 120 monthly payments of £494.83 to Vacation Finance.
Mr and Mrs Ls representative, on behalf of Mr and Mrs L, made claims to Vacation Finance 
in July 2021 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the 
holiday company was in liquidation and couldnt provide the service sold so was in breach of 
contract. It also said that the membership credits were mis-sold to Mr and Mrs L and, but for 
the misrepresentations made to them, they wouldnt have purchased them nor entered into 
the loan agreement. It also said that the terms of the agreement are so egregious as to be 
unfair, the payment of commission was hidden from view and the membership credits were 
marketed as an investment. It said that the membership credits were sold to Mr and Mrs L 
under extreme sales pressure, no affordability checks were carried out on their ability to 
afford the loan and their relationship with Vacation Finance was unfair. 
Vacation Finance responded to those claims in detail and set out the reasons that it didnt 
uphold any of the claims. It said that it hadnt seen or been presented with any evidence 
which would lead it to conclude that Mr and Mrs L's product was mis-sold or misrepresented 
to them at the time of purchase. It also said that it lent to them in a responsible manner and 
that they paid off the full amount of the loan three months after it was taken out. 
Mr and Mrs L werent satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. 
Their complaint form says that their claim should be considered under section 75 because 
the holiday company is in liquidation so is in breach of contract as it cant provide the goods 
or service sold to them and the holiday company misrepresented the product to them. It also 
said that Vacation Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared 
to them; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford 
the loan; the holiday company unduly pressured them into entering into the membership 
application agreement and the loan agreement and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure them; and the membership credits were misrepresented to them; all rendering the 
loan agreement unfair under section 140A. A client impact statement was also provided to 
this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ls complaint should be upheld. She said 
that the purchase was for a single item with a cash price of £45,130 which wasnt within the 
limits for a claim under section 75 so section 75 didnt apply to this purchase. She said that 
she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr and Mrs L and Vacation 
Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that 
the relationship was unfair. She said that shed seen that no commission was paid to the 
holiday company by Vacation Finance in relation to this purchase and that she hadnt seen 
anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs L.
Mr and Mrs Ls representative says that Mr and Mrs L dont agree with our investigators 
recommendation and has requested that this complaint be referred to an ombudsman for a 
decision. It has provided an addendum containing Mr and Mrs Ls additional arguments 
which says, in summary and amongst other things, that: the product was sold to Mr and 
Mrs L as an investment; the holiday company represented to Mr and Mrs L that trading-in 
their existing products for the membership credits was the only method of realising their 
investment on their earlier purchases; the re-sale scheme would be open for members five 
years following the start of a membership but the holiday companys resale programme 
opened in 2015 and is now discontinued; the holiday company breached the Timeshare 
Regulations and misrepresented the membership credits as something that could be re-sold 
easily in the future; and, were it not for the representations, Mr and Mrs L wouldnt have 
purchased the membership credits and traded-in their existing product.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Ls complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
Mr and Mrs L say that theyd owned holiday products from the holiday company since 
2004 but Ive not been provided with any of the contractual documentation for the 
purchases that theyd made and their complaint only relates to the purchase that they 
made in May 2018 and which they paid for, in part, using a loan provided by Vacation 
Finance;
Mr and Mrs Ls representative says that Mr and Mrs L traded in their existing product 
in May 2018 for 20,000 membership credits and they entered into a membership 
application agreement with the holiday company at that time for the purchase  the 
agreement shows that the membership price was £45,130 but Ive not been provided 
with the terms and conditions that are referred to in that agreement or any of the 
other contractual documentation that its likely that Mr and Mrs L would have also 
signed with the holiday company at that time;
Mr and Mrs L also entered into a loan agreement with Vacation Finance in May 2018 
- it shows that the cash price was £45,130, they made an advance payment of 
£7,050 and the loan amount was £38,080 and they agreed to make 120 monthly 
payments of £494.83 to Vacation Finance;
Mr and Mrs Ls representative made claims to Vacation Finance in July 2021 under 
sections 75 and 140A and a complaint was then made to this service  a client 
impact statement in support of Mr and Mrs Ls complaint was also provided;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that section 75 doesnt apply to a 
claim that relates to any single item to which the supplier has attached a cash price 
not exceeding £100 or more than £30,000;our investigator said that the purchase price wasnt within the limits for a claim under 
section 75 as the membership application agreement shows that the membership 
price was £45,130 which would have exceeded the £30,000 limit  but the agreement 
also shows that Mr and Mrs L were buying 20,000 membership credits so the cash 
price for each credit would be about £2.26 which would be less than the £100 limit  I 
dont consider that Mr and Mrs Ls claim relates to a single item to which the holiday 
company has attached a cash price exceeding £100 but not more than £30,000 so I 
find that theyre unable to make a claim under section 75;
although I cant make a finding in these circumstances on a breach of contract claim 
under section 75, I understand that the holiday company went into liquidation in May 
2020, but I also understand that a new management company has been appointed to 
provide the services in connection with the membership credits that Mr and Mrs L 
had bought from the holiday company in May 2018 and that the membership credits 
are available for them to use;
Mr and Mrs L say that there was an unfair relationship between them and Vacation 
Finance because it paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared 
to them; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to 
afford the loan; the holiday company unduly pressured them into entering into the 
membership application agreement and the loan agreement and used aggressive 
commercial practices to pressure them; and the membership credits were 
misrepresented to them;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Ls claim under section 140A as only 
a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Vacation 
Finances response to that claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Vacation Finance says that it paid no commission to the holiday company and Ive 
not been provided with any evidence to show that it paid a commission to the holiday 
company in connection with Mr and Mrs Ls loan;
Vacation Finance said in its final response letter to Mr and Mrs Ls representative that 
it followed its usual process and conducted an appropriate affordability assessment 
before the loan was made to Mr and Mrs L and they paid off the full amount of the 
loan three months after it was taken out which it says clearly demonstrates that they 
were fully capable of affording the loan  but it hasnt provided any other information 
about the affordability assessment that it conducted;
Mr and Mrs L say that they took money from a pension fund and used a health 
insurance payment to pay for the purchase so as to save on loan costs which 
depleted the pension fund and they provided a copy of their bank statement for the 
period from January to June 2018;
Im not persuaded that the bank statement shows that the loan wasnt affordable for 
them and neither Mr and Mrs L nor their representative has provided any other 
evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for them when it was made to them 
in May 2018;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mr and Mrs L, that the loan was mis-sold to them or that Vacation 
Finance has acted incorrectly in connection with the loan;
Mr and Mrs L say that theyd bought other holiday products from the holiday 
company so I would expect them to have been prepared for the sales tactics that 
might be used by the holiday company before they went into the sales presentation in 
May 2018 and that, if they didnt want to buy the membership credits, they would 
have made that clear to the holiday company at that time;Mr and Mrs L had the right to withdraw from the membership application agreement 
and from the loan agreement within fourteen days without giving any reason but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that they contacted either the holiday company or 
Vacation Finance to withdraw from the membership application agreement or the 
loan agreement within the withdrawal periods;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs L were 
unduly pressured into buying the membership credits in May 2018 or entering into 
the loan agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptably aggressive 
commercial practices against them;
Mr and Mrs Ls representatives July 2021 claim letter says that it was represented to 
Mr and Mrs L by the holiday company before their May 2018 purchase that: their 
current product was unsellable as part of the re-sale scheme and that they would be 
required to purchase the membership credits if it was their intention to sell their 
product at a profit; the holiday company was ceasing to trade in timeshare 
apartments; benefits of the membership credits included that there would be no fixed 
time period at which they would be required to access their holiday; the membership 
credits would be an excellent investment; the annual maintenance fees payable 
would increase greatly if they didnt convert to membership credits; and the 
membership credits were available for a greatly reduced discount price but only if 
purchased on that day;
the claim letter says that those were false and misleading representations made to 
induce Mr and Mrs L into entering into the membership application agreement but the 
letter doesnt include a detailed account of the circumstances in which the alleged 
misrepresentations were made, the conversations that took place or the information 
that was provided to Mr and Mrs L before their May 2018 purchase;
Mr and Mrs Ls complaint form says that the membership credits were 
misrepresented to them and they also provided a client impact statement in support 
of their complaint in which they say that they were told by the holiday companys 
representative that: The best way out would be to change to [membership credits] as 
we could sell 2,000 points each year for about £7 each as these are much easier to 
sell;
Mr and Mrs Ls representative has provided an addendum containing Mr and Mrs Ls 
additional arguments in response to our investigators recommendation which says 
that the membership credits were marketed and sold to Mr and Mrs L as an 
investment but none of Mr and Mrs L and their representative has provided a detailed 
account of the circumstances in which it was represented to Mr and Mrs L that the 
membership credits were an investment, the conversations that took place, the 
information that was provided to Mr and Mrs L before their May 2018 purchase or 
any documentary or other evidence to show that it was represented to them that the 
membership credits were an investment;
I understand that the membership credits can be used for accommodation and 
experiences and Im not persuaded that its likely that the membership credits would 
properly be considered to be an investment and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that they were marketed or sold to Mr and Mrs L as an 
investment; 
the addendum containing Mr and Mrs Ls additional arguments says that the re-sale 
scheme would be open for members five years following the start of a membership 
but the resale programme opened in 2015 and is now discontinued  theres no 
reference in the documents that Mr and Mrs L have provided from the time of sale to 
show that the holiday company had said that a resale scheme would be available 
after five years  and Mr and Mrs Ls purchase was made in May 2018 so, on that basis, any such re-sale scheme wouldnt have been available until May 2023  and 
Ive seen no evidence to show any steps that Mr and Mrs L have taken to try to re-
sell their membership credits;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented the membership credits to Mr and Mrs L in any other way, that they 
were mis-sold to them or that they were induced into buying them by any such 
misrepresentations;
Mr and Mrs Ls representative says that the terms of the agreement are so egregious 
as to be unfair  but it hasnt provided the terms and conditions or said which of the 
terms it considers to be unfair;
it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in the 
agreements that Mr and Mrs L entered into in May 2018 are unfair but I dont 
consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is likely to 
mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship between a 
debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated in practice 
and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr and Mrs L and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs L and 
Vacation Finance;
Mr and Mrs Ls representative has also referred to breaches by the holiday company 
of the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 
2010 and the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008  and the 
addendum containing Mr and Mrs Ls additional arguments says that the holiday 
company failed to provide the necessary information required by the regulations;
none of Mr and Mrs L and their representative has identified the information that was 
necessary for them to make an informed decision regarding the purchase but wasnt 
provided to him by the holiday company and I dont consider that theyve provided all 
of the documentation that would have been provided to Mr and Mrs L at the time of 
the purchase;
Mr and Mrs L say that theyd made other purchases from the holiday company and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have been aware of the 
information that they needed before they made a decision to buy the membership 
credits in May 2018;
having considered all of the information and evidence that Mr and Mrs L and their 
representative have provided, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that Mr and Mrs Ls relationship with Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont 
consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr and Mrs L and Vacation Finance in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs L for the issues that theyve had with their membership 
credits and the impact of these events that has been described in their complaint 
form and the client impact statement, but I consider that Vacation Finances response 
to their claim under section 140A was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Vacation Finance to refund to Mr and Mrs L any of the money that they paid under 
the loan agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to their complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs L to 
accept or reject my decision before 29 December 2023.
