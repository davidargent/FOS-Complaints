The complaint
Mr O complains that Monzo Bank Ltd (Monzo) wont refund him multiple payments made 
from his current account as the result of a scam.
What happened
In August 2020, Mr O was involved in a scam. He was persuaded to send £35,000 from his 
Monzo account to someone who purported to be a private cryptocurrency trader but who we 
now know to be a fraudster. Mr O also sent £65,000 from an account he held with a different 
bank (Bank B) which has now been refunded in full.
Mr O was told by the scammer that his capital would be safe and he would receive between 
6-9% returns on his investment each month, once the investments reached maturity. The 
scammer also told Mr O that if he brought other investors on board, he would receive 
commission. So Mr O promoted the trader amongst his friends and family and some of them 
also decided to sign up. However, by April 2021, the scammer had stopped communicating 
with Mr O and at that point, he realised hed been scammed. 
Mr O then contacted his bank for help. Monzo looked into Mr Os complaint but it didnt offer 
him a refund of the funds he had lost. It said it had contacted the scammers bank, but it 
hadnt been able to retrieve any of Mr Os funds. Monzo went on to say that it would not look 
to assume liability for Mr Os loss. 
Unhappy with Monzos response, Mr O brought his complaint to our service. An investigator 
looked into things and initially, they upheld the complaint. When Monzo disagreed with the 
investigators outcome, he reviewed the complaint again. This time, he didnt uphold it. He 
said he didnt think Mr O had suffered a financial loss as a result of the scam. 
Mr O disagreed. He said he had suffered a loss and was still paying off some of the debts he 
had accrued because of the scam. 
As an agreement could not be reached, the case was passed to me for a final decision. 
Having reviewed all of the available evidence, I wrote to Mr O to clarify some of the incoming 
and outgoing transfers from his Monzo account and from his Bank B account. Mr O 
confirmed that in total he had sent the scammer £35,000 from his Monzo account but he had 
also received some funds into the account from the scammer too. Mr O said the payments 
into the account were either commission payments or investment returns that Mr O was to 
send on to the other investors. Mr O also told me that £5,000 of the £35,000 sent from his 
Monzo account was his friends money and he was transferring it on his behalf.
I have detailed the incoming payments in the table below. Ive also included a brief description 
of what Mr O said he did with the funds after he received them:

What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the opinion reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
Ive reviewed Mr Os account statements which were provided to me by Monzo. The 
statements show me that Mr O received £56,720 into his account from the scammer 
in relation to his investments.I asked Mr O about the funds paid into the account and he told me they were either 
paid out to other investors or used to reduce his credit card debt. 
Based on Mr Os testimony, Im satisfied that he paid £27,177.50 to his fellow 
investors  as detailed in the table above. This means Mr O has had the benefit of 
the remaining funds, some of which he used to repay his credit cards. I dont agree 
with Mr Os assertion that he hasnt had the benefit of funds paid to his own credit 
card accounts. This money has been used to reduce his overall debt and means he 
no longer has to pay this amount back. 
When I asked Mr O about the payments made from his Monzo account, it came to 
light that £5,000 of the funds sent from this account didnt belong to Mr O. They were 
his friends funds and he was simply moving them on for him. Mr O cannot claim back 
funds on behalf of someone else as Mr O didnt suffer this loss, his friend did. 
So, Im satisfied that Mr Os total overall loss from this account amounts to £457.50  
the amount remaining when I deduct the amount Mr O has had returned to him from 
his original personal investment of £30,000.
As part of my review of this case, I also looked at the payments made from Mr Os 
other account with Bank B. This is because the payments Mr O made from this 
account relate to the same scam and any amounts paid in and out of this account are 
also related to the overall amount invested. Mr O told us that he also lost £65,000 
from this account as part of the same scam. When I asked Mr O about the payments 
made from Bank B, it came to light that £10,000 of the funds sent from Mr Os Bank B 
account didnt belong to Mr O. They were his friends funds and he was moving them 
on for him. But Mr O has received £65,000 back following his complaint to Bank B - 
£10,000 more than he shouldve been able to claim back. As Ive said above, Mr O 
cannot claim back funds on behalf of someone else as he didnt suffer this loss. So, 
Im satisfied that Mr O has been paid £10,000 more than he should have been. 
So, having taken everything into account, Im satisfied that Mr Os total loss from his 
Monzo account amounts to £457.50. However, Im also satisfied hes already 
received back more than this because of his complaint with Bank B. So, overall, Im 
not persuaded that Mr O has suffered a financial loss as a result of his involvement in 
the scam.
It would not be reasonable for me to recommend Monzo pay redress to a party who 
has suffered no actual financial losses. For these reasons, I wont be asking Monzo 
to do anything further.  
I am very sorry to hear about the situation Mr O has found himself in. But Im not persuaded 
he has suffered a financial loss here. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint against Monzo Bank Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2023.
