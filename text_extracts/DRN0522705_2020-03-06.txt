K821x#15complaint
Mr B has complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called  Elevate  
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr B says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mr B took out some 49 instalment loans from Sunny between April 2015  
and July 2018. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Bs borrowing with Sunny,  based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  6 onwards. Sunny  initially said it didnt agree with this and that 
it hadnt done anything wrong.  But later it made a partial offer to settle the complaint which  
was rejected by Mr B. So the complaint has come to me for an ombudsmans final decision.
Im sorry  Mr B has had to wait a while for his case to reach this stage. I appreciate its taken  
a long time.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Bs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr B could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable  manner.  These checks  ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN05227052There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr B could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr B. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of lending history with 
a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ought not to 
be upheld. Ive looked carefully  at these and taken note of Mr Bs declared  income  at around 
the time.  Ive also looked at what he said about his monthly expenditure. 
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which Sunny most likely carried  out appear to have  
been proportionate for loans 1  4. And I think for loan 5, whilst I accept Sunny ought  to have 
carried out more  comprehensive checking,  the income and expenditure details provided by 
Mr B, would have made this particular loan appear  affordable. So I dont uphold Mr Bs 
complaint in respect of loans 1  5.
However, I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of loan 6 onwards 
in this case would have looked  different and therefore required a more thorough and 
responsible approach. The overall  pattern of Sunnys lending to Mr B should have caused it 
to see, in my view,  that it shouldnt have  provided any further loans from this point onwards. 
This is because this was Mr Bs sixth short-term loan application with Sunny in less than 4 
months. And in common with his borrowing pattern thus far, he was again asking to borrow  
from Sunny  whilst still paying off previous loans. So Sunny  ought  to have realised that Mr B 
wasnt merely  borrowing  to deal with short-term  cash-flow problems; he was borrowing very 
regularly, to address  shortfalls in his income  and to meet  an ongoing need. Mr B was having 
to consistently  take out high interest,  short-term lending over a sustained  period and the 
indebtedness caused by this type of borrowing was harmful, in my view. Sunny should have 
seen this and ought to have realised Mr B was at risk of not managing to repay the loans 
sustainably or getting into financial  difficulties. 
So Im upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 6 - 49. Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr B in 
an unsustainable manner  because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
Ref: DRN05227053the length of time over which Mr B borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 6 - 49;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 49 should be completely 
removed from Mr Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr B a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Bs complaint. Elevate Credit  International Limited  
should put things right for Mr B as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 April 2020.
