K820x#14complaint
Mr L complains  that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA are holding  money  in his account  which 
he cant access.
background
Mr L has complained  that PayPal wont  let him access money from his PayPal accounts.  
Mr L has a number of accounts with PayPal  but this decision will only focus on the two 
accounts registered to his sole name.
PayPal limited access to Mr Ls accounts.  They said he needs to send  them valid 
photographic identification, such as a passport, and proof of address before theyll release 
the money. 
Mr L says he sent this proof before  but PayPal are still holding his money.
The investigator who looked at Mr Ls complaint didnt uphold Mr Ls complaint. He couldnt 
see any evidence that Mr L had previously sent PayPal  the valid identification theyd  asked 
for  so he didnt think it was unreasonable they hadnt released the money  back  to him.
Mr L remained unhappy. As an agreement couldnt be reached,  the complaint has been  
passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
investigator that the complaint shouldnt  be upheld. Ive explained further below.
On opening the accounts with PayPal, Mr L agreed  to the terms in the user agreement. The 
user agreement contains the following  terms:
6.2 Withdrawal/Redemption Limits. You agree to comply  with our requests to verify your 
identity before we redeem  E-money to you to allow us to reduce  the risk of fraud or to 
otherwise comply with our anti-money  laundering or other legal obligations...We may, at our 
reasonable discretion (for example, without limitation, to limit fraud or credit risk), impose  
limits on the amount of money you can withdraw through  our Service.
 
10.2 Activity  by PayPalWe may,  at any time and without liability, suspend,  block, limit, 
close or cancel your right to use your Payment Instrument or Account entirely or for any 
particular transaction,  which may in turn suspend, block, limit, close  or cancel access to your 
Account or the services  (such as limiting access to any of your funding  sources, and your 
ability to send money, make withdrawals  or remove financial information).  We will normally  
give you advance notice  of any suspension or cancellation
Therefore, PayPal are entitled to ask Mr L to provide confirmation of identity before releasing  
the funds. And the documents PayPal deem acceptable identification are commonly used  for 
identity checks.
I recognise Mr L says he had previously provided PayPal with the information theyd asked 
for. But like the investigator, I cant see from the contact notes PayPal  provided  this is the 
Ref: DRN63848482case. So I dont  think theyve been unreasonable by not releasing  the funds to him yet. And 
therefore, I wont be asking them to do anything differently.
my final decision
So, for the reasons Ive explained  above, my final decision  is that I dont uphold this 
complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 February  2019.
