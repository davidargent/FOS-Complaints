The complaint
Miss L complains that replacement windows and doors that she paid for using a fixed sum 
loan agreement with Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, werent of satisfactory quality. She also complains about the adverse information 
that it has recorded on her credit file and the customer service that shes received. 
What happened
Miss L entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in June 2019 
to pay for some replacement windows and doors at a property. The cost price was £5,500 
and she paid a deposit of £100 so the loan, which was interest free, was for £5,400 
repayable by 36 monthly instalments of £150.
Miss L complained to the supplier about issues with the replacement windows and doors and 
an inspection was twice arranged but didnt take place so Miss L contacted Barclays Partner 
Finance in October 2019 and said that she wasnt going to make the loan repayments until 
the issues had been fixed. Barclays Partner Finance asked her to provide more information 
about her claim but explained that shed need to keep making the loan repayments.
Barclays Partner Finance says that Miss L didnt provide it with the information that it had 
requested and she says that it didnt contact her as agreed. She contacted Barclays Partner 
Finance again and it paid her £75 in February 2020 because it had closed her complaint  
but she hadnt made all of her loan repayments and her account was in arrears so Barclays 
Partner Finance issued a default notice to Miss L in March 2020 which was then recorded on 
her credit file.
Miss L complained to Barclays Partner Finance about the default notice and the service that 
shed received. It didnt uphold her complaint but said that her claim about the windows and 
doors was being investigated and that she must maintain the contractual payments to 
prevent her account falling into arrears.
Miss L then complained to this service and says that she wants the windows and doors to be 
repaired and for the adverse information to be removed from her credit file. The supplier has 
since inspected the windows and doors and confirmed that they were installed incorrectly 
and that remediation work would take place. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Miss Ls complaint should be upheld. He didnt 
consider that Barclays Partner Finance had acted incorrectly in response to her claim about 
the windows and doors and he believed that it had applied the default on her credit file 
correctly.
Remedial work was undertaken by the supplier earlier this month but Miss L has complained 
that a guttering pipe has been damaged by the scaffolding that was used.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Miss Ls complaint about the doors and windows, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
and that Barclays Partner Finances response to her claim under section 75 wasnt 
fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Miss Ls claim under 
section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
there has been a delay in remedial works being agreed but Barclays Partner Finance 
wrote to Miss L in October and December 2019 asking her to provide it with further 
information about her claim  but she didnt provide it with that information;
the supplier has now inspected the windows and doors and has agreed that remedial 
works were required - and they took place earlier this month  I consider that to be a 
fair and reasonable response to the issues that Miss L has with the windows and 
doors and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance to take any other action in response to her claim;
Miss L has complained about the damage caused to a guttering pipe by the 
scaffolding used for the remedial works  but Ive seen no evidence to show that 
shes raised that issue with the scaffolder, the supplier or Barclays Partner Finance 
and I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays 
Partner Finance to take any action relating to that damage at this time;
its clear that Miss L hasnt made all of the loan repayments that shed agreed to 
make in the loan agreement and I consider that Barclays Partner Finance properly 
explained to her the consequences of not making those payments;
it has sent her a default notice and recorded adverse information on her credit file  
and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it has acted 
incorrectly in doing so;
Barclays Partner Finance has paid £75 compensation to Miss L because it closed her 
complaint  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it has 
acted incorrectly in its response to Miss Ls complaint or that the customer service 
that its provided to her has fallen below a reasonably acceptable standard; and
I sympathise with Miss L for the issues that shes had with the windows and doors 
and for the difficulties that shes been caused by the adverse information thats been 
recorded on her credit file, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to remove that information 
from her credit file, to pay her any further compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint. My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 March 2021.
