K821x#15complaint
Ms P says Elevate Credit  International  Limited  (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about eight short term instalment loans Sunny provided to Ms P between 
August 2015 and April 2016. Ms Ps borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date  Taken Date  Repaid Planned 
InstalmentsAmount Highest total 
repayment due in any 
one month  *
1 08/08/2015 29/01/2016 6 £400.00 £126.00
2 26/09/2015 29/02/2016 8 £50.00 £142.67

7 02/04/2016 18/04/2016 6 £300.00 £277.08
8 17/04/2016 18/04/2016 6 £250.00 £330.15
* Some of Ms Ps loans ran at the same time  so this total represents  the highest total of all loan 
repayments due in any one month at the date the loan was taken. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Ms Ps complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. Sunny initially disagreed and then subsequently made  
an offer on loans six to eight  however, it doesnt  fully comply with what  our adjudicator 
recommended that it do. So, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN83820052the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms P could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ps complaint.
Ms P didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans one to five. Because  of this, I 
dont think that there  is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I wont be making  
a decision about  this lending. But this was part of the borrowing relationship Ms P had with 
Sunny. So, I will take these loans into account  when considering  loans six to eight. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Ms P, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ps case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Ms P was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms P had taken out six loans in around seven  months and Ms P had 
been indebted to Sunny for the entire seven months. So Sunny ought  to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Ms P was having to borrow  further to cover the 
hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Ms Ps 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ms Ps first loan was for £400  and loan six was for £500 and was taken alongside 
loans 3 and 5. At this point Sunny ought  to have known that Ms P was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Ref: DRN83820053Ms P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan eight was 
taken out eight months after Ms Ps first. And although it as for a smaller amount than 
her first loan, it was the second  loan taken  in the same  month   the total of which 
was £550. It also overlapped with loans six and seven  so her indebtedness  was 
increasing. She was only one month  in to loan six  and the combined repayment  
was the highest to date at over two and a half times of her initial repayment at loan 
one. And Ms P had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Ms P lost out because Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ps indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Ms P borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Ms Ps ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans six to eight  and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms P paid on loans six and eight;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  six to eight should be removed 
from Ms Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Ms P a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Ps complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
