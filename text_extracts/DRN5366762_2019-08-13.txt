K821x#15complaint
Mr M says that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA pursued him for a debt after someone  had 
fraudulently opened a credit account  in his name.  
background
In or about July 2018 Mr M identified that a PayPal credit account had been opened in his 
name, using his parents address and an email address he didnt recognise.  He contacted 
PayPal to say that the account  wasnt his, but he continued to receive  demands  for payment. 
Later, negative credit  information  was added to Mr Ms file. 
PayPal says it reviewed the case on a number of occasions but concluded  there were no 
strong indicators  of identity theft on the account;  put another  way, PayPal thought  the 
account did in fact belong to Mr M. It was not until March 2019 (after Mr M had referred  the 
case to this service) that PayPal accepted that was not the case, stopped demanding 
payment and arranged for the debt records to be removed from Mr Ms files.  
Mr M felt, given  the time this had taken  and the difficulties hed encountered  in trying to sort 
things out, PayPal ought to do more. When,  however, our investigator sought  PayPals 
comments on the case, it said:
the Financial Ombudsman   Service had no power to look at the complaint, since  Mr M 
wasnt its customer;  and 
it couldnt  provide  any information  about the account without the permission of the 
genuine account  holder.
Our investigator explained that our rules  had changed in 2012 to allow us to look at some  
complaints brought be people who were being  pursued by lenders, whether or not they were 
in fact the borrower. PayPal didnt accept that, however, even though  the investigator 
correctly cited the rule that allows us to look at complaints like Mr Ms. An ombudsman 
therefore had to issue a decision supporting the investigators position. 
PayPal was however  still unwilling to provide this service  with any information,  saying again 
it needed the account holders consent to do so. Our investigator  therefore issued an opinion  
on the basis of the information he did have and recommending that PayPal pay Mr M £300 
to resolve things. Mr M accepted that recommendation, but PayPal said its position was 
unchanged and asked that an ombudsman  review the case.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I agree with the investigator that PayPal 
should pay Mr M £300 to resolve this matter.
I recognise of course that fraudsters are sometimes successful  in taking out loans using  
other peoples  identities,  and that its not always  possible for lenders  to know when that has 
happened or to stop it. But PayPals reaction when Mr M said he had been  a victim of 
identification fraud was, in my view, slow and unhelpful. Hes explained in some detail how 
difficult it was to get anyone to discuss  things  with him or any information  about PayPals 
investigation. PayPal  hasnt responded to his account of events, and so I accept what Mr M 
has said about his difficulties. 
Ref: DRN53667622I dont believe that PayPals approach to this service  was particularly helpful  to Mr M either.  
It wrongly challenged our power  to consider Mr Ms complaint, even after our investigator  
had explained  clearly what the position  was. And it then decided  not to explain why it 
believed for so long that Mr M had opened  the account or what  caused  it to change that 
view. It cited confidentiality concerns, even though  whoever took out the loan was pretending 
to be Mr M. PayPal  could have provided information  to this service  in confidence, as our 
rules allow. Or, if it didnt feel able, because of concerns about confidentiality, to defend its 
position, it could  have offered to resolve the matter in the way suggested by the investigator. 
Whilst financial businesses are of course entitled to seek an ombudsmans determination of 
a complaint, my view is PayPals overall handling of this case  has added unnecessarily  to 
the inconvenience Mr M has been  put to and the distress hes suffered.       
my final decision
My final decision is that, to resolve Mr Ms complaint, PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should 
pay him £300. Under the rules of the Financial  Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr 
M to accept or reject my decision  before 13 September  2019.
