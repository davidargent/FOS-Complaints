The complaint
Mr D complains about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCAs decision to restrict his account and 
withhold the funds in it. 
What happened
In July 2020, PayPal restricted Mr Ds account after he sold an item online. PayPal asked 
Mr D for information on his selling activities and also asked Mr D to verify his identity by 
providing a copy of photo identification. Mr D responded to PayPals requests, but he 
refused to provide a copy of his identification.
PayPal continued to restrict Mr Ds account and withheld the money in it  around Â£48. 
In November 2020, and after bringing the complaint to our service, PayPal reviewed things 
again. They decided to remove the limitation on Mr Ds account despite him not providing the 
required identification.
Mr D still wanted our service to investigate things  he said while PayPal had removed the 
restriction and allowed him access to his money, they didnt compensate him for the time 
spent on the issue.
Our investigator reviewed things and didnt think PayPal had acted unreasonably. She 
explained that PayPal were acting in line with the terms of their User Agreement when they 
requested the information from Mr D. Overall, she thought their actions were reasonable.
Mr D disagreed. In summary he said, PayPal should have told him what information would 
have been requested before he went ahead with the transaction. Mr D explained that if hed 
have known PayPal needed him to verify his identification, he would have chosen to receive 
the money from the item he sold another way. Mr D also wanted to know why him selling 
one item allowed PayPal to restrict his account.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal undertook a review of Mr Ds account when he received money following the sale of 
an item. They asked Mr D for details relating to the sale and asked him to confirm his 
identity. Our investigator has helpfully shared the relevant part of the User Agreement which 
allows PayPal to restrict accounts in certain circumstances. Based on what Ive seen, Im 
satisfied PayPal complied with these terms when placing the limitation on Mr Ds account.
I appreciate Mr D didnt want to provide his identity documents to PayPal  he says they 
should have made him aware of what information they required before he received the 
payment into his account. I appreciate why Mr D feels this way, but its not reasonable to 
expect PayPal, or any other financial business, to know a customers intention when it 
comes to using the account in a certain way. Mr D says he didnt read the User Agreement 
in full  and hes stipulated that he doesnt think most people do this before entering in to any 
kind of agreement. I appreciate Mr Ds sense of feeling around this, but that doesnt mean 
the terms are unfair or PayPal arent allowed to rely on them  ultimately, Mr D did agree to 
them, whether he was aware of the full content or not. PayPal have a duty to protect their 
customers money  and sometimes that means carrying out reviews and asking for relevant 
information. Thats what PayPal has done here, so I cant fairly uphold Mr Ds complaint on 
this point. 
Mr D has rightfully pointed out that if he withdrew the sale proceeds before PayPal 
undertook their review, they wouldnt have been able to hold the money. But that doesnt 
mean the restriction was unfair. Its my role to consider the circumstances of whats actually 
happened  and in this case, PayPal restricted Mr Ds account while the money was still in it, 
which meant they also held on to the funds. 
Ive seen the correspondence between PayPal and Mr D. In July 2020, PayPal explained 
that the restriction was placed as Mr Ds account could have been linked to another 
restricted account. So while I appreciate Mr Ds query around why the sale of one item led to 
the restriction, I think PayPal have made Mr D aware that the review was due to other 
reasons. PayPal arent obliged to share the full details of their actions with Mr D but Id like to 
reassure Mr D that based on everything Ive seen, Im satisfied PayPal acted reasonably 
when carrying out the review. I also consider the information PayPal asked for to be 
reasonable and therefore I cant fairly say they did anything wrong.
In November 2020, PayPal reviewed things again and decided to remove the restriction. 
Under their usual procedure, Mr Ds account could have been permanently restricted as he 
hadnt fulfilled PayPals review due to not providing a copy of his identity. However, Im 
pleased to see PayPal continued with the further review and decided to release Mr Ds 
account  and the money in it. 
I appreciate Mr D feels he is at a loss due to the time he spent trying to get his money back. 
But in order to uphold this complaint, Id need to be satisfied that PayPal did something 
wrong. Based on the evidence and arguments received, I dont think they did  so it follows 
that I wont be asking them to do anything to put things right.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 December 2021.
