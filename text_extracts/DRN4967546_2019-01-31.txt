K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that CURO TRANSATLANTIC LIMITED (trading as WageDayAdvance)  was 
irresponsible to lend to him.
background
Mr S had two loans from WageDayAdvance between May 2012 and June 2012 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Scheduled Repayment Repaid
1 21 May 2012 £100 10 days 31 May 2012 £129.50 On time
2 6 Jun 2012 £250 23 days 29 Jun 2012 £323.75 31 May 2013
Mr S paid £73.75  interest in each of June, July, August and September 2012  to extend his 
second loan four times. He then made  regular payments, via a debt management plan, 
between then and May 2013 to clear the remaining balance.
Mr S says WageDayAdvance didnt  do enough  affordability checks before approving his 
loans. He said this left him in a cycle of debt and adversely affected his credit file. He added 
that WageDayAdvance  should have realised his debt problems were getting  worse due to 
the number of times he rolled over the loans and it should  have  offered him better  advice.
WageDayAdvance says it asked Mr S for information about his income and expenditure 
before it approved his first loan and offered him significantly less than the £450 it calculated  
he could afford. It says it used this information, together  with information about  how Mr S 
had managed his first loan, to make  a decision about loan 2.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He considered  that 
WageDayAdvance did enough checks before approving both the loans and, based on the 
information it had, he was satisfied it would have  found the loans affordable.
Mr S responded to say, in summary, that he didnt  think WageDayAdvance had done 
proportionate checks because, if it had done  so, it would have seen  he was using multiple 
short-term loan providers.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
WageDayAdvance was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make 
sure Mr S could afford to repay  the loans before it lent to him. Those  checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr S was borrowing, and his lending history. But 
there was no set list of checks WageDayAdvance had to do.
When Mr S applied  for his first loan from WageDayAdvance it asked him for information  
about his income  and expenditure. Given the scheduled repayments,  in both cases,  were  a 
relatively small proportion of Mr Ss income, and his calculated  disposable  income was £600, 
Im satisfied WageDayAdvance did enough checks.
Ref: DRN49675462I acknowledge that Mr Ss second  loan was for significantly more  money  that the first, but he 
had repaid the first loan on time and it was still less than the maximum loan amount 
WageDayAdvance had calculated he could afford.
I accept Mr S says that better checks would have shown he had other short-term loans, but I 
find the checks carried out were proportionate  to the circumstances of the loans. Based  on 
the information it had, I cant  conclude WageDayAdvance was wrong to approve  either  loan.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.
