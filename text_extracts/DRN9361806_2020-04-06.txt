There are significant gaps in the lending history between loans 11 and 12 and between 
loans 15 and 16. Our adjudicator felt that these gaps  were enough to break the chain  of 
lending. Neither  party disagreed, so I have also considered these gaps  as breaks  in the 
lending history that there were three chains of lending in this case.  
Our adjudicator partly upheld Mr Rs complaint  and thought the loans from loan 7 to 11 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN93618062Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.  Sunny have agreed  that its offer to 
uphold Mr Rs complaint  about loans 17 and 18 still stands. So as these two loans are no 
longer in dispute, I havent considered these in my decision. 
Our adjudicator felt that Mr Rs complaint about loans 1  6 and 12 onwards shouldnt  be 
upheld. And Mr R hasnt responded to dispute these findings. So, as these arent in dispute, 
I havent considered  these loans either.  This means my decision is focused on loans 7 to 11.
I have, however, looked at all of Mr Rs loans with Sunny when considering his overall 
lending history with Sunny.  Having done  so Ive considered whether there  was a point at 
which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further loans.  
Ref: DRN93618063Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr R was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr R had taken out six loans within three months  and the amounts 
borrowed was not significantly reducing.  So Sunny ought to have realised  it was 
more likely than not Mr R was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Rs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr Rs first loan was for £200 and loan 7 was for £250.  At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that Mr R was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr R borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 7  11 and Sunny has agreed to uphold the 
complaint about  loans  17 and 18. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 7 -11 and 17 and 18;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
All entries about loans 7  11 and 17 and 18 should be removed from Mr Rs credit  
file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 May 2020.
