The complaint
Mr E, who is represented by a third party, complains that Moneybarn No. 1 Limited
(Moneybarn) irresponsibly granted him a conditional sale agreement (agreement) he
couldnt afford to repay.
What happened
In March 2018 Mr E acquired a used car costing £22,900 financed by an agreement from
Moneybarn.
Under the terms of the agreement, everything else being equal, Mr E undertook to make
59 monthly repayments of £699.32. The total repayable under the agreement was
£41,259.88 at an APR of 30.1%.
In July 2018 Moneybarn agreed a repayment plan with Mr E.
In September 2018 Moneybarn agreed a repayment plan with Mr E.
In October 2018 Moneybarn sent Mr E an arrears notice.
In November 2018 Moneybarn sent Mr E an arrears notice.
In November 2018 Moneybarn completed an income and expenditure form with Mr E 
and agreed a repayment plan with him.
In December 2018 Moneybarn sent Mr E a payment plan cancelation notice.
In December 2018 Moneybarn sent Mr E an arrears notice.
In January 2019 Moneybarn sent Mr E a default notice.
In February 2019 Moneybarn sent Mr E an arrears notice.
In February 2019 Moneybarn sent Mr E a termination notice.
In February 2019 Moneybarn sent Mr E a settlement figure.
In March 2019 Moneybarn sent Mr E an advice notice to say the car had now been 
inspected, costs of £310.00 were payable and the car would (shortly) be sold at 
auction.
In April 2019 Moneybarn, following the sale of the car at auction, sent Mr E a final 
balance notice.
In January 2022 Mr E complained to Moneybarn that it had acted irresponsibly in 
agreeing to lend to him in March 2018.
In March 2022 Moneybarn issued Mr E with a final response letter (FRL).
In July 2022 Moneybarn sent Mr E a statement of account. This showed that it had a 
debt recorded in its books of £24,389.60 due and owing from Mr E broken down as 
follows:
osum advanced £22,900.00
ointerest £18,359.88
osub-total £41,259.88
orepayments made (£2,797.28) [4 x £699.32]
osub-total £38,462.60
ocar recovery charge £285.00
oauction fees £117.00
odamage/repair charges £25.00
osub-total £38,889.60
odisposal proceeds (£14,500.00)
ototal £24,389.60
Under cover of its FRL dated March 2022 Moneybarn said it didnt agree that it had acted 
irresponsibly in agreeing to lend to Mr E in March 2018 and that it had performed several 
different checks before agreeing to lend which included:
a full credit search (with a credit reference agency) which provided details of Mr Es
current borrowing levels and repayment history (including any arrears and defaults)
an independent check of Mr Es recorded net monthly income of £3,928.18 to bank 
statements supplied by him (covering the period 1 January 2018 to 12 March 2018)
a calculation to establish that a monthly repayment of £699.32 was affordable 
Moneybarn said that from the above checks it was able to establish:
Mr Es existing borrowing was extremely low with one active credit commitment with 
an outstanding balance of £27
Mr E had no recent missed payments recorded against him
Mr E had a strong ability to meet [his] credit commitments
Mr E had one or more defaults, but the latest of these was more than 26 months
old
Mr E had one county court judgement registered against him, but this was more than 
24 months old
a monthly repayment of £699.32 was less than 20% of Mr Es recorded and verified 
net monthly income of £3,928.18
Moneybarn also pointed out that Mr E signed to say that the monthly repayments were 
affordable (for the entire agreement term) and that he didnt envisage anything that would 
prevent him from making all repayments required of him on time.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Es complaint and concluded it shouldnt be upheld.
In summary he said that in all the circumstances Moneybarn had carried out proportionate 
checks (before agreeing to lend) and its lending decision was fair.
Mr E didnt agree and as well as reiterating his previous submissions he said that in 
March 2018 he hadnt long been in his job (and was still on probation) and that his bank 
statements (prior to March 2018) show he was relying on his overdraft.The investigator considered Mr Es response to his view but wasnt persuaded to change his 
mind. And because the investigator wasnt persuaded to change his mind Mr Es complaint 
has been passed to me for review and decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Moneybarn and Mr Es representative will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good 
industry practice we consider when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and 
irresponsible lending. So, I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. 
Information about our approach to these complaints is set out on our website.
Moneybarn hasnt provided a copy of the credit search it undertook. But based on a copy 
credit file provided by Mr E (dated January 2022) Im satisfied that what Moneybarn says its 
credit search uncovered can be relied upon, at least in all material respects. For the 
avoidance of doubt, and I appreciate some information recorded in March 2018 (and seen by 
Moneybarn) might not now be showing in the credit report dated January 2022 (provided by 
Mr E), Mr E had the following information recorded with a credit reference agency 
(before March 2018) that could be viewed as adverse:
oAugust 2012 £unknown 6 months arrears but debt settled in December 2017
oJanuary 2015 £unknown 1 month arrears but debt settled in February 2018
oFebruary 2016 £931 Defaulted
oApril 2016 £209 Defaulted
oApril 2016 £991 CCJ but satisfied in July 2016
Given what I say above and given that Moneybarn (before it agreed to lend) had sight of 
Mr Es bank statements for the period 1 January 2018 to 12 March 2018 I, like the 
investigator, am satisfied that Moneybarn undertook proportionate checks into Mr Es 
personal and financial circumstances before agreeing to lend to him. And for the avoidance 
of doubt, I can confirm that Im satisfied that Moneybarn didnt need to request sight of bank 
statements (from Mr E) going back further than 1 January 2018.
So, what I now need to decide is did Moneybarn, armed with what it says its credit search 
uncovered and what Mr Es bank statements for the period 1 January 2018 to 
12 March 2018 show, make a fair lending decision.
I appreciate Mr Es strength of feeling on this particular point but having considered 
everything that Moneybarn had access to, before it took the decision to lend to Mr E, I can 
confirm Im simply not persuaded that it made an unfair lending decision and that it did 
nothing wrong in concluding a monthly repayment of £699.32 was affordable for Mr E.
And for the sake of completeness, I would add that although Mr E may have (for a few days) 
between 1 January 2018 and 12 March 2018 gone marginally over his arranged overdraft of 
£250.00 and had one direct debit refused, Im not persuaded that this would have been 
enough  in itself  for Moneybarn to have concluded that it shouldnt have lent. Im also 
satisfied that the fact that Mr E had only just started his job wouldnt have been, or shouldnt 
have been, grounds for Moneybarn to have concluded it shouldnt lend.
So, in summary, Im satisfied that Moneybarn undertook proportionate checks before it 
agreed to lend to Mr E and its decision to lend wasnt unfair.My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 July 2023.
