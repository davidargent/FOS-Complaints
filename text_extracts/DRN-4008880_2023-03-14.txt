The complaint
Mr B has complained that Tesco Personal Finance PLC (Tesco) has refused to refund him 
money he lost as the result of a scam.
What happened
Mr B was looking to invest money and found an advertisement online for the business 23 
Traders. 23 Traders claimed to be specialists in binary options and as this was of interest to 
Mr B, he completed a contact form. 23 Traders contacted Mr B and he was convinced to 
transfer funds from his credit card. The investments that were made appeared legitimate. Mr 
B was then convinced by 23 Traders that investing more would maximise his potential profit.
Mr B sent a total of £43,000 to 23 Traders from his Tesco credit card as set out below;

The 23 Traders website was shut down in July 2017 and it stopped replying to Mr Bs emails. 
Our Investigator considered Mr Bs complaint and thought it should be upheld. She thought 
the third payment to 23 Traders of £3,000 made on 2 January 2017 (the third large payment 
that day) should have been significant enough to trigger Tescos fraud prevention measures, 
and it should have stepped in at this stage to ask questions about the payments.
I issued a provisional decision in which I said the following
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to provisionally decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The circumstances of this complaint are not in dispute and the evidence provided by both Mr 
B and Tesco set out what happened. What is in dispute is whether Tesco should refund any 
of the money Mr B lost because of the scam. 
Mr B has accepted he authorised the payments he made to 23 Traders, so the starting point 
here is that Mr B is responsible. However, banks and other Payment Services Providers 
(PSPs) do have a duty to protect against the risk of financial loss due to fraud and/or to 
undertake due diligence on large transactions to guard against money laundering.
In relation to the first two payments, although it seems that Mr B had not really used his 
credit card in the previous months prior to these transactions, I think that these payments 
were not so unusual for Tesco to intervene.
That said the third transaction I believe should have been considered unusual. Mr B had 
been running a balance on his card for a few months with him only paying off a small amount 
each month. Making two large transactions to a new payee, then crediting his account with 
£9,000 before making a third large transaction to a new payee should really have prompted 
Tesco to intervene. 
I can see that Tesco did contact Mr B on 2 January 2017, but it is not clear at what time 
exactly. Based on the notes that Tesco provided it seems that all it did was confirm the 
transactions were genuine. I dont think that this went far enough.
At this stage Tesco should have stepped in and asked Mr B in depth questions to find out 
what the payments related to. Had Tesco stepped in at this point, I think its likely Mr B would 
have explained the reason he was suddenly making a number of large payments from his 
card. 
Tesco would have likely warned him about the high risk of binary option investments and the 
types of scams they have seen, for example where the investment provider encourages an 
investor to keep investing large sums as a matter of urgency - which appears to have been 
similar to what Mr B was experiencing at the time. 
I note 23 Traders were operating without being licensed by the UKs Gambling Commission 
(as required at the material time) and they appeared to be pressuring Mr B to pay larger 
sums quickly. With the information Tesco ought to have known about binary options scams 
at the time, I think these would have been key red flags and they would have likely explained 
their concerns that this was likely a scam.In addition to the expectations on Tesco to have effective fraud prevention systems in place, 
its expected that customers should take responsibility for their decisions. In the 
circumstances I dont think it would be fair to say Mr B contributed to the loss. I say this 
because Mr B had no previous experience in this type of investment and was lulled into a 
false sense of security by a business that went to great lengths to appear to be legitimate. I 
cant see that there were any warnings in place when Mr B started using the account.
So, I dont think it would be fair to reduce compensation on the basis that Mr B should share 
blame for what happened.
Section 75
While I dont consider the first two payments to 23 Traders ought to have triggered an 
intervention by Tesco Bank. As these payments were made on a credit card Ive then 
considered whether Mr B has any rights under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 
to claim back the money for the first two payments. 
Mr B used his credit card to directly pay 23 Traders directly. And he did so because he 
expected it to use his funds to legitimately trade in options. However, the evidence strongly 
suggests 23 Traders, was not in fact a legitimate investment broker. It misled Mr B into 
believing he was depositing money for genuine investments and also that he would be able 
to withdraw the funds he made from these investments. Its most likely Mr B never actually 
traded, and we know he wasnt able to withdraw any funds. And 23 Traders stopped 
responding to him and have since removed their website. 
Considering the above, I believe Mr B does have a valid claim for misrepresentation. He first 
entered into the contract with 23 Traders because it led him to believe he would be trading 
and able to make traders and withdraw funds. Mr Bs testimony is persuasive and based on 
this account and the nature of this situation, I consider 23 Traders did claim that he would be 
trading in lucrative investments and importantly, Mr B was given the assurances that he 
could withdraw his funds at any time.
I have also looked at an archived copy of 23 Traders website from January 2017 and it does 
purport to be a legitimate trading platform which from my understanding it was not. There are 
also many negative reviews for 23 Traders left by other victims. And 23 Traders have an 
entry on the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) register. So I 
consider 23 Traders was not operating a legitimate enterprise and that they actually never 
intended for Mr B to be able to profitably trade and then withdraw these funds. So they did 
misrepresent their position and this induced Mr B into entering into the agreements.
Taking into account the above, I consider Mr B does have a valid claim under Section 75 for 
the first two transactions he made to 23 Traders. I should also add for the sake of 
completeness that this would apply to the rest of the payments as well, had I not already 
said that they should be refunded.
Putting things right
Redress on s75 payments:
Refund the first two transactions;
Pay 8% interest on those sums from the date they were paid to the date of settlement 
(less any tax lawfully deductible)
Redress on remaining paymentsRefund payments 3 to 15 (i.e. the remaining payments to 23 Traders)
Rework Mr Bs credit card account to reimburse any interest and charges levied 
directly because of payment 3 to 15 to 23 Traders.
Pay 8% simple interest, per year, on any repayments Mr B made towards the credit 
card account in respect of payments 3 to 15 from the date they were paid to the date 
of settlement.
 Mr B agreed with my findings. Tesco Bank did not respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, as neither party has provided any new information or evidence, I see no 
reason for me to depart from my provisional findings. So my final decision is the same as my 
provisional decision and for the same reasons so I think Tesco Bank should pay redress as 
outlined below.
My final decision
For the reasons given, my decision is that I uphold this complaint and require Tesco 
Personal Finance PLC, trading as Tesco Bank, to put matters right by doing the following;
Redress on s75 payments:
Refund the first two transactions;
Pay 8% interest on those sums from the date they were paid to the date of settlement 
(less any tax lawfully deductible)
Redress on remaining payments
Refund payments 3 to 15 (i.e. the remaining payments to 23 Traders)
Rework Mr Bs credit card account to reimburse any interest and charges levied 
directly because of payment 3 to 15 to 23 Traders.
Pay 8% simple interest, per year, on any repayments Mr B made towards the credit 
card account in respect of payments 3 to 15 from the date they were paid to the date 
of settlement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 April 2023.
