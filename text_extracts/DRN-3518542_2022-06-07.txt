The complaint
Mr C says AvantCredit of UK, LLC irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
This complaint is about 2 loans AvantCredit provided to Mr C between July and November 
2016. Mr Cs borrowing history is as follows:
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in May 2022. Both parties have received a 
copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from the decision 
below. I said;
Did AvantCredit complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr C 
would be able to repay loans without experiencing significant adverse consequences?
AvantCredit has provided evidence to show that before lending to Mr C on both occasions, it 
asked him for information about his income and expenditure. It also carried out a credit 
check. Before it agreed to give Mr C loan 1, it also verified his income by requesting a 
months worth of bank statements. Based on those checks AvantCredit thought it was fair to 
lend.
Mr C was entering into a significant commitment with AvantCredit. He was agreeing to make 
monthly repayments for a period of 3 years on both occasions. So, I think it is right that 
AvantCredit wanted to gather, and independently check, some detailed information about Mr 
Cs financial circumstances before it agreed to lend to him. I think that the checks it did on 
both occasions were sufficient to achieve that aim. I think AvantCredits checks were 
proportionate. 
Did AvantCredit make fair lending decisions?
I have concluded AvantCredit made proportionate checks. But simply performing 
proportionate checks isnt always enough. A lender also needs to react appropriately to the 
information those checks show. Those results might sometimes lead a lender to undertake 
further enquiries into a consumers financial situation. Or, in some cases, the results might 
lead a lender to decline a loan application outright. This is what I currently think AvantCredit 
should have done for both loans.
AvantCredit obtained bank statements from Mr C when he applied for his first loan. It 
gathered a months worth. It says it did this to verify Mr Cs income. On these statements 
there are many gambling transactions. Mr C was over his agreed overdraft limit whilst he 
was spending money on gambling too. I currently think this shows Mr C was having 
problems managing his finances at that time and on seeing this AvantCredit shouldnt have 
made a decision to lend to him.
Loan Date taken Amount Term Repayment
1 July 2016 £2000 36 Months £88.41
2 November 2016 £2100 36 Months £103.73Mr C repaid loan 1 in September 2016 and asked for loan 2 in November 2016. I dont think 
it is likely Mr Cs finances would have improved in this short period of time and so it follows 
that I dont think, based on what AvantCredit had in front of it, that it should have given Mr C 
this loan either. 
AvantCredit needs to put things right.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response to 
my provisional decision. Mr C responded and had no further comments. AvantCredit did 
not respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C has not made any new points for me to respond to and AvantCredit has not responded. 
So, as neither party has anything further to add that I feel I need to comment on or that will 
change the outcome of this complaint, I dont see any reason to depart from my findings 
within my provisional decision. With that being the case, I uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Putting things right  what AvantCredit needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr C paid on loan 1 and 2;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 1 and 2 from Mr Cs credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to take off tax from this interest. AvantCredit must 
give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Cs complaint and direct AvantCredit of UK, LLC to put 
things right as described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2022.
