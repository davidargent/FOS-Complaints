K820x#14Mrs H has claimed  for damage  to her contents under the policy also.  I have been provided, 
amongst other things,  with an estimate from a sofa company,  kitchen company and other 
suppliers to evidence  this. 
But Legal  & General would only be liable to pay out under the policy for damages caused  by 
an insured event. I have  seen no evidence to make me conclude that the escape of water 
was, on balance, the cause of any damage to Mrs Hs contents. And I have seen no 
evidence to make me think that any damage  caused  to any of Mrs Hs contents  was caused 
by an insured event.  So I dont think I can ask it to do any more.  
I also note Mrs Hs comments in respect  of Legal & Generals failure to finalise  her case in a 
timely manner which she says caused the wood flooring  and kitchen cabinets  being further 
damaged. I have thought about  this carefully  but I do not agree. As above, I havent seen 
enough evidence  to make  me think that any damage caused to the Kitchen/Dining area was 
caused by the leak or any other  insured event.  And I think  it more  likely that damage to the 
kitchen cabinets  and wood flooring was caused  as a result  of them being left outside  Mrs Hs 
home which is not an insured event. 
I have taken into account all Mrs Hs comments and submissions  before coming  to my 
conclusions but they do not affect my decision. 
I understand that Legal & General  have already paid Mrs H Â£7484.26. And having 
considered all the evidence in this case I dont think Legal & General need to do anything  
more. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Mrs H.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I do not uphold Mrs Hs complaint  against Legal & General 
Insurance Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask the consumer to 
accept or reject my decision  before  8 March 2019.
