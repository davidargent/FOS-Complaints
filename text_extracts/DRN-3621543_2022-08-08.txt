The complaint
Mr B is unhappy with how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cia SCA has handled his PayPal 
account. Hes said this has impacted his business, and his ability to repay borrowing he had 
taken from PayPal. 
What happened
Mr B has explained that he was running an online business selling e-liquids. And was using 
PayPal to receive funds for the business. Mr B said he had been doing this for a number of 
years, with no problem. But then PayPal told him it was no longer allowing e-liquid or vape 
vendors to use its facilities. So, Mr B could no longer receive payments for his business 
through PayPal.
Mr B has said this had an impact on his business. And, it had an impact on his ability to 
repay a loan he had taken out through PayPal. Mr B said this was because he applied, and 
was accepted for a working capital loan, with the payments being based on 30% of his sales. 
And these repayments were to be taken through his account. But when he ceased to be able 
to receive funds into the PayPal account, he wasnt able to make the repayments. 
Given that Mr B had been using PayPal for some time for his business, and he felt that it had 
now caused him financial difficulties, Mr B considered that PayPal had acted unfairly. So, he 
raised his concerns with it. And felt it should write off the loan the remainder of the loan he 
had with it. 
PayPal responded, and maintained its position. It said it had conducted a general review of 
accounts held with it and had become aware that Mr B was using his PayPal account in a 
way which was against its acceptable use policy. This being because of the products Mr B 
was selling. PayPal said Mr B had needed to gain pre-approval from it, for the sale of e-
liquids, e-cigarettes and the like. And he hadnt done this.
PayPal has said if Mr B wishes to seek pre-approval, he can contact its sales team in 
relation to this. 
Because Mr B remained unhappy with PayPals position on the matter, he referred his 
complaint to this service for an independent review.
Our investigator considered this complaint and didnt think it should be upheld. They said 
PayPals acceptable use policy was clear that pre-approval from PayPal was needed in this 
instance. And Mr B hadnt got this. So, without approval, it was reasonable for PayPal to say 
Mr B couldnt receive payments in relation to his vape business. 
Mr B disagreed. He said there had never been the need to gain pre-approval from PayPal for 
his business  the only approval needed was through the online website he was selling 
items on  and this approval had been gained. Mr B said that PayPal had changed the rules 
after he had already been using PayPal.
Mr B also said that when he took out the working capital loan with PayPal, it should have 
made checks to ensure it was appropriate to provide the loan. And these checks should 
have included it seeing the transactions coming from Mr Bs account. So, he felt PayPal had 
acted unreasonably in the provision of the loan. Mr B maintains that PayPal should write off 
at least some of the outstanding balance he owes.
Because Mr B didnt agree, this complaint has been referred to me decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint. I know this will come as a 
disappointment to Mr B  its clear he feels strongly about the matter. But Id like to reassure 
the parties that Ive reviewed all information and evidence provided by both. However, when 
explaining my decision, Ive only referenced evidence I consider necessary to detail my 
reasoning.
When considering a complaint such as this, the starting point is the terms of the user 
agreement between PayPal and Mr B. This being because it is the basis of the contract 
between the two parties. On looking at the user agreement I can see PayPal explains that 
when using a PayPal account, the account holder mustnt breach its acceptable use policy.
PayPals acceptable use policy also highlights an account holder must comply with it. It goes 
on to explain that there are activities that require PayPals approval. Under the section 
Activities Requiring Approval, section 15 explains that tobacco products, non-cigarette 
tobacco products and e-cigarettes need prior approval from PayPal. There is no dispute that 
Mr B was selling products that fall into this category. And so, he would need approval from 
PayPal to accept payments in relation to this.
This service has asked both parties whether Mr B has approval. Mr B has explained he had 
approval by an online website he sold products through. But hasnt provided anything to 
show he had approval from PayPal to receive payments of this nature. And PayPal has 
highlighted its systems show no contact from Mr B to gain approval from it. So, based on 
what Ive seen, Mr B didnt have approval to receive these payments, and this was needed. 
Given this, Im satisfied PayPal acted reasonably in noting there was a breach of the 
acceptable use policy. 
Mr B has said this isnt the case. Hes said that at the time of opening his account no 
approval was needed, and PayPal later decided to restrict receiving funds for these types of 
accounts. Im aware Mr B opened his PayPal account in October 2014. And Ive looked at an 
internet archive website, which shows PayPals acceptable use policy from this time. This 
also shows the need for prior approval to receive money for transactions relating to e-
cigarettes. So, Im satisfied its likely approval was needed. 
In any event, PayPal is entitled to update its user agreement. And I cant see Mr B has ever 
sought approval, including after he became aware it was needed. PayPal has said if Mr B is 
seeking pre-approval for the sale of e-cigarettes or e-liquids he needs to submit his requests 
to its sales team. So, this is something open to Mr B.
Because Im satisfied Mr B breached the acceptable use policy, I think it was reasonable for 
PayPal to stop Mr B receiving payments for these transactions. He didnt have the 
authorisation for this. So, I dont think PayPal did anything wrong here.
Mr B has raised the working capital loan he received and his concerns about the ability to 
repay it, given the transactions he cant receive. But as I dont think PayPal did anything 
wrong in restricting these transactions, there isnt anything further I recommend in this respect. PayPals user agreement does note it is able to seek reimbursement for liabilities 
through other means, including through debt collection, if there are insufficient funds in the 
relevant PayPal account. So, I dont think it has made an error by looking to collect the debt 
elsewhere, in this instance. 
But I do understand that Mr B has since raised wider concerns about the working capital 
loan, and PayPals decision to provide this to him. If Mr B has concerns about this, hell need 
to raise this with PayPal directly for it to look into. 
My final decision
Given the above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. So, I dont require 
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cia SCA to do anything more. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 September 2022.
