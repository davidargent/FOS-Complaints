Mr N complained that 118 118 Money been irresponsible in lending to him.
118 118 Money looked into his complaint. It said it had carried out proper checks and it 
thought the loans were affordable. 
Mr N referred his complaint to us. Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. He didnt think 
118 118 Money had carried out proper checks in respect of Loan 3 but wasnt able to say 
what 118 118 Money would have found if it had carried out proportionate checks. 
As Mr N didnt agree, the matter has been referred to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions 
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Ns complaint. These two 
questions are:
1. Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr N would be able to repay the loans without experiencing significant adverse 
consequences?
If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
If not, would those checks have shown that Mr N wouldve been able to do so?
2. Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
The rules and regulations in place required 118 118 Money to carry out a reasonable and 
proportionate assessment of Mr Ns ability to make the repayments under the agreements. 
This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or affordability 
check.
The checks had to be borrower-focused  so 118 118 Money had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would be sustainable. In practice this meant that the business had to 
ensure that making the repayments on the loans wouldnt cause Mr N undue difficulty or 
significant adverse consequences. That means he should have been able to meet 
repayments out of normal income without having to borrow to meet the repayments, without 
failing to make any other payment he had a contractual or statutory obligation to make and 
without the repayments having a significant adverse impact on his financial situation.
In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 Money to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr N. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan applications.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking. Even 
for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint.
Loan 1
When Mr N applied for the loan, he told 118 118 Money that his monthly income was £1,400 
and his expenses (including other credit commitments) were £610. 118 118 Money said it 
carried out a credit search and verified Mr Ns income using industry standard checks. The credit search revealed Mr N owed a total of £473 over 7 active accounts. There was 
nothing very concerning revealed by the credit search. Thered been no defaults or cash 
advances in the last 12 months.
I think 118 118 Moneys checks were proportionate given the size and term of the loan and 
the value of the repayment in relation to Mr Ns monthly income. So I dont think 118 118 
Money ought to have been concerned the loan wouldnt be sustainably affordable for Mr N. 
It follows that I dont think 118 118 Money was wrong to give Mr N Loan 1. 
Loan 2
When this loan was taken out, £2,622.60 was used to repay Loan 1. Mr N told 118 118 
Money his monthly income and expenses were broadly the same and the purpose of the 
remainder of the loan was home improvements or repairs.
Mr Ns total borrowing had increased in the 6 months since taking out Loan 1 to £930. But he 
still seemed to be managing his finances well. Again I think 118 118 Moneys checks were 
proportionate given the size and term of the loan and the value of the repayment in relation 
to Mr Ns monthly income. I dont think 118 118 Money was wrong to give Mr N Loan 2.
Loan 3
I think 118 118 Money should have been concerned about Mr Ns need to borrow for a third 
time so soon after repaying Loan 2. In addition its credit search showed that Mr Ns debts 
had increased to £4,529. His credit commitments with the Loan 3 repayments would be 
around a third of his stated monthly income. Due to these factors I think 118 118 Money 
should have done further checks to assure itself that Mr N would be able to repay the loan in 
a sustainable way over the 24 month term. I think it ought to have carried out a more 
thorough review of Mr Ns finances. As I cant see that this was done, I dont think that the 
checks carried out before providing Mr N with this loan were reasonable and proportionate.
Although I dont think the checks 118 118 Money did before agreeing the loan were 
sufficient, that isnt enough of a reason for me to uphold Mr Ns complaint. In order for the 
complaint to succeed I would also need to be able to say that proportionate checks would 
have shown 118 118 Money that Mr N couldnt sustainably afford the repayments.
Although Ive concluded that 118 118 Money should have carried out further checks for the 
loan, Im not sure what it would have seen if it had done so as Mr N hasnt provided us with 
bank statements from around the time he applied for this loan. Im not suggesting here that 
these are the checks that 118 118 Money should necessarily have done. But I think looking 
at these would have given a good indication of Mr Ns financial situation around the time he 
applied for this loan. As I cant say with any certainty that 118 118 Money would have 
uncovered information showing the loan would be unaffordable for Mr N, Im not able to 
uphold this part of his complaint.
Ive also thought about whether 118 118 Money acted unfairly in some other way and I 
havent seen any evidence that it did.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold Mr Ns complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2022.
