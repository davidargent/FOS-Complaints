The complaint
Mr C and Mrs C complain that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) are still pursuing them 
for a debt.
What happened
Mr C and Mrs C owed RBS the following amounts:
Between 7 November 2018 and 28 January 2019, there were three credits paid into account 
A - £450, £170.80 and £361.19  a total of £981.99. The total debt on all accounts was then 
therefore £3,238.81.
In February 2009, the debts were passed to RBS recoveries department, and then to debt 
collectors in May 2010. The accounts were passed to second debt collectors in October 
2018. In September 2019, the debt collection agency changed hands. The debts remained 
with RBS.
Mr C and Mrs C say they made an agreement with the debt collection agency that  if they 
paid off the large loan of over £18,000  then the remaining debts on the two other accounts 
would be written off. So  they paid in £981.99 to do that. They paid this amount to the debt 
collectors  who passed it to RBS. But the payments were credited to the current account A. 
They needed to borrow money from Mr Cs father to make the payments to the large loan  
in order to honour the deal theyd made. They also said that RBS cannot pursue them for the 
debts as they are time limited  as theyve not been asked for any payments for seven 
years.
RBS said they had no record of any agreement to write off any debts - between the debt 
collectors and Mr C and Mrs C  and asked them for evidence of this. The debts werent 
time limited as they amalgamated all the debts when they were transferred to the debt 
collectors. And  theyd written to Mr C and Mrs C in October 2019 when the debts were 
transferred to the second debt collectors. They said the debts were valid and should be 
repaid.
Mr C and Mrs C brought their complaint to us. Our investigator said he considered the debts 
werent time limited  as there was a welcome letter from the debt collectors in December 
2018. And in Mr C and Mrs Cs letters to them, theyd acknowledged the debts. He said the 
debts were valid and enforceable.
Mr C and Mrs C didnt agree. They said again that if there wasnt such an agreement (to 
write off the current accounts debts if the loan was repaid) - then why did they pay exact

I reached a provisional decision where I said:
This complaint had been the subject of a lot of correspondence between Mr C and Mrs C, 
ourselves and RBS. But  I will try to cut through to the main points.
Firstly  the issue of whether there was an agreement to write off the balances on accounts 
A and B. This is the crux of Mr C and Mrs Cs complaint  which is that they agreed with the 
debt collectors that if they paid off the large loan of over £18000  then the remaining, 
smaller, debts on the two current account would be written off. Based on this agreement, 
they say they went ahead and paid £450 a month  which I can see happened from 
December 2015 onwards. The debt on the loan was only £981.99 in October 2018. Mr C and 
Mrs C say  they then paid this in to pay off the loan under the terms of the agreement they 
had with the debt collectors and RBS. I can see they paid in this amount. But  the debt 
collectors sent this amount to RBS, who applied it to the current account A, not the loan.
The account statements show £450.00 was paid each month and credited to the loan 
account  up to and including October 2018. For reasons that are not clear, the last normal 
monthly payment of £450.00 in November 2018 and the last two payments (bringing the total 
to £981.99) were credited to current account A. That seems to be a clear error and not 
something in the control of Mr C and Mrs C. It doesnt matter whether the error was on the 
part of the debt collection agency RBS was using at the time or RBS themselves. This is 
supported by the letter from the debt collection agency dated 6 December 2018 referring to 
only two debts  for the two current accounts.
Weve asked RBS several questions about this. Theyve said it doesnt matter which account 
the credit was paid into  as they considered the debt were amalgamated into one. But  I 
dont understand this as separate statements are being produced for all three accounts. And 
 RBS havent been able to show us a letter to Mr C and Mrs C which explains the 
amalgamation. So  I dont think this argument stands up. RBS have said the payments into 
the current accounts (of £981.99) were adjustments  I dont understand what that means 
either.
RBS have said they dont have a record of any agreement to write off the debts. And  if 
there had been one, the debt collectors wouldve had to get RBS agreement to it, so RBS 
would have a record of it. The debt collectors dont have any record either. RBS havent 
been able to show us the general agency agreements they had with the debt collection 
agencies. But equally, there have been three firms of debt collectors used over the years  
so records may have been mislaid. But also  Mr C and Mrs C havent been able to show us 
any evidence that an agreement existed. But in summary  little material evidence exists.
Having determined that the intention of the payments totalling £981.99 was to clear the loan 
I can now consider the crux of the matter  was there an agreement for the two current 
account balances to be written-off? Here, RBS doesnt have any evidence there wasnt any 
such agreement. Having no evidence as such, I have to then consider the testimony from Mr 
C and Mrs C.
And I find that quite compelling. They say, why would we have paid £981.99 exactly if we 
didnt think it was all that was needed to be paid to the bank?. I think there is something in 
that. They had been paying £450.00 each month since December 2015. So, they would 
have been able to clear the amounts due on the current accounts in only five months. It 
seems strange that they would stop making the £450.00 payments if they believed the 
amounts on the two current accounts remained payable to the bank.I view the letter dated December 2018 as significant in terms of what happened directly after 
it. The letter said there were debts of £2699.01 and £539.80 on the two current accounts  
and it was directly after that time that Mr C and Mrs C paid in a further £170.80 and £361.18 
to take the total payments to £981.99  the balance of the loan account at the time. This 
cannot be a simple coincidence, and I cant think of any other reason such an amount 
wouldve been paid in. For me, this indicates that there was an agreement as Mr C and Mrs 
C claim.
On Mr C and Mrs Cs argument that the debts are time limited  I can see that the debt 
collectors wrote to them on 6 December 2018 and said the balances owing on the current 
accounts were £2699.01 and £539.80. But  the legality of the debt under time limitation 
legislation is a matter for a court to decide, not this service.
This is a balanced provisional decision, where Mr C and Mrs C have consistently argued 
their case for a long time. And  theres an absence of any form of written evidence, so I 
must base my judgement on a balance of probabilities as to what I think happened. And  on 
the basis, I think there was an agreement to write off the outstanding debts on the two 
current accounts  if the loan was repaid. And so  RBS should do that and put Mr C and 
Mrs C in the position they wouldve been in in January 2019  because the debts shouldve 
been written off then. This means that RBS should close the loan account and the two 
current accounts and write off the total debt of £3238.81. They should remove any entries on 
Mr C and Mrs Cs credit file in connection with those debts from that date. But because this 
is very much a balanced decision, I dont think its appropriate to award any compensation 
here.
Responses to the provisional decision:
RBS accepted my findings. So did Mr C and Mrs C  and asked for confirmation that this 
would mean the debt collection agencies would be informed and stop calling them.
So - I now need to make a final decision.
(continued)
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Because both RBS and Mr C and Mrs C agreed with the provisional decision, I wont be 
departing from it. And so  RBS must do what I said in it. I am only changing the final 
decision very slightly to confirm that Mr C and Mrs C get no more calls from the debt 
collection agencies  which I assume would be the case anyway.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc must:
Write off the outstanding debts on the two current accounts and loan account - 
£981.99, £539.80 and £1717.02.
Ensure the debt collection agencies are notified and cease calls to Mr C and Mrs C.
Remove any entries on Mr C and Mrs Cs credit file in respect of those debts with 
effect from January 2019.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 17 November 2021.
