The complaint
Mr H and Miss P complain that GE Money Consumer Lending Limited has rejected the 
claims that theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Mr H and Miss P are being 
helped with their complaint by a claim management company.
What happened
Mr H and Miss P entered into a purchase agreement to buy some holiday club membership 
points in September 2008. The price of the membership was £7,700 and they also traded-in 
some existing points. They entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with GE Money 
Consumer Lending at the same time for the £7,700 and to refinance their existing credit of 
£11,995. They agreed to make 120 monthly payments of £279.61 to GE Money Consumer 
Lending. The loan was transferred to another lender in 2011. 
Mr H and Miss Ps representative complained to GE Money Consumer Lending in August 
2018 about a number of issues including that the membership had been misrepresented to 
Mr H and Miss P, there had been a breach of contract, commission had been paid by GE 
Money Consumer Lending to the holiday company which hadnt been declared to Mr H and 
Miss P and the relationship between GE Money Consumer Lending and Mr H and Miss P 
was unfair. 
GE Money Consumer Lending said that Mr H and Miss Ps loan had been transferred to 
another lender so it was unable to investigate the complaint and they should contact that 
lender. It then said in June 2021 that it had found that it was its responsibility to answer the 
complaint and it offered Mr H and Miss P £50 for any stress and inconvenience that may 
have been caused as a result of its error and the delay in rectifying it. It then set out the 
reasons that it didnt consider that their complaint should be upheld, including that the 
complaint had been raised out of time, it didnt sell the membership and wasnt present at 
the sale. 
Mr H and Miss P werent satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. 
Their complaint form says that the holiday company and GE Money Consumer Lending 
failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mr H and Miss Ps ability to afford the loan, GE 
Money Consumer Lending paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared 
to Mr H and Miss P and the holiday company unduly pressured them into entering into the 
contracts  all of which rendered the agreement unfair under section 140A of the Consumer 
Credit Act.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr H and Miss Ps complaint should be upheld. He 
didnt think that GE Money Consumer Lending had acted unfairly when it said that it wasnt 
going to look into their misrepresentation claim any further and he wasnt persuaded that the 
relationship between GE Money Consumer Lending and Mr H and Miss P was unfair. He 
said that the account records show that a credit check was completed and GE Money 
Consumer Lending obtained details of Mr H and Miss Ps income and outgoings. He thought 
that GE Money Consumer Lendings offer to pay £50 compensation to Mr H and Miss P was 
a fair offer.
Mr H and Miss P have asked for their complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. They 
have responded in detail and say, in summary, that:
the membership was misrepresented to them;
they were advised that it was an investment;
the holiday company has breached the contract;
a court has declared the agreement illegal and null and void;
EU directives have been breached;
credit checks were carried out in another room so they have no information as to who 
was spoken to or the level of check that was conducted;
they werent advised as to what the relationship between the representative, the 
holiday company and GE Money Consumer Lending was;
they werent advised that GE Money Consumer Lending paid a commission to the 
holiday company and the fact that commission was being paid should have been 
declared irrespective of the amount;
they werent given the full facts;
they were pressured into the agreement;
they have no knowledge of the offer of £50 compensation which they consider to be 
derisory and would have rejected; and
they dispute the suggestion that the claim was made out of time as the claim was 
made as soon as they were aware that they were able to make a claim.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr H and Miss Ps complaint is that GE Money Consumer Lending turned down the 
claims that theyd made to it and I accept that they referred their complaint to our 
service within six years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the 
Limitation Act 1980 applies to their claims;
Mr H and Miss Ps claims were made under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer 
Credit Act but Im not determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as 
only a court would be able to do that - Im considering whether or not GE Money 
Consumer Lendings response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr H and Miss P claim under section 75 is that the holiday company has breached 
the purchase agreement and that the membership was misrepresented to them and 
that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them - if the 
criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, GE Money Consumer Lending would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr H and Miss P could have made a claim to the holiday company or 
GE Money Consumer Lending about the misrepresentations that they say induced 
them into buying the membership in September 2008 as that was the latest time that 
any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been 
incurred as that was when they also entered into the loan agreement with GE Money 
Consumer Lending;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or GE Money Consumer Lending  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt 
made to GE Money Consumer Lending until August 2018, nearly ten years later 
which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that 
their misrepresentation claim is now time-barred;
the time limit for a breach of contract claim in these circumstances is also six years 
from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which is when everything 
needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr H and Miss P ought reasonably to have been aware of the facts 
that they say were a breach of contract in the first few years after they entered into 
the purchase agreement and Im not persuaded that theyve provided enough 
evidence to show that there had been a breach of the purchase agreement by the 
holiday company in the six years preceding the date of the claim that was made to 
GE Money Consumer Lending in August 2018 - so I consider that their breach of 
contract claim was made outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and is 
now also time-barred;
Mr H and Miss P have referred to an overseas court judgment and say that it makes 
the purchase agreement illegal and null and void  but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the purchase agreement is illegal or that the court 
judgment shows that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company for 
which GE Money Consumer Lending would be liable under section 75;
Mr H and Miss P say that their claim was made as soon as they were aware that they 
were able to make a claim  but when they had the knowledge to bring a claim 
doesnt assist them for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim 
under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have 
knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that 
those sections are applicable to Mr H and Miss Ps claims;
Mr H and Miss P say that there was an unfair relationship between them and GE 
Money Consumer Lending - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
GE Money Consumer Lending says that the loan was transferred to another lender in 
2011 but Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan has been repaid so Ive 
considered their claim under section 140A but Im not persuaded that its likely that a 
court would conclude that the relationship between Mr H and Miss P and GE Money 
Consumer Lending was unfair in these circumstances;
Mr H and Miss P acquired holiday club membership points under the purchase 
agreement and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
membership was sold to them as an investment;
Mr H and Miss P say that GE Money Consumer Lending should have told them about 
any commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the loan  but Ive 
not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by 
GE Money Consumer Lending to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that GE Money Consumer 
Lending wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was normally 
paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that GE Money Consumer 
Lending should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr H and 
Miss P risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr H and Miss P complain that GE Money Consumer Lending failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan  but GE Money Consumer 
Lending has provided evidence to show that a credit check was performed and that it 
obtained information from Mr H and Miss P about their financial situation which 
detailed their employers, their monthly incomes which was jointly £4,166, their 
monthly outgoings of £1,109 and that they were homeowners  I consider that it was 
reasonable for GE Money Consumer Lending to conclude on the basis of the 
information that it had obtained that a loan with a monthly payment of £279.61 was 
affordable for them at that time  and Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan 
was unaffordable for them;
Mr H and Miss P say that they werent advised as to what the relationship between 
the representative, the holiday company and GE Money Consumer Lending was  
but they signed the purchase agreement with the holiday company to buy the 
membership points and entered into the loan agreement with GE Money Consumer 
Lending for a loan to pay for those points  Im not persuaded that the relationship 
between the holiday company and GE Money Consumer Limited was concealed from 
them or that they were given any incorrect information about that relationship;
GE Money Consumer Lending initially said that it was unable to investigate Mr H and 
Miss Ps complaint because their loan had been transferred to another lender  but it 
then sent a detailed response to their complaint to their representative in June 2021 
and that response included its offer to pay them £50 for any stress and 
inconvenience that may have been caused as a result of its error and the delay in 
rectifying it;
I consider £50 to be fair and reasonable compensation for any distress and 
inconvenience caused by GE Money Consumer Lendings error in these 
circumstances and Im not persuaded that its error justifies more compensation than 
that  Mr H and Miss P say that they would have rejected that offer but if they now 
wish to do accept it I suggest that they contact GE Money Consumer Lending;GE Money Consumer Lending issued a substantive response to Mr H and Miss Ps 
claims in June 2021 and Im not persuaded that the outcome that it reached was 
unfair or unreasonable in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr H and Miss P for the issues that theyve had with their 
membership and the difficulties that theyve experienced, but I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require GE Money Consumer 
Lending to refund to them any of the money that they paid under the loan agreement, 
to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in response to their 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr H and Miss Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H and Miss P 
to accept or reject my decision before 15 November 2022.
