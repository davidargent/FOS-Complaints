The complaint
Mrs B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA didnt refund her for an item, after 
she raised a claim under its Buyer Protection policy.
A representative has been helping Mrs B with her complaint. For ease, Ill refer to anything 
theyve said as being said by Mrs B.
What happened
In mid-2021 Mrs B purchased a watch through an online shopping site. She used PayPal 
Credit to pay for the item. Mrs B says it was advertised as a designer watch in excellent 
working condition and was described as having a gold tone and polished stainless-steel 
case with the original full length stainless-steel and gold tone bracelet. However, the gold 
tone of the watch she received was badly chipped and the defects werent showing on the 
pictures provided by the seller online. 
Mrs B raised a dispute with PayPal under its Buyer Protection policy, using the category 
significantly not as described. She also tried to resolve the matter directly with the seller. 
The seller agreed to reimburse Mrs B for the item if she returned it, so she posted it to the 
address they gave her. 
PayPal rejected Mrs Bs claim a couple of days after shed raised it. It told her that the 
payment was ineligible for PayPal Buyer Protection. After Mrs B appealed, PayPal reopened 
her claim.
There was some further communication between Mrs B and PayPal. Mrs B says PayPal 
gave her a lot of contradictory information. She says PayPal didnt explain why the credit 
agreement wasnt cancelled. 
PayPal sent Mrs B a number of letters chasing for payment on her PayPal Credit account, 
including a default notice. Mrs B disputed owing the money but didnt receive any response 
from PayPal. She was then contacted by a debt collection agency. 
Our investigator looked into Mrs Bs concerns and thought her complaint should be upheld. 
He didnt think it was fair for PayPal to have rejected Mrs Bs claim. He recommended that it 
refund the amount shed paid for the item to her PayPal Credit account and pay her an 
additional amount for trouble and upset. 
PayPal disagreed with our investigators view and asked for the case to be passed to an 
ombudsman. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold Mrs Bs complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPals user agreement says that buyers may be eligible for a refund under its Buyer 
Protection policy in certain circumstances, including where the item is Significantly Not as 
Described.
PayPal says Mrs Bs claim was initially rejected because it believed it had minor scratches 
and was described as used. It says her appeal was denied because Mrs B didnt reply to 
requests for further information. 
I can see that PayPal requested a copy of the original description of the item or service on 
18 June 2021. However, Mrs B had already returned the item to the seller on 15 June 
because they had told her they were willing to refund her.
PayPal says Mrs B didnt respond to its information request within the three day time frame it 
had given her. However, its also acknowledged that Mrs B made it aware shed returned the 
item when she sent a picture of her post office receipt to it on 19 June 2021, which was the 
day after the request.
PayPal says Mrs B returned the item without being advised to do so and so she would need 
to deal with the seller regarding any refund. However, PayPal advised her to try to resolve 
the matter with the seller when she first raised the dispute. So, I think it was reasonable for   
Mrs B to have returned the item when the seller told her he was willing to give her a refund. 
PayPal says that if Mrs B had returned the item to the seller before escalating to a claim 
(and the significantly not as described reason was valid) it would have asked her for a 
tracking number and could have closed the claim in her favour upon delivery confirmation to 
the sellers address. It says it wouldnt have accepted a screenshot to show that the address 
Mrs B had returned the item to matched what was showing on the online shopping site, 
because it wouldnt have been able to associate the sellers email address to the seller or 
the item.   
It's unclear why PayPal doesnt think this information wouldnt be enough. In any event, 
PayPal doesnt appear to have asked Mrs B for evidence to show shed returned the item to 
the sellers address at the time. Nor has PayPal said what it would have accepted as proof 
that shed returned the item.
 
Mrs B spent a lot of time communicating with PayPal to try to get the matter resolved. Shes 
also provided emails which show that the seller had told Mrs B she could only receive the 
refund via the online shopping site. The online shopping site told Mrs B it couldnt open a 
dispute as there was already one open with PayPal. Im not persuaded that PayPal did 
enough to help her resolve things.
As Mrs B was left without the item and PayPal didnt seem willing to help her, I think its 
understandable that she didnt think she should pay the amount owing on her PayPal Credit 
account. Shes provided evidence that her representative disputed her owing this on more 
than one occasion. But PayPal doesnt appear to have responded. 
Under the circumstances, I think it would be fair for PayPal to refund the transaction to Mrs 
Bs PayPal Credit account and remove any interest and charges relating to it. It should also 
remove any negative information from her credit file.
Overall, I think the customer service Mrs B received from PayPal was poor. It didnt 
communicate with her clearly and it didnt do enough to help her recover the payment. Mrs B 
spent a lot of time trying to sort things out. Shes told us she is vulnerable, and the situation 
caused her to experience anxiety. So, I think it would be fair for PayPal to also pay Mrs B 
£150 for distress and inconvenience.Putting things right
PayPal should:
Refund Mrs B the amount she paid for the item (£129.99) to her PayPal Credit 
account.
Remove any interest and charges relating to the above.
If Mrs B has made any payments towards the purchase, PayPal should refund these 
to her along with 8% per annum simple interest from the date the payments were 
made until the date they are refunded.*
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs Bs credit file. 
Pay Mrs B £150 for distress and inconvenience.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal to deduct tax from this interest. PayPal should give Mrs B 
a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mrs Bs complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA to put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2022.
