The complaint
Mr D complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him in an
irresponsible manner.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in April 2020 that I summarise below.
Mr D was given 16 loans by Sunny between December 2018 and March 2019. Each of the 
loans was due to be paid in 24 weekly instalments. Mr D repaid many of the loans well 
before they were due, but a balance remained outstanding on three of the loans when he 
made his complaint. A summary of his borrowing from Sunny is as follows;

15 21/02/2019 - £  150
16 10/03/2019 23/04/2019 £  100
In my provisional decision I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, and 
in particular that the checks Sunny needed to do would need to take into account things 
DRN-1891200such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I thought less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
I thought that the checks Sunny did before agreeing the first four loans were proportionate. 
But I thought those checks suggested that Mr D wouldn't be able to sustainably repay loans 
2, 3, or 4. But I didn't think it had been wrong for Sunny to agree to give loan 1 to Mr D.
I thought that Sunny should have done more checks before agreeing the remaining loans. 
But even based on the information Sunny had gathered I didn't think it had been reasonable 
to agree loans 5 to 9. 
And I thought that, by the time of loan 10, Sunny should have realised that the overall 
pattern of Mr D's borrowing should have suggested that any further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldn't 
provide further loans. So I asked Sunny to pay Mr D some compensation in relation to 
loans 2 to 16.
Neither Mr D nor Sunny have provided any further comments or evidence in response to my 
provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Given that neither party has provided 
me with any new evidence or further comments, I see no reason to alter the conclusions 
I reached in my provisional decision.
So apart from the first loan I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr D. Sunny 
needs to pay him some compensation.
Putting things right
I dont currently think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr D after, and including, the
loan that he took on 2 December 2018. So Sunny should;
refund all the interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 2 to 12, and loan 16.
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 13 to 15 and treat any 
payments Mr D made towards these loans as payments towards the capital
if reworking Mr Ds loan accounts for loans 13 to 15 as Ive directed results in Mr D 
effectively having made payments above the original capital borrowed on any loan,
then Sunny should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on 
the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of 
settlement.
if reworking Mr Ds loan accounts for loans 13 to 15 leaves an amount of capital still 
to be paid on any loan, then Sunny can use the total refund from the other loans(after 
the deduction of tax) to offset this. And if there is still an outstanding capital balance 
on any loan then I remind Sunny that it should take a sympathetic view when seeking 
to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr D.
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ds credit file in relation to 
loans 2 to 9.
the number of loans taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 10 to 12 and loan 16, and about loans 13 to 15 once they have been fully repaid, should be removed from Mr Ds 
credit file
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold most of Mr Ds complaint and direct Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 July 2020.
