The complaint
Mrs M complains that NewDay Ltd trading as John Lewis Partnership Card (NewDay) didnt 
apply a refund to her credit card account. Mrs M says the failure to apply the refund caused 
additional interest to be applied to her card account. 
What happened
Mrs M placed an order for goods on 31 October 2022 using a banking payment service 
linked to her NewDay credit card. Mrs M cancelled the order the same day and the merchant 
and banking payment service confirmed the payment had been refunded. When Mrs M 
received her credit card statement, she couldnt see the refund had been applied to the card 
and complained to NewDay.
NewDay said it hadnt received the refund but accepted that it took too long for it to deal with 
Mrs Ms complaint, and paid Mrs M £20. NewDay also refunded interest of £60.10 it had 
applied to the account as a gesture of goodwill.
Mrs M brought the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service and one of our 
Investigators looked into things. The Investigator wasnt persuaded the amount Mrs M wants 
refunding was debited to her NewDay card account and that no refund was due because of 
this. Mrs M asked that an Ombudsman decides the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Mrs M will be disappointed, but Ive decided not to uphold this complaint. I will 
now explain why.
Mrs M says the crux of her complaint is that NewDay didnt apply a refund for the debit 
applied to her card account of £27.38, and theres no dispute that Mrs Ms NewDay account 
was debited for £27.38. Mrs M has provided evidence showing the banking payment service 
she used processed a refund of £24.54 - around the same time as the £27.38 transaction - 
and she says this refund doesnt appear on her NewDay statements. Mrs M says this refund 
is the same transaction as the £27.38 already debited to her NewDay account. Theres no 
credit or debit for £24.54 on Mrs Ms NewDay account and NewDay has confirmed to the 
Financial Ombudsman Service that it cannot trace this amount in any of its holding accounts, 
including a search using the transaction number the banking payment service provided.
Mrs M has strong views that the £27.38 debit is linked to the £24.54 credit, but in the 
documents Mrs M has provided, the banking payment service provider refers to a debit of 
£24.54 and a credit for the same amount. - theres no mention of a debit of £27.38. In my 
opinion, this suggests that the banking payment service carried out an internal transaction 
and a debit or credit for £24.54 was never submitted to NewDay. In my opinion the £24.54 
debit and refund are more likely than not a separate transaction and unrelated to the £27.38 
transaction. I think that if the banking service provider intended to refund £27.38 its more 
likely than not it would have refunded this amount and not a lower amount. I considered 
whether the Euro to Pound exchange rate would have impacted on this transaction, but the 
documents Mrs M provided use the same exchange rate for the debit and refund  this 
supports that this is more likely a sperate transaction to the £27.38 one.
In summary, for me to decide NewDay should have refunded £27.38 I would need to be 
reasonably sure it had received a refund request for this amount, and Ive not seen that it 
did. I think its unlikely the transactions for £24.54 and £27.38 were the same transaction. As 
theres no evidence to show the £24.54 was debited to Mrs Ms card in the first place, I cant 
reasonably conclude NewDay should refund this amount.
For completeness, NewDay has already refunded some interest it applied to Mrs Ms card 
account as a gesture of goodwill. NewDay has also paid Mrs £20 for failing to deal with her 
complaint as quickly as it should have. As complaint handling isnt a regulated activity, I cant 
consider this issue in my decision.
My final decision
For the reasons provided above, Ive decided not to uphold Mrs Ms complaint against 
NewDay Ltd trading as John Lewis Partnership Card.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 December 2023.
