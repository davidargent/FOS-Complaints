K820x#14complaint
Mr K is unhappy PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) closed his account  and held 
his funds.
background
PayPal carried out a review into Mr Ks account  following a purchase he made.  Mr K was 
unhappy with an item he received and was liaising  with PayPal for a refund. PayPal 
refunded Mr K for the item, but it also carried  out a review into his account, and decided it 
didnt want to continue  its relationship with Mr K. It told him it would close  his account,  and 
would hold his available  funds for 180 days  as its entitled to do in its terms and conditions.
Mr K was unhappy with PayPals decision.  He said it was unfair  of PayPal to close  his 
account, as this meant he would be unable to trade. Hes also frustrated at the lack of 
information PayPal  provided around  why his account has been closed.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 18 October  2019. In my provisional 
decision I said:
Ive thought about PayPals decision to close Mr Ks account and hold his funds for 180 
days. PayPal  has said its entitled to take such measures and make  business decisions as it 
sees fit. And I dont disagree   PayPal isnt obliged to continue to provide  its service to Mr K 
if it doesnt want to. But I have to make  sure its reached this decision fairly, considering the 
circumstances of this particular case.
PayPal has said Mr K engaged in restricted activities   which  is why his account was closed  
and his funds  withheld. Its terms and conditions  say it can withhold funds  for 180 days  to 
cover any potential disputes or claims which may arise. Specifically, the term explains:
-if we have reason to believe that you have engaged in any restricted  activities,  we may 
take various actions  to protect PayPal, a user, a third party,  or you from reversals,  
chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and any other liability. The actions we may 
take include  but are not limited to the following..block your account and/or hold any 
funds in the reserve account  including  without limitation, for more than 180 days  if so 
required by PayPal.
So I think PayPals been clear that  if it suspects any restricted activities  are carried  out  it 
can permanently suspend  the account,  and hold any funds for 180 days or more  to protect it 
from any liabilities. And this is what its done in Mr Ks case. But I think the important point is 
that in order to reserve Mr Ks funds,  PayPal needs  to have a reason to believe he engaged 
in any restricted activities. So Ive considered whether PayPal  has acted fairly in this regard.
PayPals provided  some information  to show Mr K was selling a number of items  for 
considerably less than the recommended retail price (RRP). While I dont think  this is 
enough on its own, PayPal has also explained  some concerns about Mr Ks practices when 
using an online selling platform.
So it seems  to me that the use of his account  led to PayPals concern about  the risks Mr Ks 
activity may have caused.
Ref: DRN52358282So in this case, I can understand why PayPal thought  there might be an unacceptable  level 
of risk associated with Mr Ks account. And Im satisfied it didnt act unreasonably by taking 
the action it did to protect itself, in line with its terms and conditions.
Ive seen that Mr K has since withdrawn  his funds after the 180 days  expired. And while I 
know hell be disappointed, for the reasons Ive outlined  above, I dont think  PayPal acted 
unreasonably. So I dont intend on asking  it to do anything more,  and I dont currently intend 
to uphold Mr Ks complaint.
PayPal accepted my findings  but Mr K didnt respond. So now Im issuing my final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Mr K nor PayPal disagreed with my findings, I see no reason to depart from them.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 January 2020.
