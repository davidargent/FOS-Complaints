The complaint
Miss L complains that Brightside Insurance Services Limited mishandled her motor
insurance policy. 
  
What happened
Miss L went onto a price comparison website. It referred her to Brightside which acted as an
intermediary between her and an insurance company.
Miss L paid a deposit of £28.64. Brightside also acted as a credit broker between Miss L and
a lender which financed her payment of the balance of the premium. Miss L agreed to pay a
further 11 instalments of £32.53. The insurance company issued a motor policy for the year
from 5 July 2021.
On 7 July 2021, Brightside gave Miss L a seven-day notice of cancellation. Brightside said
she had given invalid bank details for the direct debit. Miss L confirmed her correct bank
details the same day. But Brightside failed to stop the cancellation, which it confirmed with
effect from 14 July.
Miss L complained to Brightside that it shouldnt have cancelled her policy. She arranged
alternative  more expensive - cover.
By a final response dated 21 July, Brightside said it had cancelled the policy in error. It
waived its cancellation fee and refunded Miss L her deposit of £28.64 and waived any
outstanding balance  so she didnt pay for her time on cover. Brightside also said it wouldnt
put a cancellation marker on her records.
Miss L brought her complaint to us without delay. She said that the Brightside policy
wouldve cost £386.47 for a year and her new policy will cost £517.99 - so Brightside had
caused her an additional cost of £131.52 as well as distress and inconvenience.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. He thought that Miss L
had no option but to arrange emergency alternative insurance at a greater premium which
had caused her trouble and upset. He recommended that Brightside should:
1.pay Miss L £131.52 for the difference between her original insurance and 
alternative insurance she was forced to take out; and
2.compensate Miss L £100.00 for the trouble and upset.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss L  
and to Brightside on 10 November 2021. I summarise my findings:
Brightsides final response didnt put Miss L back into the position she shouldve been 
in. It removed a fee for a cancellation that shouldnt have happened. And it gave her 
the benefit of free insurance for the nine days from 5 to 14 July, which was worth 
about £9.50 on a pro-rata basis.
Miss L couldve had a new policy without paying another deposit, for about £42.00 
per month. In its submission to us, Brightside said the total of the instalments 
wouldve been £465.00.
Miss L ended up paying a deposit of £37.40 and agreeing to pay 11 instalments of
£43.69  a total of £517.99.
So she wouldve been better off agreeing to pay Brightside about £42.00 per month 
with no further deposit. I was minded that  by turning that down and instead 
agreeing to pay a total of £517.99, Miss L had failed to mitigate her loss.
For that reason, I was minded to find it fair to direct compensation for her financial 
loss by reference not to the figure of £517.99 but by reference to the figure of 
£465.00 as follows:
£465.00
Less £386.47
sub-total  £ 78.53
less  £   9.50
balance  £ 69.03
I was minded to direct Brightside to pay interest at our usual rate on the amount of 
£69.03 from 16 August 2021 (the date of her first instalment payment under the new 
policy).
From the call recording and emails, I found that the unfair cancellation caused Miss L 
distress when she found out the cancellation had gone ahead and inconvenience in 
calling Brightside and making alternative arrangements. I was minded that £100.00 
was fair and reasonable compensation for this.
Subject to any further information from Miss L or from Brightside, my provisional decision 
was that I upheld this complaint in part. I intended to direct Brightside Insurance Services 
Limited to pay Miss L:
1. £69.03 compensation for financial loss;
2. simple interest at a yearly rate of 8% on the amount of £69.03 from 16 August 
2021 to the date of payment. If Brightside considers that its required by HM 
Revenue & Customs to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Miss L 
how much its taken off. It should also give Miss L a certificate showing this if she 
asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if 
appropriate; and
3. £100.00 for distress and inconvenience.
Miss L accepts the provisional decision.
Brightside has acknowledged but not responded to the provisional decision.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Brightsides policy documents for Miss L showed cover for social, domestic and pleasure
and commuting, with protected no-claims bonus, an estimated 5,000 miles per year and with
an excess of £150.00. That was at a total cost including interest of £386.47 (or about £1.05
per day). That is the position Miss L shouldve been in for the policy year.
Brightside has accepted responsibility for incorrectly cancelling that policy.
The position Miss L is in is that she took out a new policy. Im satisfied that it is a like-for-like
replacement for her Brightside policy. That is at a total cost including interest of £517.99.
So I can see why Miss L believed Brightside should compensate her for a financial loss of
the difference between £386.47 and £517.99, that is £131.52.
Brightsides final response didnt put Miss L back into the position she shouldve been in. It
removed a fee for a cancellation that shouldnt have happened. And it gave her the benefit of
free insurance for the nine days from 5 to 14 July, which was worth about £9.50 on a pro-
rata basis.
So Ive thought about directing Brightside to pay Miss L compensation for financial loss as
follows:
£517.99
less £386.47
sub-total £131.52
less £    9.50
balance £122.02
However, Ive listened to the recording of Miss Ls call to Brightside on 15 July. Brightside
said the insurer couldnt reinstate the policy and a new policy would cost about £42.00 per
month. Miss L identified that as an increase of about £10.00 for each of the eleven
instalments  or about £110.00 in total. And while Brightside described it as a zero deposit
policy, Miss L rightly pointed out that shed already paid a deposit for a policy she no longer
had. Understandably she wasnt keen to agree to pay higher instalments.
Miss L had said she needed her car insured before she drove home. Matters were left on the
basis that Brightside would ask the insurer if it would price match to the initial policy  and in
any event Brightside would ring Miss L back in the late afternoon.
Ive also listened to a call recording of Brightsides call at around 17:00 on 15 July.
Unfortunately, Miss L didnt answer. Brightside left a voicemail saying that it hadnt heard
from the insurer so the only option was the quote Brightside had given earlier (£42.00 per
month). As Brightside is a broker, I find it likely that it had quoted for a like-for-like policy.
So Miss L couldve had a new policy without paying another deposit, for about £42.00 per
month. In its submission to us, Brightside said the total of the instalments wouldve been
£465.00.
I can understand that Miss L was under pressure of time. But her policy documents arent
dated  as I wouldve expected - 15 July. They say that cover started at 04:07 on 16 July.
And Miss L ended up paying a deposit of £37.40 and agreeing to pay 11 instalments of
£43.69  a total of £517.99.So she wouldve been better off agreeing to pay Brightside about £42.00 per month with no
further deposit. I consider that  by turning that down and instead agreeing to pay a total of
£517.99, Miss L had failed to mitigate her loss. 
Putting things right
For that reason, I find it fair to direct compensation for her financial loss by reference not to 
the figure of £517.99 but by reference to the figure of £465.00 as follows:
£465.00
Less  £386.47
sub-total  £  78.53
less  £    9.50
balance  £  69.03
Ive thought about whats fair for interest. I will  direct Brightside to pay interest at our usual 
rate on the amount of £69.03 from 16 August 2021 (the date of her first instalment payment 
under the new policy).
From the call recording and emails, I find that the unfair cancellation caused Miss L distress
when she found out that the cancellation had gone ahead and inconvenience in calling 
Brightside and in making alternative arrangements. I conclude that £100.00 is fair and 
reasonable compensation for this. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Brightside Insurance Services Limited to pay Miss L:
1. £69.03 compensation for financial loss;
2. simple interest at a yearly rate of 8% on the amount of £69.03 from 16 August 2021 
to the date of payment. If Brightside considers that its required by HM Revenue & 
Customs to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Miss L how much its 
taken off. It should also give Miss L a certificate showing this if she asks for one, so 
she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate; and
3. £100.00 for distress and inconvenience.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 January 2022.
