The complaint
Mrs T complains that Scottish Widows Limited (Scottish Widows) failed to provide the call 
transcripts she requested.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the Investigator for these reasons:
Scottish Widows has accepted our Investigators recommendation that it should 
provide Mrs T with the transcripts requested. But Mrs T is only happy to accept this 
as resolution for her complaint once the transcripts are already received, so has 
asked for a final decision to be issued on the matter.
Scottish Widows has also already paid Â£300 for the delays in sending the transcripts, 
which I believe is fair recognition of the upset and inconvenience the matter has 
caused.
I also agree that a reasonable and simple resolution for the complaint is for the call 
transcripts to be issued to Mrs T. There appears to be no objections to this on either 
side.
For these reasons, my decision is to uphold Mrs Ts complaint.
Putting things right
To put things right, Scottish Widows Limited should:
Send the requested call transcripts to Mrs T, and confirm Mrs Ts receipt of them
My final decision
My final decision is that this complaint should be upheld.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 September 2022.
