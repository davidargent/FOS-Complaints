K821x#15complaint
Mr M says CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid lent to him irresponsibly. He said he 
needed to keep taking loans to cover previous loan repayments. This led to him having 
financial problems. 
background
This complaint is about ten payday  loans and one running credit  account (flex credit)  
QuickQuid provided  to Mr M between February 2014 and January 2017.  A summary of the 
lending is in a table at the end of this decision. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She thought that Mr M should receive 
compensation for part of loan 1 and all of loans 6 to 11. Mr M agreed with what  the 
adjudicator said.  
QuickQuid agreed with our adjudicator about  loan 1 and it made an offer to refund the 
interest and charges from 31 March 2014 onwards in the flex credit  account. But it didnt 
agree to pay compensation for loans 6 to 11. Mr M didnt accept QuickQuids offer.  He still 
felt that he should be paid compensation for loans 6 to 11. 
So as no agreements has been  reached the complaint has been passed  to me  an 
ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Ms case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and Ive explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ms income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  indicate  that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done  more 
to establish that any lending  was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number or higher  frequency  of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer and business have a lending  relationship  
is long
Ref: DRN65723692There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Ms complaint.  These questions are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr M would be able to repay  in a sustainable way?  If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr M would  have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Ms indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Ms complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr M would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would those  checks have 
shown that Mr M would have been able to do so?
QuickQuid has accepted our adjudicators opinion to uphold loan 1. And Mr M has accepted 
our adjudicators opinion about loans 2 to 5. Because of this I dont think there is any 
ongoing disagreement about loans  1 to 5. So I wont be making a decision  about this 
lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr M had with QuickQuid. So they 
are something I will take into account when  considering the other loans he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 11 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ms indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise 
harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which QuickQuid should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid shouldve realised that it shouldnt have provided any 
further lending.  Given the particular circumstances  of Mr Ms case, I think that this point was 
reached by loan 6. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr M was borrowing were generally  increasing from loan 6 onwards. 
Mr M borrowed Â£600 in total for loan 6, this is double the amount that he took for loan 
1. 
Whilst I can see there were some smaller loans towards the end of the lending Mr M 
had been borrowing  from QuickQuid for over two years by this time. 
So because of these  two factors QuickQuid ought to have realised  it was likely his 
indebtedness was increasing, or had increased, unsustainably
I can see there were some breaks in the lending. But, other than between loans 1 
and 2, I dont think  these breaks were long enough for QuickQuid to have assumed 
that Mr Ms situation  mayve improved.  So I dont think  Mr M was really  reducing the 
amount he owed QuickQuid. He was in effect paying  large amounts of interest  to 
service this debt over an extended period
Ref: DRN65723693I think that Mr M has lost out because  QuickQuid continued to approve loans from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans (loans  and deferrals) was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding  Mr Ms complaint about loans 6 to 11 because  the overall pattern of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and hes 
lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr M in some 
other way.  
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
pay the compensation it has offered  on loan 1. For clarity this was to refund the 
interest and charges  Mr M paid on any drawdowns  made after 31 March 2014
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  6 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about the drawdowns from loan 1 from 
13 March 2014 from Mr Ms credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 means  any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 6 to 11 should be removed from Mr Ms credit file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ms complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 July 2019.
