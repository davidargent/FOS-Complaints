K821x#15complaint
Mr T complains that Uncle Buck Finance LLP was irresponsible to lend to him. He asks that 
it admits this and compensates him.
background
Mr T took out seven  loans  with Uncle Buck between January 2015 and January 2016 as 
follows:
loan 1 for £400 taken out on 26 January 2015,  repaid on 20 February 2015;
loan 2 for £675 taken out on 25 February 2015,  repaid  on 20 March  2015;
loan 3 for £675 taken out on 27 March  2015, repaid on 20 April 2015;
loan 4 for £675 taken out on 28 April 2015, repaid on 20 May 2015; 
loan 5 for £350 taken out on 30 May 2015, repaid on 20 June 2015;
loan 6 for £600 taken out on 9 July 2015, to be repaid by three instalments of £266,  
repaid on 5 August 2015; and 
loan 7 for £1,000 taken out on 10 January  2016, to be repaid by three instalments of up 
to £438.84, repaid  on 20 January  2016.
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld.  She said while Uncle  
Buck made adequate checks before offering loan 1 and loan 7, it should  have made  further 
checks before the other loans. Uncle Buck offered to refund interest and charges on loans 4 
and 5. The investigator said if Uncle Buck had made proper checks, it would have known 
that loans 2, 3 and 6 were unaffordable.  The investigator said Uncle  Buck should refund 
interest and charges on these loans and remove adverse  information  about them from 
Mr Ts credit file.
Uncle Buck  didnt agree. It said the income and expenditure information Mr T provided 
suggested the loans were  affordable  and it did credit checks which  didnt suggest any 
problems. It said Mr T provided his bank statements when he raised  his complaint and these 
dont evidence the loans being unaffordable.  Uncle Buck said Mr T used  short term loans as 
a lifestyle choice, not because he was reliant  on them. 
my provisional decision
I didnt agree with all of the investigators recommendations. So I sent a provisional  decision 
to the parties  to explain why. In summary, I thought Uncle Buck should have made further  
checks before offering  loans 2 to 7 and that, if it had, it would have known they werent  
affordable. Mr T agreed and didnt have further  comments. Uncle Buck  didnt agree. It 
provided detailed  comments. Ive addressed its comments and, where  appropriate, changed 
or expanded  my findings from those set out in my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
Ref: DRN35257272loan 1 (January  2015)
When Mr T applied for loan 1 he told Uncle Buck his monthly income was £2,500 and his 
monthly expenditure was £1,450, which included £300 for credit commitments.  I think, given 
this was Mr Ts first loan,  these  checks  were  proportionate. The information  Uncle  Buck 
received suggested  the loan was affordable.
loans 2 and 3 (February and March 2015)
Mr T applied  for loan 2 a few days after repaying  loan 1. He told Uncle Buck his monthly 
income was £2,500. Mr T told Uncle Buck his monthly expenditure was £1,550, which  
included utilities (£100),  transport (£100), food (£100), mortgage  and fixed loans (£800), 
store/credit cards (£300) and other (£100).
After meeting his stated  expenditure,  Mr T was left with £950 to meet  the repayment of £805 
for loan 2. Mr T gave  Uncle Buck similar  information about his income  and expenditure when 
he applied  for loan 3, with an increase in some items of expenditure which  meant it added up 
to £1,610. This left him with £890  to meet  the repayment for loan 2 of £810. 
Uncle Buck  says Mr T was left with £146  after meeting the repayment for loan 2, which it 
says is enough  for any unexpected expenses. Uncle Buck says it did a credit check  and this 
didnt show any defaults or county court  judgements.  It says the credit  check suggested 
Mr Ts only short term commitment was his previous loan from Uncle  Buck and he didnt 
have any late or rolled over payments. 
But Id said in my provisional decision that the credit  check showed Mr T had credit 
commitments of about £26,000  in addition to his mortgage.  This included about £13,000 of 
revolving credit and about £12,500 of other loans. Uncle Buck  says it was entitled to rely on 
the information provided by Mr T and its credit  check. I think it should  have considered  
whether the indebtedness  in the credit check was consistent with Mr Ts stated  monthly 
expenditure on credit commitments.  
Uncle Buck  says Mr Ts mortgage was in joint names. And the majority of his unsecured 
indebtedness is a joint loan. I agree that its possible the monthly  cost of the mortgage and 
loan was shared.  But, so far as I can tell, Uncle Buck didnt ask Mr T this or ask about  
household income, so it cant have known whether this was the case. 
While lenders are, generally, entitled  to assume  information provided by a customer is 
correct, I dont think its reasonable  for Uncle Buck to rely on information when theres an 
unexplained inconsistency.  If Uncle Buck  had reason to doubt the information it received  
as is the case here  it should ask for further information,  an explanation or evidence  to 
support what the customer says.  
 
When Mr T applied for loans 2 and 3 he asked for £1,000. In both cases, he applied only a 
few days after repaying the previous loan. I think this, the indebtedness shown in the credit  
check and the amount  of loans 2 and 3 should  have prompted  Uncle  Buck to make more  
checks. I think Uncle Buck should  have considered whether Mr Ts stated  expenditure on his 
credit commitments  was consistent  with its credit check. I think it should have asked for 
more information  about Mr Ts credit  commitments, including  any short term commitments.  
Mr Ts bank  statements show monthly  mortgage payments of £809.  He made payments to 
credit card accounts of £470 (February 2015), £290  (March 2015) and £350 (April 2015). He 
Ref: DRN35257273made monthly payments for what appear  to be personal loans or loans  from instalment  
lenders totalling  about £849 (February 2015), £817  (March 2015) and £797 (April 2015). 
I think Mr T had regular  monthly credit commitments of about  £1,900.  After  meeting his 
regular credit commitments and living expenses he wouldnt have enough income  left to 
meet the repayments for loans 2 and 3. 
Mr T also had short  term commitments: he made payments to short  term lenders of £1,200  
(February 2015), £1,300  (March 2015) and £1,890 (April 2015) in addition  to the payments 
he made to Uncle  Buck.  
Uncle Buck  says it cant take into account  information it doesnt have. It says it doesnt have 
to obtain bank statements. And it says its credit check  didnt show excessive short  term 
commitments. I agree. But I think the information  it had should have alerted it to the need for 
more checks  in particular relating to Mr Ts indebtedness and the monthly cost of his credit 
commitments. It didnt have to get bank statements to do this, but I havent  seen  evidence  
that it did this in another way. 
Uncle Buck  says it would  cause offense  if it asked customers whether they were borrowing 
to fund their gambling.  I havent said that it should  have asked Mr T this.  
Uncle Buck  also says it could only obtain  bank statements issued  prior to lending. But Mr Ts 
bank statements for January 2015  show a similar  picture of Mr Ts monthly  credit  payments. 
He made  payments for personal loans of more  than £1,000. He took out a loan from an 
instalment lender of £5,500. He received loans from short term lenders of about  £1,900  and 
made payments to short term lenders  of nearly £3,000.  
Mr T also provided copies of his bank  statements  to Uncle Buck.  It made a number of 
comments on the bank  statements,  some of which refer to Mr Ts income later in the year. I 
said in my provisional decision that I didnt think Mr Ts income  in mid-2015 was relevant to 
loans 2 and 3  and Uncle Buck has said it agrees. Uncle  Bucks  comments  havent  
persuaded me that loans  2 and 3 were affordable.  
loans 4 and 5 (April and May 2015)
Uncle Buck  offered to refund interest  and charges on loans 4 and 5 before the complaint 
was brought to us, saying some  of your loans  were funded within quick succession of each 
other. I consider we ought to have  been aware  that you were becoming reliant on our loans, 
as a result  of this. I wont comment further  on these loans.
loan 6 (July 2015)
Mr T took out loan 6, of £600, in July 2015 less than three weeks  after hed repaid loan 5. 
Loan 6 was to be repaid by three instalments of £266. This was Mr Ts sixth loan without a 
significant break in borrowing.  I think his pattern of borrowing should have alerted Uncle 
Buck to a possible problem, such as dependency  on short  term loans. I think Uncle  Buck 
should have asked for information to gain a full understanding of Mr Ts financial 
circumstances. While  there are different ways of doing this, one is to look at his bank 
statements. 
Uncle Buck  says it spoke  to Mr T before loan 6 and went through his income  and 
expenditure. It says Mr T must have given  inaccurate information. It says if its required to 
Ref: DRN35257274use bank statements for evidence, then it should be entitled to rely on income which  Mr T 
stated during the discussion. But, for the reasons Ive already given, Uncle  Buck needed to 
ask for information to get a full understanding of Mr Ts circumstances. Im not persuaded by 
the evidence it provided that its discussion with Mr T achieved this. 
Mr Ts monthly  income  varied: £3,020 (May 2015),  £3,150 (June 2015), £3,280  (July 2015)  
and £3,170 (August 2015). He received an additional payment of £640 from his employer in 
July. Im not sure what this was for, but it wasnt a regular payment. Uncle Buck  agreed  that 
this doesnt suggest Mr T had regular monthly income of £3,926. Nor do I think its 
reasonable to include  in Mr Ts income amounts paid into his account in cash or from Mr Ts 
other accounts unless  the evidence suggests  these  payments are regular  income. 
Uncle Buck  says Mr T made monthly  credit  payments of about £2,400. I think  its about  
£3,000. Mr Ts bank statements show monthly mortgage payments  of £809. He made  
monthly payments  to loan accounts  and instalment  lenders  of about £680. He made  
payments to credit card accounts  of £1,000  in June 2015. During June  2015,  Mr T received 
about £1,300 from short term lenders. He made payments to short term lenders of £600 
(June 2015) and £1,730  (July 2015) (not including payments to Uncle Buck). 
Mr T would also have  had to meet his living expenses. I dont think  further borrowing was 
affordable or sustainable. 
Uncle Buck  says its not fair to say that it should take account of all the costs  of Mr Ts 
lifestyle, including loans,  leisure and other activities, but not additional income unless its 
regular. But I dont  see how Uncle Buck could fairly assess affordability on another  basis. 
Ive said more about this below. 
loan 7 (January  2016)
Mr T took out loan 7, of £1,000, in January 2016. Loan 7 was to be repaid over three 
instalments, the largest being about £440.  Mr T had repaid loan 6 in August 2015.  Given 
Mr Ts previous pattern of borrowing, I dont consider the five months break  in borrowing to 
be enough for Uncle Buck to disregard his borrowing  history. Given this, and the amount  of 
the loan, I think  Uncle  Buck  should  have asked for information to gain a full understanding  of 
Mr Ts financial circumstances. 
Mr Ts monthly  income  was £2,800  in December 2015 and January 2016.  
Mr T had monthly mortgage  payments of £809, although his January payment was made  
late after the end of the month. He also made monthly payments of £245 to an instalment 
lender  again the January payment was made late. Mr T made payments to credit card 
accounts of £475 (December  2015) and £650 (January 2016). Uncle  Buck has noted  that it 
appears Mr T also missed or was late with another loan repayment.  
During December  2015,  Mr T received about  £2,100  from short term lenders. He borrowed 
another £2,700 from short  term lenders in early January 2016,  before taking out loan 7. Mr T 
made payments to short term lenders  of £717  (December 2015), £4,300 (January 2016) and 
£2,280 (February  2016) (not including  payments  to Uncle Buck).  
Mr T would also have  had to meet his living expenses. I dont think  further borrowing was 
affordable or sustainable. 
Ref: DRN35257275Uncle Buck  says it couldnt  have known when it offered  Mr T loan 7 that he would pay 
£4,300 to short term lenders. It says it couldnt have known what  would  happen in 
February 2016, after the loan was taken out. So it was entitled to rely on the information 
provided by Mr T and the credit check.  Im not persuaded by this. If Uncle  Buck had made 
proportionate checks, it would have  known that Mr T took out short term loans of about 
£2,100 in December 2015 and another £2,700 in early January 2016, before taking out loan 
7. Mr T would have owed interest on these loans. I think Uncle  Buck would have had a clear 
indication of the likely cost of repaying  these loans and that further borrowing wasnt  
affordable or sustainable.
other comments from Uncle  Buck
Uncle Buck  says while Mr T used short term loans  his bank statements suggest they were 
repaid when due. It says Mr T derived a monetary benefit from the loans which  augmented 
his income. It says Mr T used short  term lending  as a lifestyle choice. It says his bank  
statements evidence payments to a number  of betting and gambling institutions and Mr T 
could have chosen to prioritise debt repayments instead.
I agree  that Mr Ts bank statements show evidence of gambling  throughout the period he 
borrowed from Uncle Buck. I think he was borrowing to fund a gambling problem  and to 
repay the resulting debts. I dont think its reasonable to say this is a lifestyle choice and Mr T 
could have chosen to prioritise debt repayments instead. 
Uncle Buck  doesnt  agree  that all of Mr Ts expenditure should be taken into account.  It says 
if it werent for gambling and the funding and repayment of loans Mr T wouldnt be in 
financial difficulty. And it considers some of Mr Ts spending to be discretionary.  It says it 
cant know that someone is gambling. But I think  if Uncle Buck  had carried  out proportionate  
checks, it would have known about  Mr Ts use of short term loans  (and other indebtedness) 
and that further  borrowing wasnt affordable or sustainable.
Uncle Buck  says Mr Ts bank statements show transfers between accounts  and cash  
deposits. Uncle Buck says it isnt fair to say it has to take all expenditure into account but not 
these credits when assessing  Mr Ts income.  But I dont think its reasonable to treat these 
credits as income without  knowing  where they come  from  that they are genuine income 
and not loan deposits.
I think its likely these transfers  and cash transactions are related  to Mr Ts gambling  and 
loans. Mr T may, at times, have won when gambling, although  some  or all of the deposits 
could be loan proceeds. But I dont  think its reasonable  to rely on possible gambling wins 
when assessing  whether  borrowing is affordable and can be repaid in a sustainable  way. 
Uncle Buck  says loans  were repaid  on time or early. I dont agree that this proves the loans 
were affordable. While  Mr T repaid short term loans he also took out new loans each month. 
Mr Ts pattern of borrowing suggests he was repaying debts by taking  out new loans. This 
isnt a sustainable way to meet debt repayments. 
Having considered Uncle Bucks comments, I dont think Uncle Buck should have offered 
loans 2 to 7 to Mr T. So it should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr T paid on loans 2 to 7;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
Ref: DRN35257276Remove any negative  information about loans 2 to 7 from Mr Ts credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order Uncle  Buck Finance LLP to amend Mr Ts 
credit file and pay the compensation as described  above.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 March  2019.
