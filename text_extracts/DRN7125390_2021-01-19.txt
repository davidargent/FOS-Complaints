K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement with 
Clydesdale Financial Services Limited,  trading as Barclays Partner Finance, wasnt  of 
satisfactory quality.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr H under  a conditional sale agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance  in August  2018;
Barclays Partner Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring 
that it was of satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory 
quality will depend on a number  of factors, including the age and mileage of the car 
and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr H was about four years old, had been  driven  for 
97,000 miles and had a price  of Â£12,939;
Mr H complained to Barclays Partner Finance in November 2018 about  some issues 
with the car and it asked him to provide a diagnostic report  about those issues;
Mr H took the car to a garage for a diagnostic  test in December 2018, when its 
mileage was recorded as 100,253,  and it was found that the valve  cover gasket and 
cylinder head were  leaking  oil and that there  was low pressure on three  cylinders and 
a gearbox fault  and it was recommended that the oil leaks  and pressure  loss be 
rectified and that the software be updated for the gearbox fault;
Barclays Partner Finance asked  Mr H to arrange  for the car to be inspected  by an 
independent expert  to confirm whether or not those faults would have been present 
when the car was supplied to him  but he didnt  so and says that the car has since  
been stolen so cant be inspected;
he says that the dealer has been given many opportunities to fix the problems with 
the car but Ive not seen  evidence  about  any response by the dealer to any issues 
with the car and the first evidence  that Ive seen about these issues  is his complaint 
to Barclays Partner  Finance in November 2018 when he said that the car was 
consuming more fuel than expected and that the dealer wasnt helpful at all;
this service cant consider a complaint  by Mr H about the dealers response to his 
issues with the car and, although  there has been some information  provided about 
Mr H using the car as a taxi, I havent made any findings on that issue; 
the diagnostic  report identified some faults with the car but, as I would  expect to be 
the case for such a report, it didnt explain the cause of those faults or say whether or 
not they would have  been present when the car was supplied to Mr H;
Ref: DRN71253902Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that those faults  were  
present when the car was supplied  to Mr H and he was able to use the car to drive  
more than 3,000 miles between August 2018, when it was supplied  to him, and 
December 2018, when the diagnostic  report was prepared;
I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to ask him to 
provide an independent report  about those faults  - but he initially refused to do so 
and then says that the car has been  stolen so cant be inspected;
I sympathise with Mr H for the issues that hes had with the car and for it being stolen 
 but Im not persuaded  that theres enough evidence in these circumstances  to 
show that the car wasnt of satisfactory  quality when  it was supplied to him; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays  Partner Finance 
to end the conditional sale agreement, to pay him any compensation  or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
If he hasnt already done so, I suggest  that Mr H contacts  Barclays Partner Finance about 
his conditional  sale agreement and the issues  arising from the theft of the car  and its 
required to respond  to any financial difficulties that hes experiencing positively and 
sympathetically.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 February  2021.
