The complaint
Mr W complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited delayed the payment of funds to his bank 
account.
What happened
Mr W had a merchant account with WorldPay (UK) Limited. In July 2021, Mr W took a 
payment of £10,000 through his merchant terminal. Mr W expected the money to be paid 
into his account by 5 July.
But WorldPay carried out a review of this payment  and didnt release the funds to Mr Ws 
account until 7 July. Mr W says that this meant he had insufficient funds in his bank account: 
some cheques bounced, causing him embarrassment and affecting his relationship with his 
main suppliers.
Dissatisfied, Mr W complained to WorldPay, and then referred the complaint to us.
Our investigator looked at the complaint but didnt think it should be upheld.
Mr W didnt agree.
The complaint has been referred to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Financial businesses like WorldPay are subject to a number of legal and regulatory 
requirements. These mean it needs to have processes in place to monitor transactions and 
may mean it needs to review payments at any time.
This is reflected in the terms and conditions and the operating instructions that applied to 
Mr Ws account. The terms and conditions allowed WorldPay to withhold or defer payments 
in certain circumstances. The operating instructions stated that WorldPay 
may withhold payments from your business while we complete our investigation into 
whether a genuine transaction has taken place that relates to goods and services 
provided by your business. We aim to complete investigations in a timely and 
efficient manner, but there is no set time for our investigation to be completed.
In Mr Ws case, WorldPay reviewed a payment Mr W took of £10,000. Based on what Ive 
seen, Im satisfied WorldPay was acting in line with its legal and regulatory requirements  
and the terms and conditions  when it reviewed the payment.
WorldPay then carried out its review. Id expect any review to be completed in a timely 
manner. In this case, WorldPay carried out its review on 5 July, which formally concluded on 
6 July. The payment was released on 7 July.
With all this in mind, I dont find WorldPay did something wrong here. Im satisfied that 
WorldPays terms and conditions allowed it to delay payments in these circumstances and 
the review appears to have been carried out quickly.
Mr W says this delay caused him and his business severe embarrassment. He says the 
delay meant he was unable to honour cheques to suppliers and that this made him look 
untrustworthy and unprofessional.
I dont doubt that what happened would have been embarrassing. But I cant hold WorldPay 
responsible if Mr W sent cheques before the settled funds were paid into his account. The 
agreement Mr W had with WorldPay meant it was always possible for payments to be 
delayed  in some cases without notice. And based on what Ive seen, Im not persuaded 
WorldPay should have completed its review or made the payment any sooner than it did. 
Ive considered Mr Ws further comments. Mr W says WorldPay needed to tell him when it 
delayed payments  and didnt. He also says he was given misleading information over the 
phone about when hed be paid. Ive carefully considered these points, but they dont change 
my conclusions. Mr W was aware he hadnt been paid these funds, and given what Ive said 
above Im not persuaded hed be in a substantially different position had WorldPay explained 
things better. I think its likely hed still have needed to explain to his suppliers why they 
wouldnt be paid. I also note that Mr W says that his bank agreed to waive the bank charges 
he incurred as a gesture of goodwill. 
For these reasons, I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint, and Im not going to tell WorldPay to do 
anything to put things right.
My final decision
I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 February 2023.
