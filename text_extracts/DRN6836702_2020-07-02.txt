K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains about the way PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA handled a complaint arising  
from his purchase of an item through eBay.  
background
Mr B has a PayPal account. He bought  a jumper costing  £15 through eBay. He paid the 
seller using PayPal.  When the jumper arrived, however, it was the wrong  size, so he decided 
to return it and seek a refund.
Ref: DRN68367022PayPal says it sent Mr B emails explaining what he needed to do to obtain a refund. Mr B 
says he didnt get those emails  and, when he tried to follow  up by phone, was unable  to 
contact PayPal. As a result, Mr B didnt follow the correct procedure  to obtain a refund, and 
none was provided.  He did however return the jumper to the seller.
Mr B complained that PayPal hadnt  provided  him with the information he needed  to get his 
money back. He had changed his email  address  and told PayPal that hed done so; PayPal 
should have used his new email address, but didnt. Hed been unable to contact  PayPal 
using its free phone  line and so had had to pay to use a different number.  Hed often been 
kept waiting for a long time and had been  promised  return calls which  hadnt  materialised.
Mr B said that his phone  bills connected with this matter were some  £76 and that he was 
therefore £99 out of pocket, once the cost of the jumper and postage  were  taken  into 
account. He wanted PayPal to cover his losses.
PayPal explained  that, although Mr B had changed  his email address on his account,  hed 
made this purchase  as a guest  that is, it hadnt  gone through  his account.  As a result, all 
email communication  regarding the transaction was made  using the email address  hed 
provided when  making  the purchase and the payment;  that was his old address.  PayPal  
didnt consider that it was responsible for the problems  Mr B had faced when trying to get in 
touch by phone or for the fact the he hadnt  followed the correct  procedure for returning  
items.
PayPal did, however, offer Mr B a £25 credit to resolve  his complaint. Mr B didnt think  that 
went far enough and referred his complaint to this service.
Initially, one of our investigators  considered the case. He thought  that PayPals offer was fair 
in the circumstances and didnt recommend that it do any more to resolve Mr Bs complaint.
Mr B didnt agree, however, and asked that an ombudsman consider the case. One of our 
ombudsmen did that and, because she reached  a different view from the investigator,  issued 
a provisional decision.  She thought that PayPal should have identified that emails about  the 
refund process  wouldnt reach Mr B and should  have alerted him to that. She recommended  
that PayPal make a payment of £150 to Mr B. This time, PayPal  didnt agree and asked that 
we consider the case again.
Because the original ombudsman had by this time left the ombudsman  service, Mr Bs case 
was passed to me to consider. I thought however  that the compensation she had 
recommended  of £150  was rather high given  the nature of the complaint and the amount 
at stake. I thought that PayPals offer of £25 was more reasonable and so indicated,  
provisionally, that I wasnt minded to require it to be increased.
Mr B didnt accept my conclusions, and so Ive reviewed the case  again  as the final stage 
in our process.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I explained in my provisional decision,  the underlying cause of the issue  in this case  was 
that Mr B changed his email address and didnt therefore receive email instructions about  
returning the item to the seller. I accept that he told PayPal about the change; I also accept 
Ref: DRN68367023though that PayPal only applied that change to his account, but not to this purchase, which  
hed made  using the guest facility. That was unfortunate, but I didnt consider that to be the 
fault of either PayPal  or Mr B. 
I noted too that PayPal hadnt provided recordings of its telephone  contact with Mr B, citing  
data protection  concerns  even  though  Mr B had provided his consent to data sharing. I 
therefore accepted that Mr Bs account  of those conversations  was broadly accurate. 
Im required  by law and by our rules to determine Mr Bs complaint by reference to what I 
consider to be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. In my view,  those circumstances  
must include the fact that the underlying purchase  which gave rise to Mr Bs complaint was 
of an item costing £15. I remain  of the view that to award him £150 to resolve this dispute  
would be disproportionate. I acknowledge that PayPal could have done more  when Mr B got 
in touch, but I havent changed my view from that set out in my provisional decision;  I believe  
that PayPals  offer of £25 is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to do anything  further  
to resolve Mr Bs complaint. Under  the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im 
required to ask Mr B to accept or reject my decision before 2 August 2020.
