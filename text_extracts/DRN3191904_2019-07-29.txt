K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr C took loans from QuickQuid between August 2017 and October  2018.  I have noted that 
around the time Mr C was due to repay loan 3 he took some additional borrowing and 
changed the repayment date. I intend to treat that additional borrowing as refinancing  the 
original loan, and so class it as a new loan. So Mr C took a total of six loans over the time he 
was borrowing from QuickQuid, and additionally topped up two of the loans by taking 
additional borrowing  on six further occasions.  All of Mr Cs loans  have been  successfully 
repaid and a summary of his borrowing from QuickQuid is as follows;

Mr Cs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think QuickQuid 
had been wrong  to give Mr C the first three loans. But he didnt  think  any of the subsequent 
loans should have been agreed. So he asked  QuickQuid  to pay Mr C some compensation.
QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mr C accepts  my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN31919042QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr C could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
The repayments on Mr Cs first three loans were  relatively modest compared to the income 
that he declared to QuickQuid. I have noted that Mr C was around six weeks late repaying 
his first loan.  I think that should have caused  some concerns to QuickQuid. But on balance  
I dont think that alone  was enough  to suggest to QuickQuid that Mr C couldnt sustainably 
afford its loans.  So given Mr Cs repayment amounts, what  was apparent  about  his 
circumstances at the time, and his history with the lender, I dont think  it wouldve been  
proportionate for QuickQuid to ask him for the amount of information  that would be needed 
to show the lending was unsustainable.   
Ref: DRN31919043And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr C provided or the information  QuickQuid 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying.  So I dont  think QuickQuid was wrong to give these  three loans to Mr C.
Apart from the first loan,  QuickQuid structured each of Mr Cs loans so that he wouldnt 
repay the capital  hed borrowed  until around three months later. In the first two months hed 
just need to pay some interest to QuickQuid. Ive taken this payment structure into account 
when considering the loans that QuickQuid gave  to Mr C.
Mr C successfully paid the first two interest only repayments on loan 3. But shortly before  he 
was due to make the final, larger, repayment he asked QuickQuid to refinance his loan. So 
QuickQuid lent him some  additional  funds and offered a new repayment  schedule meaning 
he wouldnt  need to repay both the original capital and his new borrowing for a further  two 
months.
The amount  Mr C needed to repay on his final instalment was just over £374. But Mr C had 
told QuickQuid that he only had £354  left over each month to repay his loans. QuickQuid has 
said that Mr C couldve  saved some disposable  income in the first two months  to put towards 
his final repayment.  So it is effectively saying that I should consider  the average  repayment 
Mr C needed to make each month on his loan.
But I dont agree that would be a reasonable assumption at this stage. By now Mr C had 
been borrowing  almost  constantly from QuickQuid for six months. Over that time he had 
been late making his repayment on loan 1. And hed been  unable to meet  his agreed  
repayment on loan 3. I think that should  have indicated that Mr Cs finances were  most likely 
under some pressure and it was unlikely that hed be in a position  to save to make the final 
repayment on this loan. So I dont think QuickQuid should have given loan 4 to Mr C.
Mr C repaid loan 4 as planned. And there was then a gap of almost  three  months before he 
asked to borrow again. Whilst this might  have allayed some concerns that QuickQuid might 
have had about Mr C being dependent on its lending I dont think the gap was long enough  
to allay all of them. So although  I still think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to base  its 
affordability assessment  on information that Mr C provided, I think it should have asked him 
some very specific questions about  any other  short term loans that he was already 
committed to repaying.
Had it asked Mr C for more details of his other  short term borrowing  at the time it agreed 
loan 5 I think QuickQuid  would have seen the real difficulties that Mr C was facing in 
managing his money. At the time Mr C asked for loan 5 he already owed money to a number 
of other  short term lenders  loans that he would need to repay  at the same time as his new 
borrowing from QuickQuid. I think the poor nature of Mr Cs finances should have been  a 
clear indicator that it was unlikely he could afford to repay any new borrowing in a 
sustainable manner.  So I dont think QuickQuid should have given this loan to Mr C either.
Mr C asked QuickQuid to lend him additional  capital on this loan on three occasions over the 
following month. Looking  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr C 
I think by this point  the lender should reasonably  have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt 
provide any further  loans.  
I say this because:
Ref: DRN31919044By the time Mr C first asked to top up his fifth loan hed been borrowing from 
QuickQuid for a lengthy period and he wasnt making any inroads to the amount he 
owed the lender.  By then Mr C had paid a considerable  amount of interest to 
QuickQuid to effectively service a debt over an extended period.
Shortly after repaying loan 5 Mr C asked to borrow again. And he topped up that loan 
on three separate occasions in the space of little more than a week. So QuickQuid 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr C was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that 
Mr Cs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
I think that Mr C lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from the top ups 
to loan 5 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and top ups was likely to have had negative  implications 
on Mr Cs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So overall I dont  think QuickQuid should have  agreed to lend to Mr C from loan 4 onwards.  
QuickQuid needs  to pay Mr C some compensation.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Mr C after,  and including,  the loan that 
he took on 19 February 2018 (loan 4). So for each of those loans QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Cs credit file in relation to loan 4.
The number of loans  taken from loan 5 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  5 and 6 should be removed  from Mr Cs 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN31919045my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold some of Mr Cs complaint and direct CashEuroNet UK LLC 
to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 August 2019.
