The complaint
Mr H, a director of a Ltd company, which Ill refer to as company A, complains about 
National Westminster Bank Plcs (NatWest) repeated requests for information in relation to 
company A. Mr H has also complained that company A hasnt been receiving account 
statements.
What happened
The circumstances surrounding this complaint and my initial findings were set out in my 
provisional decision which said:
Mr H is the director of company A, incorporated in 2017. Mr H explained that since 2019 
NatWest has kept requesting information from him, about company A, even though he 
says hes provided it on at least three previous occasions. Mr H says that hes spent a lot 
of time going back and forth with NatWest over the phone and waiting for their 
responses, which has affected his business. Mr H says that NatWest will suspend his 
account if he doesnt provide the information.
In August 2020 Mr H raised a complaint with NatWest about their repeated requests 
for information. He raised another complaint in October 2020 about the same issues.
In September 2020 NatWest sent their final response (FRL) to the first complaint, and in 
October 2020 they sent their FRL for the second complaint. NatWest upheld the 
complaint for the poor service Mr H received. They paid £150 in compensation for the 
costs and inconvenience caused. However, in each FRL NatWest reiterated their 
requirement that Mr H send in to them certain information regarding company A.
Mr H wasnt happy with NatWests response and felt that they shouldnt be requesting 
the information from him as hed previously sent it in to them.
On 24 September 2020 Mr H brought company As complaint to us here. One of our 
investigators looked in to the complaint and didnt feel that NatWest needed to do 
anything further, so the investigator didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr H said the investigator hadnt considered the impact the situation has had on company 
A or addressed all of his complaint points, so he asked that the complaint be referred to 
an ombudsman for a final decision.
In June 2021 I issued a provisional decision in which I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
From the information provided its clear to me that NatWest had made a number of 
requests of Mr H for information relating to company A. Its also fair to say that Mr H had 
received conflicting information from NatWest in relation to whether the information was 
still needed. This is apparent from what Mr H has said and has been confirmed by 
NatWest in their October 2020 FRL. NatWest acknowledged that errors were made and 
paid Mr H a total of £150 compensation.
So it seems to me that the key issues I need to consider are:
1. was it reasonable for NatWest to continue requesting information?
2. whats been the impact on company A from NatWests actions? and
3. have NatWest fairly compensated company A
Ill also deal with Mr Hs separate complaint about not receiving statements.
was it reasonable for NatWest to continue requesting the information?
NatWest have explained in their complaint summary to us that they require certain 
information about company A. They explained that this is a necessary part of their legal 
and regulatory obligations under the Know Your Business Checks (KYBC). Ive thought 
about this carefully, however, its not uncommon for a bank to have KYBC or a variation of 
it as part of their process and terms. So, although I dont think its unfair that NatWest 
would need the information that they requested; Ive thought about whether NatWest had 
treated company A fairly whilst meeting their legal and regulatory requirements.
I acknowledge that Mr H has said that the information has been sent to NatWest around 
three times previously. However, although NatWest hasnt denied this, theyve confirmed 
that they havent received it. I recognise theres a gap between what Mr H has said and 
what NatWest have stated, however as NatWest has maintained that theyve not received 
the information, I could see why they would continue to request it of company A.
NatWest has said it may restrict company As account if the information that its requested 
isnt provided; and have referred to their business terms (clause 5.3) which explains that in 
certain circumstances theyre able to do so. I recognise this will be concerning for Mr H, 
but as referred to earlier NatWest have legal and regulatory requirements which they must 
meet, and I think its fair that they explain to Mr H what the potential consequences to 
company A are, should the information theyve asked for not be received. So, in the 
circumstances Im persuaded that NatWest have acted fairly here.
Mr H has recently explained to our investigator that NatWest continues to request the 
information about company A. And I acknowledge Mr Hs strength of feeling about this. 
However, for the reasons explained above, I think NatWest have acted fairly by requesting 
this information. So, to resolve this matter I would suggest Mr H contact NatWest as a 
matter of urgency to arrange for the information requested by them to be provided.
the impact on company A, and have NatWest fairly compensated company A?
In the complaint Mr H has said that in order to resolve matters he would like to be fairly 
compensated. Mr H has said that hes lost business due to the time hes spent trying to 
sort things out with NatWest. In their FRL in September 2020, NatWest offered and 
compensated Mr H with £50 for costs and £100 for the inconvenience caused. I think the 
offer is fair in the circumstances. I say this because £50 seems a fair amount to 
compensate for what the phone costs may have been over a number of calls with 
NatWest. And I havent been provided with any further evidence to show the costs were 
more than this. And for overall inconvenience and receiving conflicting information from 
NatWest, I think £100 is also fair.
I appreciate its likely to be challenging for Mr H to prove loss of income and I recognise that there would have been a degree of inconvenience caused as he was trying to 
resolve matters with NatWest, but unfortunately, as Mr H hasnt been able to provide any 
further evidence regarding loss of business, overall, I think £150 compensation is 
reasonable.
account statements
Mr H has also explained that hes not been receiving account statements from NatWest. 
NatWest have recently confirmed to us, through their system records that since company 
As account was opened, theyve been sending out statements to the registered business 
address each month. NatWest have also provided screen-prints to verify when the 
statements have been issued. And the address they hold on their system is consistent 
with company As registered address.
I recognise that company As trading address is different to the registered address, and 
Im unable to determine which of these addresses are mostly used by Mr H. As NatWest 
have confirmed the statements have been issued to the registered address, should Mr H 
prefer to receive account statements to the trading address instead, I would suggest he 
speak to NatWest to arrange this.
Having considered this information, I dont think that NatWest has done anything wrong 
here. I dont doubt that Mr H hasnt been receiving the statements, however I think its 
more likely to be an unfortunate misunderstanding. Having considered all the information 
provided, Im satisfied that NatWest have sent statements out to the correct address and 
therefore havent done anything wrong in relation to this part of the complaint. As 
explained earlier Mr H may find it useful to speak with NatWest to make alternative 
arrangements regarding where the account statements are being sent. However, in the 
circumstances, I wont be asking NatWest to do anything more in relation to this.
I invited the parties to make any further comments.
NatWest responded to say they had nothing further to add. However, Mr H responded to say 
that he didnt accept it. Mr H made some further comments which Ill address below. 
Now both sides have had an opportunity to comment, I can go ahead with my final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Within his response Mr H explained that hed made further contact with NatWest to discuss 
the information they needed, however he remained disappointed by their handling of the 
matter. He also said that he felt the £150 compensation was insufficient for what hed been 
through.
The above is not exhaustive, but a summary of what I considered to be the main points 
raised in Mr Hs response to my provisional decision. To be clear, Ive considered all the 
information provided by both parties in relation to this complaint, however to maintain the 
informal approach of this service Ive focussed on what Ive considered to be the main issues 
here.
Ive carefully considered Mr Hs comments following my provisional decision. Having done 
so, I remain satisfied that NatWest have acted fairly in requesting certain information from 
company A, particularly as Im persuaded, they havent received it. In addition, for the reasons explained above I also think £150 compensation from NatWest is fair in the 
circumstances.
I acknowledge Mr Hs strength of feeling about this whole matter, in addition to the 
challenges he says he experienced while discussing the issue with NatWest. However, I still 
consider my provisional findings to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 
Neither party has added anything which gives me cause to change these. Therefore, for the 
reasons as set out above and in my provisional decision, my final decision is the same. 
My final decision
To settle the complaint National Westminster Bank Plc paid £100 compensation to company 
A and £50 to cover the cost of the phone calls Mr H has made. 
I think this is fair in all the circumstances. So, I wont be instructing National Westminster 
Bank Plc to do anything more.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 September 2021.
