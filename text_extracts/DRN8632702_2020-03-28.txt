Mr H says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 11 loans Sunny provided to Mr H between  October  2015  and 
September 2018. Mr Hs borrowing history  is as follows:
Loan Date  Taken Date  Repaid Instalments Amount Repayment
1 08/10/2015 29/01/2016 6 £500.00 £150.08
2 06/12/2015 29/01/2016 6 £200.00 £210.76
3 11/12/2017 28/02/2018 6 £250.00 £73.19
4 14/12/2017 31/01/2018 6 £100.00 £101.90
5 21/12/2017 28/02/2018 6 £100.00 £129.30
6 22/01/2018 28/02/2018 6 £50.00 £142.89
7 19/02/2018 28/02/2018 6 £50.00 £127.92
8 02/06/2018 31/08/2018 6 £300.00 £92.64
9 14/06/2018 31/08/2018 6 £200.00 £150.28
10 16/07/2018 31/08/2018 6 £150.00 £193.23
11 02/09/2018 12/12/2018 6 £500.00 £154.06
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint about loan 6 onwards  and thought these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed with this opinion but agreed to uphold Mr Hs 
complaint about  loan 11 only.  So, the complaint was passed to me to reach a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN86327022the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.  Our adjudicator  felt that loans 1  5 
shouldnt be upheld, and Mr H seems  to have accepted this opinion.  So as these loans are 
no longer in dispute, I havent considered these further in my decision. But I have looked at 
all of Mr Hs loans when reviewing his overall borrowing history with Sunny. 
Sunny has pointed out that there was a gap of around 22 months in between loans 2 and 3. 
Ive considered this gap and I think this is significant  enough to create a break in the lending  
chain. This means  that loans 1 and 2 form the first lending chain, and loans 3  11 form a 
second lending  chain. 
Sunny have said that it carried  out affordability  checks before lending  Mr H any of the loans. 
But from loan 6 onwards I wouldve expected a responsible lender to have carried out more  
substantial checks of Mr Hs circumstances. 
Mr H hasnt provided us with any bank statements or his credit file information from this time 
for me to consider.  So, I cant say that a full check of Mr Hs financial situation  at this point 
wouldve uncovered  anything of concern for Sunny.  However, when applying  for loan 6 I 
think Sunny  had enough information which indicates  Mr H wasnt coping  financially. I say this 
because at the time of applying for loan 6 Mr H already had loans  3, 4 and 5 outstanding,  
and all these three  loans were taking  out in quick succession  within days  of each other. 
This information was available  to Sunny at the time and is enough to suggest to a 
responsible lender that this is someone who isnt managing their finances well and is 
therefore unlikely  to be able to repay this loan or any subsequent loans. So, I am upholding 
loans 6 and 7 on this basis.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN86327023Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr H was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr H had taken out five loans within two months  and had been indebted 
to Sunny for the whole time.  So Sunny ought  to have  realised  it was more likely than 
not Mr H was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loans 
was leaving in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Mr Hs first loan in this chain was for was for £250 and loan 8 was for £300.  At this 
point Sunny ought to have known that Mr H was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need. 
While  I have seen that there  was a gap in the lending  between loans 7 and 8, I do not 
think this gap is significant and so I dont  think this breaks the chain of lending. And 
looking at the entire  lending  history, Mr H often took out a new loan while  still having 
loans outstanding. 
Mr H had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr H has lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Hs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 6 - 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 6 and 7 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  8, 9, 10 and 11 should be removed 
from Mr Hs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN86327024my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 April 2020.
