Mr K complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading  as 118 118 Money was irresponsible 
when it provided  him with two loans. 
background
Mr K took two loans  with 118 118 Money.  This table  includes some of the information 
provided to us by 118 118 Money about Mr Ks loans.

When Mr K complained to 118 118 Money, it didnt  agree that it had been  irresponsible.  So 
he brought his complaint to this Service. One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Ks 
complaint and recommended that it be upheld  and that 118 118 Money  put things right in 
respect of both loans.  It didnt agree,  although  recently it made an offer to Mr K to refund the 
interest hed repaid on Loan 2 only. He didnt accept the offer, and so the complaint has 
come to me  an ombudsman  for a final decision. If Mr K accepts my decision it will be 
binding on the parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
118 118 Money provided the loans in question while it was authorised and regulated  by the 
Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA).
The FCAs Principles for Business  set out the overarching requirements which all authorised  
firms are required to comply with. These  included  PRIN 2.1.1 R (6) which says: A firm must 
pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.
The Consumer Credit  sourcebook (CONC)  set out the rules  and guidance which  apply to 
credit providers like 118 118 Money when providing loans. CONC 5 sets out a firms  
obligations in relation  to responsible lending.  
Section 5.2.1R of CONC set out what a lender needed to do before agreeing to give a 
borrower a loan saying:
(1) Before making a regulated credit agreement the firm must undertake
an assessment of the creditworthiness of the customer.
And at Section  5.2.1(2) the lender  had to consider:
(a) the potential  for the commitments  under the regulated credit agreement  to 
adversely impact the customers  financial situation, taking into account  the 
Ref: DRN43528042information of which the firm is aware at the time the regulated credit agreement  is to 
be made; and
(b) the ability of the customer to make repayments as they fall due over the life of 
the regulated  credit  agreement, or for such an agreement which is an open-end 
agreement, to make repayments within a reasonable  period.
CONC also included guidance about proportionality of assessments. CONC 5.2.4G(2) 
saying:
A firm should consider  what  is appropriate  in any particular circumstances dependent  
on, for example, the type and amount of credit  being  sought  and the potential  risks to 
the customer. The risk of credit not being  sustainable directly  relates  to the amount  of 
credit granted and the total charge for credit  relative  to the customers  financial 
situation.
CONC 5.3 contained further  guidance on what a lender should bear in mind when thinking 
about affordability. CONC 5.3.1G(1) saying:
In making the creditworthiness assessment  or the assessment required by CONC 
5.2.2R (1), a firm should  take into account  more than assessing the customers ability 
to repay  the credit.
CONC 5.3.1G(2) then added:
The creditworthiness assessment and the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R (1) 
should include the firm taking reasonable steps  to assess the customers  ability to 
meet repayments under  a regulated credit  agreement  in a sustainable manner 
without the customer  incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant adverse  
consequences.
CONC 5.3.1G(6) clarified  what is meant  by sustainable:
 
For the purposes of CONC  sustainable means  the repayments under  the regulated 
credit agreement can be made by the customer:
(a) without undue  difficulties, in particular:
(i) the customer should be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; and
(ii) without having to borrow  to meet the repayments;
(b) over the life of the agreement, or for such an agreement which  is an open-end 
agreement, within  a reasonable period; and
(c)  out of income and savings without having to realise security or assets; and 
unsustainable has the opposite meaning.
CONC 5.3.1G (4) added that if a firm does take account of income and expenditure in its 
credit worthiness assessment:
Ref: DRN43528043(b) it is not generally sufficient for a firm to rely solely for its assessment of the  
customers income and expenditure on a statement of those matters  made  by the 
customer.
(c) its assessment should be based  on what  the firm knows at the time of the 
assessment
Whilst CONC sets out the regulatory framework that authorised consumer credit providers 
have to adhere to it represents a minimum standard for firms. And - as an ombudsman - Im 
also required  to take into account any other guidance, standards, relevant codes of practice, 
and, where appropriate, what I consider to have  been good  industry  practice.
Taking into account the relevant rules,  guidance,  good industry  practice and law, I think 
there are some overarching  questions  I need  to consider in order  to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of Mr Ks complaint: 
Did 118 118 Money complete  reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy 
itself that Mr K would  be able to repay  his loans in a sustainable way?  If so, did it 
make a fair lending  decision? If not, would those  checks  have shown that Mr K 
wouldve been able to do so?
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly  or unreasonably in some  other  way?
Ive outlined above some  of the regulations in place at the time 118 118 Money provided the 
loans to Mr K. And in summary,  it had to carry out reasonable and proportionate 
assessments of whether he could afford to repay them in a sustainable way. 
The checks  118 118 Money did, had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances  of the 
loans.  And  what is proportionate  will depend on a number  of factors  including  things like the 
consumers financial history and current situation as well as things such  as the amount, type, 
cost of the credit being sought.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have  
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income); 
the longer  the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit  is likely 
to be greater and the customer is required to make  payments for an extended period); 
Ive carefully considered  what a reasonable and proportionate check  shouldve  looked like 
when 118 118 Money was in the process  of approving the loans for Mr K. And I've thought 
carefully about what checks 118 118 Money  says it did and whether those were  
proportionate in the circumstances. It has provided details about both the loan applications.  
These include information about  what Mr K said about his income  and outgoings and the 
results of the credit reference agency  (CRA)  checks carried out by 118 118 Money. 
Additionally it carried  out welcome calls on both occasions to confirm the information 
Ref: DRN43528044provided by Mr K and discuss the loan being  offered. It has provided me with two recordings 
of calls which I've listened  to carefully.
For ease of reference I have rounded figures.
When Mr K applied  for Loan 1 he asked for £3,500  to be repaid over 12 months.  But he was 
approved for a lower amount (£2,750) over a 24 month term. Mr K said that the purpose  of 
the loan was to consolidate other  credit. He declared a monthly income of £3,054 and 
outgoings of around £1,768  leaving a disposable  income of about £1,286.
The CRA results in 118 118 Moneys possession said that he had an outstanding total credit  
balance of £14,852 from 14 active accounts. Of this balance  £8,201  was for loans and 
£6,651 was revolving credit which was 91% of his total credit  limits  on that type of account. 
Additionally Mr K had taken £13,570 by way of cash advances over the previous 12 months.  
Ive carefully considered  the details of the various credit accounts  appearing on 118 118 
Moneys CRA search.  And I've thought about  everything 118 118 Money  said in response  to 
our adjudicators assessment. It points out that of the 12 accounts opened recently, 7 were 
opened between  September  and November 2015  and 5 were opened between December 
2015 and February  2016. It says that this shows Mr K was borrowing less over the three  
months prior to taking Loan  1. 
Its true that the number of new loans  had reduced but this was in an overall picture of 
multiple loans and other credit  most of which was high cost and to which  Ill refer further  
below. In any event,  a borrower  taking five loans in three months is  in my experience  not 
an indicator of a positive  financial  situation.  And beyond  that there was so much more  in the 
CRA results that - taken together - indicated Mr K was in a very poor financial situation.
Mr K had a long history  of borrowing and repaying loans and a significant number of these 
had been taken in the 12 months before he took Loan 1. Many  of the loans were from high-
cost short-term credit providers and were  payday  loans. Additionally a number of loans 
were still outstanding on 1 March 2016. 
Ive mentioned above that Mr Ks outstanding balance on loans was over £8,200. As recently 
as February hed taken  two loans of £1,000 each.  Given that he told 118 118 Money that he 
was using the loan to consolidate debt, it wasnt going to cover anywhere  near his 
outstanding balances on loans. Ill refer to his high credit card balances later.
Ref: DRN43528045118 118 Money was aware that Mr K had been  using payday loans. It says that by using 
Loan 1 to consolidate his debts he was freeing up more disposable income  and that the 
interest rate payable  on Loan 1 was lower than for payday loans. I've mentioned above that 
Loan 1 wasnt  going to be meeting much  of Mr Ks outstanding credit. 
But I also think its important to note that whilst the interest rate on Loan 1 may have been 
lower than on payday loans, it was going  to be repaid  over two years  and so Mr K was going 
to repay  over £3,850 in interest on it - in other words in addition  to repaying the capital of 
£2,750, Mr K was due to pay an additional 140% in interest (if he complied with the credit  
agreement: if he got into arrears  it couldve  been more).  But the cost of payday loans is 
capped. Lenders  cannot charge a borrower  more  than 100% of the amount initially 
borrowed. So over the long term, Loan 1 could very well have been significantly more 
expensive for Mr K than the high-cost short-term loans he might repay with the Loan 1 
advance.
On top of Mr Ks loans,  he also had several credit  cards with high outstanding balances. For 
example:
Credit Card 1: balance £514:  credit limit £800
Credit Card 2: balance £1,144: credit limit £1,250
Credit Card 3: balance £4,101: credit limit £4,200 (this account had been opened 
recently - in September  2015)
Credit Card 4: balance £892:  credit limit £1,000
So Mr K was close to his limit on a number of his credit facilities.  I've mentioned  above  that 
hed been using his credit cards to make cash withdrawals. This is a very expensive form of 
credit and something which  in my experience - is indicative of someone  struggling to 
manage their finances. Mr K had declared  a monthly disposable income  of almost £1,300 
and yet since October 2015  had made  29 cash withdrawals on four credit  cards amounting 
to a sum in excess of £5,000.
118 118 Money was aware of all of this. It says that Mr K hadnt missed any payments on his 
credit cards and was running his accounts positively. But this level of debt on expensive 
credits cards  shouldve concerned 118 118 Money. Im not persuaded that he was managing 
them just because he didnt miss payments or exceed his limit. He was consistently up at his 
limit and owed them  significant sums.   
And yet 118 118 Money concluded  that Mr K would be able to sustainably repay Loan 1  a 
loan which  was going to cost him over £275  every month for two years. In my opinion there 
was clear evidence  from the CRA results that Mr K was using credit  to repay credit or fill the 
holes left in his finances by the repayment  of credit. This wasnt  sustainable.
So I dont  think it was responsible of 118 118 Money - based on the information it had - to 
provide Mr K with this expensive loan  on which he was going  to have to repay over £6,600. 
The assessment it was required to do included considering the risk to Mr K of not being able 
to repay  Loan  1 sustainably: it wasnt about the risk to 118 118 Money  of it not getting  back 
its money. Had it gone on to make  what I consider  proportionate checks  it wouldve 
established how precarious  Mr Ks finances  were. From his bank statements I can see that 
in January 2016 Mr K borrowed two payday loans amounting to £950 from Lenders  A and B. 
He repaid Lender A around £600  and Lender  C around £1,000  (on seven different accounts) 
and Lender D £80.
Ref: DRN43528046In February Mr K took three  high-cost short-term loans  amounting  to £2,300  from Lenders B, 
C and G. And he repaid  almost £2,500 to various high-cost short-term  lenders. Additionally  
he had two longer  term loans  he was repaying at around £430  per month and the credit  
cards I've mentioned above.
I'm satisfied that 118 118 Money shouldve declined Loan 1 based on the information it had. 
Had a more thorough  assessment been done  (as wouldve been proportionate in these 
circumstances), it wouldve confirmed  the picture shown by 118 118 Moneys own checks.  
Repayment of Loan 1 wasnt  likely  to be made sustainably.
Loan 2 was taken on the day Mr K repaid Loan 1. 118 118 Money seems to put a lot of 
weight on the fact that - apart from once - Loan  1 was repaid  in line with the credit 
agreement. But repayment of a loan on time doesnt necessarily mean that it was being 
repaid from sustainable means. Indeed the CRA check showed that Mr Ks outstanding  
credit balance had increased. It now stood  at £16,700 (of which  £875 was in relation to Loan 
1). So instead of clearing  some of his debt and improving his credit  situation with Loan  1, it 
appears to have worsened  for Mr K over the intervening period. 
118 118 Money says that Loan 2 was offered on a lower interest rate than for Loan 1 
because Mr Ks disposable income  and CRA  results  had improved. This suggests that at the 
time of Loan  1, 118 118 Money  had concerns about Mr Ks ability  to repay  sustainably  and 
offered him a lower loan over a longer term than hed applied  for  on a higher interest rate  
because there was a risk to it of not getting  back its money. But that aside, I think  that 
118 118 Moneys CRA checks now showed that Mr Ks credit situation had  in real terms 
deteriorated. He owed more and he had more open  accounts  of which 16 had been  
opened in the last six months (compared to 14 at the time of Loan 1). 
Mr K now had more credit  cards  in February  2018  than hed had when he took Loan  1. And 
he was still making cash  withdrawals on them.  Additionally he had been exceeding his 
credit limit on some of his credit cards. 
Throughout 2017 Mr K had taken and repaid numerous payday loans  often many  in a 
single month  and usually for sums  in excess of £500  (several  were for £1,500).  And he was 
still repaying loans  hed taken in in the last few months of 2017. 
As with Loan  1, Mr K said he was going  to use Loan 2 to consolidate  debt. But the sum of 
£2,000 wasnt  going to go very far at all. One loan he took in September  2017 had a balance 
of over £3,600.  And two more recent loans had balances  of over £2,300. Indeed on the day 
the loan was deposited into Mr Ks account  he repaid Loan 1 (£275) - reducing  further  the 
amount he had to consolidate his other debts. Additionally he repaid £800 towards two credit 
card balances, over £1,700 on two loans with Lender J, and £370 to Lender C. Given these 
figures it isnt surprising to see that he went back - in the following week  - to Lenders C and J 
for additional loans totalling £1,500.
I'm satisfied that 118 118 Money shouldve realised  based on the information  it had  that 
Mr K was in financial difficulties and he was in an unsustainable cycle  of debt. It wasnt 
enough for 118 118 Money to conclude  that Mr Ks declared disposable income (even with 
some verification of his income being correct)  and his apparent  good history  in repaying 
Loan 1 was sufficient to satisfy itself that hed be able to repay Loan 2 sustainably. This 
narrow approach  failed to take adequate  account  of this extensive  credit history and the 
reasons behind it. 
Ref: DRN43528047Had 118 118 Money looked  further into Mr Ks circumstances  it wouldve seen that Mr K was 
spending very large sums of money with gambling  firms - often several hundred  pounds  in a 
day - even in excess of £1,000 on occasion. And the repayment  of Loan 2 was unlikely to be 
through sustainable means.
In summary,  I dont think 118 118 Money  treated Mr K fairly when it provided  him with Loans 
1 and 2. I note that during  one of the welcome calls, the 118 118 Money representative  told 
Mr K  that the business had been  set up as a real alternative to customers  who have 
difficulties being  able to borrow from mainstream  lenders like banks and didnt want  to get 
caught up in a payday cycle. I think that these loans exacerbated Mr Ks difficulties and that 
he lost out as they became part of his broader  cycle  of debt (of which 118 118 Money was 
aware) which meant Mr K was paying very high levels of interest. The sheer number of loans 
he had been taking - including Loans 1 and 2 - was likely to have had negative  implications  
on his ability  to access mainstream (and cheaper) credit. 
I'm upholding Mr Ks complaint and require 118 118 Money to put things right. 
putting things right
Im satisfied that 118 118 Money wasnt responsible when it provided the two loans in 
question to Mr K so I require it to put things right. I understand  that there may be an 
outstanding balance on Loan  2. So I require 118 118 Money to do the following:
A)add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr K towards interest,  fees and 
charges on Loan 1
B)calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr K which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr K originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)remove all interest,  fees and charges from the outstanding balance on Loan 2, 
and treat any repayments made  by Mr K as though they had been repayments of 
the principal on Loan  2. If this results in Mr K having made overpayments then 
118 118 Money should refund these  overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would have 
arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 118 118 Money should then refund 
the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step D.
If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts  calculated  in A and B 
may be used to repay any balance remaining on Loan 2. If this results in a 
surplus (as I expect it will) then the surplus  should be paid to Mr K. However,  if 
there is still an outstanding balance then 118 118 Money should agree  an 
affordable repayment  plan with Mr K. 
D)118 118 Money should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ks 
credit file in relation  to Loans 1 and 2. 
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. It must  give Mr K a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN43528048my final decision
For the reasons  given  above I'm upholding Mr Ks complaint and I require Madison CF UK 
Limited to put things  right in the way I've outlined.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 February  2020.
