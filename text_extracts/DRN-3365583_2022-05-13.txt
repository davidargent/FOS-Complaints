The complaint
Mrs H complains that Bank of Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) has failed to refund over 
£17,000 she lost as part of an investment scam.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not set out everything 
again here. In summary, Mrs H lost £17,115.11 to a fraudulent merchant named Royal Trust 
Group (RTG). 
She made several payments from her Halifax debit card, which were first paid to Ownr wallet 
(a legitimate cryptocurrency platform). The cryptocurrency was subsequently transferred to 
the scammer from the Ownr wallet platform.
The following transactions were made from Mr Hs Halifax debit card:
Date Merchant Amount Running total
12/03/2021 Ownr wallet £215.61 £215.61
15/03/2021 Ownr wallet £721.45 £937.06

01/04/2021 Ownr wallet £1093.77 £17,115.11
  Total £17,115.11
Mrs H subsequently realised she had been scammed by RTG on or around 5 April 2021 
after they failed to provide her with the money she wanted to withdraw, at which point she 
stopped communicating with them. Mrs H raised a dispute with Halifax for help in recovering 
her lost funds, but the bank declined to provide her with a refund. She complained that 
Halifax ought to have done more to prevent the payments from being made.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mrs Hs complaint. He didnt think the transactions were 
unusual enough to have prompted any intervention by Halifax, and he also didnt think a 
chargeback claim would have been successful given the payments Mrs H made from her 
debit card were paid to a legitimate company. Mrs H disagreed, so the matter has been 
escalated to me to determine.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator and have decided 
not to uphold it. Ill explain why.
It isnt in dispute that Mrs H authorised the disputed payments she made to Ownr wallet 
using her Halifax debit card (where her funds were subsequently transferred on to the 
scammers from her crypto wallet). The payments were requested by her using her legitimate 
security credentials provided by Halifax, and the starting position is that banks ought to 
follow the instructions given by their customers in order for legitimate payments to be made 
as instructed.
However, Ive considered whether Halifax should have done more to prevent Mrs H from 
falling victim to the scam, as there are some situations in which a bank should reasonably 
have had a closer look at the circumstances surrounding a particular transfer. For example, 
if it was particularly out of character. 
I appreciate that overall, Mrs H has lost over £17,000 which is a significant amount of 
money. But this amount wasnt paid in one single large or out of character transaction. It 
was spread over 11 separate smaller increments which, in my judgment, would not have 
appeared particularly unusual or out of character when compared with Mrs Hs spending 
history, such that they ought to have been regarded as suspicious or indicating that she 
might have been at risk of falling victim to a scam. The payments were not of such an 
amount, for example, that it would represent a significant deviation from the way Mrs Hs 
account was normally run. 
I also acknowledge there were occasions where more than one payment was made in the 
same day to Ownr wallet, such as three payments being made on 15 March 2021. However, 
by this point, Mrs H had already made a payment to the crypto platform a few days before. 
So, by the time she came to make these payments, Ownr wallet was already established on 
her account as an existing payee that she had paid before. The three payments she made 
on 15 March 2021 also only totalled around £3,900, which cumulatively wouldnt have 
appeared overly unusual for an amount to be spent in one day. The same would also 
therefore apply to the payments Mrs H made on 22 March 2021 (by which point Ownr wallet 
had also been established on her account as a payee that shed sent several payments to 
before). 
So, having considered the payments Mrs H made to Ownr wallet, Im not persuaded there 
was anything that ought reasonably to have triggered Halifaxs fraud monitoring systems, or 
that would have indicated she was in the process of being scammed. 
I appreciate that Mrs H never had any contact with Ownr wallet and that she had only 
corresponded with RTG throughout the scam. But the fact still remains that she did not pay 
the scammer directly. So, even if warnings had been put in place about RTG by the 
Financial Conduct Authority at the time, I still would not have expected Halifax to have 
automatically blocked the payments she was making from her debit card, as these were 
being made to Ownr wallet  a legitimate cryptocurrency trading platform. Mrs H submits that 
Ownr wallet are part of RTG. But she hasnt provided any persuasive evidence to 
substantiate this claim, and neither have I seen anything else that would suggest Ownr 
wallet is a fraudulent company either.
Mrs H also says she contacted Halifax to find out some more information and to ask for 
advice about RTG, but that each time she couldnt get through. I understand it must have 
been frustrating not being able to reach the bank. But given there was no reasonable basis 
for the bank to have questioned the payments, Im not persuaded that Halifaxs failure to 
answer Mrs Hs calls can be considered a missed opportunity for them to have prevented 
her loss in these circumstances. 
Mrs H also says she interacted with Halifax staff in branch when she was depositing money 
into her account in order to pay the scammer. But while a bank would be expected to 
question its customers over any large or unusual withdrawals being made, the same cannot be said for cash deposits being made into the account (unless there was any reason to 
suspect money laundering was taking place, which I cant see there would have been here). 
So, I dont think Halifax acted unreasonably when it failed to ask Mrs H why she was 
depositing money into her account. Indeed, it wouldnt be practicable to expect a bank to 
question every customer wishing to make a cash deposit.  
Ive also thought about whether Halifax could have done more to recover the funds after 
Mrs H reported the fraud, as in some circumstances the money can be recovered via the 
bank raising a chargeback dispute. However, in these circumstances, Mrs H used her debit 
card to pay a legitimate company (Ownr wallet) before the funds were subsequently 
transferred on to the scammer. So, she wouldnt be able to make a successful chargeback 
claim in these circumstances because the company she paid had provided the services as 
intended (i.e. the purchase of cryptocurrency). Therefore, I do not think Halifax were under 
any obligation to raise a chargeback for Mrs H either.
I appreciate this will likely come as a disappointment to Mrs H, and Im sorry to hear she has
been the victim of a cruel scam. Id also like to reassure her that I have taken into 
consideration everything she had sent us. However, in the circumstances, I do not consider 
it would be fair and reasonable to hold Halifax liable for her loss.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 June 2022.
