The complaint
Mr B complains about how National Westminster Bank Plc handled his payment requests.  
What happened
Mr B had an account with NatWest. In August 2019 he wrote a letter to ask the bank to 
transfer £146,998 to another account so he could buy some shares. Shortly after this he 
received a letter from NatWest explaining that it had been unable to complete the transfer as 
there hadnt been sufficient funds available in the account to cover the full amount and pay 
the fee for a CHAPS payment.
Mr B responded to this letter to express his dissatisfaction that the payment hadnt been 
made. In this letter he asked for a payment of £160,600 to be made to another account. 
Shortly after this NatWest wrote to Mr B to say it hadnt been able to make this payment 
either, as it required security verification and it hadnt been able to reach him by phone in 
order to obtain this.
Mr B wasnt happy with this as he said the value of the shares he was trying to buy had now 
gone up, so he had lost out on the return on the investment. He also said he had updated his 
phone number a few years earlier and this hadnt been actioned by NatWest. He made a 
complaint to NatWest.
NatWest didnt uphold his complaint. It said that it hadnt been able to process the first 
payment due to insufficient funds in the account to cover the £23 transfer fee. It said the 
second payment required additional security checks and these couldnt be completed, so it 
was also right not to process that payment. It said it hadnt received the letter Mr B had 
included in his complaint notifying it of his change of phone number. However offered 
assurance that this had now been changed on his record. 
Mr B wasnt satisfied with this response. He said that as the £23 fee was so small in 
comparison to the transfer, and he had kept his accounts in good order, an unarranged 
overdraft should have been used in order to ensure the transaction went ahead. Further he 
said that he had included his correct phone number in all the correspondence he had written 
to NatWest, so it should have been aware of the right number to use. He brought his 
complaint to this service.
In February 2020, after Mr B had brought his complaint to us, he had another problem with 
the account. He tried to use his debit card to make a purchase through his broker for around 
£8,000. This wasnt successful and he received a letter from the fraud team at NatWest to 
say that he would be contacted about the payment. NatWest agreed that we could look at 
this complaint as part of our investigation.
Our investigator considered all the issues but didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. 
She said it was for NatWest to decide whether it grants an unarranged overdraft and she 
said she thought it was reasonable that it would want to carry out security and it had 
provided evidence that it hadnt received Mr Bs letter updating his contact details. 
Further, she said after looking into the debit card transaction that Mr B attempted in February 
2020, she was satisfied that NatWest followed its usually process when a transaction is 
identified as unusual. 
Mr B didnt agree with our investigator and asked for his complaint to be reviewed by an 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr B has raised a number of different complaint points. As this is an informal service I
havent responded to every one. I have only addressed what I consider to be the key issues 
in relation to this complaint. However I want to reassure Mr B that I have considered all the 
points he has raised when reaching my decision. 
I have addressed the pertinent issues in turn below.
Transfer requested in August 2019
Mr B doesnt think NatWest treated him fairly by not processing his transfer request due to 
insufficient funds. He says he has lost out on a return on the investment because of this.
I appreciate it would have been frustrating for Mr B to learn that his transfer hadnt been 
successful due to the £23 fee. I also understand this may have caused him embarrassment 
and he feels he has lost out financially because of it. 
When assessing a complaint, I look at whether the business has made an error and where it 
has, what it should do to put things right. In this case NatWest didnt proceed with the 
transfer due to insufficient funds in the account to cover the fee. Having reviewed the terms 
and conditions I can see this is a standard fee for transfers for amounts greater than 
£20,000. So I cant say NatWest were unfair to charge this amount. And, in order to 
complete the transfer, the full amount requested plus the fee would need to be available in 
the account. As this wasnt available, NatWest couldnt complete the transaction. And I think 
this is fair.
Mr B has said that NatWest should have processed the transfer regardless, as it could have 
foreseen the potential consequences not doing so would have had on him. He has 
suggested it should have either broken down the transfer into smaller amounts to avoid a fee 
or used an unarranged overdraft to take the fee. 
While I understand Mr Bs frustration, I dont agree NatWest has acted unfairly here. When 
arranging a transfer it is the responsibility of the customer to ensure there are sufficient 
funds to cover all associated costs. And NatWest are entitled to not proceed with the transfer 
if there isnt. 
I have considered Mr Bs suggestions about how NatWest could have proceeded with the 
transfer. Although unarranged overdrafts will sometimes be agreed by a bank, this is a 
discretionary decision. So I cant say NatWest treated Mr B unfairly by not authorising one 
here. Further, the fees for transfers of different amounts are laid out in the accounts terms 
and conditions. So I wouldnt expect NatWest to take action to avoid the fee.So while I sympathise with Mr Bs position, I dont agree NatWest has done anything wrong, 
so I wont ask it to anything further here.  
Transfer requested in September 2019
Mr B is also unhappy that NatWest didnt process his request for a transfer in September 
2019.
NatWest has said that for transfers of large amounts, it needs to complete security checks to 
ensure the request is legitimate. In this case the request was received in writing. I can see 
that NatWest attempted to call Mr B in order to get authorisation. However it wasnt able to 
get through to him on the number held on file. As it wasnt able to complete the required 
security checks, the transfer couldnt be made.
While I can understand Mr Bs frustration that another transfer wasnt processed, again I 
dont think NatWest has done anything wrong here. I understand the need for additional 
security checks when a large transfer is requested. And as this is NatWests process for 
carrying out these checks is to call its customer, I cant say it has done the wrong thing by 
not completing the transaction where it isnt possible to carry out these checks.
Mr B has also raised concerns about the contact number NatWest hold for him. He has 
provided a letter dated 2015 informing NatWest of a change to his phone number. NatWest 
has said that it didnt receive this letter. It has provided all correspondence it holds on file 
from Mr B and I can see this wasnt received. While I appreciate this is frustrating for Mr B, I 
cant say that NatWest has made an error here. It appears the letter wasnt received, so it 
has continued to use the phone number it has on file.
Mr B has said that all his correspondence over the last few years has included his new 
phone number in the letterhead. And I can see this is the case. However NatWest has 
advised that for security reasons it only uses information that has been formally provided 
and security checks are required when a phone number is changed, as this is its most 
common way of verifying a customers identity. So for this reason I think it has acted fairly by 
using the number it has on file for Mr B.
NatWest has now confirmed that it has updated Mr Bs phone number, so Im satisfied that 
he shouldnt experience similar problems in future.
Unsuccessful payment in February 2020
Mr B tried to make a payment to his broker using his debit card in February 2020 but this 
was unsuccessful. He says NatWest has caused him further embarrassment and 
inconvenience. 
NatWest has said that as the transaction was unusual and for around £8,000, it triggered a 
fraud alert on the account. When this happens, additional security verification is required, 
and it has shown evidence that it tried to contact Mr B. As this contact was unsuccessful it 
wrote to Mr B asking him to get in touch. 
It is usual for banks to require verification for transactions they identify as unusual or for 
large amounts paid on a debit card. And it is reasonable for NatWest to require additional 
checks when these transactions are attempted. On this occasion NatWest attempted to 
contact Mr B and if this had been successful then it is likely the transaction would have been 
processed more quickly. I appreciate as it was unable to contact Mr B this would have been 
inconvenient and caused further distress. But I cant say NatWest has done anything wrong 
here, so I wont ask it to do anything furtherConclusion
I can see that Mr B has suffered inconvenience and been caused embarrassment by 
transactions that havent been successful. And that this has been made worse by the fact 
that this has happened on three separate occasion. However after examining each, I dont 
agree that NatWest has treated him unfairly or unreasonably in its handling of his requests. 
So I wont ask it to do anything differently.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given I wont require National Westminster Bank Plc to do anything 
differently.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 February 2021.
