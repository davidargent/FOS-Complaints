K821x#15complaint
Mr P is unhappy with how Clydesdale Bank Plc (Clydesdale) has offered to put things  right 
following his complaint about the sale of payment protection insurance (PPI).
background
Mr P bought the PPI to protect  the repayments  on a credit card.  Mr P thinks the policy was 
mis-sold.
Clydesdale investigated  the complaint and thought it should be upheld.  It worked  out it 
needed to pay Mr P £288.84.
Mr P isnt sure Clydesdale has got this right  he thinks  the amount Clydesdale has worked 
out is too low.
Our adjudicator looked at the complaint and said that what  Clydesdale  had done was fair. Mr 
P didnt  agree  so the complaint has been  passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Clydesdale agrees it shouldnt have sold Mr P the policy.  So I havent considered how the 
policy was sold - Ive just looked at whether what its offering to put things right is fair. Based 
on what Ive seen, I think it is. Ill explain why.
Where I decide, or a business agrees, that a complaint about the sale of PPI should be 
upheld, Id expect  the business  to put the consumer in the position theyd be in if they hadnt  
bought the policy.
Mr P bought the PPI to protect  the repayments  on a credit card.  So the cost of the policy was 
charged to the card,  and Mr P needed  to repay  this, with interest, in line with the terms and 
conditions of the account. Mr P needs to get the extra hes paid back.
PPI was charged to the account  based  on what Mr P owed when Clydesdale  prepared his 
statements. Ive seen  statements for the periods 
July 1995 to February 1998, 
July 1998 to March 1999,  
July 1999 to October 1999,
July 2000 to January 2001
June 2001  to August 2001, and
Individual statements for May 2002 and October  2002.
These show premiums of £65.33, which is the amount Clydesdale has included in its offer.
Where theres gaps between the statements, Clydesdale has estimated the premiums based 
on the balances  shown on the statements immediately before and after the gap. Its estimate 
is £0.70.
Ref: DRN96548212I see that in February  1998 and March 1999, the statements showed a £0.00 closing 
balance  the next available  statements  opened  with a £0.00  balance. Clydesdale  assumes 
Mr P didnt use his card  and so wasnt charged  for PPI  during this period.
In October  1999 and January 2001  the statements show closing balances of £0.03 and 
£0.08. Its not clear  when  Mr P repaid these amounts: the next statements show  opening 
balances of £0.00. I think its possible Mr P didnt use the card during these periods. But 
Clydesdale has instead assumed Mr P owed £10.07, which  is what  he owed according to the 
next available statement. So it assumed it charged him £0.07  a month during this period, 
except in the final month where there was no balance carried  forward  and therefore no PPI 
charged.
Finally, it looks  as though  Mr P repaid the account  in July 2001.  The remaining statements, 
in May 2002  and October 2003,  show a £0.00 balance. I see that in February 2004 the card 
was cancelled because  Mr P was no longer using it. I havent seen any evidence Mr P used 
his card from August  2001 onwards. This means Mr P was no longer charged for the PPI.
In total, Clydesdale thinks it charged  Mr P £66.03 in premiums, and Mr Ps representatives 
havent sent me anything that suggests  he was charged more than this.
Clydesdale has also worked out it charged Mr P an extra £50 in fees because of the PPI. It 
says it charged £8.23 more in interest  because  of the premiums. And because Mr P had to 
pay more towards the credit card, Clydesdale has added  interest   the rate is 8% - to 
compensate him for the time hes been  out of pocket.
So Clydesdale has done what  Id expect it to.
I recognise that Mr P is disappointed that the offer isnt bigger.  But this compensation is 
intended to put him in the position hed be in if he hadnt bought the policy  and based on 
what Ive seen, there were long periods  when  he didnt use the card and so wasnt  charged  
anything for PPI.
In all the circumstances, I think Clydesdales offer is fair.
my final decision
For the reasons  above, my final decision is that Clydesdale  Bank  Plc has offered fair 
compensation for mis-selling  PPI. I understand this has already been paid so I dont direct  
Clydesdale Bank  Plc to do anything further.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 May 2019
