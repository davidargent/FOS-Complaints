K820x#14complaint
Mrs D is the administrator of the estate of D. She complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
wants her to sign an indemnity form to release  the funds in the deceaseds account  even  
though she has a Grant of Letters  of Administration. She is being assisted in this complaint 
by her daughter.
background
On 23 April 2019 I issued  a provisional decision saying that subject to any further comments  
or evidence  from Mrs D or PayPal, I intended to uphold this complaint. I outlined  the 
background of Mrs Ds complaint as follows:
PayPal is holding £336.75 in an account. Mrs D sent it the Grant of Letters of Administration  
in April 2018 but it wont send a cheque  to her without an indemnity form and further 
identification documents.
The adjudicator didnt think PayPal had done  anything wrong. She said it was entitled  to ask 
for identification before closing the account.
Mrs Ds daughter didnt  agree. She thought the Grant of Letters of Administration was 
sufficient evidence of her mothers identity.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My provisional findings based on the evidence available at the time were as follows:
Since this Service has become involved PayPal has accepted that it doesnt require a signed 
indemnity form in addition to the Grant of Letters  of Administration. But it says it still requires 
proof of Mrs Ds identity.
Ive looked at the documents PayPal says it needs  but it seems  to me that the initial  list of 
documents relates to the closure of an account with a nil balance. If there is a positive 
balance it then requires  either a signed  indemnity form or a Grant of Probate or Letters  of 
Administration.
The Grant of Letters of Administration  is the legal authority  given to someone to deal with a 
deceased persons estate. It contains the name  and address  of the person  legally  authorised 
to collect in and distribute  the assets  of a deceased person. The Grant  of Letters  of Authority 
to deal with Ds estate gives authority to Mrs D. It gives her address which is the address 
shes given to PayPal.  In those circumstances it seems to me its unreasonable  for PayPal to 
ask Mrs D to provide further identification evidence.  
Mrs D wants PayPal to send her a cheque for the balance. PayPal says it can transfer the 
balance to the bank account  linked to the PayPal account. But Mrs D tells us the bank 
holding this account will only accept  cheque payments into a frozen  deceased account and 
not electronic  payments. PayPal says the balance can be transferred to the administrators
PayPal account  and if the administrator doesnt own one it recommends he or she could 
open one. Mrs D doesnt have a PayPal  account  and it seems  unreasonable  to expect  her to 
Ref: DRN39166152open one just to receive  this balance. I dont  think  the options  PayPal is giving to pay the 
balance on this account are fair and reasonable and so I think it should send the balance to
Mrs D by cheque
PayPal responded  saying  that I was of the opinion that this was the closure  of an account 
with a zero balance. That is a misunderstanding  of my findings. As I explained in my 
decision, the document PayPal says it requires if there is a positive balance is either, a 
signed indemnity  form, or a Grant of Probate of Letters of Administration.  The issue at 
hand is that PayPal  was asking for a signed indemnity form in addition  to the Grant  of 
Letters of Authority. But PayPal has since accepted, in an email dated  5 April 2019, that it 
doesnt require  the signed indemnity  form. But its asking for additional identity documents. 
And in my provisional  decision I explained why I thought that was unreasonable.
PayPal has now raised the issue of its anti-money  laundering  obligations.  The Proceeds of 
Crime Act 2002 (POCA) and other money  laundering regulations  and legislation,  places 
extensive obligations on regulated financial businesses  such as PayPal.  It is required to take 
a risk based approach to money laundering and have suitable systems and processes in 
place. But the regulations  aren't prescriptive and so it's up to the business to put in place the 
appropriate measures.  
The PayPal account has a balance of £336.75. The Grant of Letters  of Administration is the 
legal authority for Mrs D to deal with the estate. PayPal hasnt told us it has any reason to 
think Mrs D isnt who she says she is. In those  circumstances  it seems to me that PayPals 
obligations under  the money  laundering regulations would not require  it to ask for further 
identity checks.  And it would be unreasonable for PayPal to do so. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. To put matters right PayPal should close  Ds 
account and send the balance by cheque to Mrs D.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs D, on behalf  of 
the estate of D, to accept  or reject  my decision before 14 July 2019.
