K820x#14Complaint
Miss E complains  about the way Madison  CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) treated 
her while she was experiencing financial  difficulties.  
Background
In February 2016  Miss E successfully applied for a £2,000 loan with 118 118 Money. The 
loan term was 24 months with repayments of £194.93. Miss E has told us that she later hit a 
rough patch and wasnt  able to keep up with her monthly payments.  
In July 2016 Miss E asked 118 118 Money  if she could add that months payment to the end 
of her loan as she was due to go on holiday.  118 118 Money said it didnt offer that option. 
On 1 August  2016 Miss E contacted 118 118 Money again and said she would have trouble 
making her payment as she was due to go on holiday. 118 118 Money  responded and asked 
Miss E for further information about  her situation. 
At the end of October  2016 Miss E cancelled the instruction  used to collect her monthly 
payments and told 118 118 Money she wasnt working. In November 2016 Miss E completed 
an income and expenditure assessment but it showed she had enough  disposable income to 
maintain her payments. 
In January 2017 118 118 Money agreed  to accept  reduced payments of £40 for the next two 
months. In April 2017 118 118 Money extended  the £40 payment plan for three months. 
In July 2017 Miss E agreed a further  payment plan with 118 118 Money for the next three  months. 
In December 2017 Miss E agreed a payment plan to pay £20 a month. Miss E continued to 
make that payment  until July 2018  when  she made  a partial  repayment.  The outstanding 
balance was repaid in full at the beginning of August 2018. 
Concerned with her treatment by 118 118 Money, Miss E referred her complaint to our service 
and it was passed to an investigator. The investigator thought  118 118 Money had treated 
Miss E fairly whilst she was experiencing financial  difficulties and didnt uphold her complaint. 
Miss E asked to appeal  so her complaint has been passed to me to make  a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss E complains  about the way 118 118 Money  treated her when she wasnt able to 
maintain her payments and says it should have stopped charging interest  during  that time. 
I understand there were genuine reasons that meant  Miss E wasnt  able to maintain her 
payments. But businesses have a range of options available  to provide help to customers  
experiencing trouble paying   they dont have  to stop charging  interest.  
Ive looked at what 118 118 Money did after Miss E got in touch about her financial 
difficulties. Each time Miss E made contact 118 118 Money asked her about her 
circumstances and why she wasnt able to make her payment. It sent income and 
expenditure assessments and asked questions  to see whether it could offer assistance. 
118 118 Money then looked at Miss Es financial situation. 
Ref: DRN37939162On various occasions  118 118 Money agreed to put a reduced payment arrangement  in 
place, accepting payments of either  £40 or £20. Whilst  I note Miss Es concerns, Im satisfied 
118 118 Money has treated her positively and sympathetically by agreeing  to accept 
significantly reduced payments for an extended period of time. I havent  seen anything that 
persuades me 118 118 Money  treated Miss E unfairly. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Miss E but as I havent  found  any evidence of a mistake  by 
118 118 Money and I think it provided positive and sympathetic support whilst she was 
experiencing financial difficulties Im not upholding this complaint. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 January 2020.
