The complaint
Mr K is unhappy that he wasnt made aware by NewDay Ltd that he wasnt able to complete
a balance transfer between two differently branded NewDay administered credit accounts.   
What happened
Mr K applied for a NewDay administered credit account as he wanted to take advantage of a
0% interest promotional offer on balance transfers. Mr Ks application was approved, and he
was issued with a new credit account. However, when Mr K went to complete the balance
transfer, he discovered that it wasnt allowed because the credit account he wanted to
transfer the balance from was also administered by NewDay, albeit under a different brand.
Mr K wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
 
NewDay looked at Mr Ks complaint, but they noted that the fact that balance transfers
between different NewDay administered accounts wasnt permitted was explained online
and that a link to that explanation had been provided to Mr K during the account application
process. So, they didnt uphold Mr Ks complaint.
 
Mr K wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They noted that the main documents that
Mr K had been provided with at the time of the application didnt explain this exclusion or
signpost Mr K to where it might be found. Because of this, they recommended that the
complaint be upheld in Mr Ks favour and that NewDay should make a payment of £100 to
Mr K.
 
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendation put forwards by Mr K, so the matter was
escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 22 November 2021 as follows:
I can appreciate that NewDay feel that the exclusion in question is listed online and 
that Mr K ought therefore to have been aware of this exclusion when applying for the 
new NewDay administered account.
 
However, its evident from the documents provided Mr K at the point of application  
being specifically the Your Card  Important Customer Information, Pre-Contract 
Credit Agreement, and the Credit Card Agreement - that none of these documents 
make any reference to this exclusion or adequately directed Mr K to where this 
exclusion could be found.
 
Furthermore, while NewDay have stated that a link was provided to Mr K where the
information could be found, its clear from NewDays own explanation of how to access 
the information from this link that a number of further steps needed to be taken by Mr K 
following accessing the link before the information in question became visible.
 
Given the importance of this exclusion in cases such as Mr Ks  where a customer 
applies for a new NewDay administered card specifically to carry out a balance transfer 
from an already existing differently branded NewDay administered credit account  it 
would be expected by this service that an explanation that such a balance transfer isnt 
permitted would have been clearly provided to Mr K.
 
But I dont feel that I can reasonably say that the relevant information was made clearly 
available to Mr K  for the reasons outlined above  and Im satisfied that if Mr K had 
been made aware that he wouldnt be able to carry out the balance transfer he was 
intending to, that he wouldnt have applied for the new NewDay credit account. As 
such, I feel that Mr K has been unreasonably inconvenienced by having applied for the 
account in the absence of the important relevant information and also by having then 
sought to understand why the balance transfer he wanted to make wasnt allowed. And 
it follows from this that Ill be provisionally upholding this aspect of Mr Ks complaint.
 
In their view of this complaint, our investigator recommended that NewDay make a 
payment of £100 to Mr K to compensate him for the inconvenience hed incurred. 
Matters of compensation can be subjective, with an offer considered as being fair and 
reasonable by one party not being considered as such by someone else. However, 
while I appreciate that Mr K may believe that a larger amount of compensation is 
warranted, the amount of £100 compensation does feel fair to me, and I can confirm 
that its commensurate with what this service would expect, given the circumstances 
here.
 
Mr K has also questioned whether, should this service uphold this aspect of his 
complaint, as I am provisionally doing, that this entails that this service considers the 
exclusion clause in question to be onerous in contract law. But this service isnt a Court 
of Law and doesnt operate as one, and so I can confirm that my decision to uphold 
this aspect of Mr Ks complaint doesnt in any way include any form of 
acknowledgement or judgement as to the merits of the exclusion in question. Rather, it 
is simply and only a decision, made by myself in my professional capacity as a 
financial ombudsman, that in this particular instance and under these specific 
circumstances, an unfair outcome has arisen for the reasons explained previously for 
which I feel compensation of £100 should be paid by NewDay to Mr K.
 
Im also aware that Mr K feels that NewDay should amend his credit file to remove the 
new account as though it had never been applied for. I can appreciate Mr Ks concerns 
here, but NewDay have a responsibility to make accurate credit file reports, and I 
would only consider instructing NewDay to amend a credit file where a persons credit 
file has been negatively impacted by an error or omission made by NewDay.
 
And, while I do feel that NewDay did make an omission here, I dont feel that this has 
had any negative impact to Mr Ks credit file, and I say this because the successful 
application for a new credit account doesnt constitute adverse credit reporting or, in all 
likelihood, impact negatively on Mr Ks ability to gain alterative further credit, should he 
choose to do so. And this remains the case should Mr K now choose to close the new 
credit account without use.
 
Finally, Im aware that Mr K is unhappy that NewDay didnt respond to a Data Subject
Access Request (DSAR) which he made to enable him to understand the potential 
impact of what had occurred here and to help him articulate his complaint to this service. NewDay have confirmed that they received a replacement DSAR request form 
from Mr K, but that this wasnt forwarded by them to the correct department, so that Mr 
Ks request was never acted upon.
 
NewDay have confirmed that they are able to complete the DSAR request, should Mr K 
still require it. However, I feel that this further inconvenience to Mr K merits additional 
compensation, and as such my provisional decision here will be that NewDay should 
make a further payment of £50 to Mr K because of this, taking the total amount of 
compensation payable to £150.
 
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr K and NewDay the opportunity to provide 
any comments or further information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a 
final decision. NewDay confirmed that they accepted my provisional decision. However, Mr K 
did provide some further comments for my consideration.
 
Mr K didnt feel that enough consideration had been given to how NewDay had handled his 
complaint, including that NewDay corresponded with Mr K via written letter rather than by 
email. But its up to a business to decide how it will operate, and it isnt within the remit of 
this service to instruct a business to change how it operates  only to assess whether an 
unfair outcome has arisen as a result. And, while I can appreciate that Mr K would have 
preferred to have communicated with NewDay electronically, I dont feel that I can censure 
NewDay in any way for electing to communicate in writing.
 
It also should be noted that this service isnt permitted to look at any aspect of a complaint 
which is concerned with how a business has handled a complaint, such as is the case in this 
instance. This is because there are rules about what this service can and cant look at. 
These rules can be found in the Dispute Resolution (DISP) section of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) Handbook and includes that this service is only permitted to consider 
complaints about regulated activities  which complaint handling is not.
 
Mr K has also stated that he feels that NewDay, by collecting the interest that was due on his 
previously existing account  the balance of which he was unable to transfer to the new 
NewDay account  have profited from Mr K not being allowed to transfer that balance.
 
I can understand why Mr K might think this. However, it was always the case that the 
exclusion clause was in place, and it isnt the case that this decision is in any way saying 
that NewDay shouldnt have such an exclusion clause in place, only that NewDay didnt 
reasonably signpost the existence of that exclusion. This means that it would never have 
been the case that Mr K would have been able to transfer the balance, which in turn means 
that Mr K would always have had to pay the interest due on the older account. 
 
As such this means that the £100 compensation being awarded for this aspect of Mr Ks 
complaint is being awarded solely for NewDay not providing clear information, and therefore 
I dont feel that any unfair outcome has arisen from Mr K having to pay interest on his older 
NewDay account, because as mentioned, this interest would always have needed to be 
paid, because it would never have been possible for the balance to be transferred.
 
Finally, Mr K has made a reference to NewDay not fulfilling its legal obligations regarding his 
Data Subject Access Request. However, as mentioned in my provisional decision letter, this 
service is not a Court of Law and as such is unable to comment on this point as Mr K would 
like. What this service can comment on is whether an unfair outcome has arisen. And as 
explained in my provisional decision letter, I feel that an unfair outcome has arisen here in 
regard to this point, and it remains my position that a further £50 compensation should be 
paid by NewDay to Mr K because of this.   
 All of which means that Im satisfied that the outcome that I arrived at in my provisional 
decision letter  that this complaint should be upheld in Mr Ks favour and that NewDay 
should make a payment of £150 to Mr K to compensate him for the inconvenience these 
matters have caused him  does constitute a fair and reasonable resolution to what has 
taken place here, and I can confirm that my final decision will be that I am upholding this 
complaint in Mr Ks favour on that basis.
  
Putting things right
NewDay must make a payment of £150 to Mr K. This payment may not take the form of a 
credit to one of Mr Ks NewDay accounts unless Mr K gives his permission for it to do so.     
My final decision
I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 December 2021.
