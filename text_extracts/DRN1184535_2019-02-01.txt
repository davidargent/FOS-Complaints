K820x#14complaint
This complaint is about a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy  taken out with a credit 
card in 1998. Mr D says NewDay Ltd mis-sold  him the PPI.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr D case.
Ive decided the policy wasnt mis-sold. Ill explain  why.
Mr D doesnt remember any mention of PPI when  he applied  for his credit card. Mr D 
applied for his credit card through  the post  and NewDay has supplied a copy  of his 
application. On this, I can see that PPI is presented as an optional product   and has 
been selected with a tick. Mr D has then signed  the application,  agreeing to the 
information on it. So with this in mind, I think NewDay made it clear  that Mr D didnt have 
to take out the PPI and that he chose to take it out  although I can understand why he 
cant remember this as it was over 20 years ago.
NewDay didnt recommend the PPI to Mr D so it didnt have to check if it was right for 
him. But it did have  to make sure Mr D got the information  he needed to decide if it was 
right for him. 
Its possible the information NewDay gave Mr D about the PPI wasnt  as clear  as it 
shouldve been. But as I think he chose to take out the PPI - it looks  like he wanted  this 
type of cover. Based on what  Ive seen of his circumstances  at the time it doesnt look 
like he was affected by any of the exclusions to or limits on the PPI cover  - so it would 
have been useful for him if something  went wrong. It also looks  like the PPI was 
affordable. So I dont think better information  about the PPI would have put him off taking 
out the cover. 
This means NewDay doesnt  have to pay back all of the cost of the PPI to Mr D.
But NewDay  will pay back some  of the cost of the PPI to Mr D because: 
NewDay got a high level of commission and profit  share (more than 50% of the PPI 
premium) - so it should have told Mr D about that. Because  NewDay  didnt  tell Mr D, that 
was unfair. 
To put that right, NewDay  has basically offered to pay back  the amount of commission  
and profit share that was above  50% of the PPI premium - and I think that offer is fair in 
this case.
Ive thought about everything Mr D has said - but these  points  dont change  my decision, and 
for the reasons set out above,  I dont  think the PPI was mis-sold.
what the business needs  to do
Ref: DRN11845352NewDay has to pay back to Mr D any commission and profit share it got that was more  than 
50% of the PPI premium. NewDay should  also pay back to Mr D any extra interest he paid 
because of that.
NewDay should re-work the credit card account  and pay back  to Mr D the difference  
between what Mr D owes and what he wouldve owed if the commission  and profit share  it 
got hadnt been over 50% of the cost of the PPI. NewDay  should also pay Mr D 8%* simple  
interest if he paid off their credit card at some  point.
*Businesses have to take basic rate tax off this interest. Mr D can claim back the tax if he doesnt pay tax.
my final decision
The PPI policy wasnt mis-sold  so NewDay Ltd does not have to pay back  all of the cost of 
the PPI to Mr D.
But NewDay  Ltd does  have to pay back to Mr D any commission and profit  share it got that 
was more than 50% of the PPI premium.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.
