K821x#15complaint
Z, a limited company, complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc restricted its account meaning  that 
it could not make payments.
background
HSBC wrote to Z to say it was carrying out a safeguard review  to help prevent fraud and 
financial crime. HSBC told Z it needed  to provide information about its business.  Z provided 
the information it was asked for. But HSBC did not contact it for over two months to tell it that 
this was not complete. Zs account  was restricted.  HSBC offered to pay Z £100.
Our investigator did not think that this was sufficient and recommended  that HSBC pay 
£250. This was to compensate Z for the inconvenience caused and for the negative impact  
on its relationship  with its clients.
Z did not think that this was sufficient and has also referred to further problems after the 
safeguard review had completed.  
HSBC said that it had never told Z that the restrictions  wouldnt be applied. And Z had not 
demonstrated the impact  on its business.  HSBC made clear that it would be addressing a 
new complaint about what  Z said had happened after the safeguard review had been 
completed on 21 January  2019.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I asked HSBC for some clarification about what happened and the aspects of Zs account  
that were restricted.  I also said that based on what Id seen I did not think that the 
compensation was sufficient. It provided  further comments  and agreed to increase its offer to 
£350.
Some key events and dates relevant to my assessment of this complaint are as I understand 
them as follows:
-On 2 May and 29 June 2018  HSBC wrote  to Z about the review  asking it to provide 
information online. 
-On 25 July 2018, it wrote to Z and said that as it had no response it would be 
stopping certain  services on 27 September 2018 and closing the account on 21 
November 2018.
-There was a telephone review with the director of Z on 30 July 2018 and Z was 
asked to provide  further information  which it did on 8 August 2018.  The review did 
not conclude as there was a further  requirement but Z was not contacted  about this.
-On 27 September  2018 the ability to make international  payments was removed from 
the account.
-In October 2018 Z tried to make  an international payment which  was declined. The 
director contacted  HSBC and on 15 October 2018  the review was started again with 
an interview. On 22 October 2018 HSBC sent Z a letter  saying the account would 
close on 21 November 2018.
Ref: DRN22986572-Z made a complaint and on 19 November 2018 HSBC issued a final response 
apologising for the delay  and saying that I would like to reassure you that there  are 
currently no restrictions applied to your Business  Bank  Account  affecting the account  
facilities such as Debit Cards, Bill Payments within  the UK and Direct  Debits. It 
offered to pay Z £100.
-On 21 November 2018 there was a full suspension of the account. HSBC said in 
response to me that this did not include payments through internet banking. The 
director of Z told this service that it did until he rang up about  it.
-On 7 December  2018 internet banking was suspended and Z says that on 11 
December 2018 a direct debit was declined.
-On 12 December 2018 internet banking was reinstated. Although HSBC has told me 
that the ability to make  international  payments was also reinstated  that seems 
inconsistent with the ongoing  review  and its case file note that the limit was 
reinstated on 21 January 2019.
-On 7 January  2019 internet banking was inhibited and then reapplied.
-On 8 January  2019 Z was told about information  that was then required.
-On 21 January 2019 HSBC says the review was completed.
I need first to say that the safeguard exercise  was something HSBC  considered  necessary 
for it to comply  with its regulatory requirements.  So there was always going to be some 
necessary inconvenience for Z as a result. And HSBC made  clear  to Z what  would happen if 
the review was not completed based  on its own processes.
However, as HSBC accepts, there were delays here that could have  been  avoided. Notably 
due it seems to a change  in a staff member there was no follow up to this process to Z from 
August 2018 to October 2018.  And although HSBC appeared  to recognise this in its 
response letter it did nothing to adjust the timescales to prevent further restrictions  to the 
account. The evidence  suggests that it was only through  the contact from Z that restrictions 
were removed each  time. And there was a long period  over which  Z could not make any 
international payments. Even  when the process restarted there seemed to be delays in 
telling Z what was still required and, as in January 2019, this only happened  after the 
account had been inhibited.
I consider Z has been caused needless inconvenience and delay  here. I know  the 
investigator asked it to substantiate any financial  loss. Ive looked at what its provided and 
while I dont doubt  that it had to make some adjustments for the periods when as set out 
above the account was restricted, I am not persuaded that this resulted in a financial loss. 
Taking account of everything that happened  until 21 January 2019 in my judgement 
compensation of £350 is appropriate  and HSBC  has agreed to pay this. I make clear that, as 
HSBC has said, a complaint about what happened with Zs account after this date has not 
been considered here.
Ref: DRN22986573my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and require HSBC  Bank  UK Plc to pay Z £350  as 
it has now agreed to do.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Z to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 August 2019.
