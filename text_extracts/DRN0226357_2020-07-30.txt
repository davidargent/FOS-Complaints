K820x#14complaint
Mrs C complains about the amount that shes been charged by Arval UK Limited for damage 
to a car that she returned at the end of her hire agreement. Her husband is also involved in 
her complaint. 
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus  on giving the reasons for 
my decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
the hire agreement, which  was signed by Mrs C, says: Arval shall invoice the Hirer 
for the cost of repairs (whether or not carried out) to a Vehicle returned to Arval  that 
is subject to damage which, in accordance with the BVRLA Fair Wear and Tear 
Guide for the Contract Hire Industry, would constitute unfair  wear  and tear ; 
I dont consider that term to be unfair  or unreasonable and Mrs C accepted it when 
she signed the agreement;
the car was returned when the agreement ended and it was inspected  by Arval in 
March 2019  the inspection identified damage to the car with a total recharge value 
of Â£524.58 and an inspection report was produced  which  included photos  of the 
damage;
Mrs C was charged for the damage  but her husband complained about the charges 
and says that the car was returned  in good condition,  the repairs  werent carried  out, 
its impossible to not scratch the alloys and he's leased cars before and never been 
charged for damage;  
Ive looked  at the photos in the inspection report and I consider that they clearly  show  
that the front bumper is scratched, a head  light is broken and that three of the alloy 
wheels are damaged;
I dont consider that damage to be fair wear and tear when assessed against the 
British Vehicle Rental  and Leasing Association guidelines on fair wear  and tear and 
nor do I consider that the damage  would reasonably be considered  to be fair wear  
and tear;
I consider that Arval  has charged Mrs C for damage in accordance with the terms of 
the hire agreement and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence  to show  that 
its acted incorrectly in these  circumstances or that the charges are excessive; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Arval to reduce  (or waive) 
the amount that its charged Mrs C for damage to the car - or to take any other  action 
in response to her complaint.
Ref: DRN02263572my final decision
So my decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 August 2020.
