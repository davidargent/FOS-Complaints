K821x#15complaint
Ms E complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid, lent to her in an
irresponsible manner.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  15 July 2019,  
an extract  of which is attached and forms part of this final decision.  So, I wont  repeat that 
information here. 
In my provisional decision,  I set out why I thought  that Ms Es complaint  should be upheld  in 
part and what I intended to direct QuickQuid to do to put matters  right.  I invited both parties 
to let me have any further comments and evidence. Both Ms E and QuickQuid said that they 
had nothing further to add.
 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that neither  Ms E nor QuickQuid has provided  me with anything further, I see no 
reason to depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.  So, for the 
reasons Ive explained, I dont think that QuickQuid  should  have  given Ms E loans five to 14.
Ref: DRN46164632my final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Ms Es complaint in 
part. I now require CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  to; 
refund  all interest and charges Ms E paid on loans  five to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans five and six from Ms Es credit file;
the number  of loans  taken from loan seven onwards  means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about loans seven to 14 should  be 
removed from Ms E s credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. 
QuickQuid must give Ms E a certificate showing how much tax its taken off, if she asks 
for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms E  to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 September 2019.

complaint
Ms E complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to her in an irresponsible 
manner.
background
QuickQuid gave Ms E 14 loans - not 13 as previously stated - between May 2014  and
June 2016. On six of the loans, Ms E topped up the loan by taking additional borrowing.
Ms E repaid all of her loans with QuickQuid.  A summary of Ms Es borrowing from QuickQuid is 
shown as an appendix to this decision.
One of our adjudicators assessed Ms Es complaint. She thought  that QuickQuid hadnt treated Ms 
E unfairly by giving her loans one to four but that it shouldnt have given her loan five onwards. The 
adjudicator set out what QuickQuid should  do to put matters right.
QuickQuid didnt agree  with the adjudicators assessment. As the complaint hasnt been 
resolved informally, its been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general  approach to complaints about  short-
term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  - on our 
website.
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Ms E could  repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a 
number of different things, such  as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages  of a lending relationship, 
I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Ms E could  sustainably  repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.
Ref: DRN46164634Of course the loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow  this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being  without undue  
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting  
other reasonable  commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it 
follows that a lender  should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont 
be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments 
without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Ms Es complaint.
I dont think that QuickQuid was wrong to give Ms E loans  one to four. Given the loan amounts,  
what was apparent about  Ms Es circumstances  at the time and her history with QuickQuid at that 
stage, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask Ms E for the amount of 
information needed to show  the lending  was unsustainable.  There  wasnt anything  in the 
information Ms E provided or the information  QuickQuid  shouldve been  aware of, which meant it 
wouldve been  proportionate for QuickQuid to start verifying what  Ms E said.
As our adjudicator explained, the position changed by loan five. Thats  because  the repayments 
for loans  five represented  a significant proportion  of Ms Es income.  In the circumstances, there 
was a significant  risk that Ms E wouldnt have  been able to meet her existing commitments  without 
having to borrow again  So, I think it was unlikely  that Ms E wouldve been able to meet the 
repayments for loan five or loan six for the same reason.  I dont think  that QuickQuid  should have 
give Ms E loans five and six.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids  lending history with Ms E, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point at which  QuickQuid should reasonably have seen that further lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised
that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Ms Es case, I think that this point was reached by loan seven.  I 
say this because by loan seven, Ms Es overall pattern of borrowing suggested she had become  
persistently reliant on short-term loans.  Ms E had taken seven loans in almost seven months and the 
amounts she was borrowing  had increased. Loan seven and its top-up  was for more than double the 
amount of loan one.
Whilst the amounts  Ms E borrowed from loan seven onwards varied, in my view, the pattern of 
lending shows that the loans  were unsustainable.  Ms E wasnt making any real inroads  to the 
amount she owed QuickQuid.  Loan 14 was taken out over two years after Ms Es first loan with 
QuickQuid and it was for a larger amount.  Ms E had paid large amounts  of interest to, in effect, 
service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended period.
I think that Ms E lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan seven 
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Ms Es indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period  of time.  And the 
sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Ms Es ability to access  
mainstream credit  and so potentially kept her in the market  for these  high-cost loans.
So, in addition  to upholding loans five and six, Im also proposing to uphold the complaint about  
loans seven to 14.
Ref: DRN46164635putting things right  what I intend  to ask QuickQuid  to do
refund all interest and charges Ms E paid on loans five to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans  five and six from Ms Es credit file;
the number of loans  taken from loan seven onwards means  any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So all entries about loans seven to 14 should  be removed from Ms E s 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must 
give Ms E a certificate showing how much  tax its taken  off, if she asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I intend to uphold  Ms Es complaint in part and direct
