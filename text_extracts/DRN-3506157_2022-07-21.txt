DRN-3506157
The complaint
Mr R and Mr Y complain about Ageas Insurance Limiteds proposed settlement for their 
contents insurance claim.
Mr Y, while a joint policyholder, was not involved in the claim process I therefore wont be 
referring to him in my reasoning below.
All references to Ageas also include its appointed agents.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The terms and conditions of the policy say a consumer can choose to use their own 
supplier, or cash settle, a claim. However, the policy sets out in this instance that 
Ageas will only pay what it would cost to use its network of suppliers. This is a 
common feature in a lot of policies. And its not unusual for an insurer to have 
agreements with suppliers and contractors to provide services at agreed rates.
The policy is only required to indemnify Mr R and provide a suitable replacement 
item. I understand Mr R may not want to use Ageas preferred supplier, and he has 
the option to take a cash settlement to buy a bike from a place of his choosing. But 
Ageas is entitled to pay out only the cost it would incur  as set out in the terms and 
conditions.
So for these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr R and Mr Ys complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R and Mr Y to 
accept or reject my decision before 18 August 2022.
