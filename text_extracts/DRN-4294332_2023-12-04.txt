DRN-4294332
The complaint
Mr G complains that he is required to provide a one time passcode (OTP) when shopping 
online using his credit card held with NewDay Ltd. 
What happened
Mr G complains that he is unbale to use his NewDay credit card for online purchases 
because he lives in a remote area with no mobile phone signal and doesnt receive OTPs. 
He complained to NewDay and said he thought it should offer an alternative method for him 
to receive the OTP.
In its final response, NewDay said that in order to make a purchase online, it needed to have 
customer authentication before it could approve the transaction to protect customers from 
fraud. NewDay said it had sent the OTP to Mr G at the correct mobile number and that 
although it could see that the OTP hadnt been delivered, there was no evidece to suggest 
that this was because of any error by NewDay.
Mr G remained unhappy and brought his complaint to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He said there was no evidence to suggest that 
NewDay had made any errors, and that there was an alternative option for Mr G to verify his 
purchases via the app, which only required interne access and not mobile phone coverage.
Mr G didnt agree. He said hed downloaded the app but a requirement for setting up the app 
was the receipt of an OTP, so he hadnt been successful in setting it up. Mr G said that other 
lenders had a telephone system to verify online purchases and he thought NewDay should 
be required to offer him this method.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay has explained that it is required by law to authenticate customers before it can 
authorise online payments. It has explained that it can allow customers to create a list of 
trusted retailers so that OTPs are not required every time a customer shops online with that 
retailer, but says that in order to add a retailer to the trusted list, authentication with a OTP 
will be required for the first transaction with the retailer.
Ive reviewed the information held by NewDay in relation to Mr Gs account. I can see that 
NewDay holds the correct mobile number and email address for Mr G, and that the OTP is 
being sent correctly.
I can also see that NewDay has looked into why Mr G isnt receiving OTPs. It says that 
OTPs are expiring before they reach Mr G, which is most likely because his device is out of 
range.
I appreciate that this must be frustrating for Mr G. However, Im satisfied that NewDay is 
required under the relevant regulations to have these authentication measures in place. The 
method of authentication is a matter for NewDay and this service isnt able to require it to 
use a particular method. So whilst I understand the point that Mr G makes about other 
lenders using different methods of authentication, this isnt something I can require NewDay 
to do.
Having reviewed the information from NewDay, theres nothing to suggest that NewDay has 
made an error when sending the OTPs to Mr G. It has used the correct details. Because 
NewDay hasnt made an error, Im unable to say that it should take any further steps here.
I can see that NewDay has offered Mr G an alternative option for verifying his purchases via 
the app. Mr G has said that he hasnt been able to use the app because it requires a OTP to 
set it up. It should be possible for Mr G to receive a OTP when he is an area with mobile 
phone coverage, so he could set up the app at this time. Once the app is set up, it requires 
internet access rather than mobile phone coverage, so Mr G should be able to use it.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 January 2024.
