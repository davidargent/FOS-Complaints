The complaint
Mrs J complains that Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Limited (LV) unfairly cancelled 
her motor insurance policy. 
What happened
Since at least June 2018, Mrs J had a motor policy with LV. The policy renewed 
automatically for each of the years from June 2019, 2020, and 2021. The policy was set to 
renew automatically for another year from June 2022.
On 15 May 2022, LV emailed Mrs J a renewal confirmation. LV said it would take the 
premium of about £250.00 on 13 June 2022 from a payment card. The policy was to cover 
Mrs J as policyholder and her husband as a named driver.
On 10 June 2022, LV emailed Mrs J with the policy documents including an insurance 
certificate.
On 14 June 2022, LV emailed Mrs J with notice that it would cancel he policy unless she 
made payment by 21 June 2022. Mrs J didnt respond.
On 22 June 2022, LV emailed Mrs J to say it had cancelled the policy.
On 15 August 2022, police stopped Mrs J in her car on suspicion of driving it with no 
insurance.
Mrs J complained to LV that her bank was saying that it hadnt received a request for 
payment on 13 June 2022. 
By a final response dated 23 September 2022, LV turned down the complaint.
Mrs J brought her complaint to us in mid-October 2022.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She thought that LV 
had acted fairly and reasonably towards Mrs J.
Mrs J disagreed with the investigators opinion. She asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. She says, in summary, that:
In 2021, her payment card ended in 3252 but in 2022 it ended in 2932.
Either LV or her bank are at fault over the non- payment. 
She has never disputed missing the emails. 
The issue left her out of pocket as follows:
hire of car to get home after stopped £200.00
police fee for impounding and releasing car £160.00
fuel going to retrieve car (approx.)  £ 30.00
taxi from car hire drop-off to car pound £  20.00
fine (plus 6 penalty points) £300.00
Total £710.00
Her insurance has increased.
She had countless sleepless nights, upset and general mental stress. 
She is now worried about speeding, red lights etc. as further points could result in a 
ban.
The police told her that another person had just been stopped because their payment 
hadnt gone through either. She wonders if that was also with LV.
She has used the same bank account for nearly 30 years. All cards she used are 
hers and linked to that account. 
She has recently rung the bank. It told her that in 2018, a card ending in 4238 was 
used to take payment. In 2019, 2020, and 2021 the card ending in 3252 was used.
LV hadnt previously used the card ending in 2932.
In 2022 the card ending in 2932 was allegedly declined.
Mrs J also complained to her bank and brought that complaint to us. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that that complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that LV requested payment 
from the bank.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
LVs policy terms included the following:
10. Cancellation Our rights to cancel your insurance 
Well cancel your insurance by giving you 7 days notice if:

 you dont pay the premium or a monthly payment when weve asked for the money 
by a certain date; 

Well send you a letter or email letting you know the cancellation date and the reason 
why were cancelling your insurance. If youve just taken out the policy or renewed 
and havent paid any premiums, well cancel your insurance back to the start/renewal 
date
Mrs J had told LV that her preferred method of contact was email. LV had emailed her 
before without any reported problems. 
LV has told us that for the years from June 2018, 2019, and 2020, it took payment from a 
card ending 2932 but for the year from June 2021, it took payment form a card ending 3252. 
But I prefer the search evidence provided to us by the bank. That says that in June 2018, LV 
took payment from a card ending 4238 and in June 2019, 2020, and 2021, it took payment 
from a card ending 3252.
LV has shown us an email dated May 2022 saying that it was going to take payment from a 
card ending 2932. But its not clear to me that LV had that card number at that time.
LV issued a certificate of insurance in anticipation of the renewal.The bank has shown us statements showing more than sufficient funds and some other card 
payments in mid-June 2022. 
LV has shown us a screenshot dated 13 June 2022 saying that it requested the payment. 
But I prefer the search evidence provided by the bank. That says that LV didnt request 
payment on either the card ending 2932 or the card ending 3252. Ive noted that the card 
ending 3252 expired in November 2021. Ive said that its not clear to me that LV had the 
card number ending 2932 in June 2022.
In any event, Mrs J hadnt made payment to LV. So LV emailed Mrs J the seven-day notice 
of cancellation and (after that period expired) it emailed the confirmation that it had cancelled 
the policy. LV has given us the exact times at which Mrs J opened those emails. So I 
consider that she ought reasonably to have realised that LV had cancelled the policy and 
she needed to take action to contact LV or to get insured with another provider.
So I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct LV to compensate Mrs J for the problem with 
the police many weeks later in August 2022. I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct LV to 
do any more in response to this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Limited to do any more in response to this 
complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 May 2023.
