The complaint
Mr A is unhappy with how MotoNovo Finance Limited dealt with his request for assistance as 
a result of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
What happened
In March 2018, Mr A was supplied with a used car through a hire purchase agreement with 
MotoNovo. He paid a £2,000 deposit and the agreement was for £12,175 over 60 months, 
with 59 monthly repayments of £277.55, and a final payment of £278.55.
Mr As income had been affected by Covid-19 and, on 22 April 2020, he applied to 
MotoNovo for a payment deferral (otherwise known as a payment holiday). And MotoNovo 
granted this.
In June 2020, MotoNovo contacted Mr A to tell him that his payment deferral was coming to 
an end. And, during a phone call on 14 July 2020, MotoNovo incorrectly told Mr A that the 
original deferral had been agreed for the May to July 2020 payments. Mr A asked MotoNovo 
to extend the payment deferral for three months i.e. to September 2020, and he completed 
the paperwork for this on 16 July 2020. 
However, MotoNovos process also required Mr A to phone them after hed submitted his 
application for a deferral. Which he didnt do. Despite this, MotoNovo agreed a deferral to 
cover the payments for June to August 2020, which theyve said was done in error.
On 27 August 2020, MotoNovo sent Mr A a text message, telling him that his deferral period 
was coming to an end, and he would need to start making payments. On a phone call on 6 
October 2020, Mr A told MotoNovo that hed left the country in late-August 2020 due to the 
death of a close relative. At this point Mr A was incorrectly advised that the deferral had 
been set up for six months, and an arrangement was made to repay the deferred payments 
over the remaining term.
In January 2021, Mr A complained to MotoNovo that theyd been recording arrears on his 
credit file since September 2020. While MotoNovo initially said that this was an error and the 
credit file would be amended, they later changed their position. Mr A wasnt happy with this, 
and he brought his complaint to us for investigation.
Our investigator said MotoNovo had provided Mr A with some incorrect information about his 
payment deferral. And that Mr A had submitted the necessary forms to extend the deferral 
period to six months, which is what he believed had been agreed. She also said that, in the 
call on 6 October 2020, no arrears were mentioned, and Mr A was told that six payments 
had been deferred.
While the investigator said that MotoNovo hadnt granted Mr A a full six month payment 
deferral, because of the conflicting information he was provided with, had it been made clear 
to him that the September 2020 payment needed to be made, he most likely wouldve paid 
this. So, she didnt think it was fair that MotoNovo record this missed payment as arrears.
MotoNovo didnt agree. They said that the missed payment marker was due to Mr A not 
making the September 2020 payment, for which there was no deferral agreement in place. 
And because they only misadvised Mr A that there was a payment deferral in place to cover 
this payment in October 2020, after the payment had been missed, they dont think that they 
should amend his credit file.
MotoNovo also said that Mr A failed to contact them after completing the paperwork for 
extending the payment deferral, which was a choice or error on his part. So, they dont 
think they were responsible for this. Because MotoNovo didnt agree, this matter has been 
passed to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same overall conclusions as the investigator, and for 
broadly the same reasons. If I havent commented on any specific point, its because I dont 
believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
In considering this complaint Ive had regard to the relevant law and regulations; any 
regulators rules, guidance and standards, codes of practice, and (if appropriate) what I 
consider was good industry practice at the time. Mr A was supplied with a car under a hire 
purchase agreement. This is a regulated consumer credit agreement which means were 
able to look into complaints about it. 
The basic facts of this case arent disputed, so I wont repeat them here. While MotoNovo 
have acknowledged that they gave Mr A incorrect information, Im satisfied that the crux of 
this matter is whether Mr A shouldve been reasonably aware that he was required to make 
the payment for September 2020.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published guidance that came into effect on 27 April 
2020, as to how firms like MotoNovo should deal with customers whose incomes had been 
affected by Covid-19. The guidance said that a firm should grant the customer a payment 
deferral for 3 months unless the firm determines (acting reasonably) that it is obviously not in 
the customers interests to do so. 
MotoNovo have confirmed that, on 22 April 2020, they agreed to defer Mr As payments for 
April and May 2020  a two-month payment deferral. However, they havent explained why 
they considered that it was obviously not in Mr As bests interests to agree this deferral for 
three months, in line with the FCA guidance.
The FCA issued updated guidance on 15 July 2020. This allowed MotoNovo to extend 
payment deferrals and grant up to six months in total. MotoNovo have confirmed that, on 14 
July 2020, Mr A had contacted them to ask for an extension to his payment deferral. Its not 
disputed that he was asked to submit an income and expenditure form, then call MotoNovo 
when this was done. And, while Mr A did complete the forms to apply for this payment 
deferral, he didnt follow this up with a call to MotoNovo. As such, MotoNovo didnt process 
his application. 
However, in what they call an administrative error, MotoNovo have confirmed that they 
provided Mr A with a further payment deferral to cover the payments due from June to 
August 2020. And, despite referring to this as an error, MotoNovo have honoured the second 
payment deferral, and didnt report the deferred/missed payments as arrears.Ive seen MotoNovos case notes for their contacts with Mr A. This shows that, on the call of 
14 July 2020, he was incorrectly told the payment deferral in place covered the payments for 
April, May, and June 2020. And, when he queried why hed received a text message telling 
him is payment deferral was coming to an end and a payment was due in in June 2020, he 
was told we message all our customers that are in deferrals, But the system doesnt 
recognise when the deferral is actually due to end [sic].
So, based on this information, Mr A would reasonably assume that he may receive incorrect 
messages telling him when the payment deferral is due to end and the next payment is due. 
And, given what hed been told about the period of the existing payment deferral, when he 
applied for a three-month extension to this, he wouldve also reasonably expected this to be 
for the payments due from July to September 2020.
Mr A received a further text message on 27 August 2020 telling him that his payment 
deferral was coming to an end and a payment was due. Im aware that he was out of the 
country at the time, attending a relatives funeral, but hed previously been told that the 
system doesnt know when a deferral is due to end. And he reasonably believed, based on 
what hed been told in July 2020, that the deferral extension was actually ending in 
September 2020. Given all these circumstances, I dont think it was unreasonable for Mr A 
not to contact MotoNovo at this time. Or to assume that a payment was actually due.
Mr A spoke to MotoNovo again on 6 October 2020. In this call he was again told that his 
payment deferral was for six months. So, he arranged for these six deferred payments to be 
added to the end of the agreement. At no point did MotoNovo explain that the payments had 
only been deferred for five months and, as such, there was one payment (for September 
2020) due immediately. Had they done so; Mr A wouldve had the opportunity to challenge 
the deferral period at this point and make the missed payment to avoid it being reported on 
his credit file.
Given all the above circumstances, Im satisfied that at no point before 6 October 2020 
should Mr A have been reasonably aware that the payment deferral was only for five 
months, not six, and that the September 2020 payment was due.
Whats more, Im not satisfied that MotoNovo applied the FCA guidance correctly in April 
2020. When Mr A applied for a payment deferral, the guidance was for this to be approved 
for three-months unless it wasnt in the customers best interests to do so. I havent seen any 
reason why it MotoNovo considered that it was in Mr As interests to have a two-month 
payment deferral, and not a three-month deferral.
As such, Im satisfied that the first deferral shouldve covered the payments for April to June 
2020. Whats more, Mr A submitted the paperwork for a second deferral period in July 2020. 
While he didnt phone MotoNovo after hed submitted this, MotoNovo didnt follow up on the 
application either. And I wouldnt expect them to ignore an application just because a 
customer failed to follow this up with an immediate phone call.
Given this, and because MotoNovo actually granted a second deferral period (even though 
theyve said they did this in error because Mr A hadnt followed their process), Im satisfied 
that this second deferral shouldve covered the payments for July to September 2020. And, 
had this happened, the first payment Mr A was required to make wouldve been in October 
2020. And MotoNovo wouldnt have reported a missed payment to the credit reference 
agencies for September 2020.
So, Im satisfied that MotoNovo need to take further action.Putting things right
Ive seen that MotoNovo have already paid Mr A £50 compensation for their errors. So, I 
dont think they need to pay any additional compensation. Therefore, MotoNovo should 
amend Mr As credit file to remove any reporting relating to the payment for September 2020 
being recorded as missed.
My final decision
For the reasons explained, I uphold Mr As complaint. And MotoNovo Finance Limited must 
follow my directions above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 September 2022.
