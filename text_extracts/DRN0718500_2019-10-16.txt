K821x#15complaint
Mr P says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
says he had taken  over 20 loans with Sunny over time and he had problems repaying them.  
He thinks Sunny shouldnt have lent to him. 
background
This complaint is about 23 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr P between  
December 2015  and July 2017.  Ive attached a table to the end of this decision that shows 
some of the information  Sunny has provided  about the lending. 
Sunny looked  at this complaint before it came to this Service.  It didnt think  that it had lent 
irresponsibly but it offered  to pay compensation of £25 to settle the complaint. Mr P didnt 
accept this offer.
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought Sunny shouldnt have approved 
loans 3 to 23. 
Sunny has responded to our adjudicator  and said that it shouldnt have approved any 
lending after loan 10. So it didnt fully agree with what  the adjudicator said and as no 
agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
Ref: DRN07185002There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Ps complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
Mr P has didnt  disagree with our adjudicators  opinion about loans 1 and 2. Because of this 
I dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about these loans. So I wont  be making  a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Mr P had with 
Sunny. So they are something I will take into account when considering the other loans he took.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 3 to 5 would most likely have 
shown that Mr P had a very low disposable income  after making the loan repayments.  He 
was also using other short term lenders and had been borrowing and repaying significant  
amounts in the recent past.  And he had recently  defaulted on some of his other  credit
All of these factors, taken  into consideration together, lead me to conclude  that Mr P was 
having problems  managing his money. I think that Sunny wouldve found out this information 
if it had made proportionate  checks.  And I think Sunny wouldve seen Mr P wouldnt  have  
been able repay the loans in a sustainable way. So I think  that Sunny shouldnt  have given  
loans 3 to 5 to Mr P and I think hes lost out as a result of this. So Im upholding Mr Ps 
complaint about  loans  3 to 5. 
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 23 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  
history with Mr P, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  Sunny should  
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
up to loan 6 the amounts Mr P was borrowing had been  generally increasing. This was largely  
because Mr P was taking out further  loans before repaying the ones he had. And going 
forward Mr P continued to take loans from Sunny often with very little or no break  in between;  
Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr P was having to borrow  
further to cover  the hole repaying his previous  loans was leaving in his finances and that 
Mr Ps indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
Ref: DRN07185003Mr P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 23 was taken out 
over a year and half after Mr Ps first. And it was for a larger amount. And Mr P took a long 
time to repay  these  loans meaning he was in debt to Sunny for over three years. Mr P had 
paid large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny over an extended period. 
I think that Mr P lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer  number of loans (loans  and deferrals)  was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ps ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost  loans
So, Im also upholding  Mr Ps complaint about loans 6 to 23 and Sunny should put things right.
Sunny has agreed  that it was wrong  to lend after loan ten. This is because  it thought  it was 
likely that Mr P had become reliant  on credit  at this point and so it shouldnt have approved 
any further loans.  This is an agreement  of sorts  but, put simply, in this case I think this was 
evident at an earlier point as Ive detailed  above.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr P paid on loans 3 to 23;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative  information about  loans 3 to 5 from Mr Ps credit file;
the number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded about  them  
is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 to 23 should  be removed from Mr Ps credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr P a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ps complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 November  2019.
