K821x#15complaint
Mr M has complained about short-term  loans granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as Quick  Quid (Quick  Quid  or the lender). Mr M says Quick Quid was 
irresponsible to lend to him. He says he struggled  to repay its loans and had to borrow  from 
other short term lenders  in order to so. 
background
Quick Quid agreed 14 loans for Mr M from March 2015 to September 2016. The amounts 
ranged between  £50 and £450,  and most were to be repaid over three months. Mr M asked 
for additional advances on most of his loans.  Ive summarised some of the information that 
Quick Quid provided about  these loans in the table  below.

Quick Quid provided what  it calls a monthly estimated disposable income  for each loan,  
which it says incorporated information Mr M provided and information about his monthly 
credit commitments  taken from credit reference agency checks.  I dont know  how this was 
calculated but I have also thought about  this information when making my decision.  
Our adjudicator found that Quick  Quid didnt carry out proportionate affordability  checks  for 
the loans from Mr Ms fourth  one onwards. And, had it done,  so it wouldnt have agreed to 
lend to him from November 2015  when he asked for a third additional advance on his sixth 
loan. Our adjudicator recommended  that Quick Quid refund the fees and charges Mr M paid 
for his loans  from this point onwards.  
Mr M agreed  with this recommendation. Quick Quid  disagreed with it and so the complaint 
has come  to me, as ombudsman, to review and come to a final decision.  
Ref: DRN36165712my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have also taken into account the law, 
any relevant regulatory  rules and good  industry practice at the time.  
Quick Quid didnt explain why it disagreed  with our adjudicators view.  Nor did it provide any 
further arguments or information for me to consider  beyond what it provided to this Service 
initially. The lender did say in its response  that that after 1 March 2015  it carried out 
appropriate and proportionate affordability assessments in line with the regulators guidance 
and, as Mr Ms loans were issued after this date, they were  not irresponsibly lent. Quick  Quid 
also provided a lengthy  explanation of its entire lending process in support of this argument. 
This Service has responded to Quick Quid on these generic arguments directly  and through 
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to address these points here, though I have  
considered them alongside everything else in making my decision. 
I would remind Quick  Quid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Ms complaint and what both parties have said 
about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr M borrowed the loans in question.  Bearing  in mind 
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect Quick Quid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
Ref: DRN36165713In coming to a decision on Mr Ms case,  I have considered the following questions:
did Quick Quid complete reasonable and proportionate checks when assessing each 
of Mr Ms loan applications to satisfy  itself that he would be able to repay the loan in 
a sustainable  way?
oif not, would those checks have shown that Mr M would have been able to do 
so? 
taking into account the short term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  
pattern of lending  increase Mr Ms indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
did Quick Quid complete reasonable and proportionate checks?  And, if not, what  would 
reasonable and proportionate checks more likely than not have shown?
Quick Quid recorded  Mr Ms income  throughout his borrowing history and ran credit  checks  
with a credit  reference  agency. I dont know what these checks  showed as Quick Quid hasnt 
shared the results of these. It did point out that there  were no county court  judgements 
recorded on its initial check and provided the credit scores returned  from its latest  check, 
though these on their own tell me very little about  Mr Ms financial situation. 
As mentioned, Quick  Quid provided what it calls a monthly estimated disposable  income for 
each loan. These figures taken individually dont immediately reveal that Mr M wouldnt be 
able to afford the loans, except perhaps  in the case of loans 6 and 8 where the loan term 
was less than a month and where  there was potentially a foreseeable risk that Mr M wouldnt 
be able to meet his repayments sustainably when considered on a pro-rata  basis. 
Our adjudicator found that Quick  Quids affordability checks werent proportionate from 
loan 4 onwards  and that from loan 5 Quick Quid ought to have taken  steps to independently  
verify the information  Mr M had provided for this and all his subsequent loans. As loans 4 
and 5 were for relatively low amounts (£50) I am prepared to give Quick Quid the benefit  of 
the doubt here in terms of the proportionality of its checks and conclude that they were 
proportionate for both loans. And so Im not upholding Mr Ms complaint about loans 1 to 5.
However, I am in agreement with our adjudicator regarding Mr Ms sixth loan application and 
beyond. When  Mr M applied for a sixth loan in November 2015, eight months after hed first 
applied for credit and for an increased  amount  (£150), I am of the view that Quick Quid 
ought to have considered that a pattern  of dependency might have developed and so it 
should have gathered a more comprehensive  picture of Mr Ms circumstances than it did.
By that point, November  2015, Mr M had owed  money to Quick  Quid almost continuously 
since early March. Quick Quid was obligated  to consider the risk to Mr M of him not being  
able to repay its loans  in a sustainable  way, in other  words without having to borrow  further 
or go without  to meet his repayments. If Mr M was dependent on its loans to meet his usual 
costs then he wasnt likely to be able to meet his loan repayments  out of that same  amount 
of normal income without experiencing financial difficulty, notwithstanding  its calculations of 
his disposable  income. And, bearing in mind its relationship with Mr M thus far, it ought to 
have investigated  his circumstances further  before  agreeing  to lend. But I cant  see that it did 
anything beyond what it did to check Mr Ms financial circumstances when he first came  to 
Ref: DRN36165714ask for credit. And so I dont think the checks were  proportionate for this loan or its 
subsequent further advances or top-ups.
Mr M went on to borrow a further eight loans  in 2016, most of which were topped up, and he 
made his last payment to Quick Quid  in January 2017. I think  Quick Quid ought to have 
looked into Mr Ms circumstances in more depth than it did each  time he asked for further 
credit, for the above reasons. 
So, Ive considered what Quick Quid was likely to have learnt  had it carried  out reasonable 
and proportionate checks when Mr M applied for his sixth loan onwards. 
As shown  in the loan table Mr M topped up nine of his loans, three of them more than once. 
Hed applied  for his sixth loan of £150  in early  November 2015. He then topped  this up with 
an additional  £50 on the 19th of the month, and a further two amounts of £75 on the 22nd and 
23rd eventually owing  £418 which he needed to repay in two instalments - £33 on the 4th of 
December and £385 on the 18th of December. 
Agreeing these advances  left Mr M owing £418  to be repaid over 25 days, potentially  from 
an amount of £470 (based on Quick  Quids monthly  estimates on a pro-rata basis). I dont 
think it was reasonable  to lend to Mr M on this basis without looking further into his 
circumstances given  the potential risk to him of not being able to meet  his repayments 
without having  to borrow again.  Mr M went  on to borrow again from Quick Quid about two 
weeks later.
Mr M hasnt  been able to provide this Service with his bank  statements  but based  on 
information this Service has seen of his circumstances, I understand that he was borrowing 
from at least four other  short term lenders  during  the time he borrowed from Quick  Quid and 
throughout 2016. Mr M told us that at one time he had up to 15 separate  loans with up to 8 
payday loan companies and the result of managing  his finances in this way led him into 
financial hardship. I think its fair to conclude  that 2016 was a difficult year financially for 
Mr M. And I think,  on balance,  its likely Quick Quid would have concluded  similarly, had it 
done more to assess the affordability of its loans  for him.
There is another consideration which leads me to uphold Mr Ms complaint from this point 
onwards, which  I will now discuss.
taking into account  the short term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ms indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise 
harmful?
Mr M started  out by borrowing £100  in March 2015.  By that November this had increased to 
£350. And his final loan in September 2016 was for £450. It seems to me Mr Ms overall 
indebtedness to Quick Quid was increasing over this time and in a way that wasnt 
sustainable for him, given the number  and frequency of the loans.
Quick Quid says that there were breaks  of time between loans which  demonstrated a lack of 
financial dependency. However,  I dont  think there  is an absolute figure for the length of gap 
that signifies a dependency  on such credit  or one that signifies a lack of dependency. I am 
likely to view a gap of one or two pay cycles differently to a gap of a year. But my 
conclusions about  what a gap might signify will depend on the circumstances of the 
consumer and the particulars of the lending relationship. 
Ref: DRN36165715In this case, most of the gaps in lending were for about two weeks. There  was a longer gap 
of about six weeks  between Mr M repaying loan 11 and applying for loan 12. But at that point 
Mr M had been borrowing  from Quick Quid for well over a year,  and I dont think  its 
reasonable for Quick Quid to conclude that he wasnt dependent on its loans at that stage.
Quick Quids website  states that: 
Short-term loans are designed  to help you bridge the gap between paydays  so that you can 
take care of any unexpected expenses. If you need  a quick cash  advance to cover 
unexpected expenses, a Quick Quid short-term loan may be an option for you. However,  you 
should not take out a short-term loan if you don't think you can pay it back on time, or if you 
are in need of a long-term financial solution. 
And;
Short-term loans should be used for short-term financial needs only,  and not as [a] long-
term financial solution. As a responsible lender, we do not encourage the frequent  use of our 
service.
When Mr M topped up his sixth loan for a third time,  it should have been obvious to 
Quick Quid at this point, if not before,  that he wasnt likely to be using these loans for 
unexpected short-term money problems and was probably in need of a longer term more 
suitable solution. And so I think it ought  to have stopped lending  to him at this point. 
I have noted that Mr M repaid some  of his loans early and therefore didnt pay the full 
amount of interest  he initially contracted to repay, but this saving (about £75) was more or 
less cancelled out by the £60 in late fees he paid. As Ive explained, Mr M was also 
borrowing from other short term lenders, which might explain the early loan repayments  as 
he borrowed  from one lender to repay another. 
Mr M paid about £280 in interest and late charges in the period over which  I am upholding 
his complaint. I understand that Mr M didnt repay the entire principal  he borrowed for his 
final loan having  contacted Quick  Quid in September 2016 to say that he was in financial 
difficulty. I dont know  the detail  of what happened after this but from the communications 
Ive seen it seems that that the lender wrote  off £115 of the principal amount borrowed and 
Mr M finally repaid his loan in January  2017. 
In considering the financial impact  of these loans,  which Ive concluded were irresponsibly 
agreed, I am not making any finding about the amount of interest Mr M paid to have access 
to this credit  over this period of time.  It is true that by repaying his loans early Mr M didnt 
pay as much interest as he would  have done had the loans run their full term. But agreeing 
this number of loans for Mr M eventually wasnt sustainable for him and I dont think its 
unreasonable to say that any interest he paid at this stage contributed to his overall  financial 
difficulties. So I think it is fair that Quick  Quid refunds the interest  and charges he paid for 
these. I also think its fair that it deducts the £115 that was written off, should it choose to do 
so. Mr M did after all have the use of this money  and putting  him back into the position he 
would have been in, had the lending not been  agreed, means he wouldnt have had access 
to these funds.
I have also thought about the impact of these lending decisions on Mr Ms credit record.  I 
think the number  and frequency of the loans may have  had and will, potentially,  continue to 
have implications for Mr Ms ability to access mainstream  credit  because the presence of 
Ref: DRN36165716these short-term loans  on his credit file is likely  to be viewed negatively by other lenders. So 
I think the lender  ought to return Mr Ms credit  file to what  it would have shown, had it not 
agreed this number of loans  for him. 
in summary
To sum up, I dont think Quick Quid gathered enough information to reasonably assess 
Mr Ms ability to make  his loan repayments in a sustainable way from his final advance on 
his sixth loan.  I havent  made a finding on the affordability of these loans individually,  
however I have found that beyond this point, Quick Quid  ought  to have concluded that it was 
irresponsible to keep  lending to Mr M. It should have seen that he appeared to be dependent  
on its loans for purposes other than to meet  unexpected  expenses  and was probably in need 
of a longer-term  solution. 
As a responsible lender,  Quick Quid wouldnt have agreed to any further credit for
Mr M, given  that this would increase his indebtedness and potentially impact  negatively on 
his creditworthiness.  Therefore, I think Quick  Quid was irresponsible  to have agreed  his third 
advance on loan 6 and all further loans for him. 
what Quick Quid should  do to put things right
Quick Quid should:  
-refund all interest  and charges (including  late fees) Mr M paid for these loans from his 
third advance  on loan 6 (agreed  on the 23 November  2015)  onwards;
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to the 
dates of settlement;
-remove all information about these loans from Mr Ms credit file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick  Quid to take off tax from this interest. Quick Quid  
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I partially uphold Mr Ms complaint and require CashEuroNet 
UK LLC trading  as Quick Quid to put things right as Ive set out.
 
 Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 April 2019.
