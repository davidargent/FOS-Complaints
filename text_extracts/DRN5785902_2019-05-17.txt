K820x#14complaint
Mr H is unhappy that The Equine and Livestock  Insurance Company Limited (Equine) wont 
cover the full cost of a claim made under  his pet insurance policy  for vets fees.  
background
Mr H took out an annual pet insurance policy on 18 November 2017.  His dog was unwell and 
he called  Equine  on 17 October 2018  to submit a claim and request authorisation for the vet 
to carry out further  tests.  The claims assessor  incorrectly informed Mr H that cover  was for 
£6,000 in relation to vets fees. The limit was actually £5,000. In a further  call on 8 November 
2018, another claims assessor explained that Mr H would be entitled to claim a further 
£6,000 following renewal of the policy on 18 November 2018.
The claim was accepted by Equine for the policy limit of £5,000.  But due to the error made 
by the claims assessors in providing  information  to Mr H, after further review of those calls, 
Equine decided  to pay fees up to the limit of £6,000 instead of £5,000 (the actual limit). 
Initially, the excess of £95 was deducted but Equine later decided  it would also refund the 
excess paid by Mr H due to the errors made.  
Although Mr H was told he could claim again in the new renewal year, Equine confirmed he 
had been given incorrect information. It said it had paid a further £1,000 in recognition of the 
error that was made. But it also said no further cover  was available  upon renewal of the 
policy for the same illness or condition. 
Unhappy with Equines response, Mr H brought the complaint  to this service. Our 
investigator looked into the complaint  and didnt uphold it. He thought Equine had applied  
the terms and conditions of the policy fairly  and the offer made in recognition of the errors it 
made on the phone  calls is also fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the case. 
Mr H asked for an ombudsman to make a decision. So the complaint has been passed to 
me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The claim has been accepted by Equine  and settled. But theres a dispute about how much 
Equine has decided  to settle  on as it hasnt paid the full cost of the fees incurred by Mr H on 
the claim.  So the key issues I now need to decide  on this case are:
Whether the terms and conditions  of the policy have been  applied fairly in relation  to 
the full cost incurred by Mr H; and 
Whether the offer made by Equine  is fair in light of the errors  that were  made.  
terms and conditions
Ive looked at the policy document  which relates to the period of the claim  this covered the 
period from 18 November 2017 to 17 November 2018. 
Ref: DRN57859022The section on vets fees states the cover limit for this would be £5,000.  This will cover  the 
cost of treatment and/or  complementary treatment up to 365 days from the date of each 
injury, illness  or condition which first showed clinical signs. There was an excess payment of 
£95. 
Under the section   Policy wording, section 1 says:
Time Limited  Cover
We pay up to the amount  shown in Your policy schedule for treatment and/or 
complimentary treatment  undertaken  as a result of an injury, illness or condition 
occurring during the policy terms,  subject to cover being in force and the relevant 
premiums have been received by us.
The amount  in the relevant policy schedule shows that cover was for a maximum amount of 
£5,000 and was available  for each injury,  illness  or condition for up to 365 days.
On the same  page, exclusions  are listed, one of which  say there  would be an exclusion for:
Costs incurred, treatment  received or prescribed for use more  than 365 days  after 
your pet first displayed clinical signs of an injury, illness or condition.
Looking at the relevant terms and conditions, Im satisfied  that it was made  clear  what  would 
be covered, what the limit would be and what exclusions  applied for a claim made for vets 
fees. 
offer
Equine made an offer to Mr H taking into consideration  that it made errors in providing  
incorrect information to him on two phone calls. 
Ive looked at what would have happened  had the error not occurred. In this case, Equine 
would have covered Mr H up to a limit of £5,000 for vets fees resulting from treatment for 
the injury, illness  of condition of his dog. 
But the error did happen and Equine has accepted responsibility for this. It apologised, paid 
a further £995 on top of the £5,000  maximum limit. This included  a £95 fee for a neurology 
consultation that happened after 18 November 2018 (when the policy had been renewed for 
the following  year).  
Additionally, the £95 excess was also refunded to Mr H in recognition  of incorrect  information 
being given to him. 
In total, Mr H received  a payment  of £5995 for the policy  period  November  2017/2018  and a 
refund of £95 for the consultation fee relating to the new renewal period covering  November 
2018/2019. 
In its final response of 20 March 2019,  Equine also confirmed it would consider any fees 
incurred after 18 November 2018 until 16 October 2019 up to a further £6,000. I appreciate  
theres a dispute  about the outstanding fees equine declined to pay of £1851.05. But these 
would exceed  £6,000  that was already paid and as they incurred before 18 November 2018,  
Equine declined  to pay this additional  amount.  Im satisfied that Equine has considered the 
Ref: DRN57859023error it made  in the phone calls fairly  in paying  a further £1,000  than it should because  of 
that error.  Im also satisfied that it hasnt  acted inappropriately  in declining to pay the full cost 
incurred.
conclusion
Overall, Im not persuaded that Equine has acted  inappropriately by not accepting  to pay the 
full cost of the vets fees incurred by Mr H. It did accept responsibility for the errors  made  
and honoured  to pay £1,000 more than the £5,000 cover limit on the policy. It also refunded 
the excess payment  of £95. 
Equine, therefore, doesnt need to do anything further as I think it has acted  fairly  and 
reasonably in the circumstances  of this case. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint against The Equine and 
Livestock Insurance  Company Limited. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 June  2019.
