Miss S complains  Lloyds  Bank Plc updated  her passbook with a transaction  she didnt make.  
background
Miss S is represented by a friend but for ease of reading Ill just refer to Miss S.
In January 2017, Miss S made a £400 withdrawal, in branch. On checking her passbook  she 
saw her balance  was £500 less than she thought it would be. On further checking she saw 
the previous transaction  wasnt clear,  as another transaction  had been  printed on the same 
line. The transactions were both for £500, one made  in October 2014, which Miss S said she 
recognised. But the other,  again for £500,  dated  September 2014; Miss S disputed  as she 
said this wasnt showing in her passbook,  at the time she made  the transaction in 
October 2014. She complained to Lloyds and wanted it to compensate her for the amount 
she believes  should still be in her account.
Lloyds said her passbook  and balance were correct  and that she hadnt  suffered any loss. 
But it did accept Miss S had received poor customer service, in the handling  of her 
complaint. And had offered  compensation of £150  for the inconvenience  and the expense  
she had incurred whilst it dealt with the matter. 
Miss S didnt think this was fair and referred her complaint to us. Our investigator didnt 
uphold the complaint. She said Lloyds had shown the relevant transactions had been  made.  
Miss S didnt accept  this view. She said that the transaction had been made without the 
passbook being  present.  And that Lloyds hadnt  been able to produce the withdrawal slip to 
show shed made  the transaction.  She also added that the time the transaction,  in 
September 2014, was made  was too early  for her to have been able to get into the branch.  
She asked  for an ombudsman to review her complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I dont uphold  this 
complaint. I know this isnt the answer Miss S was hoping  for, so Ill explain why.
I have looked  at the evidence Miss S has given  the copy of her passbook. This does show  
a couple of transactions had been  printed across one another.  On closer inspection, they are 
both cash withdrawals of £500 each, one 5 September 2014  (the disputed  transaction) and 
the other 24 October 2014. 
Ref: DRN11912222Lloyds has also sent its record of the transactions.  For ease of reading I have tabled the 
transactions below:
Date of 
TransTime of 
Trans Amount Balance
17.01.2014 09:38:54 £400 £3548.38
05.09.2014 09:56:54 £500 £3048.38
24.10.2014 10:06:35 £500 £2548.38
14.01.2017 14:05:16 £400 £2148.38
 
Miss S said she couldnt get to the branch at the time the disputed  transaction  in 
September 2014 was made.  But the first transaction made in January 2014,  which  isnt in 
dispute, was made  at a time earlier  than the disputed one. So, I dont agree with Miss S 
argument that she wouldnt have been  able to get to the branch at the time the disputed 
transaction was made as she had done  so before.
Miss S has also said the details given to her, by Lloyds, show  the transaction was made 
without the passbook being  present. The transaction details Lloyds gave her have a without 
passbook mnemonic  identifier,  against  which WB is noted. Miss S has interpreted this as 
identifying that the transaction was made  without her passbook.  But this same  marker  is 
showing for all of the transactions, even those  not in dispute, which Miss S said were made 
using her passbook.  I have checked with Lloyds and the WB is the identifier  that shows  the 
transaction was made with the passbook.  And, if the passbook hadnt been  used, the 
identifier would have shown NIB , which means Not in Book. So, I think  the passbook was 
used when all of the transactions were made.
So, the disputed  transaction should  have been  visible on Miss S passbook,  at the time,  she 
made the transaction in October 2014, unless it was added  retrospectively. Lloyds has said 
when a passbook  is updated after the transaction was made,  there would be an update  
notation made on the passbook. No such notation is showing in Miss S passbook.
Miss S has asked for sight of the withdrawal slip to confirm she made the transaction. I can 
see Lloyds have tried to get this document, but because of the time that has passed it hasnt 
been able to recover the item. I dont think this is unreasonable given it keeps this type of 
record, usually, for only three  years  and the transaction was made  over three  years  ago.
So, I dont think there is any evidence to show that the transaction wasnt made at the time it 
says in Miss S passbook. And Miss S has had her passbook to make further undisputed 
transactions since then.  I do understand how upsetting  this has been  for Miss S and she has 
now lost confidence  in the balance  of her passbook. But Ive seen nothing  to show that the 
balance shown is incorrect. So I dont think  it would  be fair to ask Lloyds to pay the disputed 
amount to Miss S.
Lloyds has accepted that its handling  of her complaint could have been better and has 
offered Miss S £100 for the inconvenience  caused and £50 to cover her expenses for visiting 
the branch. This service  doesnt have the power to look into how a complaint was handled,  
so its for Miss S to decide if she wants to accept Lloyds offer.
Ref: DRN11912223my final decision
My final decision is I dont  uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 July 2019.
