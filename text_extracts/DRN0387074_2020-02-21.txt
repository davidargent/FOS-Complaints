K821x#15Miss M says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about 41 payday  loans  Sunny  provided to Miss M between  July 2015  and 
November 2018.  Ive detailed Miss Ms first 8 loans below,  and the subsequent loans taken 
were all of varying amounts between £50 to £500,  with no significant  break  in the chain  of 
lending. Each loan was due to be repaid over 6 instalments and the last loan was taken on 3 
November 2018.
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Repayment
1 25/07/2015 04/08/2015 6 £300 £97.03
2 10/09/2015 19/02/2016 6 £150 £43.13
3 14/09/2015 18/03/2016 6 £100 £76.49
4 02/10/2015 18/03/2016 6 £150 £122.46
5 23/02/2016 20/07/2016 6 £300 £176.16
6 21/03/2016 20/07/2016 6 £100 £130.28
7 05/05/2016 20/07/2016 6 £50 £145.34
8 21/07/2016 01/10/2016 6 £400 £132.94
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Ms complaint and thought  the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed with this saying it carried out proportionate 
checks. It did however  agree that loan 17 onwards shouldnt have been given to Miss M and 
made an offer on these  loans. The offer was put to Miss M but she did not accept it and said 
that loan 5 onwards shouldnt have been  given to her. 
Whilst the case was awaiting an ombudsman review Sunny made another offer  this was to 
refund interest  and any charges on loans  13 onwards. It also offered to amend Miss Ms 
credit file. This offer was put to Miss M but she did not accept it. 
As no agreement could be reached, the complaint  assed to me  an ombudsman   for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss M could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN03870742the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to more when it approved  loans 1 to 4. Miss M 
didnt disagree  with this so I won be making further  findings on them.
However, our adjudicator  thought that for loan 5 Sunny hadnt done enough. And that 
proportionate checks wouldve  shown Miss M was having issues  managing her money. I 
agree with this and Ill explain why. 
Sunny says it carried out checks on Miss M when  she applied for loan 5. These  included  
gathering details about her income and all her expenditure, including short  term lending  
commitments. Sunny  says these checks didnt reveal anything of concern and loan 5 was 
affordable as Miss M had adequate disposable  income. 
However, I think if Sunny had reacted effectively to the information it had gathered and taken 
steps to obtain  a clearer, more accurate picture  or Miss Ms finances it wouldve  seen  that 
Miss Ms existing borrowing was significant. Miss M had two outstanding loans with other  
lenders that were due to be repaid. And she also had loans 3 and 4 with Sunny still running. 
So taking all of this into account I think if Sunny had carried out a more  detailed assessment 
I think it wouldve been obvious Miss M was not in a position to take on loan 5 and repay  it in 
a sustainable  manner.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN03870743Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ms case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss M was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss M had taken  out 6 loans  within 3 months.  So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Miss M was having  to borrow  further to 
cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that 
Miss Ms indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
From  6 onwards Miss M was often  provided  with a new loan within  days  of settling a 
previous one. 
Sunny  says that up until loan 17 it carried out adequate checks and the amounts 
Miss M was borrowing didnt always go up. It also says that on average for each loan 
she wasnt required to use more than 11% of her income  to meet  repayments. But 
Miss M wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Sunny. Miss Ms last 
loan was taken  out over two and half years after her first. So Miss M had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Miss M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ms ability  to access  mainstream  credit  and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loan 5 and loan 6 onwards and and Sunny should  
put things right.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss M paid on loans 5 to 41;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Miss Ms credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 41 should be removed from 
Miss Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Elevate Credit International Limited  to take off tax from this 
interest. Elevate Credit  International  Limited must give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
Ref: DRN03870744For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Miss Ms complaint. Elevate  Credit  International 
Limited should pay put things right for Miss M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman ask Miss M to accept or reject  my decision 
before 21 March 2020.
