K820x#14complaint
Mr M is unhappy  that TransferWise  Ltd facilitated  a fraudulent transfer from his TSB bank 
account. 
background
Mr M was a victim of a fraud where a fraudster transferred  £9,000 from his TSB bank 
account to a third party, via TransferWise,  in June 2018. 
TSB accepted responsibility for what happened  it refunded £9,000. And because  it 
refunded the money a day later than it ought  to have done, it added £300.00 to compensate 
Mr M. It also said it would  consider any further  losses Mr M could evidence caused by the 
late refund. 
Mr M remained unhappy  he thought  TransferWise was equally  responsible  for allowing the 
fraudulent transfer  to go through.  And he doesnt believe hes been adequately 
compensated for what went wrong. 
In January 2021, I sent a provisional decision which explained why I didnt think  
TransferWise needed to do anything to put things right. Neither Mr M nor TransferWise  
responded to my findings with anything  to add by the deadline  given, so its been passed to 
me to make a final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Given that neither Mr M nor TransferWise 
responded to my provisional findings,  I see no reason to depart from my decision to not 
uphold this complaint.  For completeness, Ive explained my reasoning again: 
Mr M blames  TransferWise for the fraudster being able to complete the transfer.  Its 
not for me to tell TransferWise exactly how to verify its customers.  And I note that 
here, the fraudster  was able to get past TransferWises security questions because  
they already had a lot of Mr Ms personal  and account information. Indeed, it seems 
TransferWises involvement was one part of a sophisticated operation  involving 
hacking Mr Ms phone and his TSB account. 
So I dont think I can reasonably say that its TransferWise fault that this happened   
that blame more  squarely falls with the fraudster. And even I thought  differently,  my 
role isnt to punish TransferWise for what happened. Instead its to put Mr M back  in 
the position he wouldve have been  had this not have  happened.
£9,000 was stolen from Mr Ms TSB account. It seems TSB refunded this a few days 
after he reported the fraud   so Im satisfied  thats already been put right. 
Mr M says he suffered other losses too  hes mentioned cancelled travel  plans  and 
a concert ticket. But hes provided  no evidence of how being without the £9,000 for a 
few days directly  caused these losses. 
Mr M also mentioned the moral damage  and the inconvenience of all the spam 
emails hes received as a consequence of what happened. It must  have  been  terrible  
Ref: DRN60996272for Mr M to have  such  a significant amount stolen. And I think the £300 TSB awarded  
is a fair reflection  of the distress of being  without the money for a few days. But, for 
the reasons Ive already  explained, I dont blame  TransferWise that someone tried to 
defraud him  so I cant  ask it to compensate him for that undoubtedly  horrible 
experience. 
It follows that I think Mr Ms losses, that could reasonably be TransferWises  
responsibility, have  already  been  put right.  So I dont ask it to do anything  further. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to Mr M to accept  or 
reject my decision  before 16 March  2021.
