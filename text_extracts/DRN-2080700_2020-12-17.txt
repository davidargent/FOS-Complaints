The complaint
Miss W has complained that she was given a loan of £2,000 by Madison CF UK Limited 
trading as 118118 Money (118 Money) when she only wanted a loan of £1,300. 
What happened
Miss W was offered a pre-approved loan of £2,000. She only wanted a loan of £1,300 but 
the on-line application wouldnt let her change the amount. On a call to 118 Money, she was 
told to accept the higher amount and it would be changed to £1,300. So she accepted the 
loan. But £2,000 was sent to her bank account while she was on the call.
On the calls to 118 Money, Miss W was told that she could pay back £700 of the loan and 
reduce the monthly repayments or keep them the same. Or she could cancel the loan 
completely without paying any interest as long as the money was repaid within the 30-day 
cooling off period. Miss W said she wanted to cancel the loan. The calls were long and 
lasted over 90 minutes in total. But 118 Money emailed her with what to do. Miss W didnt  
repay the loan though, or make payments to it and because of this, 118 Money later issued a 
default notice.
Miss W complained to 118 Money. She said she told the call handler that she wanted to 
make a part repayment of £700 and not repay the whole loan. She said that she tried to 
make a payment of £700 on the app but it wouldnt let her. She hadnt asked to repay the 
whole loan as she had used some of the money to pay off credit cards. Miss W said that she 
planned to discuss this with a manager, but he hadnt called her back as arranged.
118 Money replied on 23 August 2019. They said that they had offered to accept a part 
repayment of £700. Miss W had chosen to repay the full amount of the loan and cancel it. 
This had to be done by 21 September 2019  within the 30-day cooling off period. They 
apologised for the long waiting time on the call and agreed a goodwill payment of £50 for 
this.
Miss W complained to this service on 21 September 2019.
The investigator gave his view on 30 July 2020. He said that 118 Money had offered to 
accept a partial repayment of £700 or full settlement of the loan and cancellation of it. He 
said that if the £2,00 loan had been repaid, then a new loan of £1,300 could have been 
applied for. He did not uphold the complaint.
Miss W disagreed with the investigators view and asked for her complaint to be reviewed by 
an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive listened to the two calls between 118 Money and Miss W. The calls were long, but 
during them, the options to Miss W were laid out: either to repay part of the loan (£700) and 
make lower repayments for the remaining £1,300, or to repay the whole loan of £2,000 
within the 30-day cooling off period (by 21 September 2019). Miss W said clearly on both 
calls that she wished to repay the £2,000. In the second call, the call handler read out the 
cancellation rights, including 118 Moneys right to take legal action if the loan was not repaid. 
Miss W accepted these on the call. She asked for confirmation in writing and 118 Money 
said that would be done.
118 Money sent out the terms of the repayment to Miss W. I think these terms were clear - 
they set out what Miss W would need to do to withdraw from the agreement and how she 
would need to do this. They explained the consequences if Miss W didnt repay the loan. So, 
I think these were clear and told Miss W what shed need to do.
 
I appreciate that the first call Miss W had with 118 Money was long with considerable waiting 
times. This must have been very frustrating for Miss W. 118 Money accepted this and have 
paid compensation of £50, which I think is fair. A manager did not call Miss W the next day 
as it had promised. But this doesnt mean to say that what 118 Money did was wrong in 
terms of asking her to repay whats outstanding. 
118 Money set out the options to Miss W and she clearly said she wanted to repay the loan 
in full. And they let her know the terms on which she could do this, both on the call and in 
writing. Miss W did not repay the loan and so 118 Money were entitled to take further action 
to recover what she borrowed, including sending a default notice. I realise thatll have an 
impact on Miss W, but it fairly reflects that she borrowed money and didnt pay it back  
having been told of the consequences of not doing so. So I cant ask 118 Money to take any 
further action here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint. Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118118 Money has 
already made an offer to pay £50 to settle the complaint and I think this offer is fair in all the 
circumstances.
So my decision is that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118118 Money should pay £50.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 14 January 2021.
