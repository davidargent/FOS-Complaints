K821x#15Complaint
Mr M complains Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent to him irresponsibly.
Background
Mr M took one running credit facility (RCF) and then 14 instalment loans. Ive included some  
of the information weve  received about these loans from Sunny in the table below.

The RCF (loan 1) allows a consumer to either request funds up to their agreed  credit limit in 
one go or take multiple drawdowns  up to their limit. Mr M had a credit limit of £500.  Each  
drawdown could  be repaid  via five monthly instalments. 
In our latest  assessment an adjudicator didnt think Sunny was wrong to have  granted the 
RCF or the first eight instalment loans. But he thought the remaining instalment loans (loans 
9 to 15) shouldnt have  been given. 
Neither Mr M nor Sunny have responded to the latest adjudicators view. But, Sunny had 
already accepted that something  may have gone wrong when it provided loans 12 to 15, so 
it agreed to refund interest on these  loans together with 8% simple interest. It also agreed  to 
remove loans 12 to 15 from Mr Ms credit file. Mr M wasnt happy with this offer.  
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed  to me for a final decision.
Ref: DRN66274102My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr M doesnt appear to disagree with our adjudicators findings that Sunny wasnt wrong to 
grant the RCF or loans  2 to 8. It seems  therefore that this lending  isnt in dispute  and so I no 
longer think that I need to make a finding about this lending. 
Ive also not considered whether Sunny should  have lent loans 12 to 15 as it has already 
agreed it shouldnt.  But for clarity Ive set out what Sunny has agreed to do for these loans  
which was in line with the adjudicators recommendation.   
So instead,  this decision will focus on whether Sunny  did anything wrong when it lent loans 9 
to 11. These  being the instalment loans lent between 3 April 2015 and 12 May 2015. But I 
have kept the other lending in mind  when thinking  about the overall lending  relationship 
between Sunny and Mr M. 
For the lending  that remains in dispute, Sunny had to assess  if Mr M could afford to pay 
back the amounts  hed borrowed  without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which 
was proportionate to the circumstances.  Sunnys checks could have taken into account  a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments 
and Mr Ms income and expenditure. With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr M. These  factors include:
Mr M having a low income  (reflecting  that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being  especially high (reflecting that it could be more  difficult 
to meet a higher  repayment from a particular level of income);  
Mr M having a large number of loans and/or having these loans  over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr M coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also  
suggestive of the borrowing becoming  unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr M.
Ref: DRN66274103Sunny was required to establish whether Mr M could sustainably repay his instalment loans 
 not just whether he technically had enough money  to make his repayments. Having 
enough money to make  the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mr M was able 
to repay  his loans  sustainably.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. The 
Financial Conduct  Authoritys (the industry  regulatory)  says in the Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC) states payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and in particular, made  on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and 
without having  to borrow to make  them.  If a lender realises, or ought reasonably  to have 
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, 
then it follows that it should  conclude those  repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Ms complaint.
Ive considered the overall pattern of Mr Ms lending  history with Sunny, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  like the adjudicator, I agree that this point 
was reached by loan 9. I say this because:
By loan 9 it was almost six months into the lending relationship with no significant  
breaks between loans. Mr M had drawn  down six times  under the RCF and then taken  a 
further eight instalment  loans, some of which overlapped. In my view, Mr Ms loan 
history up until this point was a clear  indication that his underlying financial situation 
didnt seem  to be improving; 
Mr M took some  loans  shortly after having repaid previous ones. For example, loans 4, 
7 and 9 were each  taken out shortly after repayment of previous loans. And loan 5 was 
taken out within  two weeks of repayment of loan 4. 
So Sunny ought to have  realised it was more  likely  than not Mr M, on these occasions,  
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole the repayment of the previous loans had 
left in his finances and that this was indicative  of his indebtedness not being sustainable;
The RCFs drawdowns and the instalment loans show a broadly similar  pattern of 
borrowing. Mr M took a total of £500  through the first two drawdowns  under the RCF in 
October 2014, followed by a further £300 in November 2014. And through his instalment 
loans, in January 2015 Mr M borrowed £300 followed  by £500 in both February and 
March 2015 and then a further £500  in April  only a matter of days  after repaying  the 
loans hed taken  in March.
I think its more  likely than not that this consistent  pattern  of borrowing over the period 
showed that Mr M didnt  just have a short-term cash-flow  problem or was likely  
borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall  in his income  but to meet an ongoing need. 
   
Mr Ms lending history was prolonged with loans  10 to 15 showing a similar level of 
indebtedness as earlier lending. Loan  10 was for £500  followed by a further £300 in May 
2015 and then £500 in June 2015.  The amount of time that Mr M spent indebted to 
Sunny meant that he was servicing  a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
Ref: DRN66274104I think that Mr M lost out when Sunny provided loans 9 to 15 because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit over an extended  period and;
the sheer  number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ms ability  
to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Ms complaint about loans 9 to 15. And Ive set out what  Sunny should 
do to put things right as detailed below.
Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund all interest  and charges Mr M paid on loans 9 to 15;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove loans 9 to 15 from Mr Ms credit file entirely, this is because  the period  of time 
Mr M owed Sunny  money  means  that any information  still recorded  about these loans is 
adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ms complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2020.
