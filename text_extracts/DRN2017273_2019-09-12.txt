K821x#15complaint
Mr O complains that MYJAR Limited lent to him in an irresponsible manner.
background
Mr O took out 23 loans with MYJAR between March 2014 and December 2017. Loans 
one to 18 and loan 20 were payday  loans. Loans 19 and 21 were instalment loans repayable 
over six months. Loans 22 and 23 were instalment loans  repayable  over 12 months. A 
summary of Mr Os borrowing  with MYJAR is set out in an appendix to this decision.  Mr O 
hasnt repaid all that was due in relation to the final loan. 
Mr O says that MYJAR didnt identify  that hed become  reliant on these  loans and that they 
made his financial  position worse.  He wants a refund of interest and charges, with interest. 
Mr O also wants  adverse  information removed from his credit  report.  
In response to Mr Os complaint, MYJAR made an offer of redress  in relation to loans 
two to 18. Mr O didnt respond to that offer. MYJAR says its happy  to honour its earlier offer 
to Mr O. 
One of our adjudicators assessed  Mr Os complaint. She said that, in addition  to its offer in 
relation to loans  two to 18, MYJAR should  pay Mr O compensation in relation to loans 19-23. 
That was because by loan seven, the overall pattern of Mr Os borrowing suggested hed 
become persistently reliant on short-term loans.  She set out what she thought MYJAR 
should do to put matters  right. 
MYJAR didnt agree  with the adjudicator. It said that the adjudicator  hadnt  explained how 
shed come to her conclusion or what evidence shed relied on. As there was no agreement 
between the parties,  Mr Os complaint was passed to me, an ombudsman,  to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
MYJAR has already  made an offer to Mr O in relation to loans two to 18, which  its confirmed 
its content to honour. So, Im looking at whether that offer goes far enough and also whether  
it treated Mr O fairly  in relation to loans one and 19-23.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr O 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN20172732the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
MYJAR was required to establish whether  Mr O could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading Irresponsible Lending guidance  and later 
the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Os complaint.  Ive looked at the dates of the loans 
and noted the gap of over six months between Mr O repaying loan 19 and taking out loan 
20. Ive thought carefully about  this. However, when  Mr O repaid loan 19 in October 2015, 
hed  been borrowing from MYJAR  for over 18 months. And when he came  back  to borrow 
again I understand  that MYJAR didnt do anything substantially differently to assess  the risk 
of the repayments  being unsustainably  affordable than what  it had done  when he first 
borrowed from it. I havent seen anything from either party that suggests  Mr Os situation 
had improved in the intervening time. I dont think that the gap in borrowing between loans 
19 and 20 is such that it broke the chain of borrowing. So, Im dealing  with one chain of 
borrowing here. 
I dont think that MYJAR was wrong  to give Mr O loan one. Given  the loan amount, what  was 
apparent about  Mr Os circumstances at the time and his history with MYJAR at that point, I 
dont think it wouldve been  proportionate for MYJAR to ask Mr O for the amount  of 
information needed to show the lending was unsustainable. There  wasnt  anything in the 
information Mr O provided  or the information  MYJAR  shouldve  been aware of, which meant  
it wouldve  been proportionate for MYJAR to start verifying what  Mr O said at that stage.  
Ive looked at what MYJAR  has said about the steps  it took before lending  to Mr O and the 
checks it carried out. Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Mr Os lending history  with 
MYJAR, with a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have 
seen that further  lending  was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  And so MYJAR should  
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Ref: DRN20172733Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Os case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
seven. I say this because from loan seven onwards and with the exception of the gap 
between loans 19 and 20, which Ive addressed above, Mr O was provided with a new loan 
within weeks of settling  a previous one. So MYJAR  ought to have realised it was more likely  
than not Mr O was having  to borrow  further  to cover  the hole repaying his previous  loan was 
leaving in his finances and that Mr Os indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr O wasnt making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed MYJAR.  Loan 23 was taken out 
three years and nine months after Mr Os first loan with MYJAR and it was for a much larger 
amount. Mr O had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to MYJAR over 
an extended period.
I think that Mr O lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan seven  
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended over an extended period  of time. And the 
sheer number of loans  was likely  to have  had negative implications on Mr Os ability  to 
access mainstream credit. So, they kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So I dont  think MYJARs offer goes far enough  in that from loan seven  onwards it should  
also remove any negative information from Mr Os credit file and it should  compensate  Mr O 
in relation to loans 19-23. 
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans two to 23 and write off any 
outstanding interest and charges on loan 23;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
deduct from the refund and interest  above any capital sum still due in relation to loan 
23 and pay Mr O the balance; 
remove adverse information about loans two to six from Mr Os credit  file, as its 
offered to do; 
the number  of loans taken from loan seven onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans seven  to 23 should be removed 
from Mr Os credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr O a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Os complaint  in part. MYJAR  Limited  should  
pay Mr O compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 October  2019.
