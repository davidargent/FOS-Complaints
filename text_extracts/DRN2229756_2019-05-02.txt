K820x#14complaint
Mrs H says Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) mis-sold her an Current  Account Plus 
packaged bank  account. Shes used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to complain.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mrs Hs complaint and didnt think  Barclays had 
mis-sold the packaged  account. The CMC asked  for an ombudsmans  decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mrs Hs complaint. 
I think Mrs H freely  chose  to take the Current Account Plus.  And having looked  at her 
circumstances at the time, I think that Mrs H was eligible  for and couldve used  the main  
benefits included  on the Current Account Plus.
Equally while Im open to the possibility  Mrs H wasnt provided with everything  she shouldve  
been, I havent seen anything to suggest  clearer information wouldve changed her decision to 
take the account in the first place. So, in these circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mrs Hs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs H to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 June  2019.
