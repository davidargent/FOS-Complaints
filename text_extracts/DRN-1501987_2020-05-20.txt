The most recent adjudicator to look at the case upheld Mr Ts complaint and thought the 
loans 4-9 shouldnt have been given to Mr T. The adjudicator didnt think loans 4 to 7 
shouldve been given as Mr T was having issues managing his money. And she didnt think 
loan 8 and 9 shouldve been given as by this point Mr T had become reliant on short term 
lending.
Sunny didnt agree with the view, explaining that it carried out adequate checks. But it made 
an offer on loans 6 to 9. This offer was outlined to Mr T but he chose not to accept it.
As no agreement could be reached, the complaint was passed to me  an ombudsman  
for a final decision.
my findingsIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach 
to complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and 
good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr T could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny 
should fairly and reasonably have done more able for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
an loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult 
to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of 
time during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that 
repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming,unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to 
establish whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication 
a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow 
this is the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly 
and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments 
sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in 
this context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to do any more when it lent Mr T loans 1 to 3. Mr 
T didnt disagree with this so I wont be making further findings on these loans, but I have 
considered them when looking at Mr Ts borrowing history and his financial situation overall.
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ts complaint and said that loans 4 to 7 shouldnt have 
been given he would not be able to sustainably repay them. Sunny didnt agree, and said 
it carried out a sufficient and robust assessment of Mr Ts circumstances.
I think if Sunny had carried out proportionate checks it wouldve seen Mr T had existing 
short-term loans, all taken out within months of each other and which were running when Mr 
T applied for his fourth loan. Two of these existing loans were with Sunny and he had others with at least two other short-term lenders. Based on these loans its reasonable to say that 
Mr T was having issues managing his finances. So I think Sunny shouldve considered this 
before providing loan 4 as Mr T was not in a position to sustainably repay his loans. 
Sunny says non of Mr Ts loans are outstanding and given Mr Ts income its unreasonable 
to say loan 4 onwards shouldnt have been given to him. I appreciate Mr T had a relatively 
high income, but by loan 4 Sunny shouldve been looking to build a clearer picture of Mr Ts 
situation. Mr T wouldve had multiple loans running concurrently and I think this information 
shows he was not managing his finances well and was potentially becoming reliant on short 
term lending and using it to cover on-going shortfalls in his finances. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ts case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr T was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr T had taken out 8 loans in just around 7 months. Some of Mr 
Ts loans were also overlapping. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely 
than not Mr T was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous 
loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ts indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Mr Ts first loan was for £950 and his subsequent loans varied in 
amount considerably. But most importantly there didnt seem to be a downward trend 
in the amount Mr T was borrowing, and by loan 9 Mr T was borrowing £950 again. I 
think Sunny ought to have known that Mr T was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need.
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 9 
was taken out 9 months after Mr Ts first. Mr T had also paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 
six onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ts ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So Im also upholding the complaint about loans 4 to 9 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr T loans 4 to 9. Sunny should:
refund all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans 4 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement; remove any negative information about loans 4 to 7 from Mr Ts credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 8 and 9 should be removed from Mr 
Ts credit file.
 
HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if Mr T asks for one.
 my final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Ts complaint. Elevate Credit International 
Limited should put things right for Mr T as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman ask Mr T to accept or reject my decision before 
17 June 2020.
