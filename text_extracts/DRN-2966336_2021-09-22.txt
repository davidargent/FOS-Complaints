The complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refused to refund him for an item he 
bought that was significantly not as described.
What happened
Mr P says he bought an item that was significantly not as described. He says the seller of 
the item agreed to refund the item and said that he could keep the item. Mr P says he then 
raised a dispute via PayPal and says he should not have been required to send the item 
back in order to be refunded. He would like a full refund of the purchase as well as 
compensation for what took place.
PayPal says the item was bought by Mr P in November 2020 and he raised a dispute with it 
in February 2021. It says it asked Mr P to return the item and provide it with delivery 
evidence which would have allowed it to refund the money in line with its user agreement. 
PayPal says Mr P didnt provide the return delivery information and so closed his claim.
Mr P brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought PayPal was entitled in line with the user agreement to ask for the return delivery 
evidence which Mr P didnt provide. And in those circumstances PayPal was entitled to 
reject Mr Ps claim.
Mr P doesnt accept that view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint.
PayPals user agreement requires a buyer to provide evidence of a return of an item 
significantly not as described before it will process a refund. Im satisfied that information is 
made clear in the agreement between Mr P and PayPal and that Mr P would have agreed to 
that condition when the agreement started.
Im satisfied that PayPal told Mr P that he needed to provide the return delivery evidence 
and gave him a reasonable time period for doing so. Im also satisfied that Mr P didnt 
provide the required information and, in those circumstances, I dont think PayPal made a 
mistake or acted unfairly by refusing to refund the money.
I appreciate Mr P questions why he should have paid for the return costs but that is not 
something I can fairly hold PayPal responsible for, as that requirement is made clear in the 
user agreement.
Overall, Im satisfied that PayPal has acted in line with the agreed user agreement and 
hasnt made a mistake.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2021.
