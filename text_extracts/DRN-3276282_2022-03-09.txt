The complaint
Mrs C complains that Advance Payment Solutions Limited (trading as Cashplus) was 
irresponsible to lend to her.

Mrs C also had two Credit Builder accounts with Cashplus  from December 2015 and from 
September 2018. Mrs C has agreed that this complaint is about the loans detailed above.
Mrs C says she was already struggling financially and in an Individual Voluntary 
Arrangement (IVA) when she applied for the loans. She says she found the repayments 
really difficult and eventually couldnt sustain them or her Credit Builder payments. Mrs C 
says it negatively affected her credit file and caused her a lot of stress.
Cashplus says it carried out rigorous affordability analysis including monthly credit reports 
and a review of other outstanding debt. It says it took into account Mrs Cs monthly income 
and its checks did not indicate the lending was unaffordable. As well as the above loans, 
Cashplus says Mrs C had two Credit Builder accounts  one from December 2015 and the 
other from September 2018. It says the first was settled in January 2017, whilst the second 
defaulted in May 2019. Cashplus says no error was made in approving any of the credit.
Our adjudicator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. He found it likely that 
Cashpluss checks would have shown Mrs C was in an IVA before loan 1 and so should not 
have approved any of the loans. He added that Mrs Cs pattern of lending itself indicated the 
loans were unsustainable by loan 7. Our adjudicator recommended that interest and charges 
should be refunded on all the loans (plus 8% interest) and that adverse information about 
loans 1 to 6 should be removed from Mrs Cs credit file. He further recommended that loans 
7 to 11 should be removed from Mrs Cs credit file in their entirety.
Cashplus responded to say, in summary, that it did see an IVA on Mrs Cs credit record but 
that it was over 18 months old with no indication of an outstanding balance. It added that 
Mrs C had no other adverse information on her file and she met its underwriting criteria for 
the lending. Cashplus says Mrs C repaid all the loans on time which indicates it was a fair 
lending decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Cashplus needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs C 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Cashplus should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers net income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
make any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customers been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Cashplus was required to establish 
whether Mrs C could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer 
could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. 
This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mrs Cs complaint.
Loans 1 to 6
Cashplus had information about Mrs Cs income at the time of loan 1 and also carried out a 
credit check. I accept it says its affordability checks showed Mrs C met underwriting criteria, 
but I consider the information it saw on her credit file should have led Cashplus to have 
carried out further checks. I say that because it acknowledged it saw an IVA from 18 months 
earlier, so I find it should have verified its status. If it had done so, it would have found the 
IVA was active from June 2014 and was still active throughout the lending, until March 2020.
So I consider Cashplus should have reasonably known Mrs C was already in an insolvency 
arrangement and that it was irresponsible to have approved further lending.
Loans 7 to 11
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Cashpluss lending history with Mrs C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Cashplus should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Cashplus should have realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Cs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
Mrs C had applied for seven loans within six months with few gaps between loans;
Mrs C wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Cashplus. Loans 4 to 
11 were all for the same amount;
Mrs C had paid a lot of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Cashplus for an 
extended period.
I think that Mrs C lost out because Cashplus continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Cs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period;
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mrs Cs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for high-cost loans.
So Im upholding Mrs Cs complaint about loans 1 to 11 and Cashplus must put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Cashplus should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it refused to lend to Mrs C, as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. For example, having been declined this lending Mrs C may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and this particular lender (with regard to the Credit Builder account) which she 
may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow 
the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Mrs C in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mrs C would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Cashpluss liability in this case for what 
Im satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. Advance Payment Solutions Limited (trading as 
Cashplus) should:
A. Refund all the interest and charges Mrs C paid on loans 1 to 11 with interest of 8% 
simple a year from the date they were paid to the date of settlement*
B.Remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs Cs credit file in relation to loans 
1 to 6. The overall pattern of Mrs Cs borrowing from loan 7 onwards means any 
information recorded about these loans is adverse, so Cashplus should remove 
loans 7 to 11 entirely from Mrs Cs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Cashplus to deduct tax from this interest. Cashplus
should give Mrs C a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if she asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 April 2022.
