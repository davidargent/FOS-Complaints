The complaint
 Mr K complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wont refund payment for a 
damaged item. He would like a refund.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so  I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons:-
I appreciate Mr K didnt provide the full information PayPal required to support his 
complaint within the timescale PayPal requested. However, Mr K did provide 
evidence from the courier company to say the goods were damaged, a screen shot 
of an online conversation from a windsurf retailer and photos of the goods. So, I think 
he did evidence an issue with the goods.
Mr K then did provide an independent report. This confirmed structural damage to the 
windsurf with a recommendation that the merchant cover the cost of a replacement. I 
appreciate this report was provided by 23 April 2021 when PayPal had asked for it by 
2 April 2021. But Mr K has explained that due to the current health situation he was 
unable to get the report by 2 April 2021. Given the closure of shops and facilities I 
dont think this delay was unreasonable. And I think PayPal should have taken this 
into account.
As Mr K did provide the necessary information to show damage to the goods I think 
its reasonable that PayPal refund the full cost of the surf board (2349 Euros). If 
PayPal wants the damaged board returned it should cover the cost of this. Also, on 
proof of cost, PayPal to refund the cost of the independent report. And pay the 150 
Euros compensation our investigator recommended for the inconvenience caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that uphold this complaint.  In full and final settlement of this complaint 
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should:-
Refund the full cost of the windsurf board (2349 Euros)
Refund, on proof of cost, the report Mr K commissioned for PayPal
Pay Mr K 150 Euros compensation for the inconvenience
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 October 2021.
