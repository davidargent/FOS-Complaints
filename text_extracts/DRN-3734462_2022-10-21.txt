The complaint
Mrs A complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refused her request for refunds after 
she raised claims under its Buyer Protection policy.
What happened
In late 2018 and early 2019, Mrs A used her PayPal account to purchase some skin 
lightening products from a seller online. Miss A contacted the seller several times because 
the products didnt seem to be working. She says she was told to be patient and more 
batches would be sent. 
Mrs A tried to obtain a refund from the seller but was unsuccessful. In June 2019, Mrs A 
raised disputes for three transactions under PayPals Buyer Protection policy, using the 
category significantly not as described.
PayPal accepted Mrs As claim for the transaction she made in March 2019. But it denied 
her claims for the two transactions she made in November 2019. It said this was because 
she had submitted the disputes after its 180 day deadline.
Mrs A complained to PayPal, but it maintained its position, so she asked our service to 
consider the matter. Our investigator looked into Mrs As concerns but didnt think her 
complaint should be upheld. He thought PayPal had treated Mrs A fairly, in line with its 
terms. 
Mrs A disagreed with our investigators outcome. She said the seller was a scam company, 
which had falsely advertised products that were fake. She said PayPal had connected her to 
a scam company. She didnt think PayPals 180 day rule applied because her rights as a 
consumer had been violated. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mrs As complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPals user agreement says that buyers may be eligible for a refund under its Buyer 
Protection policy, in certain circumstances, if the purchase is not received or is considered 
Significantly Not as Described.
The user agreement lists the requirements a purchaser must meet to be eligible for PayPal 
Buyer Protection, including:
Open a dispute in the Resolution Centre within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, 
then follow our online dispute resolution process.
I can see that Mrs A opened disputes with PayPal for transactions she made on 18 and 28 
November 2018. However, she didnt do this until 2 June 2019, which was more than 180 
days after she sent the payments. Given what it says in PayPals user agreement, I think it 
was reasonable for PayPal to have declined these two claims.
Mrs A strongly believes that she was a victim of a scam. Shes provided a number of 
documents to show that the seller made false claims about the products it sold her. She 
believes PayPals 180 day rule shouldnt apply for scam companies. 
I appreciate my answer will be disappointing for Mrs A, but Im not persuaded that PayPal 
has an obligation to reimburse Mrs A outside of the 180 day time frame set out in its user 
agreement. I note that PayPal did refund her for the transaction she made within this time 
frame. So, Im satisfied that PayPal has acted fairly and reasonably.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mrs As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2022.
