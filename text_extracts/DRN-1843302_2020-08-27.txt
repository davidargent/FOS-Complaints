DRN-1843302
The complaint
Mr R complains that a patio door that he paid for using a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Shawbrook Bank Limited was misrepresented to him and about the quality of the installation 
of the door and windows.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr R says that the door was sold to him on the basis of increased security, he agreed 
to buy it because of its security features, the door supplied is different to the door that 
was sold to him and that he wouldnt have bought the door that was supplied to him;
hes also complained about the quality of the installation of the doors and windows 
and about other issues arising from the installation;
I can understand Mr Rs frustration that he hasnt received the door that he was 
expecting but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
supplier agreed to provide him with a door that had different features to the door that 
was supplied to him;
the loan agreement refers to the goods and services as being Windows Patio Door 
and the price and payment arrangements were clearly set out in the agreement;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the door was 
misrepresented to Mr R so I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Shawbrook Bank to refund to Mr R any of the money 
that hes paid for the door and windows;
the investigator asked Shawbrook Bank to arrange for the installation of the door and 
windows to be inspected by an independent expert and that took place in March 
2020;
the inspection report says that the door is faulty and recommended that it be 
replaced and quoted a cost of £1,484 for the required work;
the investigator recommended that Shawbrook Bank should make those repairs and 
that it should pay Mr R £200 for the distress and inconvenience caused  Shawbrook 
Bank has accepted the investigators recommendation;
Mr R says that he should receive a refund for materials that he paid for but werent 
used  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that hes been 
charged for unused materials or that the supplier agreed that it would make such a 
refund to Mr R;
I consider that its fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Shawbrook Bank to 
arrange and pay for the repairs to the door and window that were recommended in 
the inspection report and to pay £200 to Mr R to compensate him for the distress and 
inconvenience that hes been caused; and
I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Shawbrook Bank 
to refund to Mr R any of the payments that hes made under the agreement for the 
door and windows, to reimburse any other amounts to him or to take any other action 
in response to his complaint.
Putting things right
I find that Shawbrook Bank should arrange and pay for the repairs to the door and window 
that were recommended in the inspection report and to pay £200 to Mr R to compensate him 
for the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused.
 My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Rs complaint in part and I order 
Shawbrook Bank Limited to:
1. Arrange and pay for the repairs to the door and window that were recommended in 
the inspection report.
2. Pay £200 to Mr R to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes 
been caused. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 September 2020.
