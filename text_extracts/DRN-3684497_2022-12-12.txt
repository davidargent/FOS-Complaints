The complaint
Mr T complains that NewDay Limited, trading as Aqua, wont refund to him the amount that 
he was charged for a suit. 
What happened
Mr T used his NewDay credit card to pay for a suit when he was overseas in October 2020. 
He says that the cost of the suit was 5,636 currency units but he was charged 56,360 
currency units and he didnt notice the discrepancy because the screen on the card machine 
was tiny. He says that he returned the suit and was told that hed receive a refund but he 
had to return to the UK and no refund was received.
He made a claim to NewDay in January 2021 and he says that it refunded the payment of 
£1,532.65 to his account in February 2021 but took the money from his account again in 
May 2021. He complained to NewDay but it said that the merchant had challenged its 
chargeback claim and provided evidence of the receipt for the transaction. It also said that it 
had considered Mr Ts claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 but had 
been unable to proceed with the investigation as evidence wasnt provided to support his 
claim that there had been a breach of contract. Mr T wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that 
NewDay had sufficient evidence to say that the amount that Mr T had been charged was 
incorrect or that the item had been returned, so he didnt think that any chargeback wouldve 
been successful. He thought that NewDay had reached a reasonable conclusion and that it 
had handled the chargeback fairly. He didnt think there was sufficient evidence to say that 
Mr Ts contract with the supplier was breached or that a misrepresentation had occurred so 
he thought that NewDay had reached the right outcome on Mr Ts section 75 claim.
Mr T has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that this has 
given him depression and anxiety and that his complaint hasnt been understood. He says 
that he didnt get the suit so he must not be charged any amount for it, the receipt is a fake 
and displays the shop workers name and the merchant hasnt provided its CCTV footage. 
He says that NewDay didnt conduct a proper investigation and favoured the merchant to get 
commission. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made but, if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made; 
NewDay made a chargeback claim because Mr T had raised a dispute with it in 
January 2021 for a payment of £1,532.65 that hed made in October 2020 and it 
credited that amount to his account in February 2021  but the merchant provided a 
credit card receipt and a handwritten receipt showing the charge of 56,360 currency 
units;
New Day said that the merchant had challenged the chargeback and provided 
evidence for the transaction made so it held Mr T liable for the payment and re-
applied the charge of £1,532.65 to his account in May 2021;
I consider that NewDay acted correctly by making a chargeback claim but it was 
defended by the merchant and I consider that it was reasonable for it to conclude that 
there was then no reasonable prospect of the claim being successful;
there was a delay in NewDays decision on the claim but Im not persuaded that it 
was enough to justify an award of compensation and I consider that it was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances for it not to have proceeded any further with the 
chargeback claim and to hold Mr T liable for the payment;
NewDay says that it also considered Mr Ts claim under section 75 and, in certain 
circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the 
supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ts complaint about NewDay, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the merchant and that NewDays 
response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of Mr Ts claim under section 75 as only a court would be 
able to do that;
Mr T says that the charge should have been for 5,636 currency units, that the receipt 
is a fake and that he returned the suit for a refund so he shouldnt be charged any 
amount for it;
our investigator looked into the name shown on the receipt and he says that it 
appears to be the name of a fashion designer and that the name on the receipt 
referred to the designer of the suit, not to another customer;
Im not persuaded that Mr T has provided enough evidence to show that the receipt 
is a fake and the amount shown on the merchants receipt is the same as the amount 
shown on the credit card receipt (which also includes Mr Ts name) and Mr T hasnt 
provided any other evidence to support his claim that he only bought a suit or that the 
charge for a suit was 5,636 currency units;
nor has he provided any other evidence to show that he returned the suit for a 
refund, that the merchant had agreed to refund any money to him or that he was 
entitled under his contract with the merchant to return the suit for a refund;
Im not persuaded that Mr T has provided enough evidence to show that theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the merchant and I consider that it was 
fair and reasonable in these circumstances for NewDay not to have upheld his 
section 75 claim; I dont consider that Mr T has provided enough evidence to show that NewDay didnt 
conduct a proper investigation and favoured the merchant to get commission or that 
it should have asked the merchant about its CCTV footage; and
I sympathise with Mr T for the issues that hes described, including the depression 
and anxiety that hes experienced, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require NewDay to refund to Mr T the payment that he 
made to the merchant, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2023.
