The complaint
Ms S is unhappy that NewDay Ltd provided new and further credit to her on multiple
occasions, all instances of which she feels werent affordable for her at those times.
What happened
In March 2017, Ms S successfully applied for a NewDay branded credit account (Brand A),
and NewDay provided her with a Brand A credit account with an initial credit limit of £600.
In September 2017, NewDay increased the credit limit on the Brand A account from £600 to
£1,000. Further credit limit increases followed: to £1,750 in January 2018, to £3,000 in June
2018, to £4,000 in September 2020, to £5,500 in January 2021, and to £7,000 in June 2021.
In August 2018, Ms S successfully applied for a second NewDay credit account (Brand P),
and NewDay provided her with a Brand P credit account with an initial credit limit of £900.
In May 2019, NewDay increased the credit limit on the Brand P credit account from £900 to
£1,000. Further credit limit increases followed: to £2,000 in August 2019, to £3,250 in April
2020, to £4,000 in October 2020, and to £5,000 in February 2021.
In June 2019, Ms S applied for a third NewDay branded credit account (Brand Z), and
NewDay provided her with a Brand Z credit account with an initial credit limit of £600.
In March 2020, NewDay increased the credit limit on the Brand Z credit account from £600
to £1,600. Further credit limit increases followed: to £2,100 in January 2021, and to £3,000
in June 2021.
In November 2020, Ms S successfully applied for a fourth NewDay branded credit account
(Brand M), and NewDay provided her with a Brand M credit account with an initial credit
limit of £600. In July 2021, NewDay increased the credit limit on this account to £1,000.
In September 2021, Ms S raised a complaint with NewDay because she felt that she hadnt
been able to afford any of the new or further credit that NewDay had provided to her, and
that this should have been apparent to NewDay, had they undertaken checks into her
financial position before providing the credit to her.
NewDay looked at Ms Ss complaint. They confirmed they had undertaken checks into
Mrs Ss financial position before providing credit to her, and they felt that in all instances
there hadnt been anything resulting from those checks that should have reasonably given
them cause to suspect that Ms S might not be able to afford the credit she was then offered.
Ms S wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. During their investigation NewDay made
an offer to reimburse some interest and charges that had been incurred on the accounts to
Ms S, and this resulting in NewDay making some reimbursement payments to Ms S.
However, Ms S still wanted her complaint considered by this service, and when our
investigator completed their review they felt that, in regard to all the provisions of credit, the
information that NewDay assessed should have given them causes to suspect that Ms S
might not be able to afford the credit, such that it shouldnt have been subsequently provided
to her. So, they recommended that this complaint be upheld in Ms Ss favour on that basis.
NewDay didnt agree with the view of this complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 23 August 2022, as follows:
Id like to begin by listing the provisions of new and further credit under consideration 
here in chronological order.

Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how 
much and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before 
approving a customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of 
credit available to a customer on an existing line of credit, the business would 
undertake reasonable and proportionate borrower focussed checks to ensure that 
any credit being offered to a customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
NewDay believe that they did that here, and note that at the time of the new account
application they took information from Ms S directly about her employment status and 
annual income, as well as obtained information about Ms S from a credit reference 
agency so as to get a better understanding of her wider financial position.
NewDay also note that before offering further credit to Ms S on her accounts, they 
reviewed how Ms S had been managing and maintaining her accounts up to that 
time, as well as obtained updated information from a credit reference agency about 
Ms S. And NewDay contend there was nothing resulting from any of these checks, at least up to November 2020, that they feel should have given them any reasonable 
cause to believe that Ms S might not be able to afford the credit she was  
subsequently approved for.
March 2017  Brand A account application
When Ms S applied for a new credit account with NewDay in March 2017, she told 
NewDay that she was employed with a gross annual income of £22,000. This 
equates to a net income of around £1,500 per month.
NewDay also assessed that Ms S had total existing unsecured debt at that time of 
£3,500. And while it is notable from Ms Ss credit file that there were two defaults on 
record, with a total default balance of £3,200, the most recent of those was nearly 
three years prior at the time of the application, and as such Im satisfied it was fair for 
NewDay to effectively discount these defaults and given more weight to Ms Ss more 
recent financial position.
To that effect, Ms Ss credit file showed that she wasnt in arrears on any of her 
existing credit commitments at that time, and she appeared to be managing her 
existing credit commitments without significant incident. And in consideration of all 
this information, I dont feel that it was unreasonable for NewDay to have felt that Ms 
S would in all likelihood be able to afford a new line of credit with the relatively low 
credit limit of £600 which they subsequently approved her for at that time.
September 2017  Brand A credit limit increase from £600 to £1,000
Its notable that in the months leading up to the credit limit increase in September 
2017 that Ms S appeared to have been managing and maintaining her Brand A credit 
account without incident. I say this because Ms S had generally maintained the 
balance of the account within the credit limit and hadnt incurred any overlimit of cash 
advance fees on the account, which can be considered as indicators of potential 
financial difficulty.
Additionally, Ms Ss credit file didnt show any significant increase on her amount of 
existing unsecured debt and continued to suggest that Ms S was managing her 
existing credit commitments without incident. As such, given the relatively small 
increase under consideration, I feel that it was reasonable for NewDay to have felt 
that Ms S would most likely be able to afford that credit limit increase and to have 
therefore offered it to her.
January 2018  Brand A credit limit increase from £1,000 to £1,750
In the months leading up to the credit limit increase in January 2018, Ms S continued 
to maintain the balance of the Brand A account within the credit limit and didnt incur 
any overlimit fees. And while Ms S did incur some cash advance fees on this 
account, the amounts withdrawn were relatively low and I dont feel were strongly 
suggestive that Ms S might have been struggling financially at that time.
In regard to Ms Ss credit file, while it was the case that one of her existing credit 
accounts was showing as being one month in arrears, her amount of existing 
unsecured debt wasnt showing as having increased, and there was no indication of 
Ms S using any payday loans or other indicators of potential financial difficulty 
present. As such, while the overall picture of Ms Ss financial position wasnt 
completely unproblematic here, it remained generally good, and I dont feel that it 
should have reasonably given NewDay cause to suspect that Ms S might not be able to afford the credit limit increase under consideration at that time, such that it 
shouldnt have been offered to her.
June 2018  Brand A credit limit increase from £1,750 to £3,000
I feel that the overall picture of Ms Ss creditworthiness begins to get murkier at this 
point. One reason I say this because by considering an increase of the credit limit to 
£3,000, NewDay would now be providing Ms S with five times the amount of credit 
she was initially approved for only 15 months earlier. Additionally, while Ms S was 
maintaining the balance of her Brand A credit account within the credit limit in the 
months leading up to the increase, she was utilising the majority of the £1,750 credit 
available to her on the Brand A account.
Furthermore, Ms Ss credit file continued to show that she remained in arrears on 
one of her existing credit commitments, and that her amount of overall existing 
unsecured debt was rising, albeit not excessively, to around £5,000. And its also 
notable that NewDay hadnt communicated with Ms S in person since the account 
application in March 2018 and hadnt updated their understanding of her income and 
expenditure since that time.
As such, I feel that the overall picture of Ms Ss financial position that can be taken 
from this information  including the high credit utilisation on the Brand A account, 
the continuing arrears on one of her existing credit commitments, and the increase in 
overall debt  should have given NewDay cause to suspect that Ms S might not be 
able to afford any further credit at that time such that further checks should have 
been undertaken by NewDay before increasing he credit limit.
NewDay did communicate with Ms S directly again two months later, in August 2018, 
when she applied for the second NewDay account. And at that time Ms S told 
NewDay she was employed with a gross annual income of £24,500, which equates 
to a net monthly income of about £1,650. Ms S also explained to NewDay at that time 
that she had monthly living expenses (which would include existing credit repayment 
commitments) of £700 and monthly accommodation costs of £495. And given that Ms 
S told this to NewDay in August 2018, I feel that had NewDay undertaken further 
checks into Ms Ss financial position in June 2018, as I feel they should have done, 
they would likely have learned similar information.
Considering this information, its notable that Ms Ss monthly living and 
accommodation costs total £1,195, which when taken against her new monthly 
income of £1,650, meant that Ms S had monthly disposable income available to her 
of about £450. And given this amount of assessed disposable income when taken 
against the £1,250 credit limit increase under consideration here (which if fully 
utilised I dont feel would have reduced the disposable income amount available to 
Ms S by a significant amount), I feel that on balance it would have been reasonable 
for NewDay to have concluded that Ms S would most likely have been able to afford 
that further credit limit increase, such that I dont feel that NewDay acted unfairly 
towards Ms S by implementing that increase.
August 2018  Brand P account application
As discussed above, when Ms S applied for the Brand P account in August 2018, 
she told NewDay that she was employed with a gross annual income of £24,500. 
However, its notable that in the two months since the last Brand A credit limit 
increase in June 2018, Ms Ss total exiting debt amount had increased considerably, 
from £5,000 to £9,300.This is a significant increase, and given that NewDay have a responsibility to ensure 
that Ms S could sustainably afford to repay any new or further credit being offered to 
her, I feel its important at this point to determine roughly how much Ms S would have 
had to pay towards her existing credit commitments to be able to repay them in a 
sustainable way.
I would generally consider sustainable affordability to be where a consumer can 
afford to make monthly payments where at least as much capital balance is being 
repaid as is monthly interest. For credit balances where the annual interest rate is 
similar to those being provided to Ms S by NewDay here (approximately 30% APR) 
this roughly equates to a consumer being able to make monthly payments of about 
5% of the combined capital balance and monthly accrued interest amounts.
In the case of an existing unsecured debt balance of £9,300, this means monthly
repayments of approximately £475. Its notable that Ms S gave a monthly living 
expenses amount of £700. While this figure would include existing credit 
commitments, its unclear whether these were calculated using the criteria I outlined 
above or whether Ms S was making minimum monthly payments  although looking 
at Ms Ss Brand A management history from February to May 2018 (months where 
Ms S appears not to have taken further credit) it notable that her Brand A account 
balance wasnt reducing. And so, it appears more likely that Ms A was making 
payments towards the account closer to the minimum amount required to sustain the 
account without taking the balance of the account over the credit limit, rather than 
making payments to reduce the account balance.
It's also notable from the Brand A account data that, following the credit limit increase 
to £3,000 in June 2018, Ms As credit file no longer shows that any of her other 
existing credit commitments are in arrears  as had been the case for several months 
prior to that credit limit increase. This appears to suggest that Ms S may have used 
the further credit provided to her by NewDay to clear credit arrears elsewhere  using 
credit to repay credit  which I find difficult to consider as being sustainable and 
which is potentially another indicator of financial difficulty.
All of which means that I feel that the information that NewDay had available to them 
when considering Ms Ss application for the Brand P account should have given them 
cause to assess Ms Ss creditworthiness at that time in greater detail, and that if they 
had, it should have been apparent to NewDay that Ms S most likely wasnt in a 
financial position whereby she could sustainably afford any further credit at that time. 
And it follows from this that I do feel that NewDay did provide this credit account to 
Ms S irresponsibly such that Ill be provisionally upholding this aspect of Ms Ss 
complaint.
June 2019  Brand Z account application
When Ms S applied for the Brand Z account in June 2019, she told NewDay that she 
was employed with a gross annual income of £27,900, which equated to a net 
income of £1,845 per month. Ms S also declared monthly living expenses of £1,000, 
as well as monthly accommodation costs of £475. This left Ms S with declared 
disposable monthly income at that time of £370.
At that time, Ms Ss total amount of existing unsecured debt had risen to £13,400, 
which is approaching half of her gross annual income. And again, while Ms Ss 
declared living expenses would have included her exiting credit repayments, its 
unclear from that declared amount whether Ms S was making these payments in a sustainably affordable manner or not. It also should be noted that if we use the same 
criteria as previously explained to calculate sustainable affordable monthly payments 
on a balance of £13,400, this equates to £685 per month.
Also that in the first half of 2019, Ms S hadnt been making payments to her Brand A 
account large enough to reduce the balance of the account, and that the balance of 
that account had increased to close to the full £3,000 limit by June 2019, which I feel 
strongly suggests that Mrs A wasnt making sustainable monthly repayments to her 
exiting credit commitments.
At the very least I feel that the above should have prompted NewDay to have 
undertaken more detailed checks into Ms Ss financial position before approving her 
application for credit. And I feel that had NewDay undertaken more detailed checks  
which I feel should reasonably have included a review of Ms Ss current account 
statements for the months leading up to the application  then the information they 
would have gathered from those additional checks should have confirmed to them 
that Ms Ss financial position was such at that time that she wouldnt in all likelihood 
be able to afford any further credit at that time.
I say this because, having reviewed Ms Ss current account statements for the 
months leading up to the credit limit, its notable that in the two months immediately 
prior to the application Ms S had made payments of over £1,800 toward credit 
repayments, which equates to over £900 per month. Its also notable from the 
statements that Ms S began repaying a payday loan during that time, and that she 
regularly maintained the balance of her account in an overdrawn position.
As such, taking all the above into account, I dont feel that NewDay should have 
approved Ms Ss Brand Z account application, and Ill be provisionally upholding this 
aspect of this complaint in Ms Ss favour.
September 2020  Brand A credit limit increase from £3,000 to £4,000
In September 2020, NewDays most recent direct understanding of Ms Ss income 
was from the Brand Z application in June 2019, when Ms S told NewDay she was 
employed with a gross annual income of £27,900.
In the months leading up to the Brand A credit limit increase in September 2020, 
NewDay assessed Ms Ss total existing unsecured debt to have grown to over 
£21,500. This is a large percentage of Ms Ss gross annual income, and almost equal 
to her net annual income, which would have been around £22,500 at that time.
This amount of unsecured debt is a significant increase from the £13,400 that Ms S 
had at that time of the Brand Z application just over a year before, and I feel that it 
clearly represents an unsustainable amount of borrowing on the part of Ms S such 
that this credit limit increase shouldnt reasonably have been offered to Ms S by 
NewDay. And Ill be provisionally upholding this aspect of Ms Ss complaint on that 
basis.
November 2020  Brand M account application
When Ms S applied for a Brand M account in November 2020, she told NewDay that 
she was employed with a gross annual income of £28,500. NewDay also assessed 
Ms M as having total unsecured debt at that time of £23,900.This amount of total unsecured debt would likely have been more than Ms Ss annual 
net income, which would have been around £23,000 at that time, and as such Im 
satisfied that it didnt represent a sustainable amount of debt for Ms S and that it 
should have been apparent to NewDay from this information that the provision of a 
new line of credit to Ms S shouldnt have taken place.
Summary
In consideration of all the above, my provisional decision here is that while I feel it 
was reasonable for NewDay to have approved Ms Ss initial Brand A account 
application, and to have increased the credit limit on that account up to £3,000, which 
took place in June 2018, I feel that all subsequent provisions of credit past that date 
werent provided responsibly by NewDay and shouldnt have been offered to Ms S.
These include all three subsequent account applications (Brands P, Z, and M) as well 
as all credit limit increases on the Brand A account which took place after June 2018.
In response to my provisional decision, both Ms S and NewDay confirmed they were happy 
to accept the findings of my provisional decision. As such, I see no reason not to issue a 
final decision upholding this complaint in Ms Ss favour on the basis explained above, and I 
can confirm that my final decision is that I do uphold this complaint on that basis accordingly.
Putting things right
Brand A
NewDay must reimburse to Ms Ss Brand A account, all fees and charges that were incurred
or accrued on the account after the credit limit increase to £4,000 which took place in
September 2020.
NewDay must also reimburse to that account all interest incurred on the account for any
portion of the balance over £3,000 from September 2020 onwards.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance in Ms Ss favour, NewDay must pay this
balance to Ms S along with 8% simple interest calculated to the date of repayment.
If the above reimbursements result in a balance remaining for Ms S to pay, NewDay must
contact Ms S to arrange an affordable repayment plan with her.
NewDay must also remove all adverse credit reporting relating to this account from
September 2020 onwards, on the condition that there is no balance remaining on the
account for Ms S to pay. If there is a balance remaining for Ms S to pay, NewDay must make
the credit file amendments instructed above when Ms S has fully repaid that balance.
Brands P, Z, and M
NewDay must reimburse these accounts, all fees, charges, and interest that were accrued or
incurred on the accounts from the point that the accounts were opened.
If these reimbursements result in one or more of the accounts having a credit balance in Ms
Ss favour, NewDay must pay this balance to Ms S along with 8% simple interest calculated
to the date of repayment.
If the above reimbursements result in a balance remaining for Ms S to pay, NewDay must
contact Ms S to arrange an affordable repayment plan with her.NewDay must also remove all adverse credit reporting relating to these accounts from the
point that the accounts were opened, on the condition that there is no balance remaining on
the accounts for Ms S to pay. If there is a balance remaining for Ms S to pay on one or more
of the accounts, NewDay must make the credit file amendments instructed above for those
specific account when Ms S has fully repaid the balance outstanding on those specific
accounts.
Additional Points
If its the case that following the reimbursements instructed above, there are balances owed 
to Ms S on some accounts, but balances remaining for Ms S to pay on other accounts, 
NewDay may use the balances owed to Ms S (inclusive of the 8% interest) to repay the 
balances that remain for Ms S to pay, although they must provide a clear explanation to    
Ms S as to what they have done.
Finally, its my understanding NewDay have already made some reimbursements to Ms S on 
3 February 2022. Its acknowledged and expected that NewDay would take these already 
paid reimbursements into account when calculating any amounts that may still be due to   
Ms S based on the above, and that NewDay would provide clear information to Ms S of any 
calculations they have undertaken in this regard.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 October 2022.
