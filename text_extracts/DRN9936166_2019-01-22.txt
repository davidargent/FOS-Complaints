K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains Gain Credit LLC (Lending Stream)  lent him money he couldnt  afford  to 
repay.
background
Mr R took out four instalment  loans with Lending Stream.  These are:
Loan Date amount instalments
monthly repayment
Repayment date
1 08 June 2013 £115 5 up to £63.25 15 November 2013
2 20 November 2013 £600 6 up to £324.00 15 November 2014
3 28 December 2013 £130 6 up to £70.20 15 November 2014
4 17 January 2014 £140 6 up to £75.60 15 November 2014
Mr R missed a repayment on loan 1 but paid an additional amount to catch  up and repaid 
the loan when it was due on 15 November  2013. Mr R didnt  miss another repayment. He 
contacted Lending Stream to agree a repayment plan for loans 2-4 in February  2014.  He 
then repaid these  loans  paying his final repayment on 15 November 2014.
When Mr R complained to Lending Stream that the loans werent affordable  it didnt agree. It 
says it was entitled to rely on the information Mr R gave  about his income and outgoings, 
and when it did so, along with carrying out a credit check, it saw that the loans were 
affordable for him. 
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Rs complaint should not be upheld. He says Lending 
Stream carried out proportionate checks for loans 1 and 2. He also concluded that although  
Lending Stream should have carried out further  checks for loans 3 and 4, that these loans 
were affordable for Mr R anyway. So he didnt think Lending Stream  did anything wrong. 
Mr R disagreed with the adjudicators view and says if Lending Stream had checked his 
bank statements at the time it granted the loans it wouldnt  have lent him the money.  As both 
parties are still not in agreement, the complaint has come to me to make  a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not going to uphold 
this complaint. I will explain  why.
I think the overarching  questions I need  to consider  in deciding  whats  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint are:
Did Lending Stream, at the time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate  
checks to satisfy  itself that Mr R would be able to repay in a sustainable way?
oIf not, would  those checks have shown that Mr R would have been 
able to do so.
Ref: DRN99361662Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Rs indebtedness in a way that was otherwise 
unsustainable or harmful?
Did Lending Stream act unfairly  or unreasonably in some  other  way?
If I determine that Lending Stream did not act fairly and reasonably in its dealings with Mr R 
and that he has lost out as a result, I will go on to consider what  is fair compensation.
Lending Stream was required to lend responsibly.  It needed to make  checks to see whether    
Mr S could afford to pay back the loan before it lent to him. Those  checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr R was borrowing and the length of the 
agreement. But there was no set list of checks Lending Stream  had to do.
Loans 1 and 2
Mr Rs first loan was for £115 to be repaid in 5 instalments with the highest repayment  
amount being  £63.25. Lending Stream says he told it he was earning £1600 and declared 
expenditure of £1000. Lending Stream also says it carried out a credit agency check that it 
says was satisfactory although I havent  been  able to see what it says it saw at the time. 
I can see the monthly repayment  was a small proportion of Mr Rs declared disposable 
income, the instalment amount was low and this was his first loan. So for those  reasons,  I 
am satisfied  that the checks carried out by Lending  Stream for the first loan were 
proportionate.
Mr R asked for second loan of £600  a few months after his first loan ended.  This was to be 
repaid in 6 monthly instalments with the largest  monthly repayment being  £324.00.  Lending 
Stream again asked  Mr R about his income  and outgoings for this loan to make sure he 
could afford  it over the 6 instalments. 
Again, the information provided  by Mr R (£2000  income and £600 expenditure) for this loan 
would have showed that the loan was affordable with him having enough disposable income 
to comfortably meet the monthly repayment.  Although Mr R missed 1 repayment  for loan 1, 
he did pay an additional payment to catch up and so I cant  see anything that would suggest 
to me that Lending Stream should have carried out further checks  over what  it had already 
done. 
Loans 3 and 4
Mr R applied for loans  3 and 4 whilst  he was still making repayments for loan 2. He applied 
for loan 3 on 28 December 2014  for £130 and loan 4 on 17 January 2014  for £140. Even 
though these loans were  for relatively  small amounts, I think by this stage and because his 
loan repayments  were overlapping, I think Lending Stream  should  have  carried out further  
checks to find out what  other short term lending Mr R had at this time. 
If it had done this though, it would have seen that Mr R had no other  short term loans due at 
the time he applied for loans 3 and 4. Mr R also had enough declared  disposable  income 
that Lending Stream would have seen that the repayments for loans 3 and 4 were  
affordable, taking into account the additional repayments needed to pay on loan 2 also.
Ref: DRN99361663In conclusion, I consider  the affordability checks that Lending Stream made on Mr Rs first 
two loans (loans 1 and 2) were proportionate and sufficient. I do think  Lending  Stream 
should have sought further information  when it agreed to lend Mr R loans 3 and 4. But if it 
had done this, it would have seen  that the loans were affordable  for Mr R anyway based on 
the information Mr R gave them. So I cant say now that it was wrong for Lending Stream to 
give these loans to Mr R. And so I cant require  it to do anything further.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 February  2019.
