DRN-1517541
Complaint
Miss D has complained that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA wont refund a transaction she 
says she didnt make or otherwise authorise.
What happened
On 8 August 2019, Miss Ds PayPal account was used to make a €466 transaction.
PayPals systems flagged the payment as unusual and potentially unauthorised. They 
emailed Miss D to check whether it was her, and she confirmed it was unauthorised. But 
PayPal then held her liable for the payment anyway.
Miss D raised a chargeback through her own bank, but PayPal defended it.
Miss D had kept her PayPal account logged in at work. And her employers IT department 
found that their systems had been subject to malware on 8 August 2019. Her employers 
PayPal account had also been defrauded, and a similar payment had been taken from them 
just half an hour before Miss Ds disputed payment.
Miss D gave this evidence to PayPal, but they said it was too late. They said that under their 
terms and conditions, once Miss D raised a chargeback she effectively waived any other 
methods of trying to get her money back.
Our investigator looked into things independently and upheld the complaint. While he 
acknowledged PayPals terms and conditions, he explained that under the Payment 
Services Regulations (PSRs), PayPal were required to refund unauthorised payments. And 
given the evidence at hand, he thought it was most likely this one was unauthorised.
PayPal accepted that it was most likely Miss D did not authorise the disputed payment. But 
they said they still wouldnt refund her, due to their terms and conditions.
The complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done that, Ive come to broadly the same conclusions as our investigator, and for 
much the same reasons.
PayPals technical evidence shows that the payment in dispute used Miss Ds correct 
details. But this is not enough, on its own, for PayPal to hold Miss D liable. Under the 
Payment Services Regulations (PSRs), they also need to be able to evidence that Miss D 
consented to the transaction. Otherwise, PayPal have to refund it.
Miss D has provided evidence that her employers IT system was compromised, and that her 
employers PayPal account was defrauded in much the same way as her own. The disputed transaction does not fit well with Miss Ds genuine activity  indeed, PayPals own systems 
flagged it as unusual and potentially unauthorised. Miss Ds testimony has been consistent 
and credible, and Ive not got any basis on which to disbelieve her or to think its likely she 
consented to the payment.
PayPal appear to agree that its most likely Miss D did not authorise the payment.
Therefore, under the PSRs, PayPal cannot hold Miss D liable for the payment in dispute, 
and must refund it.
PayPal have pointed to their terms and conditions about chargebacks. But I do not think that 
their terms and conditions supersede the relevant legislation. And a chargeback is just an 
alternative method a customer can use to try to get their money back  it does not invalidate 
their rights under the PSRs. So I do not think PayPals point is relevant here. PayPal are still 
required to refund unauthorised transactions under the PSRs.
PayPal should also keep in mind that we expect businesses to generally act fairly and 
reasonably, and to follow good industry practice. When Miss D provided evidence showing it 
was most likely shed been defrauded, PayPal should have got her her money back. Instead, 
they continued to hold Miss D liable for a payment they thought she had not made. I do not 
think that PayPal acted fairly or reasonably here, and I do not think they have followed good 
industry practice. They delayed Miss D from getting her money back and caused her undue 
distress.
Putting things right
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA should:
refund the disputed transaction;
 
pay simple interest to Miss D on the transaction, at the rate of 8% simple a year, 
payable from the date it was last debited until the date its returned. This is to 
compensate Miss D for the time she didnt have her money; 
 
pay Miss D £100 compensation for the trouble and upset they caused.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal to take off tax from this simple interest. PayPal 
must give Miss D a certificate showing how much tax theyve taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Miss Ds complaint.
I direct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA to put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 June 2020.
