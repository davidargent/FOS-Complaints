The complaint
Mr and Mrs W complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont pay them the compensation that 
theyve claimed for issues with some replacement windows that they paid for using a fixed 
sum loan agreement.
What happened
Mr and Mrs W signed an order for some replacement windows in August 2019. The cost of 
the replacement windows was £15,417, they paid a deposit of £199 and entered into a fixed 
sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank to pay for the windows and agreed to make 96 
monthly repayments of £226.92. 
The windows were being installed as part of other work that Mr and Mrs W were having done 
so they had a builder on site when the windows were installed in October 2019. The builder 
contacted Mr and Mrs W about some issues with the installation, including that the sills 
hadnt been replaced and the builder agreed to do some work to rectify the issues  Mr and 
Mrs W say that the supplier agreed to pay for that work but it has refused to do so. The cost 
of the rectification work was £1,759.32. 
Mr and Mrs W claimed that amount, and the cost of some supports and sills, from 
Shawbrook Bank in March 2020. It didnt agree that the supplier had agreed to pay the cost 
of £1,759 but said that the supplier had offered them a discount of £718 so it didnt uphold 
their claim. Mr and Mrs W werent satisfied with its response so complained to this service. 
Our investigator recommended that their complaint should be upheld. He was persuaded 
that the supplier had agreed to compensate Mr and Mrs W for the cost of the builder putting 
right the breach of contract so he thought that it would be fair and reasonable for Shawbrook 
Bank to subtract £1,759.32 from the amount owing under the agreement. He was convinced 
that the internal window sills should have been provided to Mr and Mrs W and he thought 
that Shawbrook Bank should also subtract a total of £150 for the twelve window sills from 
that amount.
Shawbrook Bank has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It has 
provided a detailed response from the supplier which says, in summary, that:
the windows were installed with due care and skill;
internal sills and supports didnt form part of the contract; and
it didnt agree to pay for the rectification works but did do some extra work for Mr and 
Mrs W without charge and offered them a discount of £718.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr and Mrs W paid for the windows using credit, in the form of a fixed sum loan 
agreement, provided by Shawbrook Bank;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr and Mrs Ws complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
of the windows and that Shawbrook Banks response to their claim under section 75 
wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Ws 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr and Mrs W have provided photos showing the issues with the windows after they 
were installed and, even though they were having other building work done at the 
time, I dont consider that the windows were installed to an acceptable standard;
Mr and Mrs W complained to the supplier about the issues with the windows and a 
site visit was arranged  their builder was present when that happened and says that 
the supplier asked him to do the required rectification work and said that it would pay 
him for doing so  which is why he submitted a separate invoice for that work;
I dont consider it to be likely that Mr and Mrs W would have agreed to pay for the 
required rectification work when they clearly felt strongly that the windows hadnt 
been installed to an acceptable standard;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the supplier did agree to pay for the 
rectification work  but Mr and Mrs W have now paid the builder (although theyve 
been asked to provide evidence to show that theyve paid the builder but havent 
responded to that request);
I consider that the suppliers failure to install the windows to an acceptable standard 
and to pay the builder for the rectification work are breaches of contract for which 
Shawbrook Bank is liable;
I consider it to be clear that Mr and Mrs W intended the windows to be a like-for-like 
replacement of their windows and, although there were clearly some differences 
between the two sets of windows, I consider that it was reasonable for them to 
expect that internal window sills would be included;
Im not persuaded that Shawbrook Banks response to Mr and Mrs Ws claim has 
been fair or reasonable in these circumstances;
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Shawbrook Bank to reduce the 
outstanding amount due from Mr and Mrs W under the fixed sum loan agreement by 
£1,759.32;
our investigator has investigated the cost of replacement window sills and says that 
the cost of the twelve replacement window sills that would be required would be £150 
 and I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Shawbrook Bank to also reduce 
the outstanding amount due from Mr and Mrs W under the fixed sum loan agreement 
by that amount.Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Shawbrook Bank to be 
responsible for the additional cost of the rectification works by the builder of £1,759.32 and 
the cost of the sills of £150  and that it should reduce the outstanding amount due from Mr 
and Mrs W under the fixed sum loan agreement by those amounts  which is a total of 
£1,909.32. If the outstanding amount due from them is less than £1,909.32 then I consider 
that Shawbrook Bank should refund the difference to them.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr and Mrs Ws complaint and I order Shawbrook Bank Limited 
to reduce the outstanding amount due from them under the fixed sum loan agreement by 
£1,909.32.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs W to 
accept or reject my decision before 12 August 2021.
