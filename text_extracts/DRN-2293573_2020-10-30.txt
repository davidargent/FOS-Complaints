The complaint
Miss M complains that S.D. Taylor Limited (trading as Loans at Home (LAH)) lent to her
irresponsibly.
What happened
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be upheld in part. LAH disagreed with the 
adjudicators opinion. The complaint was then passed to an ombudsman. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Miss Ms complaint should be upheld in part. A 
copy of the background to the complaint and my provisional findings follow this and form part 
of this final decision:
What I said in my provisional decision:
Miss M took 22 home credit loans between August 2003 and May 2013. Ive included some

Our adjudicator thought we could only consider loans 3 to 22  those loans taken out after
LAH came under our jurisdiction on 6 April 2007. And having looked at Miss Ms complaint
about these loans, she didnt think it was wrong for it to have lent loans 3 to 6.
However, the adjudicator thought LAH shouldve stopped lending when Miss M applied for
loan 7. This was because she thought Miss M appeared to have become reliant on the
lending and that further loans wouldve been harmful. So, the adjudicator said that LAH
should refund the interest and charges Miss M paid for loans 7 to 22 together with 8% simple
interest. In addition, she thought these loans should be removed from Miss Ms credit file.
LAH disagreed with the adjudicators assessment that this service could consider loans 3 to
22. And it has requested that the jurisdiction of Miss Ms loans should be reviewed by an
ombudsman before this service decides whether the loans were lent responsibly. LAH says
that:
Miss Ms statement of complaint suggests she was aware that she couldve
complained earlier than 2020 (when she was watching a TV programme);
when Miss M fell into arrears, she was sent arrears letters in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012
and 2013, all pointing her towards free money advice organisations if she was
struggling financially and which included a copy of its complaints process.
it isnt reasonable to suggest that Miss M wasnt aware that she couldve complained
earlier than she did based on her recognition at the time of lending, that the loans
were unaffordable.
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Which loans I can look into and why
loans 1 and 2
This service isnt able to consider any lending decision taken before 6 April 2007 (loans 1
and 2). This is because LAH didnt come under this services remit until this date. So Im not
able to consider whether an error was made when these loans were approved.
loans 3 to 22
For these loans the relevant time limits for bringing a complaint to this service are set out in
the Dispute Resolution (DISP) section of the FCAs handbook at DISP 2.8. It is these time
limits I must apply when considering if Miss Ms complaint was brought in time.
This services approach to applying these limits in complaints about the affordability of has
been set out at length in previous decisions which are available on our website  so I dont
intend to repeat all the arguments set out in the same level of detail.
DISP 2.8.2R says:
The Ombudsman cannot consider a complaint if the complainant refers it to the
Financial Ombudsman Service: 
(2) more than:
(a) six years after the event complained of; or (if later)
(b) three years from the date on which the complainant became aware (or ought 
reasonably to have become aware) that he had cause for complaint unless the complainant referred the complaint to the respondent or to the 
Ombudsman within that period and has a written acknowledgement or some other 
record of the complaint having been received;
unless:
(3) in the view of the Ombudsman, the failure to comply with the time limits in DISP
2.8.2 R or DISP 2.8.7 R was as a result of exceptional circumstances; or
(4) the Ombudsman is required to do so by the Ombudsman Transitional Order; or
(5) the respondent has consented to the Ombudsman considering the complaint
where the time limits in DISP 2.8.2 R or DISP 2.8.7 R have expired.
The six year period and what this means for Miss Ms complaint
For each of loans 3 to 22, Miss Ms complaint was referred to this service more than six
years after the event shes complaining about  LAHs decision to lend to her. But the
three-year period set out at DISP 2.8.2R (2)(b) can potentially extend the deadline for
complaining, depending on when a complainant became aware, or ought to reasonably to
have become aware, they had cause for complaint.
So, Ive considered when Miss M was aware, or she ought reasonably to have been aware,
she had cause to complain.
When did Miss M become aware she had cause for complaint?
Miss M has told us she only became aware she had reason to complain in 2020 when she
was watching a TV programme about financial matters.
Shes said that the repayment of the loans caused hardship and problems which resulted in
the need to borrow more money. But she says she wasnt aware that she could complain
about this until 2020. I accept what LAH says that a complaint procedure letters were sent in
2009, 2010 and 2011 so I think its likely Miss M knew she could complaint. Just not about
the specific issue of irresponsible lending.
Having reviewed everything provided on this case, Ive not seen anything which clearly
shows Miss M knew she had cause to complain about irresponsible lending before 2020. For
example, there isnt anything to suggest that she tried to complain earlier than this or
anything shes said which confirms she knew she had reason to complain earlier. I also find
Miss Ms account of when she realised that she had reason to complain to be plausible.
So, I think that Miss M didnt realise she had cause to complain until 2020.
Is it the case Miss M ought reasonably to have been aware of cause for complaint
more than three years before she complained?
While I think that Miss M complained within three years of when she had actual awareness
of cause to complain, this doesnt, on its own, mean she complained within the three year
part of the time limit.
It still might be the case that she ought reasonably to have known this earlier  i.e. because
a reasonable person in her circumstances should really have known they had reason to
complain.I think that for it to be the case that Miss M ought reasonably to have been aware of cause
for complaint, it would have to be the case that she ought reasonably to have been aware of
three things:
that there was a problem  in this case her loans were unaffordable;
that her unaffordable loans caused her loss; and
that Loans at Homes actions (or its failure to act) may have caused the loss.
Given what Miss M has said about her financial position and what LAH has said about the
arrears on the lending and the communication that surrounded this, I think that Miss M ought
reasonably to have been aware that these loans may not have been affordable. And that
they might have been causing her loss (in other words, Miss M ought to have been aware of
the first two parts of the test set out above).
That said I dont think that it was the case that Miss M ought reasonably to have been aware
that LAH mightve been responsible for her problem. For example, Im not aware LAH
suggested this in the letters it sent about her arrears (although it hasnt sent us copies of the
letters to consider)  and Ive also not seen other evidence to suggest this to be the case.
In some instances, itll be quite clear that a business might have (at least) some
responsibility for what happened to a consumer. So, for example, its likely that a consumer
taking out a product based on information given to them by a business would normally have
reason (or ought reasonably to have had reason) to think the business might have done
something wrong when they later found out that the information was misleading. Usually, a
reasonable person would attach some blame on the person providing them with information
they relied on if that information turned out to be inaccurate or untrue.
But equally its possible (and sometimes perfectly reasonable) in some situations, for a
consumer to not realise someone else might have some responsibility for their problem until
something or somebody else made that connection for them. And I think thats what
happened here.
And the bulk of information about complaint handling was, and is, fairly specialised and its
unlikely to be the sort of thing of which a reasonable consumer would be aware - especially
when Miss M was borrowing. So, unless Miss M actually saw such information when she
took the loans, and Ive seen nothing persuasive to suggest that she did, I dont think the
general availability of information about responsible lending means Miss M ought to have
reasonably complained earlier than she did.
Bearing in mind all of this and having taken everything into account, I dont think Miss M
ought reasonably to have had cause to make this complaint about LAH at any stage more
than three years before she complained. I think Miss M recognised that the lending resulted
in financial difficulty and that the unaffordable loans caused her loss. But I dont think she
was aware that it was Loans at Homes actions (or its failure to act) that may have caused
the loss.
So, I think Miss M complained in time about loans 3 to 22 because she complained within
three years of becoming aware, or when she ought to have been aware, of the reason shes
now complaining.
I think therefore that we can look at her complaint about loans 3 to 22.
I appreciate LAH has asked this service to resolve the jurisdiction aspect first before
considering whether any loans shouldve been lent. I dont think though that this is necessary
as both parties have already received the adjudicators view about jurisdiction and theoutcome of the complaint about the loans that she felt we can consider. This provisional
decision also gives each party the opportunity to respond with any further arguments or
information they would like to provide.
What Ive provisionally decided about the complaint (loans 3 to 22)  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account the law, any
relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
Miss M doesnt appear to disagree with our adjudicators findings that LAH wasnt wrong to
lend loans 3 to 6. It seems therefore that this lending isnt in dispute and so I no longer think
that I need to make a finding about Loans 3 to 6. But Ive kept this lending in mind when
thinking about the overall lending relationship between Miss M and LAH.
At the time LAH provided the loans to Miss M it was licensed by the Office of Fair Trading
(OFT). LAH had to act responsibly although I acknowledge that in 2007 there wasnt too
much by way of guidance to those businesses as to what that meant in practice. Broader
good practice dictated that responsible lenders should ensure that all loan applications went
through sound and proper credit assessments and that the interests of the borrowers should
be taken into full account.
But for the lending in dispute here the OFT had also issued guidance aimed at lenders in
January 2008 (Consumer Credit Licensing  General Guidance for Licensees and
Applicants on Fitness and Requirements). The available guidance explained that the aim of
the OFT was to ensure that an appropriate standard of consumer protection was in place
and that it would focus on a several things when assessing fitness of applicants for licenses.
One of those considerations was integrity, adding that,
The way you operate any aspect of a business may well be relevant to your fitness to hold a
consumer credit licence.
It went on to provide examples of the kind of evidence that may involve integrity issues. The
final example stated:
evidence of business practices that appear to the OFT to be deceitful or oppressive or
otherwise unfair or improper whether unlawful or not and whether arising in relation to the
licenses business or otherwise with particular regard to any breaches of OFT guidance. This
could include evidence of irresponsible lending.
The guidance added that:
Lenders may take different approaches to responsible lending in line with variations
between the needs of different sectors of the market. However, lenders should always take
reasonable care in making loans or advancing lines of credit and should take full account of
the interests of consumers in doing so. They should undertake proper and appropriate
checks on the potential borrower's creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan and to meet
the terms of the agreement. The checks should be proportionate, taking account of the type
of agreement, the amounts involved, the nature of the lenders relationship with the
consumer, and the degree of risk to the consumer.
So, to me, the avoidance of unfair practices that may result in detriment to consumers was
central to the OFTs guidance. The annex in the guidance listed a number of practices that
the OFT deemed unlawful and/or considered unfair. The final one of these was as follows:Irresponsible lending irresponsibly contrary to the provisions of section 25(2B) of the
Consumer Credit Act 1974, by failing to take reasonable care in making loans or advancing
lines of credit, including making only limited or no enquiries about consumers' income before
offering loans, and failing to take full account of the interests of consumers in doing so.
In summary, when granting licences, the OFT had thought about whether a credit provider
was being run with integrity with particular concerns around whether licence holders were
carrying out unfair practices of which irresponsible lending is an example.
So before granting credit to Miss M, LAH had to do proportionate checks. These had to take
account of the type of credit, the amounts involved, the nature of LAHs relationship with
Miss M, and the degree of risk to Miss M.
LAH has said that we made lending decisions based on a loans affordability and 
sustainability, as well as the appropriateness of the lending, that is ensuring it wont
result in any financial detriment. It hasnt though provided details of the checks that it did to
show the loans were affordable and sustainable.
I also appreciate that LAH has said that it didnt add any interest or charges when Miss M fell
into arrears. But, overall though I agree with our adjudicator that LAH should reasonably
have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the time it
provided loan 7. I say this because, not only had the OFT issued guidance and clarified the
obligations on licensed credit providers, but also because of the overall pattern of Miss Ms
borrowing by loan 7. I say this as:
By loan 7 it was over two years into the second lending relationship (since loan 2
when Miss M started to borrow again following a break in lending) with no breaks
between loans. Some of the loans also overlapped. In my view, Miss Ms loan history
up until this point was a clear indication that her underlying financial situation didnt
seem to be improving;
Miss M took some loans on the same day previous ones were repaid. For example,
loans 3 and 7 were taken out after repayment of loans 2 and 3 respectively.
So, LAH ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss M, on these
occasions, was having to borrow further to cover the hole the repayment of her
previous loans had left in her finances and that this was indicative of her
indebtedness not being sustainable.
The loan amounts were broadly similar ranging between £200 and £600. I think its
most likely this consistent pattern of borrowing over the period showed that Miss M
didnt just have a short-term cash-flow problem but was probably supporting regular
living expenses or other financial commitments;
Miss Ms lending history was prolonged with loans being taken out throughout 2008
and into 2009 and 2010. And shortly after two loans (taken out in 2010) had been
repaid considerably late (in 2013), loan 22 was lent shortly afterwards. The amount of
time that Miss M spent indebted to LAH meant that she was in effect servicing a debt
to LAH over an extended period.
I think that Miss M lost out when LAH provided loans 7 to 22:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness by allowing
her to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Miss Ms
credit file and kept her in the market for these types of loans.So, Im intending to uphold Miss Ms complaint about her borrowing from loan 7 to loan 22.
And Ive set out what LAH should do to put things right as detailed below.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both LAH and Miss M accepted the findings I reached in the provisional decision and neither 
party had anything further that it wanted to add. 
So, I see no reason to depart from the findings that I reached in the provisional decision. So I 
still think LAH was wrong to have provided Miss M with loans 7  22. 
Putting things right
In line with what LAH has agreed to do to put things right:
refund all interest and charges Miss M paid on loans 7 to 22;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove loans 7 to 22 from Miss Ms credit file entirely, this is because the period of
time Miss M owed LAH money means that any information still recorded about these
loans is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss M
a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in my provisional decision I partly uphold Miss Ms 
complaint.
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 November 2020.
