The complaint
Mr H complains TransUnion International UK Limited (TransUnion) have been reporting 
incorrect information on his credit report.
What happened
Mr H says he applied for credit with two separate providers but was turned down.
As a result, he reviewed his credit report and found his credit score was lower than 
expected. Mr H says, as he had never been in debt or had a mortgage, he expected his 
score to be one hundred percent  but that wasnt the case.
He noticed TransUnion were reporting a debt with a company, which Ill call Company A, that 
Mr H says he isnt responsible for. Mr H contacted TransUnion on 15 May 2023, explaining 
hed spoken with Company A, whod agreed Mr H was up to date with his payments, and 
didnt owe the debt shown. Mr H was frustrated TransUnion wouldnt call Company A to get 
the inaccurate information removed from his credit report. TransUnion acknowledged Mr Hs 
concerns the same day, confirming they would investigate matters.
TransUnion wrote to Mr H again on 12 June, explaining they had raised a dispute with 
Company A, but as they hadnt received a response, they were unable to amend the entry. 
They did however confirm the entry would remain suppressed from Mr Hs credit report, but 
Company A could remove the suppression at any point.
Soon after, TransUnion confirmed Company A had now responded, and TransUnion relayed 
that Company A had said to resolve matters Mr H would need to call Company A directly. 
TransUnion explained that Company A hadnt agreed for the entry to be amended  so they 
werent able to do anything further.
During this time, unhappy with the time the review was taking, Mr H raised his concerns with 
our service.
An Investigator here reviewed matters and concluded that TransUnion hadnt acted unfairly. 
They said TransUnion raised Mr Hs dispute with Company A, as wed expect, and 
supressed the information from Mr Hs credit report until Company A responded. They went 
on to explain that as Company A didnt agree for the entry to be amended, there was nothing 
further theyd expect TransUnion to do.
Mr H disagreed, in summary he said Company A had failed to communicate with TransUnion 
in the way he thought they should - by telephone, to resolve matters quickly. As such, hed 
spent hours trying to establish why the incorrect information was showing and the false 
allegations were of detriment to him.
With no resolution, the case was passed to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision, setting out why I intended to uphold this complaint, and 
setting out what I thought TransUnion needed to do to put things right. I said:
 
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, I think it would be helpful to explain the remit of our service, and what we can and 
cant look at.
The Financial Ombudsman Service was set up to resolve individual complaints. We take into 
account the law, codes and good practice  making decisions on the facts and evidence 
available in each case. As part of this, we look at the responsibilities of the business being 
complained about, here thats TransUnion, and consider whether theyve done what wed 
expect of them.
Im aware Mr H contacted Company A several times about this issue, and hed like our 
service to resolve this matter with them directly, however our powers dont extend to 
consider Company As actions, because the complaint Mr H has raised here is against 
TransUnion. We have previously told Mr H of the relevant Ombudsman scheme he would 
need to contact, about a complaint against Company A, if he remains unhappy with their 
actions.
I do appreciate Mr H says that all parties involved are only concerned with following 
processes and a telephone call would resolve matters, however I hope Ive been able to 
explain why we cant call Company A to get the matter resolved.
That said, I can consider whether TransUnion acted fairly when Mr H contacted them in          
May 2023 about the incorrect record on his credit report. Having done so, Ive so far come to 
a different outcome to our Investigator. Ive explained why below.
TransUnion dont own the data they report on  the data is owned by lenders and other third-
party companies. This means TransUnion arent generally responsible for the data provided, 
but must ensure the data is accurate, and investigate this when a dispute is raised.
Following Mr Hs contact TransUnion correctly disputed the entry with Company A, they did 
this on the day Mr H raised his concerns, so have acted fairly in this regard. Based on the 
information Ive been provided from both parties, TransUnion next wrote to Mr H on 12 June 
and explained that Company A hadnt responded to the dispute theyd raised, and without 
their permission TransUnion wasnt able to change the report.
While this is true in part, as TransUnion cant amend an entry without the consent of the 
lender, I think TransUnion were wrong to say theyd not received a reply at this time.
From the evidence TransUnion have provided, they received a response from Company A 
on 15 May, the same day they raised the dispute. This response said Mr H needed to 
contact Company A directly  it didnt give TransUnion authority to amend or delete the 
record. TransUnion should have passed this information on to Mr H as soon as possible, 
instead it took around a month to share it and gave him the wrong information in the interim. 
While the data was supressed from Mr Hs credit report during this time, he was still 
inconvenienced by having to chase TransUnion for a reply.
I understand Mr H is concerned with information he saw about Company A on the television, 
but that doesnt mean wed expect TransUnion to automatically remove information about 
Company A from Mr Hs credit report  they would need the consent of the data owner, 
Company A, which they werent given.Taking everything into account, Im persuaded that when Mr H raised his dispute with 
TransUnion about the entry from Company A, they did as Id expect and contacted the data 
owner. TransUnion dont own the debt, so they cant change it without permission from 
Company A. As Company A didnt give them the necessary permission, they are required to 
let Mr H know, but theres nothing more they can do in the circumstances.
While overall Im satisfied TransUnion did that here, they made an error by telling Mr H 
Company A hadnt responded, which delayed matters. As such, Mr H continued to contact 
TransUnion to find out what was happening, so I think TransUnion should pay Mr H £100 to 
apologise for the distress and inconvenience this error caused.
Responses to my provisional decision
I invited both parties to respond with any further points or evidence they wanted me to take 
into account before I made a final decision. 
TransUnion let me know they accepted what Id said and had nothing further to add. Mr H 
also responded, reiterating that this issue could have been resolved in one phone call. While 
he accepted the compensation I recommended, he explained his main concern was 
ensuring his name wasnt tarnished with false accusations. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as set out in my provisional decision - both 
in terms of what went wrong and how it should be put right. 
As a reminder, Im only able to consider actions of TransUnion and whether they have done 
what is expected of them. 
I do take on board Mr Hs concern about what he says is false information being recorded by 
TransUnion, but as explained, this information is not something TransUnion have the power 
to amend, without the data owners consent. 
In my provisional decision I explained TransUnion arent the owners of this information. Their 
responsibility is to raise Mr Hs dispute with the data owner  Company A, which TransUnion 
did. In this case, Company A didnt authorise TransUnion to amend, or delete the record. 
And so, it follows, TransUnion also cant be held responsible for any impact this information 
may have on Mr H, such as concerns about his credit score. Nor should they be required to 
contact Company A, by phone, as Mr H would like. 
Mr H hasnt said whether hes raised this with the other Ombudsman scheme he was told 
about before  but if he hasnt, then he may wish to since TransUnion wont be updating his 
credit file.
I remain of the opinion though, TransUnion should have told Mr H earlier than they did about 
the response from Company A  and still think £100 to compensate for that is fair.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I uphold this complaint and require TransUnion 
International UK Limited to pay Mr H £100 compensation. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2023.
