The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) irresponsibly allowed him to 
take out a number of loans which were unaffordable.
What happened
Mr M says he took out a number of NatWest loans from 2014. He says appropriate checks 
were not carried out and that the loans were unaffordable. Mr M says he had a gambling 
problem and it ought to have been obvious that the loans were not affordable as NatWest 
had access to his bank account statements. He would like all interest and charges refunded 
and also complains that NatWest allowed him an overdraft and credit card account.
NatWest says it approved four loans from 2014 to 2016 and refused Mr Ms last application 
in 2017. It says Mr M applied for the loans and it carried out appropriate checks. NatWest 
says Mr M was in employment earning in excess of £20,000 a year and that he made 
required payments for some years. It also says some of the loans were settled and says Mr 
Ms bank account operated largely in credit. NatWest says Mr M was entitled to gamble and 
he didnt tell it about any issues until some years after the loans were taken out.
Mr M brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator thought NatWest did carry out appropriate checks on the applications and 
thought the loans were well managed for some time after being taken out. The investigator 
didnt think NatWest had been told about the gambling issues and that Mr M was in receipt 
of an annual wage from £22,750 to £28,500. The investigator also thought the financial 
difficulties took place some years after the last loan.
Mr M doesnt accept that view and says he wasnt in a position to have told NatWest about 
the gambling issue at the time of the loans and says his other complaints have not been 
looked at.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr M will be disappointed by my decision. I also make clear to Mr M that I have 
only considered his complaint about the loans and not his credit card account or overdraft as 
I cant see that NatWest has investigated that part of the complaint. I also cant see that Mr 
M relied on an overdraft but those are matters he will have to ask NatWest to investigate.
Lenders and credit providers should carry out reasonable and proportionate checks on any 
credit or loan application. Those checks will of course vary depending on the type and 
amount of that lending.
I have looked at NatWest records and can see that Mr M made four loan applications 
between August 2014 and June 2016. The total amount borrowed was just over £15,000 but 
can see that some loans appeared to have been repaid in full. I can also see that NatWest 
did carry out checks on all of the applications and credit scored them which Mr M passed. I 
can also see that Mr M declared an income of between £22,750 and £28,500 which was 
confirmed by his account statements and that he had limited outgoings. Im satisfied that 
NatWest did carry out reasonable and proportionate checks on Mr Ms applications and that 
the lending was not irresponsible but affordable.
I can see from NatWests records that Mr M managed his loan accounts appropriately for 
some years after they were taken out which I think provides additional evidence that the 
loans were affordable. I have also looked at Mr Ms bank account statements and can see 
that his account was largely in credit at the relevant time. I appreciate that his account 
balance at times was relatively substantial which may have been due to gambling.
I appreciate Mr M says he was gambling but Im satisfied that its up to Mr M to decide how 
he spends his money. I dont think NatWest could have been aware that there may have 
been a problem unless Mr M told it. And I dont see what NatWest could have done to have 
helped Mr M without that conversation taking place. 
I think on balance that Mr Ms financial problems took place some time after the last loan 
was taken out in 2016. I say that as I can see Mr M made required loan repayments and 
usually had a credit balance in his bank account at that time, but the position changed some 
time afterwards.
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest did carry out reasonable and proportionate checks on Mr 
Ms loan applications. I cant see what other checks it could have carried out and as Mr M 
hasnt provided his credit file, I cant see what if any adverse information may have been 
recorded on it between 2014 and 2016. If Mr M wishes NatWest to consider a complaint 
about a credit card account he held with it or an overdraft facility then he will need to make a 
complaint to it.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2022.
