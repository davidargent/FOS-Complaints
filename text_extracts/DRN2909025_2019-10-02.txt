K820x#14Complaint
Mr and Mrs L complain that National Westminster Bank Plc pushed  through direct  debits  and 
standing orders which led to their repayment plan being broken. As a result,  their current 
account was defaulted.
Background
Mrs L called  NatWest on 1 April 2019  to discuss regular payments that were due to leave 
their current  account. Mr and Mrs L had a repayment plan with NatWest.  During  the call 
Mrs L asked about  the account balance and ran through  direct  debits  and standing  orders  
she wanted NatWest  to push through and pay. The direct debits and standing  orders Mrs L 
asked NatWest to pay totalled  £1,627.68 and she told NatWest  she would make  a payment 
into the account that day.
During the call on 1 April 2019 NatWest advised  Mrs L that the account balance  would be 
confirmed the following  day once all the payments had been made and said she could call 
back to check. No payments were subsequently  made to the account.  
On 3 April 2019  Mrs L called NatWest and complained. Mrs L said shed told the call handler 
on 1 April 2019 that she only had £750 to pay into the account  and NatWests  actions had 
put her further  into debt.  During the call, Mrs L asked to speak with the call handlers  
manager and complained.  
NatWest responded  to Mr and Mrs Ls complaint  on 3 April 2019  but didnt agree it had 
made a mistake.  NatWest said that the repayment plan had been broken and that their 
account had been passed to its recoveries team. 
Mr and Mrs L referred their complaint to our service  and an investigator looked  at what  had 
happened. He thought NatWest had dealt  with the complaint fairly and didnt ask it to do 
anything else. Mr and Mrs L didnt accept  the investigators view and asked to continue  their 
complaint so its been passed to me to make  a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive listened to both the 1 April 2019  and 3 April 2019 calls to decide whether Mrs L was 
given misleading  information about  the payments due to leave the account.  Having listened 
to the call, I did hear Mrs L mention  that she had £750. But she also ran through all the 
payments she wanted NatWest to push through and confirmed the initial total of £1592.73 
before asking for two further  payments  to be made  taking the total to £1,627.68. 
At the beginning  of the call, NatWests  call handler reviewed the outstanding balance with 
Mrs L and confirmed the account was overdrawn by £1,056.52 but explained that the 
balance could change  if direct debit payments were retuned. Mrs L then asked NatWest to 
confirm what shed  need to pay to cover  her priority direct debits. 
Ref: DRN29090252NatWest ran through a list of direct  debits and standing orders Mrs L said she needed to 
pay. As Ive said above, the total of those payments came to £1,627.68 and Mrs L ended the 
call by saying she would  then make a payment into the account to cover  them.  No payment 
was made  to the account following the call on 1 April 2019.  
Having listened  to the call, I think there  was a genuine misunderstanding.  Mrs L mentioned  
she had £750  but then did some  calculations and ran through the payments she wanted to 
make. Whilst I can hear Mrs L mentioned  she had £750, she then gave NatWest  clear 
instructions to make payments totalling £1,627.68.  Im sorry to disappoint Mr and Mrs L but I 
thought NatWests call handler gave clear  information about the status of their account  
during the call and acted  in line with the instructions they were given. I havent found that the 
call was badly handled or that NatWest failed to treat Mr and Mrs L fairly. 
Mrs L called  back on 3 April 2019  and raised  a complaint. I understand Mrs L feels  this call 
was handled poorly and I agree it became heated at points. But I think that reflects  the 
nature of the issues being discussed. I thought  NatWests call handler  remained professional  
and tried to provide the information  Mrs L wanted. I appreciate that being  told there was no 
manager to speak to was upsetting, especially given that Mrs L has told us she suffers  with 
anxiety, but NatWest has told us thats not something it can always  offer. Having listened to 
the call, I havent  been  persuaded NatWest handled it badly. 
I understand my decision is likely to disappoint Mr and Mrs L as I can see how strongly  they 
feel. But Ive listened to the calls in question and thought  NatWest  provided the information 
requested and acted  in line with the instructions it received. I thought  both calls were  
handled professionally  by NatWest. I understand Mr and Mrs Ls account was subsequently 
closed and defaulted but, for the reasons  Ive given above, I havent found that NatWest 
made a mistake.  Taking everything Ive seen into account, Im satisfied NatWest  has dealt 
with Mr and Mrs Ls complaint fairly so Im not telling it to take any further  action. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs L to 
accept or reject my decision  before  2 November 2019.
