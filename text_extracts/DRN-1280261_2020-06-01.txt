Our adjudicator upheld Miss Ds complaint about loans six onwards and thought these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny then made an offer to uphold Miss Ds complaint from 
loan 8 onwards. Miss D disagreed so, the complaint was passed to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss D could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss D could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ds complaint. Our adjudicator didnt uphold Miss 
Ds complaint about loans 1  5, and Miss D hasnt responded to dispute this. So as these 
loans are no longer in dispute, I havent considered these further. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss D, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ds case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss D was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss D had taken out six loans within six months and had been 
indebted to Sunny for the entire time. In fact, at the time of applying for loan 6, Miss D still had loans 4 and 5 outstanding. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more 
likely than not Miss D was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her 
previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Ds indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ds loans ranged from £50 to £300, but the amounts borrowed were not 
reducing substantially over time. So, at the point of applying for loan 6 Sunny ought 
to have known that Miss D was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in 
her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Miss D wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 11 was 
taken out 13 months after Miss Ds first. And it was for a larger amount. Miss D had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Miss D lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ds indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Miss D borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 6 onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right
refund all interest and charges Miss D paid on loans 6 - 11;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the information recorded on Miss Ds credit file about loans 6 onwards is adverse. 
So, all entries about loans 6  11 should be removed from Miss Ds credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision 
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Ds complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 June 2020.
