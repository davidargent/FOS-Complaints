K821x#15complaint
Mr E says CashEuroNet UK LLC trading QuickQuid lent to him irresponsibly. He said it was 
too easy to borrow  from QuickQuid and the high interest repayments  led to him having 
financial problems. He said QuickQuid  shouldve offered to help him rather  than lending to 
him over a long period.  
background
This complaint is about 23 payday  loans  QuickQuid provided to Mr E between  October 2013 
and November 2017. Some of the information about this lending is at the end of this 
decision. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that QuickQuid had made 
proportionate checks for loans  1 to 4. So its decisions to approve these loans were 
reasonable. 
He didnt think it had done enough  for the remainder of the lending. But he thought that if 
QuickQuid had made better checks then it still wouldve seen that Mr E could afford the 
repayments for loan 5. 
He thought that from loan 6 onwards QuickQuid shouldnt have approved any further loans 
as the pattern of lending itself showed  that that the loan repayments were likely to have 
become unsustainable. 
QuickQuid disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. In the main it said that the checks it 
made since March 2015 were proportionate  and they showed that the loans were affordable. 
It also said that the fact Mr E borrowed over a longer period  was not in itself evidence  of 
harm or dependency. 
So as no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed  to me to issue  a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Es case. Ive decided to uphold Mr Es 
complaint in part and Ive explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr E 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Es income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN26295832But certain factors might  indicate  that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done  more 
to establish that any lending  was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number or higher  frequency  of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer and business have a lending  relationship  
is long
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Es complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr E would be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr E would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Es indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Es complaint.
did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr E would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks  have shown  that Mr E would have been able to do so?
Mr E didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion about loans 1 to 5. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr E had with QuickQuid. 
So they are something  I will take into account when considering the other loans he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 23c because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided,  did the overall 
pattern of lending increase  Mr Es indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending to see if there was a point at which  QuickQuid 
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. 
And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  lending.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Es case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr E borrowed up to loan 17 remained largely between £150 and £400.  
But there wasnt a break in the lending which suggests Mr E was borrowing to fill the 
gap in his finances  making  the previous loan repayments had left 
Ref: DRN26295833The loan amounts generally increased after this. Mr E borrowed £900 for loan 17 and 
£850 for loan 21. These  were  high amounts in relation to his declared  income  of 
around £2,400.  So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was likely his indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably
Mr E wasnt really  reducing the amount he owed QuickQuid. He was in effect paying 
large amounts  of interest to service this debt over an extended  period. QuickQuids 
records show that Mr E borrowed for over four years. He borrowed over £8,500 and 
paid over £3,500  in interest
I think that Mr E lost out because QuickQuid continued to approve loans from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Es indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Es 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im upholding  Mr Es complaint about  loans 6 to 23c because the overall  pattern  of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and hes lost out as a result.
did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr E in some  
other way.  
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr E paid on loans 6 to 23c;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 means  any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 6 to 23c should be removed from Mr Es credit  file
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
If Mr E still owes QuickQuid any of the principal  balance he borrowed on his final loan 
QuickQuid should  remove all the interest  and charges applied  to the outstanding balance. 
QuickQuid should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Mr E went  to towards 
the principal. But importantly, QuickQuid needs to make sure that Mr E doesnt repay more 
than the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Mr E hasnt repaid the principal he borrowed QuickQuid can deduct this 
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr E has already paid enough to repay the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple*  interest from the 
date of payment  to the date of settlement
Ref: DRN26295834And if QuickQuid no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr E.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Es complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 June  2019.
