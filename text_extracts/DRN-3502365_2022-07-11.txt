The complaint
Mr M complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
MotoNovo Finance Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in April 2022 in which I described what had 
happened as follows:
A used car was supplied to Mr M under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo 
Finance that he electronically signed in February 2020. Mr M complained to 
MotoNovo Finance in December 2020 that the cars engine had seized. It said that it 
had no evidence that the fault was present or developing at the point of sale and the 
car had done 7,866 miles since purchase which indicated that it was fit for purpose at 
the point of sale.
Mr M arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert in January 2021 
and by another independent expert in April 2021. He complained to this service in 
May 2021 and paid a garage £8,646.40 to repair the car in June 2021.
Our investigator recommended that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. He thought 
that there was enough information to persuade him, on the balance of probabilities, 
that the car wasnt reasonably durable and wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was 
supplied to Mr M. He recommended that MotoNovo Finance should: pay Mr M 
£8,646.40 for the repairs; refund Mr Ms monthly payments from when the car broke 
down to when it was repaired; refund £240 to him for the first independent experts 
inspection; pay interest on all of those amounts; and pay him £200 for the trouble and 
upset that hes been caused.
MotoNovo Finance has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. 
It says that: Mr M had had the car for 12 months at the time of failure and had 
completed in excess of 8,000 miles in it; two independent inspections have provided 
evidence that the fault wouldnt have been present or developing at the point of sale; 
theres no evidence that he was told that the car had a full service history; theres no 
obligation for the dealer to service a car prior to sale unless agreed; and Mr M failed 
to service the car while he had possession of it.
I set out in my provisional decision the reasons that I didnt intend to uphold Mr Ms 
complaint which were as follows:
MotoNovo Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr M - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr M was nearly five years old, had been driven for 
56,134 miles and had a price of £33,000;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mr M says that the cars engine seized in December 2020  which was nearly ten 
months after the car was supplied to him;
he arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert in January 2021  
for which he paid £240  and the inspection report records the cars mileage as 
64,289 miles;
the inspection report identified faults with the car, which it said required further 
investigation, and concluded: Taking into consideration the time and mileage 
elapsed since finance inception, time and the type of the fault the evidence will not 
support a developing at hire conclusion;
Mr M arranged a second independent inspection of the car in April 2021 and the 
inspection report concluded: This vehicle has covered 8,173 miles since purchase, 
this allows us to confidently determine that it was fit for purpose and road legal at the 
point of sale, this opinion is re-affirmed by fact that the vehicle passed an MOT 
around the point of purchase;
it also said: The oil pump had no evidence of mechanical failure and the lack of 
lubrication, in our opinion, would not result in an oil pump failure.  In our opinion, 
cavitation of the oil is the most likely cause as this is normally associated with the 
vehicle being run with low oil levels at some point in the past and causes accelerated 
bearing wear;
Mr M then paid £8,646.40 for the car to be repaired in June 2021;
Mr M has provided a copy of the advert for the car which says that it had a full 
service history and hes provided a copy of the online service history for the car  
which is headed Customer Copy and was printed in March 2020, about two weeks 
after the car was supplied to him (he says that he believes that he obtained it from 
another dealer when he obtained new registration plates for the car);
it shows that the car was serviced in March 2016, March 2017, January 2018 and 
January 2019  the recommended service interval for the car is the sooner of 12 
months and 12,000 miles  so when the car was supplied to him it was due a service;
Mr M says that the dealer was going to service the car before he collected it but hes 
provided no evidence to show that the dealer had agreed to service the car or that 
the car was serviced at that time  and the online service history for the car (and 
another copy of it that Mr M obtained in August 2020) dont show a service in 
February 2000 and Ive seen no evidence to show that the car was serviced between 
January 2019 and December 2020 when the engine seized;
I consider that it was reasonable in these circumstances for Mr M to expect that the 
car had been serviced before it was supplied to him but I also consider that he ought 
reasonably to have identified when he received the online service histories in March 
and August 2020 that the car hadnt been serviced since January 2019 and was due 
a service;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have then raised the issue 
about the cars service history with the dealer (and to have complained to MotoNovo 
Finance if he wasnt satisfied with its response)  but he didnt do so and continued 
to use the car;I dont consider it to be fair or reasonable for Mr M to have continued to use the car  
and to drive more than 8,000 miles in it when he knew, or ought reasonably to have 
known, that the car hadnt been properly serviced;
Mr M says that there was no warning light about a low oil level but I consider it to be 
more likely than not that the engine seized as a result of it being used with low oil 
levels which is consistent with the conclusions from the second independent 
inspection and which its likely would have been avoided if the car had been serviced 
soon after Mr M had obtained either of the online service histories;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr M;
nor am I persuaded that any misrepresentation about the cars service history is 
enough in these circumstances for MotoNovo Finance to be liable for the repair costs 
that Mr M has incurred; and
I sympathise with Mr M for the issues that hes had with the car and the repair costs 
that hes incurred but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require MotoNovo Finance to reimburse him for those repair 
costs, or any of the other costs that hes incurred, to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
Mr M has responded to my provisional decision in detail and says, in summary and amongst 
other things, that:
the car may have been fit to drive when he collected it but the information provided 
shows that the issue has happened due to something in the past such as the car 
being run without oil or with the wrong oil;
hes not had to service the car as it    was sold with a full service history, it had been 
serviced and the last service was stamped in the service book but the book has 
since been lost  and the dealer will confirm this;
the car wasn't reasonably durable and of satisfactory quality and a car thats fully 
serviced should last more than ten months and 8,173 miles before it needs a 
new engine;
the first independent inspection was a waste of time and money as the car wasnt 
taken apart and the second inspection confirmed that the issue was caused by 
something that happened before he had the car;
the garage that repaired the car will confirm that the car has been run with no oil or 
the wrong oil; and
the car was sold with a 12 month comprehensive customer protect warranty but it 
only covers £1,000 so was no use for a £33,000 car.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our investigator has contacted the dealer and the garage that replaced the engine following 
Mr Ms comments in response to my provisional decision. The dealer says that Mr M 
contacted it several times about the cars service book because hed lost it but the dealer no 
longer has records about that. It also said that it didnt service the car before it was supplied 
to Mr M because the car was already serviced. 
The garage says that a bearing had split which caused the engine to stop working. It said 
that the oil level was correct when the car was recovered to it but the oil was very dirty. It 
said that it couldn't confirm the cause of the engine failure.
The car was supplied to Mr M in February 2020 and he was able to use it to drive more than 
8,000 miles in ten months. The engine seized in December 2020 and it was replaced in June 
2021. Mr M paid for the car to be inspected twice  the result of the first inspection was that 
the evidence didnt support that the fault was developing at the point of supply and the 
second inspection report said that the car was fit for purpose and road legal when it was 
supplied to Mr M.
The dealer says that it didnt service the car before it was supplied and Im not persuaded 
that the cars service history was misrepresented to Mr M. I can understand why Mr M might 
expect the car to have been serviced before it was supplied to him but the evidence shows 
that the car hadnt been serviced since January 2019.
Mr M has referred to the dealers warranty for the car. That warranty isnt referred to on the 
sales invoice for the car or in the hire purchase agreement. Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the warranty was misrepresented to Mr M or that theres been 
a breach of the warranty  and I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that 
MotoNovo Finance has any liability to Mr M in these circumstances in connection with the 
warranty.
This is a finely balanced complaint and its clear that Mr M feels very strongly that the car 
wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to him and that MotoNovo Finance should 
reimburse him for the cost of the replacement engine. But having carefully considered all of 
the evidence, Im not persuaded that I should change the outcome that I set out in my 
provisional decision. I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for 
me to require MotoNovo Finance to reimburse Mr M for the repair costs, or any of the other 
costs, that hes incurred, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 August 2022.
