The complaint
Mr F complains American Express Services Europe Limited (AESEL) (Amex) rejected a 
series of claims he made under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (CCA).
What happened
Mr F purchased a number of gift voucher codes with a value of £50 or £100 each, for a large 
online retailer, from an individual Ill call Mr G, who was trading on an auction website. Mr F 
paid for his purchases through an online payment service I will call P. Mr F says a 
significant proportion of these vouchers were invalid or had already been used, so he did not 
receive what he had paid for.  
Unable to resolve the problem satisfactorily with Mr G, Mr F attempted to dispute the 
relevant transactions with P. Mr G had sent Mr F invoices for his purchases through P, and 
Mr F had paid these using his Amex credit card. P told Mr F that it could not help due to 
restrictions within its terms and conditions relating to purchases of items such as gift 
vouchers. Mr F accepted this and brought the matter to Amex instead.
Amex told Mr F it was too late to dispute the transactions via chargeback, and that because 
he had used P as a middleman to pay Mr G, it was not liable to him under section 75 of the 
CCA. Mr F complained about this decision but Amex did not change its view. So Mr F 
referred the matter to this service for an independent assessment. 
One of our investigators looked into the complaint. She concluded there was not a valid 
debtor-creditor-supplier (DCS) agreement in place which would allow Mr F to make a valid 
section 75 claim against Amex, so it had been fair to decline his claim. She had carried out 
research which indicated P had acted as an e-money service and Mr Fs credit card had not 
been used to pay Mr G directly. Her view was that this caused the DCS agreement to be 
broken and section 75 did not apply to the transactions. Our investigator also didnt think 
Amex had been wrong to decline to attempt chargebacks for Mr F.
Mr F didnt agree with our investigators position regarding the section 75 claim. He 
advanced technical arguments regarding the means via which credit card payments are 
processed and settled in the UK. He noted that there were always middlemen in this process 
and they did not cause the DCS agreement to be broken. P was no different to these other 
middlemen and so the mere fact of his credit card payment having been made via P should 
not mean his section 75 claim is unsuccessful. As no agreement could be reached, the case 
has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr F has not disagreed with our investigators conclusions regarding the chargeback, so I 
will not focus on that aspect of the case in my decision. I will say only that from the available 
evidence it appears Amex was too late to initiate chargebacks on the relevant transactions 
by the time Mr F had brought the problem to its attention. So it wasnt wrong to decline to 
attempt chargebacks for him.
Mr F and our investigator have written extensively on the matter of the section 75 claim, so 
this will be the focus of my decision.
Section 75 of the CCA provides a degree of protection to consumers who use a credit card 
to purchase goods or services. So long as certain technical conditions are met, it allows a 
consumer to claim against their credit card company for any breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier of the goods or services.
The two main technical conditions which tend to go unfulfilled and pose an obstacle to 
section 75 claims are the need for the cash price of the items being purchased to fall within a 
certain range, and the need for there to be a DCS agreement in place.
The disagreements in this case have focused on whether the second of these conditions has 
been fulfilled, but it doesnt appear to me that the first condition has been fulfilled either.
Section 75 of the CCA does not apply:
so far as the claim relates to any single item to which the supplier has attached a cash 
price not exceeding £100 or more than £30,000
The items purchased in all of Mr Fs disputed transactions were gift voucher codes with 
values of £50 or £100. These were redeemable only at the online retailer in question, whose 
terms and conditions noted they had no cash value. The supplier (i.e. Mr G) attached a cash 
price of approximately £87 to a £100 gift voucher code. So it appears the cash price of each 
code falls below the minimum value which section 75 begins to apply from.
In advance of making my final decision, I asked our investigator to highlight the above 
problem to Mr F and ask if he had any comments. Mr F provided copies of his invoices with 
Mr G and gave a series of examples involving the purchase of multiple items, or quantities of 
materials, where the price is dependent on the amount purchased. The conclusion Mr F has 
invited me to draw is that when buying voucher codes from Mr G he was essentially making 
bulk purchases and the single item for the purpose of section 75 was not the price of each 
individual voucher code, but the price on each invoice (which was invariably above £100). 
Mr F said the price assigned to the individual vouchers was clearly related to the number of 
vouchers he purchased on each invoice.
I accept the principle behind Mr Fs submission  that for purchases of things which could be 
individually priced but may be bought in a larger quantity at an inclusive price (and perhaps 
with a discount for buying more), the single item may well be the overall purchase. I have 
some difficulty with applying the principle to his purchases of voucher codes however.
In my view, the way in which a purchase is presented is indicative of what the single item 
is. If a builders merchants simply advertised 100kg of gravel (to take the subject of one of 
Mr Fs examples) at a price of £200, then it seems likely the single item is 100kg of gravel, 
not each individual kilogram or piece of gravel. I would take a similar view of a situation 
where items which might be purchasable individually were sold as a single item package. 
For example, if a suit was sold for £250, comprising a jacket, trousers and waistcoat which 
were available separately for £99 each, then the single item would be the suit. That is the 
item which has been presented for sale.

Underneath each item on the invoice was a date and time the code was to be delivered 
(these varied even on the same invoice), and at the end of each invoice a discount was 
given from the sub-total which appears to have been equal to £2.00 per voucher code 
purchased.
The individual price of voucher codes seems to have been unrelated to the quantity 
purchased. For example, Mr F bought two codes for £87 each on 1 August 2018. He bought 
five codes at the same price per code on both 7 September 2018 and 13 September 2018. 
He bought four codes for £86.50 each on 5 August 2018. This pattern doesnt suggest the 
price was related to the quantity. Having carried out some research into similar voucher 
codes purchasable online, I can see that single codes priced below their redeemable value 
are available. So the fact Mr G was selling the £100 codes for less than this doesnt 
necessarily mean he was offering an inclusive discounted price for buying multiple vouchers.
I dont think the conclusion Mr F invites me to reach reflects the reality of the transactions. 
He wasnt buying a job lot, or a package of items presented for sale at an inclusive price. 
The invoices show individually-priced vouchers, and in my view these are the single items 
which section 75 refers to and Mr Fs prospective claims relate to, not the overall invoice 
price.
Based on my findings above, it follows that I have to conclude section 75 was not applicable 
to any of Mr Fs disputed purchases from Mr G, and Amex was therefore not wrong to 
decline his claims. 
This means I dont need to address the question of whether or not there is a valid DCS 
agreement, however I do appreciate the time and effort Mr F has gone to in setting out his 
position on this, and I thank him for raising some interesting points on the topic.
Other observations
Had the technical criteria been met for section 75 to apply to his disputed purchases, Mr F 
would need to have shown that there had been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by 
Mr G. If Mr G sent voucher codes which did not work for their intended purpose, he would 
have breached his contract with Mr F.  Mr F therefore would have needed to show that the codes he received were invalid or had 
already been used by the time theyd been sent to him. I dont think the evidence provided 
was quite enough to show this. Ive seen emails from Mr F complaining to Mr G that some of 
the codes didnt work, and an email from Mr G which essentially promised to look into the 
issues raised and provide a refund if Mr F couldnt wait. But there isnt evidence of what 
happened after this point, or evidence from the online retailer that the codes were invalid. 
I would have wanted to see some more evidence of the invalidity of the codes and that Mr G 
had failed to rectify matters. However, this is academic as my conclusion is Mr Fs 
purchases did not meet the criteria to be protected under section 75.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I do not uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2021.
