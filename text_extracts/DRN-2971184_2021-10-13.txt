The complaint
Miss B complained that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA applied interest to her account 
when they said they wouldnt. She also complained that shes unable to make payments to 
her account as agreed with PayPal.
What happened
Miss B has a PayPal credit account which she opened in April 2019. 
Unfortunately, Miss B became unemployed in 2020. She contacted PayPal to explain her 
situation. She needed their help as she was unable to make the required payments to her 
PayPal credit account. 
In May 2020, PayPal agreed a payment holiday for a period of three months. The payment 
holiday finished on 30 July 2020. PayPal offered to extend the payment holiday. But when 
she realised that interest would continue to be charged, Miss B decided not to take up their 
offer.
PayPal completed an income and expenditure form with Miss B to establish what she could 
afford to repay. Miss Bs case was then passed to PayPals Vulnerable Customer Team to 
review her circumstances and agree a hardship payment plan. 
Unfortunately, PayPal didnt update Miss Bs records correctly and a further payment holiday 
was recorded on her account. This meant that interest continued to be added to her balance. 
So, Miss B contacted PayPal on 27 September 2020. She wanted to know why the hardship 
plan agreed hadnt been set up. PayPal put her in touch with their Vulnerable Customer 
Team again.
A few days later, Miss B paid £0.50p towards her outstanding balance. PayPal refunded 
interest of £11.75 that had been charged. PayPal agreed a hardship payment plan of £0.50p 
per month. They confirmed this to Miss B by email. Miss B then made a further payment to 
PayPal of £1.00 on 5 November 2020. 
In December 2020, Miss B contacted PayPal. She wanted to set up a standing order to pay 
£0.50p per month. But PayPal said they couldnt accept standing order payments where a 
hardship plan in place. So, Miss B offered to pay £10 to cover future payments under the 
plan instalments agreed. But PayPal couldnt accept this either as the payment plan was 
regulated to receive regular monthly payments rather than one off payments.
When no further payments were received for two months, PayPal contacted Miss B. Miss B 
wanted to set up a direct debit to make payments. But PayPal said they also couldnt set up 
a direct debit where a hardship plan is in place. They suggested they set up a continuous 
payment authority from one of the cards she had registered against her PayPal account. But 
Miss B didnt want to use those cards. She said she wanted to use a different card. So, 
PayPal lifted the restriction on her credit account to allow a new card to be added. 
Miss B was unable to add the card she wanted and so couldnt make the payments agreed. 
She was also unhappy that remaining interest charged of £4.79 hadnt been refunded to her 
account. So, she referred her complaint to this service in March 2021. 
One of our investigators looked at Miss Bs complaint. He contacted PayPal who confirmed 
that they had now refunded the remaining interest. But having looked into the problems Miss 
B had setting up the regular payment agreed, he couldnt find that PayPal had done anything 
wrong.
Miss B didnt agree with our investigators findings. She said interest hadnt been refunded. 
She also insisted that PayPal were not allowing her to set up her card against the PayPal 
credit account so that payments could be made. So, she asked for her complaint to be 
referred to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I do recognise that this must be a very difficult time for Miss B. Losing her job and the 
resultant loss of income can be very stressful. Particularly where there are debts outstanding 
in addition to her normal regular living costs.
In Miss Bs case, she contacted PayPal to explain her change of circumstances. This was 
exactly the right thing to do and would ensure that PayPal fully understood her situation. 
PayPal then agreed a payment holiday with Miss B. I think this is appropriate where its 
hoped that Miss Bs job situation may only be temporary. When the holiday payment period 
expired, PayPal offered to extend it for a further three months. Looking at PayPals actions, I 
think they were doing everything they could to support Miss B in the circumstances here.
Miss B decided that she didnt want to extend the payment holiday. Shed realised that the 
balance she owed continued to attract interest. I can understand why she might do that. 
Particularly if she couldnt see a resolution to her job situation in the short term. So, PayPal, 
completed an income and expenditure form with Miss B. This would help them to decide 
exactly what she could afford to pay. So, it appears that PayPal were adopting a sympathetic 
and appropriate approach in Miss Bs circumstances here.
Unfortunately, despite taking these steps and also what Miss B had said, it appears that 
PayPal did extend the repayment holiday. PayPal have admitted their mistake here and 
refunded interest charged of £11.75. They also subsequently refunded a further £4.79. They 
confirmed that to this service in a letter in April 2021. So, it appears that PayPal have now 
refunded all the interest charged from when they first agreed a hardship payment plan with 
Miss B.
Miss B remains unhappy that shes not been able to make the agreed payments to PayPal. 
Shes told this service that PayPal have refused to set up a standing order or direct debit for 
her. PayPals policy is that they wont accept these methods where a hardship payment plan 
is in place. This is their policy and is not something that this service would question. But it is 
important that where PayPal agrees a payment plan, there should be a process that enables 
Miss B to make those payments.
PayPal have explained that they arranged for Miss B to be able to set up a new payment 
card against her account with them. This would usually be a debit card to allow payments to 
be made from Miss Bs bank account. But Miss B wasnt able to do this. Shes provided 
evidence to this service that shows that there was a problem setting up the card for 
payments. PayPal have said there is no reason, at their end, why Miss Bs card cant be 
registered for payments. 
I suggested Miss B contact her bank to establish whether the problem may be with her card 
or account with them. There can be circumstances where a bank may refuse a request to set 
up a card payment. That could be the case here. But Miss B refused to contact her bank and 
insisted that the problem lay with PayPal. Unfortunately, I cant find anything that leads me to 
reach the same conclusion. Despite asking Miss B again to contact her bank, she has not 
responded to this service.PayPal told this service that Miss B could make a payment using her card by calling them. 
Miss B told this service that she was unable to pass PayPals telephone security 
requirements. So, she thought this wasnt an option. But PayPal said she could call their 
collections telephone number which would bypass the normal security requirements and 
enable her to make a payment.
I suggested Miss B call the collections telephone number provided by PayPal. She said 
shed done this previously, without success. So, I suggested she try PayPals collections 
number again, explain her situation and let this service know the response. But Miss B didnt 
respond to this or our follow up requests.
I realise that Miss B will be disappointed, but I havent been provided with anything that 
persuades me that PayPal have acted inappropriately here. PayPal appear to have 
exercised discretion and tried to be supportive of Miss Bs circumstances. Unfortunately, 
Miss B hasnt responded to my most recent requests to speak with her bank and call 
PayPals collections service. So, based upon what Ive seen, Im not able to uphold her 
complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Miss Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 November 2021.
