K822xcomplaint
Mr and Mrs M complain  about some international cheques they say were lost by 
National Westminster Bank Plc.
background 
Mr M says he paid three cheques, drawn  on his foreign bank account, into the NatWest 
account he held jointly with his wife. One was in May 2018 for £44,200, another was in 
August 2018 for £42,000 and a third further  one was in October 2018 for £41,000. 
Mr and Mrs M say NatWest lost these cheques and as a result Mr Ms foreign bank account 
has become dormant and he has to travel  abroad  to get it operating again. He said he and 
his wife urgently  need the money.
NatWest said it sent the first cheque to the wrong  clearing bank. It apologised for the 
mistake and credited  Mr and Mrs Ms account  with the £73.60  they were charged  in fees. 
And it paid £80 compensation. But it couldnt  find any trace of the second cheque. It said it 
sent the third cheque  through  the incorrect clearing.  It paid them  a further £20 
compensation and waived  a fee of £8. After this Service became involved it offered to 
increase the compensation by another £150. 
The adjudicator thought  that Mr Ms foreign bank account had been dormant since October  
2017. So she said it wouldnt be reasonable to ask NatWest to pay for him to travel abroad  
to get it operating again. And she thought  the level of compensation NatWest  was now 
offering Mr and Mrs M was fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.
Mr and Mrs M didnt  agree. They said the last transaction  on Mr Ms foreign  account was on 
19 October 2017. It became dormant 12 months  later because NatWest  failed to deal with 
their three cheques correctly. They said NatWest  lost another  cheque which Mr M deposited 
on 13 August 2017 for £15,000.  And they were upset because they said NatWest had failed 
to protect  their personal  data. So they didnt  think the compensation was enough.
The adjudicator went back to NatWest about the cheque from August 2107.  It provided a 
bank statement to show that this amount was deposited into their account on 4 August 2017. 
She explained this to Mr M in a telephone call.
But the adjudicator agreed with Mr M that from the further information he gave her his 
account with the foreign bank didnt  become  dormant until October  2018.  But she didnt think  
that NatWest wouldve  reasonably foreseen  that losing his cheques  wouldve resulted in this 
happening. So she thought the compensation was sufficient. Mr M didnt agree. He said that 
there may be restrictions in the future on funds leaving the country where  his foreign bank 
account is held although he said this hasnt  happened  yet.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
conclusion as our investigator  for very similar reasons.
NatWest has accepted it made a mistake about two cheques Mr M attempted  to pay into his 
account. It said it cant find any trace of the third one Mr M has mentioned. And I think from 
the information its given us its made reasonable efforts to trace  it. 
Ref: DRN34628322Mr and Mrs M said NatWest failed  to protect their personal data. But I cant  see that by 
NatWest not processing  these cheques correctly there has been any breach of data 
protection.
So the only issue remaining for me to decide  is whether  the amount of compensation 
NatWest is offering Mr and Mrs M is sufficient.
I know Mr and Mrs M will be disappointed  with my decision but I agree with our investigator 
that NatWest wouldnt  have reasonably foreseen that the loss of two cheques wouldve 
resulted in the foreign  bank account  becoming  dormant.  So I cant fairly ask it to pay for the 
costs of travelling abroad to get the account operational again.
Mr M says there may soon be a restriction on him moving his funds from his foreign bank 
account and that NatWests error  will impact on him if this happens.  But we cant  fairly ask 
NatWest to compensate  for any possible future losses. Our role is to look at what has 
already happened and the impact of that on Mr and Mrs M.
NatWest has refunded the £73.60  Mr and Mrs M paid in fees and charges. And its waived a 
fee of £8. Its paid them £100 compensation and has now offered a further £150. For all the 
reasons Ive given  I think thats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.  
my final decision
My decision  is that National Westminster Bank Plc must pay Mr and Mrs M an additional 
£150.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs M to 
accept or reject my decision  before  8 August  2019.
