The complaint
Ms B, through her representative, complains that Short Term Finance Limited (STFL), lent to 
her irresponsibly.
What happened
Ms B was approved for seven loans and using the information provided by STFL here is a 
brief loan table. My understanding is that all the loans have been repaid.

Loans 4 and 5 were approved on the same day and the combined capital lent was £500 at
£45 a week repayment. Loans 6 and 7 were approved on the same day and the combined 
capital lent was £600 at £50 a week repayment.
STFL did not uphold her complaint. Ms B referred it to the Financial Ombudsman.
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that by loan 5, STFL ought to 
have been carrying out additional checks but without the information from Ms B about her 
financial circumstances then our adjudicator did not come to a finding on whether loan 5 had 
been lent irresponsibly. Our adjudicator did think that the pattern of lending had become 
such that Ms B was likely reliant on the lending by Loans 6 and 7. So she did think STFL 
should put things right for Ms B for loans 6 and 7.
STFL disagreed and said that it had adhered to the regulations governing lending, and there 
are gaps between many of the loan applications by Ms B which does not demonstrate 
reliance on its credit and felt that the gaps broke the lending chain. 
STFL said:
From the end of loan 1 to the start of loan 2 there was a break of 6 weeks and 5 
days
From the end of loan 2 to the start of loan 3 there was a break of 9 weeks From the 
end of loan 3 to the start of loan 4 there was a break of 11 weeks From the end of 
loan 4 to the start of loan 5 there was a break of 11 weeks
Loans 4 and 5 were taken the same day as one loan was split over 16 weeks and 25 
weeks terms
Loans 6 and 7 were also taken the same day as one loan was split over 16 weeks 
and 25 weeks terms
The complaint remained unresolved and was passed to me. After I had reviewed it I asked 
for copy bank statements to better understand Ms Bs financial situation. These were sent to 
us relatively recently all of which I have reviewed.  Having done that, I issued a provisional 
decision on 17 March 2022 in which I gave reasons as to why I was planning to uphold 
loans 6 and 7. 
I made it clear in that provisional decision that I was going to review the complaint again on 
31 March 2022. And I said that as Ms Bs complaint is almost a year old and then I was 
planning to issue a further decision on or before 31 March 2022 in the interests of both 
parties to try to conclude it.
We have heard from Ms B who has said she accepts the outcome in my provisional 
decision. We have not heard from STFL. 
My provisional decision findings are duplicated in the next section of this decision and in 
smaller type to differentiate it. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about high cost lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance, and good industry practice - on our website.
STFL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms B could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the Ms Bs income 
and expenditure.
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that STFL should 
fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer. These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income).
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income).
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable).
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.STFL was required to establish whether Ms B could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being the 
ability to repay without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
to do that.
My provisional decision findings dated 17 March 2022
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context and 
what this all means for Ms Bs complaint.
The statements we have received are for one bank account. I can see that there were transfers from 
another account copies, of which I do not have. The copies I have received cover the period 
12 September 2015 to May 2017, then theres a gap and the next statements cover December 2017 
to January 2018 and then one set covering November 2021 to December 2021.
Gaps in lending
I agree with STFL that the gaps in the lending between the loans do not lead me to be persuaded that 
Ms B was reliant on STFLs credit. They were not insignificant gaps. But I disagree that the gaps 
break the loan chain and so I have treated all seven loans as part of one lending relationship between 
Ms B and STFL.
Proportionate checks
The information Ms B gave to STFL at the time of applying for loans 1 to 3 were satisfactory. STFL 
has explained A credit status report was also obtainedto check for CCJs and any other 
indebtedness to check if the applicant is suffering any financial hardship and to validate the 
expenditure data they have provided. CCJ refers to County Court Judgments.
I have not seen any of the credit searches it carried out at the time. Ms B has not sent to me a copy of 
her credit file. But overall, I think that the checks were proportionate and loans 1 to 3 likely affordable.
In June 2017, Ms B applied for two loans on the same day  loans 4 and 5  and the combination was 
a £500 loan, repayable at £45 a week. This was a marked increase in capital and repayment figures 
and so I have considered whether STFL ought to have carried out additional checks. On balance 
I think not and one reason was because Ms B had been debt free from STFL for over two and a half 
months and loans 1, 2 and 3 had been paid on time (except loan 3 was a week late). So, I do not 
consider that STFL was alerted to any need for additional checks to be carried out.
However, even if additional checks had been carried out, still I dont think that STFLs decision to lend 
would have altered when it approved loans 4 and 5. And I say this because I reviewed Ms Bs bank 
statements for the month 12 April to 11 May 2017. And it revealed to me the following financial facts 
which I summarise here:
Ms B received around £541 in the month from the employer for which shed been working part-time 
for a while; and Ms Bs combined income from tax credits and child benefits amounted to £1,121; and 
she spent around £347 on food, £66 on childcare, media companies for films and music and internet - 
£71, TV licence £12, two different telephone companies £218, DVLA £20, insurance of £10, and 
council tax of £82. That equates to £826.Apart from one payment to a debt company there were no payments to any other loan companies.
Added to which Ms B transferred into this account about £815 from another account to which she 
appears to have had access. And I can see that Ms B paid around £435 to a holiday company in that 
month. It looks as if the £815 which came from her other account was used to pay the holiday 
company.
So, ignoring the holiday expenditure and the additional transfers into her account, on her regular 
income figure of £1,662 less her regular expenditure of £826 that month it leads me to think that Ms B 
would have been able to afford loans 4 and 5. And even if STFL had looked at her bank statements or 
carried out additional checks before lending loans 4 and 5 then I think it would have approved those 
loans.
Loans 6 and 7 were applied for in November 2017 and loan 5 looks to have been paid off using the 
capital from one of the new loans 6 or 7.
By this stage I do think that STFL ought to have been carrying out a full financial review and I say that 
because Ms B was returning to refinance a loan and asking for more than shed asked for before. And 
she had been a customer of STFL and indebted for almost two years.
Unfortunately, I have not been sent the copy bank statements for the period leading up to 
November 2017. I have copies up until May 2017 then nothing until December 2017.
So, I have reviewed the month for December 2017 and January 2018 and a marked difference was 
that Ms B received much less tax credit funds and there is no explanation as to why that may have 
been. I can see that she continued to receive her monthly salary of £540. Her overall combined 
income was much reduced for the month I looked at and her expenditure looks much the same as 
that of earlier in the year (save for the holiday company expense).
And so using what I have, and in view of the proximity of the December 2017 bank statement to the 
November 2017 loan approvals, I am making a provisional decision that it was unlikely she could 
afford the £50 each week to pay for loans 6 and 7.
If I am incorrect on this deduction that Ms Bs income appeared to have reduced significantly around 
the time she applied for loans 6 and 7, then I think that STFL got it wrong when it calculated 
affordability at the point of sale of the two loans in November 2017. I say this because I refer to a 
discrepancy in the records STFL has sent to us which leads me to the same provisional conclusion  
that Ms B was not likely able to afford loans 6 and 7.
Reviewing the information STFL had before lending, it looks like it was incorrect. It had recorded a 
weekly income of £793 made up of £220 employment, £33.40 child benefit and £540 other.
A full financial review which may have included looking at her bank statements and/or reviewing 
payslips  which is what I think proportionate checks would have been for loans 6 and 7  would have 
revealed that her regular monthly income was £540 not her weekly income. And its own records likely 
would have told STFL that whether it viewed her bank statements or not. Then considering her 
outgoings were similar to those in April and May 2017, then I doubt that she could afford the £50 a 
week to STFL.
I am planning to uphold Loans 6 and 7.
This is the end of the duplicated provisional decision. 
What have both parties said in response tot eh provisional decision? 
Ms B, through her representative, has agreed with my provisional findings and added 
nothing further.
STFL has not responded.As I outlined in my provisional decision, this complaint has been ongoing for a year and so in 
the interests of both parties to draw this to a resolution I have decided to issue my final 
decision. 
And as Ms B has agreed to it and I have received nothing further from STFL, then I see no 
reason to depart from the findings I made in my provisional decision and they are repeated 
here and form part of my final determination. 
I uphold the complaint in relation to loans 6 and 7. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STFL should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms B from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms B may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this lender which they may not have had with others. If this wasnt a 
viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming 
that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for borrowing). But even if they had done that, the 
information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or ought to 
have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is impossible to now 
accurately reconstruct.
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real 
and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Ms B in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Ms B would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFLs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.
STFL ought to do as follows:
refund all interest and charges Ms B paid on loans 6 and 7;
pay interest of 8% simple a year* on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative payment information about loans 6 and 7 from Ms Bs credit 
file;
*HMRC ask that STFL take off tax from this interest. It must give Ms B a certificate showing 
how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Bs complaint in part and I direct that Short Term 
Finance Limited does as I have directed in the section putting things right. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2022.
