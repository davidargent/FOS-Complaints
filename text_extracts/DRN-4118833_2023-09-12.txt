The complaint
Mr M complains NewDay Ltd (NewDay) reduced the credit limit on his credit card account 
without good reason and also breached his privacy. 
What happened
Mr M says without any prior notification NewDay reduced the credit limit available on his 
credit card account from £1,500 to £300. Mr M says NewDay then informed him that this was 
reduced as he hadnt been using his credit card account which isnt true. Mr M is also 
concerned that his personal details may have been shared with another individual as he 
received a letter from NewDay with that individuals salutation. 
Mr M wants NewDay to reinstate the previous credit limit on his credit card account and 
honour his privacy. 
NewDay says it apologised to Mr M that it didnt initially send a letter to explain the reasons 
why it was reducing his credit limit and have offered £40 by way of apology. NewDay says 
the limit was reduced because Mr M didnt use the credit card account in the way it was 
intended and additionally Mr M may want to look at his credit file. NewDay says it regularly 
reviews its customers accounts, so it may increase Mr Ms limit at a later stage and will 
advise him of this if it does. NewDay says there wasnt any breach of Mr Ms personal data it 
was simply a typing error in the salutation field of that letter. 
Mr M wasnt happy with NewDays response and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator felt NewDay were entitled to review the credit limits of its customers from time to 
time and in this instance it felt it needed to reduce Mr Ms limit accordingly, after conducting 
a credit file search. The investigator felt Mr M should request the credit balance on his credit 
card account to be sent to his bank account, so his credit card account can be used as 
intended. 
The investigator says while it must have been frustrating for Mr M to have received a letter 
from NewDay with the incorrect salutation, there was no evidence of any personal data 
breach. The investigator says NewDay apologised for not initially sending a letter to Mr M 
advising him of the reduced credit limit, but the £40 it offered was a fair amount of 
compensation for that. 
Mr M didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding this complaint and I will explain how I have come to my 
decision.
I can understand it would have been upsetting for Mr M to learn the credit limit on his credit 
card account with NewDay had been reduced. When looking at this complaint I will consider 
if NewDay acted fairly when it reduced Mr M s credit limit and if theres any evidence to 
suggest his personal data had been breached, following an incorrect salutation on a final 
response letter he received from NewDay. 
Mr Ms complaint centres around the fact, without any previous notification the credit limit on 
his NewDay credit card account was reduced from £1,500 to £300 and the subsequent 
explanation NewDay provided for that reduction isnt correct. Additionally, Mr M has raised 
concerns about his own personal data being potentially breached following the salutation on 
a letter he received from NewDay had another individuals name stated. 
I understand the points Mr M makes here, in particular that NewDays reasons for reducing 
his credit limit arent accurate  in so far that he does use the credit card account but not the 
credit limit available on it, which he feels shouldnt be a reason for the substantial reduction 
in his available credit limit. 
The first thing to say here is businesses like NewDay, as part of its ongoing credit 
assessments, are entitled to carry out regular reviews of its customers account activity. Here 
following doing so and checking Mr Ms credit file, it didnt feel it could continue to offer the 
level of credit available to him, in part due to the fact there was very light usage of the credit 
facility provided to him, although other considerations were taken into account.  
While I can understand this would have been frustrating for Mr M its not my role to tell 
NewDay on what basis it must extend credit to its customers  that is a business decision for 
it to make based on various factors and Im satisfied it has carried out a full review, but here 
felt it couldnt any longer offer the same level of credit as before in part because the credit 
limit wasnt being utilised - I am satisfied that was a reasonable decision for it to take. 
NewDay have explained it does from time-to-time review customers credit limits and it may 
consider increasing Mr Ms limit at a later stage. 
I do agree however NewDay should have informed Mr M of this limit reduction sooner than it 
did, but I am satisfied its offer of £40 by way of apology is fair in the circumstances  after all 
Mr M wasnt making use of the facility in any event.  
I have considered Mr Ms concerns about the incorrect salutation on a letter he received 
from NewDay following his complaint and NewDay have confirmed there wasnt any data 
breach here, it was simply a typing error on the salutation field, but the letter was correctly 
addressed including his full name, so with that in mind I cant say theres any evidence to 
suggest any breach of Mr Ms  personal data has taken place here. Ive also seen all other 
correspondence from NewDay to Mr M has been correctly addressed so I dont feel any 
additional compensation is warranted here. 
While Mr M will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of NewDay. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 October 2023.
