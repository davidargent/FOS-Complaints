The complaint
 Mr A complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & CIE SCA is holding him liable for three 
transactions which he says he didnt make or authorise.
 
What happened
 Mr A contacted PayPal on two occasions to dispute a number of payments which had been 
made from his account. Mr A told PayPal that his account had been hacked. Following this 
on 13 February 2019, to protect Mr As account, PayPal restricted his account.
PayPal investigated Mr As claims. And looked at transactions which had been made on 
Mr As account in January 2019. It agreed to refund Mr As first claim and refunded Mr A on 
6 April 2019. It declined Mr As second claim. However, PayPal reviewed things again and 
accepted that Mr A hadnt authorised the remaining payments. So, it refunded these in 
September 2019. 
Mr A says PayPal havent refunded him all the disputed transactions which were made from 
his account. He says he raised chargeback claims for three transactions which were part of 
his disputed transaction claim with PayPal. And he wants PayPal to refund him these 
transactions. The outstanding transactions were made on: 30 November 2018 for £55, on 
21 January 2019 for £200 and 1 May 2019 for £250.
PayPal declined to refund Mr A the outstanding transactions and said Mr A needed to 
contact his card provider as it had no grounds to overturn its decision. However, it accepted 
it had taken too long to refund Mr As second disputed transaction claim and offered him 
£150 compensation for the delays. Mr A didnt accept PayPals offer. He says he didnt make 
the three transactions and wants them refunded. And the compensation offered doesnt 
reflect the amount of trouble and upset hes been caused. So, he brought his complaint to 
our service where one of our investigators looked into the matter.
Before reaching her view, the investigator asked PayPal to provide more information to show 
that Mr A had authorised the three transactions. But PayPal didnt provide anything. So, the 
investigator looked at the information she did have. And based on this she thought that the 
disputed transactions had taken place on Mr As account between November 2018 and 
May 2019. So, she asked PayPal why it had only concentrated its fraud investigation on 
transactions made on Mr As account in January 2019. And to provide evidence to show 
Mr A had authorised the outstanding three transactions. PayPal didnt provide any 
information and referred to the chargeback being declined.
The investigator said under the Payment Service Regulations (PSRs), PayPal were required 
to refund unauthorised transactions. And based on the evidence shed seen, she thought it 
was unlikely Mr A had authorised the outstanding three transactions. So, she said PayPal 
should refund the transactions and pay Mr A interest for loss of use of his funds. Plus £200 
compensation. 
PayPal disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to review the matter. So, the complaint has 
been passed to me to decide. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant 
regulations, regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and where 
appropriate, what I consider to be good industry practice at the relevant time.
The investigators view sets out in full the facts, the transactions, the relevant regulations 
and the evidence. Both Mr A and PayPal have read the investigators view, so I wont repeat 
every detail here, only those which form the basis of my decision. However, I can assure 
both that Ive read the file, including their responses to the investigators view.
 
The PSRs primarily require financial institutions to refund customers if they didnt make or 
authorise transactions themselves. Mr A says he didnt make the transactions. So, my 
primary concern is to decide whether or not I think Mr A authorised the three payments from 
his account. If I decide on the balance of probabilities that he did, then Im unlikely to ask 
PayPal to refund them.
The investigator has explained in detail why she doesnt consider the transactions were 
authorised. PayPal has provided some information. But despite being asked by the 
investigator, it hasnt provided evidence to show how the transactions were authorised. So, it 
hasnt been able to show that the transactions were authenticated. 
Based on the evidence that has been provided PayPal has accepted that Mr As account 
was compromised and had been hacked. And in the absence of any evidence to the contrary 
I can only conclude that Mr A didnt make or authorise the three outstanding transactions. 
In reaching this conclusion I note the £200 transaction was made in January 2019 which is 
during the period that PayPal has accepted Mr A didnt authorise a number of transactions. 
PayPal also restricted Mr As access to his account in February 2019 so, its unclear to me 
how Mr A could have authorised the £250 transaction in May 2019 if he didnt have access 
to his account. And PayPal havent provided any evidence about how the account was 
accessed after this date. From looking at the chargeback information PayPal has provided I 
note that the email address used for the three transactions isnt associated with Mr A. And 
that PayPal appear to be relying on information for previous transactions during a period 
which it has accepted Mr As account was compromised. For these reasons I think its more 
likely Mr A didnt consent to the transactions. 
PayPal have pointed to their terms and conditions about chargebacks. But I dont think that 
their terms supersede the relevant legislation. And a chargeback is just an alternative 
method a customer can use to try and get their money back  it doesnt invalidate their rights 
under the PSRs. So, I dont think PayPals point is relevant here. PayPal are still required to 
refund unauthorised transactions under the PSRs. PayPal should also keep in mind that we 
expect businesses to generally act fairly and reasonably, and to follow good industry 
practice. 
Its also clear to me that Mr A has spent a good deal of time trying to sort things out and has 
been quite frustrated and upset by whats happened. He also had to wait more than six 
months for PayPal to refund his second fraud claim. So, I think additional compensation is 
warranted. I think £200 is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 
My final decision
 For the reasons Ive explained I uphold this complaint. To put things right PayPal Europe 
Sarl & CIE SCA should:Refund Mr A the disputed transactions amounting to £505
Pay Mr A interest at an annual rate of 8% simple on the disputed transactions from 
the date Mr A raised his fraud claim until the date of settlement
Pay Mr A £200 compensation for the trouble and upset hes experienced as a result 
of PayPals delays
Pay Mr A 8% simple interest on the total sum of his second fraud claim from 13 
February 2019 to the date he was refunded, to account for the loss of use of these 
funds

Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 April 2021.
