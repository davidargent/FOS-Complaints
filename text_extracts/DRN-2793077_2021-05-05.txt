The complaint
Miss T is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, authorised her for a credit account 
which was unaffordable for her at the time that she applied for it.  
What happened
Miss T applied for a PayPal credit account in October 2019 and her application was 
approved. In September 2020, Miss T contacted PayPal and advised that she was suffering 
financial difficulties. Miss T also complained that she felt the credit account should never 
have been leant to her because it was unaffordable for her at the time that it was applied for 
and because she suffered with mental health issues.
PayPal looked at Miss Ts complaint. They felt that they had undertaken reasonable and 
proportionate checks into Miss Ts financial situation at the time of the credit account 
application, and that these checks hadnt demonstrated that the credit being offered would 
be unaffordable for Miss T. So, they didnt uphold Miss Ts complaint.
Miss T wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They noted that Miss Ts credit file showed 
a number of defaults and other entries that they felt should have given PayPal cause to 
consider that the credit being offered was unaffordable for Miss T. So, they recommended 
that the complaint be upheld in Miss Ts favour and that PayPal should take corrective action 
and pay compensation to Miss T.
Despite repeated requests from this service, PayPal didnt respond to the view put forward 
by the investigator. Because PayPal didnt respond, the matter was escalated to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a lender to decide who they will offer credit to, and on what terms. What this service 
would expect would be that a lender undertakes reasonable and proportionate checks to 
ensure that any credit being offered is affordable for the account applicant at the time that 
they make the application. 
PayPal have explained that they undertook checks into Miss Ts financial circumstances at 
the time that Miss T applied for the account. As part of their initial review of this complaint, 
our investigator asked PayPal to provide the results of the check into Miss Ts credit file that 
PayPal relied upon before approving the credit account. However, despite repeated requests 
by this service to that effect, this information was never provided by PayPal.
Miss T did provide this service with a copy of her credit file, and upon review its clear that 
there are several entries  which would have been present at the time of the credit 
application - that I feel should have given PayPal cause to question whether the credit 
account being offered to Miss T was affordable for her at that time.
For instance, at the time of the credit application there were two existing defaults on Miss Ts 
credit file, as well as two other credit accounts which demonstrated repeated instances of 
missed payments.
And it would have been expected that PayPal would have checked Miss Ts credit file when 
considering her application. Especially as the information supplied by Miss T on the credit 
account application form lists her net monthly income as being in the £1,001 to £1,500 
range, whist her monthly housing payments are listed as being in the £501 to £1,000 range. 
Im not convinced that the use of such wide margin bracket options by PayPal in their 
application allows them to make an accurate determination of an applicants financial 
situation, and in this instance, it may have been the case that Miss Ts income was at the 
low end of the £1,001 to £1,500 bracket, whilst her housing costs were at the high end of the 
£501 to £1,000 bracket.
Additionally, Miss T also listed on her application for that her living expenses were £0 per 
month. This seems unrealistic to me, and I feel that it provides further cause for PayPal to 
have undertaken additional checks into Miss Ts financial circumstances, including 
conducting a check of Miss Ts credit file. And, as explained above, if PayPal had checked 
Miss Ts credit file, Im not satisfied that PayPal would, or should, have offered the credit 
account to Miss T, given the information present on Miss Ts credit file at that time.
All of which means that its difficult for me to conclude that PayPal did undertake reasonable 
and proportionate checks into Miss Ts financial circumstances in this instance, or that the 
credit account was affordable for Miss T at the time that it was applied for.
It follows from this that Ill be upholding this complaint in Miss Ts favour and instructing 
PayPal to take corrective action and pay compensation to Miss T as described below.
Finally, Miss T has also expressed her concern that the credit account shouldnt have been 
offered to her because of mental health issues that she struggles with. However, given that 
the account application was undertaken online, I cant fairly say that PayPal should have 
been aware of these issues at the time of the application. 
Putting things right
PayPal must refund all interest and charges applied to the account from inception.
If this results in a credit balance in Miss Ts favour, PayPal must pay this to Miss T along 
with 8% simple interest calculated from the dates of the interest or charges being 
reimbursed.
If a balance remains outstanding on the account for Miss T to pay, PayPal should arrange an 
affordable interest-free repayment plan with Miss T, based on her income and expenditure 
information at this time.
PayPal must also remove any adverse information relating to this account from Miss Ts 
credit file.
Finally, PayPal must make a payment of £100 to Miss T to compensate her for the distress 
and inconvenience she has incurred.  
My final decisionMy final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA on 
the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 June 2021.
