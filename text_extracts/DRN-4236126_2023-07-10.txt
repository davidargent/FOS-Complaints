The complaint
Mrs H complains that the loans she had from Lloyds Bank PLC were unaffordable to her.
What happened
Mrs H had four loans with Lloyds between 2 February 2015 and 26 February 2021 as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 2 Feb 2015 £3,500 36m £131.35 5 Feb 2018 16 Jul 2016
With loan 2
2 16 Jul 2016 £7,576.45 60m £163.80 1 Jul 2021 18 Nov 2016 
With loan 3
3 18 Nov 2016 8,191.33 70m £175.59 1 Aug 2023 26 Feb 2021
With loan 4
4 26 Feb 2021 12,401.77 48m £314.70 1 May 2025 30 Dec 2021
Mrs H says that after the initial lending, she refinanced each loan with subsequent loans 
from Lloyds. She says she took numerous holiday repayments during the period and the 
debts were increasing leaving her struggling to make the repayments. Mrs H adds that the 
financial pressure has led to emotional issues and her relationships have suffered as a 
result. She says the lending was unaffordable due to other debts and Lloyds should not have 
allowed her to refinance as she was making only the minimum repayments on her credit 
cards and her requests for payment holidays should have indicated to Lloyds that she was 
struggling financially.
Lloyds says it did not review Loan 1 as it was taken out more than six years before Mrs H 
complained and, therefore, was out of jurisdiction. It says that, when it approved the other 
loans, it had taken into account Mrs Hs income, other debt and living costs. Lloyds adds that 
it also asked Mrs H whether her circumstances were likely to change in the future. It says it 
approved her online requests for payment holidays as there was no suggestion of financial 
difficulties and she repaid the final loan in full with no missed payments.
One of our ombudsmen has considered whether this service can look into Mrs Hs complaint 
about the first loan and decided it was within our jurisdiction. So, this decision will review the 
affordability of all four loans.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He said he found the 
checks carried out by Lloyds for loans 1 to 3 were proportionate and there were no obvious 
signs Mrs H was struggling financially. However, he considered Lloyds should have carried 
out further checks before agreeing to loan 4, as Mrs Hs multiple requests for payment 
holidays could have indicated she was in financial difficulties, plus her credit commitments 
had increased. That said, our adjudicator didnt see anything which would have suggested to 
Lloyds that the lending was unsustainable, even if it had carried out further checks.
Mrs H responded to say, in summary, that she didnt agree as Lloyds didnt carry out enough
checks for loan 4.
Provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mrs H and to Lloyds on 12 June 2023. Ive summarised my 
findings below:
For loans 1 and 2 I couldnt see that there was anything that should have indicated to 
Lloyds that the lending was unaffordable;
I found Mrs H had a change of circumstances before she applied for loan 3 and 
considered it reasonable that Lloyds would have seen the lower income from her 
bank statements;
As Mrs Hs disposable income was now less than £200 and the loan repayment was 
£176 per month over 70 months, I found this was likely to be unsustainable for Mrs H 
and Lloyds should not have approved the additional lending;
For loan 4 I considered Lloyds should have ensured it thoroughly understood Mrs Hs 
financial circumstances;
Having looked at her bank statements, I was satisfied there was nothing that would 
have indicated to Lloyds that the loan repayments for loan 4 would be unsustainable.
My provisional decision was that I upheld Mrs Hs complaint about loan 3, but I couldnt see 
that Lloyds acted unfairly in any other way.
Lloyds responded to say, in summary, that it agreed to refund all the interest Mrs H was 
charged in relation to Loan 3, plus 8% simple interest on the overpayments.
Mrs H accepted Lloydss offer.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mrs H has accepted the offer from Lloyds, and Im satisfied the offer is reasonable, my 
decision is that Lloyds should refund the interest on loan 3, as it has offered to do.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. Lloyds Bank PLC should do the following, 
as it has offered to do:
Add up the total amount of money Mrs H received as a result of having been given 
loan 3. The repayments Mrs H made should be deducted from this amount. Any overpayments should be refunded along with 8% simple interest 
(calculated from the date the overpayments were made until the date of 
settlement). *
Remove any negative information recorded on Mrs Hs credit file regarding loan 3.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lloyds to deduct tax from this interest. Lloyds should
give Mrs H a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if she asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 August 2023.
