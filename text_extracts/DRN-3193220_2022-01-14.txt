The complaint
Ms H (through a representative) complains Short Term Finance Limited (STF) lent to her 
irresponsibly because it didnt carry out proper affordability checks or assessed her overall 
indebtedness.   
  
What happened
In total Ms H was advanced at least 27 home collected loans from an unknown date before 
February 2016 and June 2019. Ive included some of the information this Service has

STF has been able to provide detailed information about loans 15  27 (expect for loan 23). 
However, for loans 1  14 STF has only provided limited information about the loans, and 
even then, I cant be sure the information is correct.
For example, it has recorded loan 13 as being for £0. And, it has also provided the term of 
each loan and the likely weekly repayment for these loans. But what STF hasnt been able to 
provide, because it says the information is deleted after a rolling six-year period, is the start 
and end date of each loan. So, what this Service cant say are the start and end dates for 
each of the first 14 loans. 
Although loan 23 was approved and then cancelled, and therefore didnt cause Ms H a loss, 
Ive kept the loan in the table, to ensure that the loan numbers match up with what the 
adjudicators assessment. 
In response to Ms Hs complaint STF issued its final response letter on 5 February 2021. In 
the FRL it explained that Ms H had taken 12 loans between 2016  2019. STF didnt uphold 
Ms Hs complaint but acknowledged there had been some repayment problems during this 
period. 
Unhappy with this response, Ms Hs representatives referred her complaint to this Service.   
An adjudicator reviewed the complaint and discovered at least a further 14 loans taken out 
before 2016. Following some further investigations, she concluded those loans were within 
this Services jurisdiction and could be considered. STF agreed and consenting to all loans 
being included in the investigation.  
The adjudicator, then reviewed Ms Hs complaint and she couldnt conclude what happened 
when loans 1  14 were approved. This is because, STF didnt have any data about this 
lending beyond what was including in the table above. So wasnt able to conclude that 
anything went wrong when the early loans were approved. 
But, the adjudicator thought, that from and including loan 15 all future loans shouldnt have 
been granted. She said there were clear problems of the loans being unsustainable, 
including having multiple loans with repayment problems and her overall pattern of lending 
was now harmful for Ms H. So, loan 15, and all future loans ought to not have been 
advanced. 
Ms H appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings. Later on, Ms H confirmed that she 
didnt have any information about loans 1  14.  
STF disagreed with the adjudicators assessment. In response, it said;
there was no nothing wrong in the way STF dealt with Ms H
it adhered to all the regulations that were applicable at the time 
Ms H had previously worked for STF between June 2014 and February 2016 and 
was therefore aware of the proportionate levels that STF goes to ensure the loans 
are affordable and sustainable 
Although there were some missed payments this couldve been for a variety of 
reasons and some of the loans the adjudicator listed in her assessment when missed 
payments occurred, STF highlighted loans that either had missed payments but 
loans were still closed within the contractual term (loans 20) or only over ran for a few 
days such as loan 17 and
STF doesnt charge late payment fees.As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
There doesnt appear to be any ongoing disagreement about the outcome the adjudicator 
reached about loans 1  14, especially in light of the fact that neither STF or Ms H is able to 
provide any further information about the start and end date. I agree with the adjudicators 
findings about these loans, that this Service doesnt have sufficient information to be able to 
conclude that STF did something wrong when these were advanced. 
Instead, this decision will focus on what happened when loans 15  27 were lent. But Ive 
kept in mind loan 1- 14 as they do form part of Ms Hs lending history with STF. 
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms H could
repay her loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might suggest STF should have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Ms H. These factors include: 
Ms H having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income); 
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ms H having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms H coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms H. The loan payments being 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.
At the time loans 15  27 were advanced, STF was regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority, which has set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) that payments are 
sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in particular, made on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to make them. If a 
lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make 
their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those 
repayments are unsustainable.Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Ms Hs complaint.
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 15 - 27 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. 
But its worth saying STF has provided this Service with the information it gathered from Ms 
H about her income and expenditure for loans 15  22 and 24- 27. 
I would say, that based on the details in the application forms, that STF couldve reasonably 
concluded that Ms H would be in a position to afford the repayments she was committed to 
making. 
But Id be inclined to think that from loan 15, STFs checks really needed to go further. At this 
point in the lending relationship, I think STF ought to have been verifying Ms Hs income and 
overall expenditure in order to have an accurate understanding of her actual financial 
position. I dont think it did this level of check for these loans. 
I do note that for some of the loans, such as loan 17 it appears that STF may have reviewed 
Ms Hs bank statements. But looking at the application forms, STF didnt check Ms Hs bank 
statements for each loan. It also isnt clear whether the bank statements were actually 
reviewed as part of the affordability assessment or merely used to confirm Ms Hs income.  
Rather than using them to confirm the information Ms H had provided about her expenditure.  
That isnt the end of the matter, on top of carrying out a proportionate check, STF also need 
to be mindful whether the loans were sustainable for Ms H, not just pounds and pence 
affordable. 
So, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Ms H, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Ms H. Having looked at the overall pattern of STFs 
lending history with Ms H, I agree with our adjudicator that STF should reasonably have 
seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided 
loan 15. I say this because;
At this point STF ought to have realised Ms H was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms H had taken 14 pervious loans, and although I dont know what 
timescale this was over, this is a significant number of loans where Ms H had 
borrowed similar sums for loans 15  27. In my view, Ms Hs loan history up until this 
point clearly indicated that her underlying financial situation didnt seem to be 
improving, given her loans were increasing in value. 
Although, STF or Ms H have been able to provide much information about loans 1  
14. But it does look like, based on the limited information STF has provided, that Ms 
H previously had repayment problems in that some of the earlier loans appear to 
have taken longer to repay than the contract. These earlier loans were for similar 
sums, so its likely, that unless Ms Hs situation had changed, that shed also struggle 
to sustainable repay these loans. 
Ms H developed a pattern of taking new loans around the same time previous ones 
were repaid, for example, loans 17, 18 and 19. And later on in the lending 
relationship Ms H had more than one loan running at the same time.. So, STF ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Ms H, on these occasions, was having to 
borrow further to effectively cover a long-term financial need. To me, this is also 
indicative of her indebtedness not being sustainable.Ms H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STF. Loan 27 was 
taken out more than three years since loan 15 was advanced. And loan 27 was for 
nearly twice the amount of loan 15. Ms H had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to STF over an extended period.
After loan 15, Ms H had further problems repaying her loans although, some of the 
missed payments didnt lead to the loans being paid significantly late. For example, 
loan 16 there were 5 missed payments but the loan was still repaid before the 
contractual end date. However, there were also occasions where either loans were 
repaid significantly later than planned, such as loan 24, and then further lending was 
advanced. So, the frequency of missed payments on a number of loans, for varying 
sums, does indicate that these loans were unsustainable because this would indicate 
Ms H wasnt in a position to service the loan in line with credit agreements. 
I think that Ms H lost out when STF provided loans 15  22 and 24 - 27 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Hs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans and the time in debt was likely to have had negative 
implications on Ms Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 15  22 and 24 to 27 and Ill go on to set 
out what STF should do to put things right.
Ive considered what STF has said about Ms H being a former self-employed member of 
staff. But, Ms H being a former member of staff doesnt remove STFs regulatory 
requirement to assess the affordability for each loan as well as assessing whether the 
repayments were likely to be sustainable for her and for the reasons Ive outlined above, I 
dont think these loans were sustainable for Ms H. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms H from loan 15 as I think it ought to. 
Clearly there are several possibilities, and all hypothetical answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms H may have simply left matters there and 
not tried to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed between 
her and STF which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, she may 
have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct.
 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Ms H in a compliant 
way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Ms H would more likely than not have taken up any one ofthese options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
STF shouldnt have given Ms H loans 15 to 22 and 24 to 27.
A. STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms H towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans. 
B. STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms H 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms H originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled. 
C. STF should pay Ms H A plus B.
D. The overall pattern of Ms Hs borrowing for loans 15  22 and loans 24  27 means 
any information recorded about them is adverse, so STF should remove these loans 
entirely from Ms Hs credit file. Given, loan 23 was cancelled, this loan ought to not 
have been reported on her credit file. If it has been, then like for the other upheld 
loans this loan record should also be deleted. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Ms H a 
certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Ms Hs complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 February 2022.
