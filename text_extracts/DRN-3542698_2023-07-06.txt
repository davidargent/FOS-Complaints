The complaint
Mrs M complains that Lloyds Bank plc wont refund to her the money that she and her 
husband paid for an ownership interest in a holiday club. Shes being represented in her 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs M and her husband entered into a holiday ownership purchase agreement in February 
2017. The purchase price was £23,300 and Mrs M agreed to make payments of £1,165 in 
each of March, April and May 2017 to the holiday company using her Lloyds Bank credit 
card. Mrs M and her husband also entered into a loan agreement for a loan of £19,805 with 
a lender.
Mrs Ms representative made a claim, on behalf of Mrs M, to Lloyds Bank in June 2020 
under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the holiday company and 
Lloyds Bank misrepresented the product and breached the contract and regulations 
(including a European directive, Spanish law and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract 
Regulations 1999) and that the breaches of statute and regulations made the purchase 
agreement, and Mrs Ms payment using her Lloyds Bank credit card, null and void. 
Mrs M hadnt received a response from Lloyds Bank so a complaint was made to this 
service. This service contacted Lloyds Bank and it said that it hadnt received the June 2020 
claim letter so it then considered her claim. It said that it didnt agree that Mrs M had proven 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ms complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that Lloyds Banks decision to turn down her claims was unfair or unreasonable. She 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think 
that the holiday company had breached the contract that had been agreed with Mrs M and 
her husband. She also considered the claim under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 
but she said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mrs M 
and Lloyds Bank was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the 
conclusion that the relationship was unfair.
Mrs Ms representative says that Mrs M doesnt agree with our investigators 
recommendation and it asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It 
provided detailed responses to that recommendation in May and September 2022 and May 
2023. It outlined in its May 2022 letter its analysis of the EU directive and why the purchase 
agreement doesnt comply with the directive. It says that the breaches of the EU directive 
make the purchase agreement null and void and that, as a consequence, the related credit 
card agreement with Lloyds Bank is null and void. 
It outlined in its September 2022 letter its analysis of the Timeshare, Holiday Products, 
Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 and the reasons that it says that the 
regulations were breached and that Lloyds Bank breached its duty of care to Mrs M. It also 
says that Mrs M has a cause in negligence against Lloyds Bank for the breach of duty of 
care and a breach of contract and that she only discovered the breaches when she engaged 
it in February 2020. It referred in that letter to section 140A.
It referred in its May 2023 letter to a judicial review decision and says that Mrs Ms claim 
shares the same characteristics as the cases which were reviewed. It says that it sees no 
reason for this service not to take the same stance with Mrs Ms claims as it did on the 
fractional timeshare claims that were the subject of the review in which it was found that the 
relationships between the debtor and creditor were unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ms complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
Mrs M made payments to the holiday company of £1,165 in each of March, April and 
May 2017 using her Lloyds Bank credit card and her claim to Lloyds Bank was made 
under section 75  section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the 
supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in 
that section are met);
Mrs Ms claim under section 75 is that the holiday ownership product was 
misrepresented to her and her husband and that they wouldnt have bought it if it 
hadnt been misrepresented to them;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Lloyds Banks response to 
Mrs Ms claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mrs Ms representatives June 2020 letter to Lloyds Bank described the 
misrepresentations that it says were made to Mrs M and her husband by the holiday 
company, including that: 
they didnt realise that the contractual documentation states that they 
purchased a floating week timeshare and not a specified apartment for a fixed 
week in the year (which has been found to be null and void under EU 
directive);
they were led to believe that booking their holidays was a simple task but they 
faced great difficulty in finding availability for their holidays as there was never 
any availability during the school holidays;
they wanted to exchange the timeshare to another resort but couldnt get the 
right resort as the number of points they had was too low and that was never 
explained to them;
theyve never been able to use the timeshare as they couldnt get any 
booking despite being told that there were unlimited getaways; and
the holiday company didnt highlight the perpetuity contract which meant that 
the ongoing liability for maintenance fees would be transferred to Mrs Ms and 
her husbands children;
its clear the Mrs M and her husband entered into a holiday ownership purchase 
agreement with the holiday company in February 2017 but Ive not been provided 
with a copy of that agreement  I have been provided with unsigned copies of an assurance checklist, the loan document, an addendum to the general terms of the 
holiday ownership purchase agreement and a standard information form;
Mrs Ms representative has described the misrepresentations that it says were made 
to Mrs M and her husband by the holiday company but no detailed description of the 
conversations or circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made 
has been provided;
the assurance checklist says: Subject to payment of the full Purchase Price, I/we 
own a floating week; and floating week has been highlighted and marked with a 
question mark  and the standard information form says: The exact occupancy 
rights which Seller proposes to transfer to consumer are 1 week(s) in a 2 Bed 
Townhouse during the Gold season;
Ive seen no evidence to show it would have been reasonable for Mrs M and her 
husband to understand that they were buying a fixed week and Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company misrepresented to 
them that they were buying a fixed week  nor am I persuaded that a floating week 
holiday ownership product is prohibited under any EU directive or that it causes the 
purchase agreement to be null and void;
Mrs Ms representative says that Mrs M and her husband were led to believe that 
booking their holidays was a simple task but there was never any availability during 
the school holidays so theyve never been able to use the timeshare  but a 
townhouse was to be available to them during gold season and Ive not been 
provided with any evidence to show the unsuccessful attempts that they made to 
book accommodation or that no holidays were available for them; 
Mrs Ms representative has provided an owner options document on which 
handwritten notes have been made, including unlimited getaways, but Im not 
persuaded that its likely that the holiday company would have said that their 
purchase would entitle to them to unlimited holidays or that the notes are enough to 
show that the product was misrepresented to them;
Mrs Ms representative says that Mrs M and her husband wanted to exchange the 
timeshare to another resort but couldnt get the right resort as the number of points 
they had was too low and that was never explained to them  any such exchange 
would only have been possible after Mrs M and her husband had entered into the 
purchase agreement so I dont consider that they would have been induced into 
entering into the purchase agreement by any such misrepresentation;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs M and her husband 
had bought a points membership or that the holiday company misrepresented to 
them what they would be able to use their holiday ownership product for;
Mrs Ms representative says that the holiday company didnt highlight the perpetuity 
contract which meant that the ongoing liability for maintenance fees would be 
transferred to Mrs Ms and her husbands children  but the standard information 
form says that the period in which the holiday ownership right may be exercised will 
terminate in 2082  so I dont consider that the contract was made in perpetuity or 
that their liability for management fees would continue in perpetuity;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday ownership 
product was misrepresented to Mrs M and her husband by the holiday company or 
that they were induced into entering into the holiday ownership purchase agreement 
by any such misrepresentations;
Mrs Ms representative says that the holiday company breached the contract and 
regulations (including a European directive, Spanish law and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999) and that the breaches of statute and 
regulations made the purchase agreement and Mrs Ms payment using her Lloyds 
Bank credit card null and void  it also says that the holiday company has breached 
the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010;
I consider it to be clear from the documentation that Ive seen that the holiday 
company is not a British or Spanish company and that the holiday ownership product 
is not in the United Kingdom or Spain so I dont consider that the Unfair Terms in 
Consumer Contract Regulations 1999, the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and 
Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 or Spanish law would apply to Mrs M and her 
husbands purchase of the holiday ownership product;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract or of any applicable directive or regulation in these circumstances and, if 
there had been a breach of any applicable directive or regulation, Im not persuaded 
that it would be a breach of contract for which Lloyds Bank would be liable under 
section 75;
nor am I persuaded that the purchase agreement is null and void (as claimed by 
Mrs Ms representative);
Mrs M chose to use her existing credit card with Lloyds Bank to make payments to 
the holiday company and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that theres been a breach of a duty of care by Lloyds Bank or that those payments, 
or her credit card agreement with Lloyds Bank, are null and void (as also claimed by 
her representative);
our investigator also considered Mrs Ms claim under section 140A but I consider it to 
be clear from Mrs Ms representatives June 2020 letter to Lloyds Bank that Mrs Ms 
claim was made under section 75 and that no claim was made under section 140A;
Mrs Ms representatives May 2022 and September 2023 letters in response to our 
investigators recommendation referred to section 140A and an unfair relationship 
between Mrs M and Lloyds Bank but I dont consider that Mrs M has made a claim to 
Lloyds Bank under section 140A so I cant consider a claim under section 140A in 
this decision;
if Mrs M wants to make a claim under section 140A about her relationship with Lloyds 
Bank being unfair, she should first make a claim to Lloyds Bank and then, if shes not 
satisfied with its response, she may be able to make a complaint to this service;
Mrs Ms representative says that Mrs Ms claim shares the same characteristics as 
the cases that were subject to the judicial review to which it has referred  but the 
reviewed complaints concern fractional ownership products and Im satisfied that the 
holiday ownership product that was purchased by Mrs M and her husband isnt a 
fractional ownership product  the reviewed complaints found that a court would 
likely conclude that the relationship between the debtor and creditor was unfair under 
section 140A but Ive already said that I dont consider that Mrs M has made a claim 
to Lloyds Bank under section 140A;
Lloyds Bank says that it didnt receive the June 2020 letter from Mrs Ms 
representative, and it didnt respond to that letter, so I cant say that its response to 
her claim was fair or reasonable  but when it was contacted by this service about 
the claim it said that it didnt agree that Mrs M had proven a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the holiday company and I consider that it was fair and 
reasonable at that time for it not to have upheld Mrs Ms claim;
I sympathise with Mrs M and her husband for the issues that theyve had with their 
holiday ownership product but I dont consider that Lloyds Bank has acted incorrectly in connection with the payments that Mrs M made to the holiday company using her 
Lloyds Bank credit card; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Lloyds Bank to refund to Mrs M any of the money that she paid for the holiday 
ownership product, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2023.
