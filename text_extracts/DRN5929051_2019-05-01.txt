K820x#14complaint
Mr S says Lloyds Bank plc mis-sold  him a payment protection insurance  (PPI) policy.
background
Mr S bought the policy in 1997  at the same time as taking out a loan. The loan included an 
amount to pay for the policy.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr S disagreed with the adjudicators opinion so 
the complaint  has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory (as some of it is here),  I reach my conclusions on the balance  
of probabilities  that is, what I think is most  likely to have happened in light of the available 
evidence and the wider surrounding circumstances.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Ss case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Ss complaint because:
I think its likely that Lloyds made Mr S aware  the PPI was optional and that he chose  to 
take it out. Mr S says he was told he had to buy the PPI to get the loan he wanted.
The difficulty  I have is that I cant be sure what was discussed between  Mr S and Lloyds 
at the time. And Lloyds  hasnt  been able to provide much documentation from the sale,  
which isnt surprising as its many years since the loan and PPI were  sold.  
But Lloyds has given  us a sample  of the loan agreement it says was in use when Mr S 
arranged his borrowing. This includes a section for Optional Loan Payment Protection. 
There were Yes and No boxes that the customer had to tick to say whether or not they 
wanted the cover.
So I think Mr S wouldve realised he had a choice about whether to buy the PPI. And 
there is nothing on the loan agreement to suggest  that taking the PPI was a condition of 
getting the loan. 
I also think its unlikely that Lloyds wouldve added the PPI to Mr Ss account  if he hadnt 
ticked the box to say that he wanted the cover.  
Lloyds accepts that it probably  recommended  the PPI to Mr S, but it doesnt  look as if it 
was unsuitable  for him based on what Ive seen of his circumstances at the time.  
I think Lloyds could  have explained the cost of the policy better  than it did. Its unlikely 
that Lloyds told Mr S how much interest  he would be paying  on the amount he was  
borrowing for the PPI. But that amount was less than Â£100.  So even if Lloyds had given 
Mr S this information,  I think he wouldve still bought the PPI. 
Ref: DRN59290512Mr S would have received a limited refund of the PPI premium if he cancelled the policy  
early. I dont  know if Lloyds thought about  this when it recommended  the policy or 
explained the situation clearly  to Mr S. But Ive seen nothing  to suggest Mr S thought he 
would repay the loan early. So I dont think this made the policy unsuitable or better 
information about this wouldve stopped him buying it.
Its possible Lloyds didnt point  out the main things the policy didnt cover.  But its unlikely 
Mr S would have been affected by any of these.
When I take all of these  points into account,  Im not persuaded that the PPI was mis-sold. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 June 2019.
