The complaint
Ms M complains that NewDay Ltd (Newday) lent to her irresponsibly and shouldnt have
suspended her Aqua card in November 2020. 
What happened
 Ms M applied for an Aqua card in January 2014 and was given a limit of £250. Then,
increases were agreed on the Aqua card, and an Amazon card was also issued as follows:
Date Limit
January 2014 £250
July 2015 £500
January 2016 £1,000
August 2016 £1,750
October 2018 £2,650
October 2018  Amazon 
Card£500
 
Ms M complained that she shouldnt have been given the increases in limit. And in 
November 2020, Newday cancelled her card  even though she wasnt in financial difficulty.
Newday said Ms M passed all their credit checks. Ms M told them in January 2014 that she 
was earning £27500 per annum, with other debts of £2,500. The last default was 44 months 
previously. On the increase to £500 in July 2015, there had been late and over limit fees, but 
not in the last six months. Repayments were being made. On the increase to £1,000 in 
January 2016, there had been only two late payment charges in the last six months. On the 
increase to £1,750 in August 2016, there had been one (refunded) late payment fee. On the 
final increase to £2650 in October 2018, there had been fees charged but they were within 
policy for an offer of an increased limit. Mr M accepted the offered increases  and didnt opt 
out, as she could have. Newday said the accounts had been closed as part of their 
complaint process. When she applied for the Amazon card in October 2018, she declared 
income of £26,780 and unsecured debts of £11,400. The most recent default was 48 months 
before.
Ms M brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said she thought the issue of the card in 
January 2014 was OK, but the increases after that were irresponsible. There had been late 
and over limit fees each time. And by the time Ms M applied for the Amazon card in October 
2018, there were other external debts of over £11,000. So  Newday shouldve made more 
inquiries before increasing their lending. She said the suspension of Ms Ms Aqua card was 
OK.
Newday disagreed, they said that there were fees charged in 2014  but not in the months 
leading up to the increase in June 2015. There were no indications of other debt problems 
either. For this and all other increases, she met Newdays lending criteria, including a regular 
income. They asked that an ombudsman look at Ms Ms complaint.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
I disagree with our investigators view. I think that the increases in July 2015, January 2016 
and August 2016 were OK, but the final increase to £2,650 in October 2018, and the issue of 
the Amazon card shouldnt have been agreed. I will explain why I think thats the case.
All lenders have an obligation to lend money responsibly. We must check whether Newday 
acted in line within the Financial Conducts (FCA) rules on creditworthiness assessment as 
set out in its handbook, (CONC) section 5.2. These say that a firm must undertake a 
reasonable assessment of creditworthiness, considering both the risk to it of the customer 
not making the repayments, as well as the risk to the customer of not being able to make 
repayments.
The first issue of the card in January 2014  with a modest limit of £250  was OK. I can see 
that Ms M said she was earning £27,500 a year, had other debts of only £2,500 and had 
lived at the same address for 4 years. There werent any payday loans showing. There was 
a defaulted loan of £1,500, but that was 44 months before. So that was OK.
Looking at the increase to £500 in July 2015, there were initially problems showing in 2014. 
There were nine over limit fees  a sign of problems  but these had stopped a good while 
before - in October 2014. There were some eight late payment fees  also signs of issues - 
but these stopped in March 2015. Newday had no information about other debts. The new 
limit of £500 was still a modest one. So  I consider the offered increase in July 2015 was 
OK.
Looking at the increase to £1,000 in January 2016. There had been just one late payment 
fee. There was no information about other debt problems. So  that was also OK.
Looking at the increase to £1,750 in August 2016. There was one (refunded) over limit fee. 
But by now, Newday could see there were other debts elsewhere of £6,822 (in July 2016). 
But  given that Ms Ms Aqua account was being well maintained  payments were being 
made and borrowing was within the limit - I think that was OK.
However, by the time of the final increase to £2,650 in October 2018, there were more signs 
of problems. There were seven over limit fees and seven late payment fees in the period 
since August 2016. Other debts had gone up to £11,915 (in September 2018). So, Ms M 
was having to borrow more money and taking on a lot of debt. So, on that basis, I think 
Newday shouldve  at that time  made more inquiries and asked Miss M questions about 
what was going on. But they didnt.
It was at that time  October 2018  that Newday also agreed the Amazon card. Given what 
they could see on the Aqua card, it didnt make sense either to issue another card with an additional limit of £500.
I do note though  that Ms M couldve declined the offers of the increase but didnt. Newday 
told us that she proactively accepted them. So, to some extent, Ms M was also responsible 
for the additional borrowing.
Turning to the suspension of Ms Ms card  I can see that by September 2019, there were 
more, regular late payment fees and over limit fees  and other debts had gone up to 
£14,606  so Newday were justified in reducing the limit progressively in September 2019 
(£2550), to £2,100 in December 2019. Miss M was clearly in financial difficulty and so 
Newday were correct in stopping her card. Also, its within their terms and conditions that 
they can do this if they wish.
So  as I dont think that in October 2018, Newday shouldve increased the limit to £2,650 on 
the Aqua card, or issued the Amazon card with a limit of £500, I think they should:
Refund all interest and fees charged on the Aqua card for borrowing over £1,750 
from October 2018.
If these refunds result in a credit balance, then pay 8% per annum simple interest on 
the balance from the date of overpayment to the date of settlement.
Refund all interest and fees charged on the Amazon card from October 2018.
If debts still outstand, agree a mutually agreeable payment schedule with Ms M.
Remove any adverse credit file entries added since October 2018.
Responses to the provisional decision:
Miss M agreed with the provisional decision, but Newday didnt. They said, in summary:
Miss M had external debts of £11306 in October 2018 (not £11915)
The credit reference agency data showed a stable income, had no arrears with other 
lenders in the last six months of the October 2018 increase or any evidence of 
financial difficulty or affordability.
On the Amazon card, the same arguments applied. There werent any recent defaults 
showing. There werent any CCJs.
So  I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Ive considered what Newday have said to us in response to the provisional decision. I 
quoted the external debt of £11915  as at September 2018 as I assumed that was the 
figure that NewDay wouldve seen when looking at the increase in October 2018  but the 
difference of £609 makes no difference  the external debts were still high. 
In making a judgement on whether, or not, the lending was irresponsible  this is a balance 
of all factors that I observed. Against what Newday told us in response to the provisional decision, I was also equally concerned by the late payment and over limit history of Miss Ms 
account. And the external debts had increased a lot and was high  and I just think that on 
balance, this warranted some further questions  proportionate to the limit of £2650. And, by 
the same logic  if the lending in October 2018 on the Aqua card was irresponsible, then to 
provide a further card (Amazon) at the same time must also be considered irresponsible. It 
will also be noted that Im not awarding any compensation payment  which also reflects the 
balanced decision here.
And so  having considered what Newday have argued, I am issuing a final decision which 
is the same as the provisional decision, and for the reasons I gave in it.
My final decision
 I uphold this complaint. And NewDay Ltd should:
Refund all interest and fees charged on the Aqua card for borrowing over £1,750 
from October 2018.
If these refunds result in a credit balance, then pay 8% per annum simple interest on 
the balance from the date of overpayment to the date of settlement.
Refund all interest and fees charged on the Amazon card from October 2018.
If debts still outstand, agree a mutually agreeable payment schedule with Ms M.
Remove any adverse credit file entries added since October 2018.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 October 2021.
