K820x#14complaint
Mr P complains that Tesco Personal Finance  PLC (Tesco) has charged  him too much  for a 
personal loan.  
background
Mr P applied for a personal loan with Tesco and on 21 September 2018 it sent him a loan 
agreement. But the loan agreement was wrong  because it included a two month payment 
break at the start of the loan term. That meant the payments were £318.77, starting in 
January 2019.  
Tesco sent a second loan agreement  to Mr P on 21 September 2018 which was correct and 
didnt include a payment break at the start of the term.  The loan payments were quoted as 
£315.19. Mr P signed this loan agreement to accept its terms on 25 September  2018. 
Due to a mistake, Tesco didnt  amend  its systems to reflect  the correct  loan agreement  
before it released  the funds to Mr P. That meant  it didnt collect  loan payments for November 
and December 2018. In January 2019 Tesco collected £318.77  instead  of £315.19. 
Mr P complained and Tesco responded on 11 February 2019 and agreed it had made a 
mistake. Tesco confirmed it had accepted the wrong loan agreement on its systems which  
meant it failed to collect the first two monthly loan instalments. Tesco offered Mr P two 
options: 
1-Accept the loan agreement that includes a two month payment break. Tesco  would 
then send Mr P £214.80 which  is the difference between the £315.77 payment he 
should have made and £318.77  payment he is currently  paying across the term of 
the loan. Mr Ps loan payments would remain at £318.77. Tesco also agreed to pay 
£50 if Mr P accepts this option. 
2-Revert back  to the correct loan agreement Mr P signed to accept on 
25 September 2019. If Mr P accepts this option  hell have to make  up the two initial 
payments of £315.19.  Tesco offered Mr P £100 compensation if he accepts this 
option. 
Mr P referred his complaint to our service and it was passed  to an investigator. The 
investigator agreed Tesco had made mistakes but thought the two options  it offered were 
reasonable. Mr P didnt  agree and says hed like £200 compensation, for Tesco to waive the 
first two payments and reinstate  the correct loan agreement  with payments of £315.19. As 
Mr P wasnt  willing to accept the investigators view his complaint has been passed  to me to 
make a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Id like to note that one of our key focuses 
is to ensure a consumer  doesnt lose out financially  due to an error by a business. We look 
to put the consumer back into the position they would have been  in had no error  been made.  
In this case, Tesco confirms it accepted the wrong  loan quote  after Mr P returned his signed 
paperwork. That meant after it released  funds  to him in October 2018 it didnt collect  any 
Ref: DRN64864422payments in November  and December 2018.  The payments started in January 2019 and 
were around  £3 higher  than Mr P expected which is when he complained. 
Whilst I agree Tesco did make a mistake, I have to take into account that Mr P didnt make 
the first two loan payments of £315.19 and has saved that money. In order  to put him back  
into the position he wouldve been  in had no mistake been  made,  he would have to make up 
those payments. I appreciate Mr P wants Tesco to waive  them but Im not persuaded thats 
fair. 
Ive looked at the options Tesco has offered. Option 2 is designed to put Mr P back  into the 
position he would have been in had Tesco accepted  the right loan quotation. Whilst I 
appreciate it requires Mr P to make up the two missed payments, those are payments he 
would always have  had to make under the loan agreement he signed. Tesco  says it will pay 
Mr P £100  to apologise if he accepts that option.  I think thats fair. 
Option 1 leaves  the ongoing  loan payments at £318.77 for the rest of the term. But Tesco 
has offered to refund the difference between the £315.19 payment Mr P thought he was 
going to pay and the current  £318.77 payment. The refund of £214.80 would effectively put 
Mr P into the position of paying £315.19  for the whole  of the term of his loan whilst also 
benefiting from the two month payment break.  
In addition Tesco has offered £50 to apologise if Mr P accepts this offer. From  what I can 
see, this actually puts Mr P into a better position  than he would have been in had the correct 
loan agreement been accepted. Thats  because in Option 2 Mr P will benefit  from the two 
month payment  break but will also make payments equivalent to £315.19 once the refund  of 
£214.80 is paid to him. 
I appreciate Mr P says he didnt sign the loan agreement for the higher loan payment. But 
Tesco has explained  how the mistake came about and its offered two options  that will 
address the ongoing monthly  loan payment  Mr P has been asked to make. Im satisfied that 
both options are designed to put Mr P as closely as possible back  into the position  he would 
have been in had no error been  made. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Mr P but Im satisfied  Tesco  has provided two fair and reasonable 
options to resolve  his complaint. I appreciate the situation has caused some inconvenience  
but I think Tesco has taken that into account  when making its offers. As Im satisfied Tesco  
has provided fair options to Mr P Im not telling it to increase its offer to resolve his 
complaint. Mr P now needs  to decide  if hes willing to accept either  of the options  Tesco  has 
offered. 
Ref: DRN64864423my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 October  2019.
