The complaint
Mr D complains that MYJAR Limited lent to him in an irresponsible manner. 
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in February 2020 that I summarise below.
Mr D was given nine loans by MYJAR between May 2016 and May 2018. The loans were
due to be repaid over periods of up to a year as shown below. Mr D has successfully repaid
all his loans. A summary of Mr D's borrowing from MYJAR is as follows;

7 03/01/2018 15/01/2018 £  1,575 12
8 22/02/2018 09/04/2018 £  1,100 12
9 21/05/2018 31/08/2018 £  475 3
In my provisional decision I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, and 
in particular that the checks MYJAR needed to do would need to take into account things 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I thought less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
I thought that the checks MYJAR did before agreeing the first four loans were proportionate. 
So I didn't think it had been wrong for MYJAR to agree to give these loans to Mr D.
I thought that MYJAR should have done more checks before agreeing loans 5 and 6. But 
having considered Mr D's bank statements from the time I didn't think better checks would 
have suggested that he wasn't able to repay those loans in a sustainable manner. So 
I didnt think it had been wrong for MYJAR to agree to give these loans to Mr D either.
But I thought that, by the time of loan 7, MYJAR should have realised that the overall pattern 
of Mr D's borrowing should have suggested that any further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it shouldn't provide further 
loans. I asked MYJAR to pay Mr D some compensation in relation to the last three loans.Both Mr D and MYJAR have said that they accept my provisional decision. And MYJAR has 
offered  to pay Mr D the compensation I proposed.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Given that both Mr D and MYJAR 
have accepted my provisional findings, I see no reason to alter the conclusions I reached in 
my provisional decision.
So I don't think MYJAR should have agreed to give loans 7, 8, or 9 to Mr D. MYJAR needs 
to pay him some compensation. 
Putting things right
I dont currently think MYJAR should have agreed to lend to Mr D after, and including, the
loan that he took on 3 January 2018. So MYJAR should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr D on those loans.
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Mr D's borrowing pattern means any information recorded about loans 7 to 9 is 
adverse. So all entries about loans 7 to 9 should be removed from Mr Ds credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must
give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mr Ds complaint and direct MYJAR Limited to put 
things right as detailed above.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 May 2020.
