The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) have unfairly applied a 
default to his credit file for not repaying an unauthorised overdraft. 
What happened
Mr A had an agreed overdraft facility with NatWest for £1,900. Mr A says as a result of the 
pandemic, his job came to an end. Mr A says this had a significant impact on his income, 
livelihood and his mental wellbeing, which affected his ability to face and resolve problems.
The balance of his account had gone over the agreed overdraft. Mr A contacted NatWest to 
try and talk about his financial situation due to the pandemic and agreed to bring the account 
within the agreed overdraft limit.
Mr A wasnt able to do this, and so NatWest defaulted the account and passed the debt to a 
collection agency. Mr A didnt think NatWest had taken into consideration the impact of 
COVID-19. And he didnt think NatWest had acted fairly in not giving him further options and 
time to repay the debt.
A complaint was raised by Mr A with NatWest about their unfair and unsympathetic 
treatment of his financial difficulties and their failure to provide support. NatWest didnt agree 
and said theyd allowed Mr A enough time to clear the debt, and also placed the account on 
hold for him to seek free independent money advice. 
One of our investigators considered Mr As complaint but didnt agree that NatWest had 
treated him unfairly. They said that NatWest had followed the correct procedures in line with 
their terms and conditions and had given Mr A opportunities to bring the account back within 
the agreed overdraft limit. In addition to this the investigator explained that Mr A also had a 
savings account at the time with NatWest, which had a balance of nearly £3,000 which he 
could have used to bring the overdraft back within the agreed limit. But Mr A chose to 
withdraw all the funds in the savings account in November 2020, before the account was 
defaulted in December 2020.
Mr A rejected the investigators findings and asked for a final decision. So the case has been 
passed to me to consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate how difficult things have been for a lot of people over the last 18 months. The 
pandemic has had a significant impact on many individuals, and I can only imagine how 
stressful and worrying it must have been at times for Mr A. Whilst I empathise with Mr As 
situation, I must stick to the facts of the case and come to a fair and reasonable decision for 
both parties involved. 
Mr A had a current account with a £1,900 overdraft limit. He exceeded his limit a couple of 
times in late 2019 and early 2020, but from March 2020 agreed limit was continuously 
exceeded. Mr A didnt contact NatWest, and NatWests attempts to prompt Mr A to contact 
them were unsuccessful. In September 2020 NatWest decided to refer the account to the 
collections department. Im satisfied this was a reasonable step to take as the account had 
been in arrears for several months and NatWest hadnt heard anything from Mr A.
In early to mid-October 2020 NatWest wrote to Mr A setting out the need for him to take 
action. It also tried to discuss matters with Mr A, but he didnt accept the call. From these 
steps Im satisfied NatWest did enough notify Mr A of the position of his account and the 
need to get in contact.
Mr A spoke to NatWest on 19 October 2020. He explained the impact the pandemic had on 
his finances but said he could reduce his overdrawn balance to within the agreed limit in 
three to four weeks. There was a discussion around suspending interest and charges, but as 
Mr A didnt feel able to agree, a repayment plan this wasnt agreed. NatWest did, however, 
waive some interest and charges and was looking into providing Mr A with some breathing 
space while he sought debt advice. 
Unfortunately, the line disconnected before anything could be finalised and it seems 
NatWests call-back went unanswered. Mr A says NatWest should have done more to 
support him here. But Im satisfied they considered his circumstances and proposed 
reasonable concessions based on what Mr A told them. On 23 October 2020 NatWest 
issued a notice of default. I consider this reasonable of NatWest given the account had been 
in arrears for over six months and no repayment plan had been agreed.
Mr A called NatWest again on 29 October 2020. He was given 30 days to seek debt advice 
and get back in touch. NatWest didnt hear from Mr A so in late November 2020 they sent 
him a letter asking him to get in touch within 14 days. Mr A didnt contact NatWest again, 
although he did withdraw his savings account balance  about £1,300  which he could have 
used to bring the account back within the agreed overdraft limit to avoid the default. 
NatWest went on to close the account and report a default with the credit reference 
agencies. It was reasonable for them to do so as the account had been over the agreed 
overdraft limit for an extended amount of time, and Mr A hadnt shown a commitment to 
repaying the debt. So I wont be requiring NatWest to remove the default from Mr As credit 
file.
My final decision
I know this decision will be disappointing for Mr A, but my final decision is that Im not 
upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 February 2022.
