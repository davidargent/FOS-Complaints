The complaint
Miss W complains about the service she has received from Vanquis Bank Limited relating to 
her credit card account.
What happened
But in summary Miss W complains she was given incorrect information by Vanquis regarding 
the origin of a letter  and whether it was sent by a third party (L) that now administered the 
outstanding balance.  
Miss W says she initiated legal proceedings against L because of the information she was 
given by Vanquis.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Our service doesnt have the power to consider whether a financial business has 
breached data protection regulations. So, while I appreciate Miss W has concerns 
about this, I wont be able to comment further here.
Vanquis has acknowledged it provided some incorrect information regarding the 
origins of a letter to Miss W. It has offered Â£50 compensation to Miss W because of 
this. I think this is reasonable in the circumstances as it fairly reflects the 
inconvenience caused.
Miss W took legal action against L. But it was her decision to do so. So, Im not 
minded to award additional compensation.
So for these reasons I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Miss Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 May 2022.
