K820x#14complaint
Ms T complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA limited her account  and didnt allow her 
to make payments  towards her balance.  Shes  says this caused her account to go into 
arrears and led to interest and late payment  charges being  applied.
background
Ms T opened a PayPal  credit account in September 2017. She said she never missed any 
payments. But, on 29 May 2018, PayPal decided to end its relationship  with Ms T. It said this 
was because of the number of reversed payments and her opening, what  it deemed to be, 
an excessive number  of buyer complaints. It notified  her of this the same  day. 
Due to it ending its relationship with Ms T, PayPal permanently limited  her account, which 
meant she wasnt able to make automatic direct  debit  payments from her bank to her PayPal  
account. Ms T said she made one payment over the phone in July 2018. But she said,  after 
that date, she was abroad for a few months  and without access to a phone. 
Ms T said she wanted to continue to make payments  but wasnt able to do so. So, she sent 
multiple messages  to PayPal to ask it to set up a regular direct  debit  so she wouldnt miss 
her payment  deadline while  abroad. But she said it didnt respond and limited the options by 
which she could make payments to her account.  Ms T says this has all caused  arrears to 
build. And she says she was charged  interest  and late payment fees.  She says this has 
impacted her credit score and led to financial hardship. 
PayPal said on 9 October 2018 it made  adjustments to Ms Ts account  to enable her to link 
her bank account. It sent her an email about  this, which included comprehensive instructions 
as to how she could  link her bank account.  PayPal  also gave Ms T the contact number of its 
credit team and an email  address in case she needed further assistance.
Ms T emailed PayPal  the same day asking it to help her set up a direct debit. In its response, 
dated 27 October 2018, PayPal provided further  instructions about how Ms T could set up a 
direct debit and it gave her a Freephone  number in case she needed additional  help. PayPal 
explained Ms Ts account was, by this point,  two months in arrears and if a payment wasnt  
received before 23 November her account would be at risk of defaulting.
Ms T emailed PayPal  again, on 12 November 2018, to explain she still couldnt make a 
payment to her account as she wasnt able to set up a direct debit. PayPal responded on 
15 November explaining  it couldnt  see any reason why she couldnt  add a bank account or 
debit card to her account. It, again,  provided  her with its Freephone number and its opening 
hours in case she needed  assistance over the telephone. Ms T emailed back  the same day 
stating she still couldnt add her debit card or bank  account.
On 21 November 2018 PayPal told Ms T to call its customer services department so it could 
link her bank account. But on 26 November she emailed PayPal again  to say the website 
wouldnt allow her to link her bank  account. She asked PayPal to assist her and it 
responded, two days later, advising her to contact its customer care team  by phone.  
On around 14 December 2018  Ms T raised  a complaint with PayPal, which wasnt upheld.  It 
said it had given correct  information about how Ms T could link her bank account and set up 
a direct debit. And it stated the interest  and charges she had incurred were correctly  applied.
Ref: DRN45559862Ms T was unhappy with PayPals response  to her complaint so she referred it to our service  
where our investigator didnt uphold it. They thought PayPal  had acted  fairly.  And they didnt 
think it had done  anything wrong or needed to do anything more. But Ms T disagreed  and 
asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry  to hear about  the difficulties Ms T experienced  here. I understand she feels very 
strongly about the issues raised in this complaint  and I can see shes  gone to some trouble 
to provide our service with some very detailed submissions. I want  to assure her that Ive 
read everything she has sent us. I hope  she will understand  if I dont  address  every 
comment shes made in this decision. I intend to concentrate on what  I consider to be key to 
this complaint; namely whether  PayPal acted fairly and reasonably here.
Its not in dispute  that, until July 2018, Ms T made regular payments  to her PayPal account 
without difficulty.  Its clear that the problems she experienced in making payments after that 
date were brought about by PayPal  limiting her account. Here, PayPal said it terminated its 
relationship with Ms T due to the number of reversed payments and her opening what it 
deemed to be an excessive number of buyer complaints. Ive looked at whether this was fair.
The terms and conditions  of Ms Ts user agreement with PayPal outline how an account 
holder is expected to manage  their account. Theyre expected to refrain from engaging in 
restricted activities. Reversals and claims  are considered to be a restricted  activity under 
PayPals terms of business. Given what PayPal has told our service about the activity on 
Ms Ts account I dont  think  it was unreasonable for a review to have been  undertaken in 
those circumstances.
Under section 10.2 of Ms Ts user agreement  where an account  holder has engaged in a 
restricted activity PayPal  is entitled to suspend, block,  limit, close or cancel your right to use 
your Payment Instrument or Account entirely or for any particular transaction,  which may in 
turn suspend, block, limit, close or cancel access to your Account or the Services (such as 
limiting access  to any of your Funding  Sources, and your ability  to send money,  make  
withdrawals, or remove financial information. 
Based on what Ive seen  Im satisfied PayPal acted in line with the conditions of Ms Ts 
account when  it decided to cease its business with her and limit her account. It notified her 
promptly. So, I cant fairly find it did anything wrong.
After PayPal restricted her account  Ms T said she experienced technical difficulties in trying 
to link her bank account so she could make  payments. She said, when she reached out to 
PayPal on numerous  occasions for assistance,  it didnt help her. 
I can see Ms T contacted  PayPal regularly by email about this problem. She told our service 
PayPal never responded. But Ive gone  through the chronology of the contact Ms T had with 
PayPal in detail  in the background  to this complaint. Having looked carefully at the 
communication trail, I can see that, while PayPal didnt respond immediately to Ms Ts 
emails, it always  responded within a reasonable time. With that in mind, I dont agree that 
PayPal never responded as Ms T suggested.
Ref: DRN45559863Based on what Ive seen  of the email exchanges  between Ms T and PayPal Im satisfied 
PayPal explained  on numerous occasions how Ms T could link her bank account. The 
instructions PayPal provided were clear and Ms T was informed that PayPal could only take 
payments or set up direct debits over the phone as it needed to speak with the account  
holder. This was due to account security and I think thats reasonable.
Ms T said she wasnt able to link her bank account using the instructions she was given by 
PayPal. She thinks those instructions werent applicable to restricted accounts.  But PayPal 
says that isnt correct  and has told our service there was nothing  in place to prevent Ms T 
linking her bank  account. 
I can see that when  Ms T drew the problems  she was experiencing to PayPals attention it 
offered guidance  each  time it communicated with her about how she could make  payments 
to her account. It offered to take payment by cheque, which Ms T wasnt able to do. And I 
can also see that, in many of its responses, PayPal  told Ms T contact it by telephone so it 
could help her link her bank account,  take a payment from her or set up a direct debit. 
PayPal provided  Ms T with a Freephone  number  she could use to contact it and it told her 
when its phone lines were  open.  I think this all goes to demonstrate  that PayPal was trying  to 
assist Ms T as best it could. And I dont think it could have done anything more  to help her.
Im satisfied it was made clear to Ms T that she would need to contact PayPal over the 
telephone to resolve the problem she was experiencing. But I can see she didnt do so until 
February 2019 after which payments resumed. Ms T says she wasnt able to call before this 
point. And she thinks PayPal should have  called her to help her. But I dont think  this would 
have resolved matters  for Ms T. Ill explain why.
Based on what Ive seen,  Im not persuaded Ms T would have dealt with PayPal  over the 
telephone. She told our service she had no access to a phone  while  she was abroad and 
shes also referred to a number barriers  preventing  her from speaking with PayPal while in 
the UK.  From the extensive  email communication that PayPal and Ms T have  shown our 
service its clear to me that email was her preferred method of contact.  So, I dont think its 
fair to say that if PayPal had called Ms T it would have resolved matters sooner.
I can see the issues with Ms Ts account  were very important to her. So, Id have expected  
her to follow the advice  PayPal gave her about how to make payments to her account. Im 
satisfied PayPal made it clear to Ms T that it wouldnt be able to assist  her unless it spoke 
with her directly. And I think this placed the onus on Ms T to phone PayPal sooner for 
assistance  particularly when she knew her account was in arrears and incurring charges.
Ms T wants our service  to tell PayPal to reimburse  the fees and interest that were  applied to 
her account.  Im satisfied  they were applied in line with PayPals user agreement. And, in all 
the circumstances, I think  it would be unfair for me to tell PayPal to waive  the charges it 
applied. I say this because if Ms T had followed the advice PayPal gave  her about contacting 
it over the telephone  she could have made a payment sooner. Im satisfied  the delays in her 
payments resuming her caused by Ms Ts actions. Ive seen nothing to suggest  delay was 
due to an error on the part of PayPal. 
So, for the reasons set out above, I think that PayPal has acted  fairly  and reasonably and Im 
not going to be asking  it to do anything more. I realise Ms T will be disappointed with this 
decision. But it brings to an end what we, in trying to resolve her dispute  with PayPal 
informally, can do for her. Im sorry we cant help Ms T any further with this.
Ref: DRN45559864my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 February  2020.
