The complaint
Ms L complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA wouldnt close her account or delete her
personal information from its system. She believes PayPal provided poor customer service
and that the difficulties this caused were avoidable.
What happened
I issued my provisional decision on this complaint on 1 February 2022. I provisionally upheld 
the complaint in part and set out what PayPal needed to do to put things right. And I invited 
both parties to let me have any final comments. A copy of my provisional decision is below.
What happened
Ms L had a PayPal account, which shed opened in 2012. Historically there was an existing
limitation on this account. Ms L says she wasnt aware of this (certainly she couldnt recall
anything).
In early July 2020, Ms L contacted PayPal - she wanted to pay for a purchase online but
because she hadnt used her account for some time, shed forgotten her password.
PayPal sent Ms L a link to follow (to reset her password and re-connect with her account).
But Ms L says that as soon as she did this, the effect of the limitation resulted in everything
freezing. So, she couldnt make the payment shed intended.
Ms L contacted PayPal about this via its online chat facility. She wanted it to remove her
account details and close her PayPal account immediately. PayPal responded - it said there
was a historical limitation on her account, and it couldnt carry out her request until she
resolved this issue. In order to do this, it said Ms L needed to provide proof of her
identification (such as her passport).
The limitation had arisen due to the account being opened with Ms Ls first initial rather than
her full first name. PayPal said it needed identification to verify her details.
Ms L wasnt willing to do this  she said she had no intention of using the account now, so
she considered the request excessive. She questioned the limitation on her account and
repeated her request for her details to be removed and the account closed. As PayPal
wouldnt agree Ms L raised a formal complaint and she also referred matters to the
Luxemburg data commission (known as CNPD for short).
PayPal sent Ms L a final response. In summary, this said, in accordance with strict financial
and regulatory legal obligations it was required to retain customer data to safeguard against
fraud, money laundering and financial crime. And as its retention period for data was ten
years (set out in its User Agreement) it couldnt delete the information until that time period
had lapsed. It added that any personal data wouldnt be processed or used for any other
purpose.
Ms L wasnt satisfied and referred her complaint to us. In doing so, she highlighted the
following concerns:
-PayPal hadnt been open and transparent with her when shed contacted it about
using her PayPal account again. There was no mention of the limitation and so
PayPal had obtained her data about her bank account falsely. It now had this
information for ten years and she was worried about its security.
-She considered PayPals requests to provide identification excessive and its refusal
to close the account unreasonable given that she no longer wished to use it.
-She had sent PayPal a number of emails, but she had only got a response to the
complaint after writing to its CEOs office. She considered its customer service was
been poor.
-PayPal had eventually closed her account but only after she had involved the CNPD.
She couldnt understand why the closure couldnt have been actioned from the
outset.
One of our investigators looked into the complaint, but he didnt recommend it be upheld. In
summary he concluded:
-He didnt think the request for re-setting the password wouldve flagged the limitation.
Evidence from PayPal showed the limitation had been on the account since 2014
And that Ms L had been told about this at the time, together with what she needed to
do resolve the issue, which was to provide identification. Ms L had been unwilling to
do this. In the circumstances, he didnt think PayPal had been unreasonable.
-There wasnt any basis for asking PayPal to delete Ms Ls personal information
outside of its data retention period.
-He noted that PayPal had closed the account following involvement from the CNPD.
But this was an exception and, in his view, meant there wasnt anything more for it to
do to resolve the complaint.
-He was satisfied PayPal had responded to the complaint within a reasonable period
of time and within eight weeks of complaint handling rules.
Ms L didnt agree with these conclusions. She asked that her complaint be passed to an
ombudsman for review.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, Im intending to uphold 
this complaint in part. Ill explain why.
Limitation and adding her information
The available evidence shows Ms L was reasonably aware of the limitation on her PayPal
account in 2014. I say this because she and PayPal had been in communication about it.
Given that nothing had changed since 2014, when shed been notified, I dont think there
was any reason for Ms L to suspect that position might have changed. Having said that, I
appreciate its possible she may have forgotten about things given the time that has passed.
I know Ms L feels strongly about this particular point, but I havent seen anything persuasive
to say that in re-setting the password, PayPal should have also taken this opportunity to
remind her about the limitation. So, based on this, I dont think it treated her unfairly here.Closure of PayPal account
I have seen a copy of the live webchat that happened immediately after Ms L tried to use
her account but couldnt. The first thing to say about this is that much of the conversation is
about Ms L wanting PayPal to unlink/delete her bank account details. I will comment on this
under a separate heading below. But first I shall deal with her request to close her PayPal
account. Ms L believes PayPal should have closed her account when she asked it to, and it
shouldnt have been necessary to involve the CNPD or repeat the request a number of
times.
Having looked at the webchat I can understand why Ms L was frustrated and upset  she
couldnt make the payment she wanted to. This would have been disappointing. While I
appreciate this was a result of the limitation on her account, I think this is the key point at
which things started to go wrong in terms of the customer service she received.
In the webchat from July 2020, Ms L says, she doesnt want to use her PayPal account now
and tells it, I want you to close my account. But PayPal doesnt close the account until
October 2020 and after it heard from the CNPD, when it says it made an exception. I asked
PayPal about this and it has explained that a customer can close an account at any time, as
long as its in good standing. But not where its limited in order to avoid further investigation.
Its cited a suspicion of fraud as an example and mentioned a hypothetical situation.
Ive thought about what its said, but I havent seen anything compelling from PayPal to
support there was a reasonable suspicion of fraud in this specific case or that Ms L was
under investigation. I also note that PayPal wasnt holding an account balance where it might
be argued it needed additional information before it could release funds. Rather, PayPal had
requested identification to verify Ms Ls full first name given it says it only had her initial from
the account opening. And presumably it had already satisfied itself as to her identity.
Otherwise, I would have to question why it was corresponding with Ms L in any detail about
the existence of the account.
So, in these circumstances when Ms L said she didnt want to use the account going
forwards and asked PayPal to close it, I consider it should have reasonably actioned her
request. And by not taking any action until things were escalated, Im satisfied this caused
Ms L distress and inconvenience.
Of course, the account is closed now so theres no action for PayPal to take in this respect,
but I think it needs recognise the impact this had. I will say more about this later in my
decision.
Unlinking the personal bank account and retention of data
As I said above, a lot of the conversation with PayPal in the webchat was about Ms L
wanting it to unlink her bank account from her PayPal account and delete this information
from its systems. In the chat Ms L says shes concerned about the security of her
information. PayPal tells her that it cant unlink and delete the account until the issue of the
limitation is resolved. It adds that this cant happen until Ms L provides documents verifying
her identity. 
Ive considered these points but given what I have said about the closure of her account, I
think it follows PayPal should have also unlinked her account, as I cant see what practical
purpose would have been served in keeping it linked when no funding source have been
required for it. In not doing so, I think this added to Ms Ls frustration and her concerns about
her personal information.PayPal has said that still holds Ms Ls bank account details and will do so (in accordance
with its policy) for 10 years from when the account was closed. It says it has to do so for a
number of reasons, which include complying with the law and preventing fraud. Ive
considered its response and had regard for Principles of General Data Protection
Regulation. With this in mind  I acknowledge that PayPal is entitled to decide on its policies
and procedures in terms of retaining information. But, in the individual circumstances of this
complaint, I cant see the relevance of the information here to the obligations cited by
PayPal, or what legitimate purpose is served in keeping these particular details given there
isnt an active account. And that no transactions passed through the account using these
details. So, in strictly applying that policy here, I think its leading to an unfair outcome for Ms
L in the circumstances.
So, in the individual circumstances of this case, in not acceding to Ms Ls request about
unlinking and deleting the account details, I think it treated her unfairly and this had an
impact. In particular, I can see from the webchat response Ms L was getting increasingly
upset and frustrated.
Complaint-handling
Ms L has said she repeatedly raised her concerns with PayPal and it was only after
contacting the CEOs office that she eventually got a response to her complaint. I can
understand her frustration and I hope I have in this decision recognised some of the poor
service I feel she received. But complaint handling itself isnt a regulated activity under our
rules so its not something I can consider. That said, I think I can say Ms L received PayPals
final response letter within the timescales set out by the regulator, eight weeks.
Putting things right
Taking all these points together, I intend to require PayPal to delete all records of Ms Ls
personal bank account details from its servers, send her a letter of confirmation to say this
has been completed and pay her £300 compensation to reflect the distress and
inconvenience this caused (both at the time and in escalating matters further).
My provisional decision
My provisional decision is that I intend to uphold this complaint in part and direct PayPal
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to do the following:
- delete all records of Ms Ls personal bank account details from its servers;
- send a letter to confirm the deletion has been completed; and
- pay her £300 compensation.
Ms L responded to say she accepted the provisional decision. But PayPal didnt provide a 
response before the deadline Id given. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given Ms L has accepted my provisional decision and PayPal hasnt responded to it at all, I 
see no basis to depart from I said. PayPal didnt treat Ms L fairly and I have explained why this caused her distress and inconvenience. Its only right it should put things right and Ive 
set out what it needs to do to resolve the complaint. 
I hope Ms L can now put what happened behind her. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and direct PayPal
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to do the following:
- delete all records of Ms Ls personal bank account details from its servers;
- send her a letter to confirm the deletion has been completed; and
- pay her £300 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 March 2022.
