The complaint
Mr M complains that CarCashPoint Limited was irresponsible to lend to him.
What happened
Mr M took out a logbook loan with CarCashPoint on 29 May 2015. He borrowed £1,060 and
needed to repay £31.94 per week for 78 weeks until 25 November 2016. The loan was 
settled on 12 December 2017.
Mr M says that CarCashPoint didnt do enough checks before lending to him and that the
repayments were unaffordable. He says he was self-employed at the time, in severe 
financial difficulties and behind with his mortgage payments and other priority bills. Mr M 
adds that his car was clamped by a man that came to the door without any prior warning. He
says this was unfair as he couldnt make the payments without missing priority bills and his
wife felt threatened.
CarCashPoint says it asked Mr M for information about his income and expenditure and 
cross-referenced this with his bank statements. It says it found that Mr M had sufficient 
disposable income to make the repayments and it had no concerns about financial 
difficulties.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She found that
CarCashPoints checks went far enough and that the available information showed the
repayments were affordable to Mr M.
Mr M responded to say, in summary, that, as a family of five his outgoings were far higher
than the calculated figure. He says he had two mortgage accounts with total payments of 
around £600, both of which were in arrears. He adds that he also had a guarantor loan for 
which he was repaying over £200 per month and a very poor credit history, including a 
recent County Court Judgement (CCJ). Mr M says that he cant agree that using a bank 
statement in isolation is a sufficient check, given his poor credit record and the fact that he 
had simply stopped paying some of his bills.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mr M and to CarCashPoint on 18 November 2020. I 
summarise my findings here:
I wasnt satisfied CarCashPoints checks went far enough because:
The repayments on the loan were around £140 per month and Mr M needed to be 
able to sustain these for 18 months;
As Mr M was self-employed, it was likely his income fluctuated. Indeed, 
CarCashpoint could see from his bank statements that although Mr Ms income in 
April 2015 was in line with what hed declared, this was not the case in February and 
March;
Mr Ms deeds showed there were two lenders with interest in the property  his 
expense declaration and bank statements only showed one of these;
Mr M told CarCashPoint that he received a further £660 in child benefit and child tax 
credits. This was not reflected on the bank statements;
There was a new direct debit payment to a guarantor loan company that implied 
Mr M had recently taken out another loan;
I couldnt see any payments for utilities or council tax, even though the latter was 
included in Mr Ms expenditure declaration;
Mr Ms April bank statement showed his mortgage payment that month was returned 
unpaid and he then took out a £500 credit union loan on 9 April 2015;
There were further loan repayments on the bank statement and Mr M appeared to 
have understated his insurance and communications expenditure;
So, I couldnt conclude CarCashPoint completed reasonable and proportionate checks when 
Mr M applied for the loan. The information it had showed Mr Ms income was not consistently 
at the level hed declared and I wasnt satisfied CarCashPoint had sufficiently verified his 
other income or his expenditure, particularly in relation to the benefits he received and his 
second mortgage payment. In addition, I thought it was unlikely that Mr M had a monthly 
disposable income of over £1,000 when his most recent mortgage payment had been 
returned unpaid and he was applying for a £1,060 high cost loan.
Mr M sent further evidence of his financial circumstances at the time of the loan, including 
evidence from his credit file, so I had a look at this to see what CarCashPoint was likely to 
have seen if it had carried out proportionate checks:
I saw evidence of the benefits that Mr M was receiving at the time, but these were 
transferred into a bank account for which Mr M did not submit statements;
Mr Ms credit file showed the loan repayments hed declared were for a £5,250 loan 
he took out just four months before he applied for a further £1,060 from 
CarCashPoint;
An arrears letter showed Mr M was £1,650 in arrears on his mortgage in May 2015;
A further letter showed Mr Ms repayments on his second mortgage were £206 per 
month, but that account was also £560 in arrears;
Mr M also submitted a solicitors letter that confirmed he received a CCJ in April 
2015;
So, based on the information CarCashPoint is likely to have received had it carried out
proportionate checks, I considered it would have seen Mr M was already struggling to 
manage his money and was unlikely to have been able to sustainably repay the loan.
Indeed, I noted Mr M was consistently late with payments, incurring a £6 charge each week 
 an additional charge of around £400. Therefore, I found CarCashPoint did not make a fair 
lending decision.I acknowledged Mr M said that he had no prior warning when his car was clamped and I 
could see the Bill of Sale says Before seizing the Goods CarCashPoint will write to you 
(which may include email) and telephone you to discuss the breach and try to agree a 
remedy with you. I had limited information about the contact between Mr M and 
CarCashPoint in the lead up to the car being clamped, so was unable to say that this action 
caused distress or inconvenience to him to the extent that he should be paid compensation.
In summary, I found that if CarCashPoint had carried out proportionate checks, it was likely 
to have found that it was irresponsible to have approved Mr Ms loan.
Mr M accepted my provisional decision.
CarCashPoint did not respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I need to take into account the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice.
As neither party provided any additional information, I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional decision.
  
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. CarCashPoint Limited should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr M paid on the loan;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative information recorded on Mr Ms credit file regarding the loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to take tax off this interest. CarCashPoint
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 January 2021.
