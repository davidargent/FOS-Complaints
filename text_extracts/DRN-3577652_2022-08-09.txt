The complaint
Mr S complains that the CVV code on his new Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide) 
card is too easy to guess. He would like Nationwides systems to be more secure
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again here 
instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
Unfortunately, whilst I have noted Mr Ss views about the security of bank systems 
generally, I need to make it  clear that in this view I can only consider Nationwides 
actions and their impact on Mr S. It is also not in this services remit to force 
organisations to change their systems
I appreciate Mr Ss concern that , in his view,  the CVV code on the back of his 
Nationwide card would be too easy to guess. Nationwide has explained these codes 
are randomly generated. It  offered to cancel and replace Mr Ss card to get him a 
new card with a different CVV code, but this would mean Mr S was without a card for 
a short period. I  think was a reasonable and practical response by Nationwide.
Nationwide also paid  Â£75 into Mr Ss account as compensation for  Mr S not getting 
a call back that he expected. I understand Mr S didnt want this payment but as it has 
been made I leave it to him to either retain  or return the payment as he sees fit. I 
thought the payment was a fair gesture by Nationwide for any inconvenience caused 
to Mr S.
My final decision
 My final decision is that  I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 September 2022.
