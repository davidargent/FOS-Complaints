The complaint
Mr E complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their failure to answer his 
questions surrounding how the process, and report, cryptocurrency transactions.
What happened
On 31 January 2022, Mr E contacted PayPal to ask questions about using this account to 
trade in cryptocurrency. As he couldnt raise this issue through the PayPal website, he raised 
this through PayPals complaints process. Specifically, Mr E asked to understand how tax is 
paid on any profits he made. And, how these profits would be converted back to cash.
PayPal responded the following day, and they treated Mr Es correspondence as a complaint 
as it was made through their complaint process. So, they issued a final response advising Mr 
E to seek tax advice from a tax expert. And they confirmed Mr E would only be able to hold 
and sell the cryptocurrency in his PayPal account and that it couldnt be transferred, before 
directing Mr E to his Terms and Agreements.
Mr E wasnt happy with the answers he received, and sought further clarification, again 
through PayPals complaint process. But Mr E didnt receive a response. So, he referred his 
complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They thought PayPal had 
answered Mr Es questions fairly, with these answers falling in line with the User Agreement 
of Mr Es account. Our investigator also provided clarification to Mr E following further 
information PayPal provided regarding the questions that were asked. So, our investigator 
didnt think PayPal needed to do anything above the Â£25 that PayPal had offered.
Mr E didnt agree. He didnt think our investigator had commented on PayPals failure to 
respond to correspondence he sent after they provided an initial answer to his questions. 
And he maintained his belief that PayPals answer referring him to a tax expert was 
unreasonable and not appropriate, nor did he think they answered his question about the 
profits of any trades as hed expect. Mr E was unhappy that PayPal had since provided 
clarification to our investigator but not to him directly when he requested it. So, Mr E wanted 
PayPal to increase their offer of compensation to recognise this. As Mr E didnt agree, the 
complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome. 
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr E. I recognise Mr E 
doesnt feel as though PayPal provided him with the answers he was seeking and so, I can 
understand why hed feel frustrated. I can also recognise why this would be made worse by 
PayPal providing the clarification he sought to our investigator following our involvement. But 
for me to say PayPal should compensate Mr E, Id need to be satisfied that they purposefully 
ignored Mr Es questions, deliberately provided answers that werent appropriate and 
designed to mislead. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
Before I explain why Ive reached my decision, I think it would be useful for me to explain 
exactly what I can, and cannot, consider. I recognise a large part of Mr Es complaint relates 
to PayPals failure to respond to him after he raised concerns about their initial response. But 
I think its crucial to point out that Mr E raised the questions he wanted through PayPals 
complaint procedure. So, any responses PayPal provided were given under their complaints 
handling process, and complaints handling is an unregulated activity. So, I dont think it 
would be fair for me, nor do I have jurisdiction, to consider PayPals failure to respond to Mr 
E after they had issued their complaint final response.
And usually, I wouldnt comment on the answers provided within PayPals complaint 
response. But I do recognise Mr E contacted PayPal, albeit via the complaint process, to 
seek assurances and answers on how the account would work when purchasing 
cryptocurrency. I dont think Mr E necessarily realised he was raising a complaint at this 
point and so, Ive thought about PayPals response on this occasion.
Im aware Mr E doesnt think PayPal answered his questions appropriately. But I dont agree. 
I can see in PayPals response to Mr Es questions about whether any profits would need to 
be declared for tax purposes, they suggested he seek guidance from a tax expert. The terms 
of Mr Es account explain that it is Mr Es responsibility to determine what taxes apply to 
transactions involving cryptocurrencies. So, I dont think the onus was on PayPal to provide 
Mr E tax advice nor do I think they acted unfairly, or outside of the terms of the account, 
when not doing so. Because of this, even though I appreciate Mr E doesnt believe a tax 
expert would be able to answer this question, I dont think PayPal acted unfairly here.
And Im aware Mr E doesnt think PayPal answered his question regarding how hed convert 
the currency back to cash. But in PayPals response, I think theyve made reasonable 
attempts to answer this question, explaining youre essentially swapping one currency for 
another when you buy and sell it. The exchange rate tells you how much Crypto or GBP 
youll get in the swap. So, I dont think I can say PayPal purposefully refused to answer Mr 
Es question or made a deliberate attempt to mis-lead him. While I appreciate this may not 
have given Mr E the clarity he wanted personally, I dont think this means PayPal acted 
unfairly.
Finally, I recognise Mr E doesnt think PayPal made it clear he should refer to the terms of 
his account. But in PayPals response, they specifically reference their terms and where they 
can be found. And even if they didnt, I think Mr E held a responsibility to ensure he 
understood the terms of the account he held and that he was able to refer to these if he 
needed any information.
So, I dont think I can say PayPal have acted unfairly and because of this, I dont think they 
need to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mr Es complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 October 2022.
