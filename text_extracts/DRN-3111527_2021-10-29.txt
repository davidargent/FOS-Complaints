The complaint
Mr G complains NewDay Ltd (NewDay) provided poor customer service and failed to send 
him his credit card statements, resulting in late fees being charged to his credit card account.
What happened
Mr G says in November 2020 charges were made to his credit card account, but he hadnt 
received his monthly credit card statement, so he emailed NewDay to complain about this - 
but despite their assurances to get in touch with him they didnt. Mr G says he had to make a 
number of telephone calls to NewDay who again failed to deal with his complaint. Mr G says 
NewDay have provided poor customer service and he is concerned his credit rating has 
been downgraded as a result of their actions. Mr G is looking for NewDay to apologise and 
increase the level of compensation they offered him. 
NewDay says they are sorry for the fact Mr Gs original complaint wasnt properly logged on 
their records which is why he didnt receive a response. NewDay says Mr G changed his 
credit card  statement preferences to online in December 2019, which is why he didnt 
receive a postal statement, but these was available online. Mr Gs credit card statements 
were reverted back to paper statements in January 2021. NewDay says the late payment 
charges and interest were correctly applied as Mr G didnt make a payment that was due by 
2 November 2020 or sufficient to cover his next months payment. NewDay says they have 
not registered any missed payments on Mr Gs credit file and apologised for suggesting they 
had, in their final response letter to him.
NewDay says they have now refunded the late payment fees and interest as a gesture of 
goodwill and offered Mr G a total of £30 by way of compensation for the inconvenience 
caused to him. 
Mr G wasnt happy with NewDays response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. She 
felt Mr G had changed his statement preferences to online in December 2019 and that was 
why he hadnt been receiving paper statements. The investigator says NewDay have now 
refunded the late payment charges and interest as a gesture of goodwill and have 
apologised for any inconvenience caused as a result of not logging Mr Gs original 
complaint. The investigator says NewDay have offered a total of £30 by way of 
compensation to Mr G, which she felt was fair. The investigator pointed out there has been 
no adverse entries registered to Mr Gs credit file as a result of the late payments.
Mr G didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision.
I can understand it would be frustrating and upsetting for Mr G not to hear back from 
NewDay after registering a complaint with them, given his concerns his credit file may have 
been affected. When looking at this complaint, I will consider if NewDay have fairly 
compensated Mr G for the poor service they have provided.
The first thing to say here, is its not the role of this service to consider complaints about 
NewDays complaints process. What I will consider here is whether NewDay, were at fault 
for not sending Mr G his monthly credit card statements and if they have compensated him 
fairly, for the inconvenience they caused him when they failed to log his initial complaint 
correctly.
Mr Gs complaint centres around the fact he didnt receive his monthly credit card statements 
and as a result was unaware a payment needed to be made to his account. Mr G says this 
resulted in unnecessary late payment fees and interest being charged to his account and 
was concerned this could affect his credit rating, through no fault of his own. Mr G says 
NewDay failed to correctly log his initial complaint which meant he had to make a number of 
telephone calls and NewDays offer of compensation of £30 does not go far enough.
From the information provided to this service, I can see Mr G changed his statement 
preferences to online in December 2019 and that is why he no longer received postal credit 
card statements. Although Mr G says he felt he was persuaded to take this action, I can see 
no evidence to support that. I say this because I have seen screen shots provided by 
NewDay, showing Mr G regularly logging in online to his NewDay credit card account, also 
NewDay have since changed Mr Gs statement preferences back to postal statements, so I 
cant say Mr G didnt have the option to continue to receive postal statements, if thats what 
he wished.
It is fair to say that in all likelihood, the change in the statement preferences were the likely 
cause why Mr G failed to make the payment due, in his October 2020 statement and the 
underpayment the following month. That said for the reasons I have already stated, I cant 
hold NewDay responsible for that. 
Like the investigator, NewDay could have dealt with Mr Gs initial complaint in a more 
efficient way and I can understand that would have been frustrating for Mr G. That said, its 
not my role to punish businesses like NewDay when mistakes like this happen, but to ensure 
they apologise for any inconvenience and make an appropriate compensation payment. I am 
satisfied NewDay, as I have already explained, werent at fault for Mr G missing the payment 
due on his credit card account but even so as a gesture of goodwill they have refunded the 
late payment charges and interest applied as a result of this. In addition, NewDay have 
apologised for not providing the level of service they would expect and have offered Mr G a 
total of £30 by way of compensation. 
Contrary to what Mr G may have thought, it has been established there has been no adverse 
effect on his credit file, and he has suffered no financial disadvantage here. With that in 
mind, I am satisfied the amount offered by NewDay is sufficient and what I would expect to 
see in these circumstances. 
While Mr G will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of NewDay.
My final decisionMy final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 November 2021.
