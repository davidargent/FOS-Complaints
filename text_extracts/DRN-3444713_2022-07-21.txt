DRN-3444713
The complaint
Mr D complains PrePay Technologies Limited unfairly suspended his account. As a result, 
he found it difficult to pay for everyday expenses and bills, and he was caused 
embarrassment. 
What happened
Mr D holds an account with PrePay. In early March 2021 PrePay suspended his account and 
ask him for information about two payments from HMRC. They later asked him for 
information about a larger payment which represented his salary.
Mr D objected to his account being suspended. He didnt think it was fair because he needed 
access to the funds in the account. He says the payments he received from HMRC (a 
reliable source) were tax refunds, so they were clearly valid. He eventually provided the 
information PrePay asked for in late April, which led to PrePay unblocking his account.
Mr D complained about PrePay and then referred his complaint to our service. 
Our investigator concluded PrePay acted fairly. They said in summary:
PrePay can review accounts in line with their legal and regulatory responsibilities. 
They can also block accounts while they carry out their review. Mr D failed to provide 
PrePay with the information they required until late April 2021, which lengthened the 
time his account was suspended.
PrePay were entitled to ask for the information they did. They hadnt acted unfairly by 
suspending his account until they received the information from him. Neither had they 
caused any unnecessary delay before deciding to unblock the account. They 
unblocked the account shortly after Mr D provided his pay slip to verify his salary 
payment. PrePay didnt need to reveal the details of their review.
Mr D has asked for a final decision from an ombudsman, so his complaint has been passed 
to me to decide. Among other things he says he cant see any law or regulation which 
allowed PrePay to block his account, he shouldnt have to verify payments made to him by 
HMRC, he needs to ensure this doesnt happen again, and he was caused a lot of 
embarrassment because his account was blocked. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ds complaint. Ill explain why.
PrePay have important legal and regulatory obligations they must meet when providing 
accounts to customers. Those obligations are ongoing and dont only apply when an account 
is opened. They can broadly be summarized as a responsibility to know their customer and 
verify the origin of funds and other sources of income.
PrePay will review accounts to comply with their responsibilities. And, its common industry 
practice for firms to restrict access to accounts to conduct a review - doing so helps prevent 
potential financial loss or harm. After all, PrePay wouldnt know whether it should allow Mr D 
access to the rest of the funds in his account until they concluded their review.
There doesnt have to be an express rule or regulation which says a firm can block an 
account to make enquires about payments received from HMRC. More to the point, there 
isnt a law or regulation which prohibits this. And, the terms of the account allow PrePay to 
temporarily suspend accounts. 
Im satisfied PrePay acted reasonably by blocking Mr Ds account. I appreciate he felt the 
veracity of payments received from HMRC was clear. But the receipt of a payment from 
HMRC doesnt mean everything is fine and nothing further should be provided. Pre-Pay 
were entitled to ask him for further information.
Ultimately, Mr D didnt want to provide PrePay with the information they asked for, which led 
to his account being blocked longer than it needed to be. Im persuaded that had he given 
PrePay the information they wanted sooner, including the evidence of his payslip he would 
have been able to access his account much quicker. I say this because PrePay allowed him 
to access the account shortly after they received all the information they asked for.
Mr D may have found being questioned about payments challenging and unwarranted. And I 
appreciate having your account blocked and being asked questions as part of a review could 
feel uncomfortable and personal. But this doesnt mean PrePay were wrong to do what they 
did. I find they acted reasonably, so I am not holding them liable for any inconvenience, 
financial loss or embarrassment Mr D experienced. 
Mr D wants to ensure his account isnt blocked again in the future, but this is not something I 
nor PrePay can guarantee due to the ongoing nature of their responsibilities. As I have made 
clear, blocking accounts to conduct a review isnt something specific to PrePay. It is common 
practice in the industry used as a measure to meet legal and regulatory responsibilities. 
If Mr D wants to understand more about specific laws and regulations firms might consider 
when blocking accounts, this information is readily discoverable. But, PrePay dont have to 
provide the details behind their review. And, if he wants to know what HMRC thinks about 
this matter, he will need to contact them. I am satisfied PrePay acted fairly.
My final decision
I have decided not to uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 August 2022.
