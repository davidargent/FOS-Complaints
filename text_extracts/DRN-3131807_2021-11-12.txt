The complaint
Ms A complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA declined her request for a refund in 
relation to a phone she purchased online. 
What happened
In December 2020 Ms A purchased a mobile phone via an online auction. Ms A has told us 
the phone was described as new and the seller said they were located in the UK. But 
several months later Ms A experienced problems with her phone. Ms A has explained the 
phones manufacturer told her the item wasnt covered by a warranty and wasnt new when 
she purchased it. 
Ms A asked PayPal to issue a refund as the item wasnt as described when it was 
purchased. But PayPal refused and said the purchase wasnt covered by its Buyer 
Protection service because the request for a refund wasnt made within 180 days of the 
payment. 
Ms A referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They didnt 
find PayPal had treated Ms A unfairly by declining to refund the disputed payment. Ms A 
asked to appeal, so her complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Ms A purchased the phone online in good faith and feels PayPal should help 
get her money back during the 12 months after the purchase. But PayPals user agreement 
sets out when it will and wont help customers obtain a refund. 
The user agreement says that for a transaction to be covered by PayPals Buyer Protection 
the dispute has to be raised within 180 days from the date of the payment in question. In this 
case, Ms A didnt raise the dispute with PayPal in the first 180 days. As the dispute wasnt 
raised in the time limits set out in PayPals user agreement Im unable to agree its treated 
Ms A unfairly by declining her request for a refund. 
In response to the investigator, Ms A said PayPal has a responsibility to get her money back. 
But the assistance PayPal offers customers that dispute a transaction is set out in its user 
agreement. And, as noted above, the user agreement says a dispute has to be raised within 
180 days of the payment. Im sorry to disappoint Ms A but Im satisfied PayPal fairly declined 
her request for a refund. 
As Im satisfied PayPal has dealt with Ms A fairly, Im not telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decfision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 December 2021.
