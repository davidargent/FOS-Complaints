The complaint
Mr L complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) declined his application for a 
credit card. He says there is a problem with NatWests application process, which caused 
him detriment.
What happened
In 2022, Mr L applied to NatWest for a credit card. He provided details of his self-employed 
earnings during the application process. NatWest declined the application because it said his 
income wasnt recorded accurately on the application. Mr L says it told him he could re-apply 
using his net monthly income as confirmed by his tax calculation (HMRCs form SA302). Mr 
L re-applied but this application was declined because NatWest said he needed to wait six 
months between applications. 
Mr L complained to NatWest. He said that the information he had provided about his income 
was correct and that hed presented it in the way NatWest requested on the application form. 
He said the information it asked for later on was different. He also said that NatWest hadnt 
made it clear that he would need to wait six months before re-applying. He said theres a 
problem with NatWests application process and that he has suffered because of it.
NatWest explained that Mr Ls application was reviewed using its normal procedures which 
include a credit scoring system. It said that the system is automated but declined 
applications can be manually reviewed by a specialist team. NatWest said that Mr Ls 
application had been manually reviewed. It said the decision to decline his application was 
correct based on the income figure he had provided. NatWest said it had followed the correct 
process, so it didnt uphold the complaint. But it apologised for the upset this caused Mr L.
After sending its final response, NatWest sent Mr L a further letter by mistake. It apologised 
for the distress and concern this caused and sent Mr L a gift.
But Mr L wasnt happy with NatWests response to the complaint and came to this service. 
He said the application form asked for his average net monthly income over the last three 
months. He said thats what he provided and the figure was correct. But, when NatWest 
asked for proof of his income, he said it looked at his net profit which is different. He said he 
provided accurate information in line with what was requested and that NatWest wasnt 
comparing like with like when it sought to verify the figure stated on his application. 
He said he had planned to transfer a balance from an existing credit card and wasnt able to 
do that because NatWest declined his application. He said he incurred interest on the 
existing card as a result and that the situation has caused him stress and worry. He also said 
he has spent hours communicating with NatWest about it.
Our Investigator didnt think NatWest had done anything wrong. But Mr L didnt agree and 
asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an Ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not disputed that NatWest asked for Mr Ls net monthly income (as opposed to gross 
income) or that he stated this as £7,000 on the application form. Mr L says he was aware 
that NatWest was asking for his income after tax and says that £7,000 is the correct figure. 
He says the issue here is the way NatWest sought to verify his income. It asked for SA302s 
for the last two years. Its not unusual for lenders to request this information as evidence of 
income for a self-employed applicant. I think it was reasonable for NatWest to do so here. 
Mr L provided his most recent tax return and bank statements. He says he doesnt think he 
provided the SA302s, although the information Ive seen suggests he did. The tax 
documents didnt cover the three-month period up to the application. So, they didnt cover 
the same period which NatWest had asked about and which Mr L had reported on at the first 
stage of the process. Our Investigator asked NatWest about this. It confirmed that its 
process for verifying self-employed income relies on SA302s or tax returns. Lenders have a 
duty to lend responsibly by making sure any proposed borrowing is affordable. How they go 
about assessing that is a matter for their own commercial judgement and its not the role of 
this service to tell business how they should exercise this. But I think the approach here was 
reasonable, particularly as the process allows for some manual intervention.
In any event, I understand from what Mr L has said that the discrepancy between his 
declared income and the SA302s wasnt due to a recent increase in his income but rather 
because the SA302s take account of expenses which he is able to deduct when calculating 
his net profit.
Mr L says this means the figures were always going to be completely different. He says that, 
if NatWest made it clear on the application form that the income figure needed to be based 
on the average of the last two years SA302 figures, he would have used those figures 
instead. I can understand his point of view and I dont find anything untoward in his 
comment. But I think it was reasonable for NatWest to use the tax documents and the 
income confirmed by those to make its lending decision, particularly bearing in mind its duty 
to ensure any lending is affordable. An income figure which doesnt take account of 
expenses may result in a higher borrowing potential. But I think its reasonable for a lender to 
expect that income figures used for borrowing purposes will be the same as those used for 
tax purposes and seek to verify them in the way that NatWest did here.
NatWest says that the information Mr L provided didnt confirm an average net monthly 
income of £7,000. Im satisfied it didnt. So, I think it was reasonable for NatWest to decline 
the application.
Mr L would have preferred NatWest to tell him at the outset what information it would need to 
assess his application and I can understand that this caused him some inconvenience. But 
NatWest says the additional information from the SA302s is only required once an 
application has been referred for a lending review where an applicant is self-employed. Its 
not requested at the outset because it wont apply to all applicants. I think thats reasonable. 
Mr L also says he wasnt told hed have to wait six months to re-apply. I havent seen 
anything to suggest that NatWest did tell him this and I can understand that was frustrating 
for Mr L. But I dont think he suffered any significant detriment as a result.
As to the letter which NatWest sent by mistake, it sent Mr L a gift to apologise for this. I think 
that was fair.In conclusion, whilst Im sorry to disappoint Mr L, I dont think NatWest acted unfairly or 
unreasonably here. So, Im not going to ask it to do anything.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 December 2023.
