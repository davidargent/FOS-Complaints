K820x#14complaint
Mr A has complained that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) incorrectly used a 
different payment source  for a transaction to the one that he wished to use  PayPal Credit.  
Mr A has also complained about  the service he received  from PayPal. 
background
Mr A wanted  to buy a computer. He intended  to use PayPal Credit  a credit  product offered 
by PayPal, to pay for the computer. Mr A has said he tried initially  to make  the transaction  
using PayPal Credit  but it failed, as there  wasnt enough money in his account.
Mr A then transferred £150 into his PayPal Credit  account in preparation for the transaction.  
Mr A has said he contacted PayPal a number of times prior to the transaction to ensure he 
had the available account balance before  he made the online order.
The online order  went  through and Mr A chose  to pick up his computer in-store.  
Mr A was then contacted  by his bank to let him know that his account was overdrawn  as 
Mr As debit  card had been used to pay for the computer purchase instead of PayPal  Credit.   
Mr A has said that his bank account being  overdrawn  has resulted in him having to take out 
a loan to cover the cost of a car and insurance he intended to purchase and to clear  the 
overdraft. 
Mr A complained to PayPal but was unhappy  with their response.  PayPal have  said that 
when they were made aware of Mr A being unhappy  with how the transaction  went  through 
they recommended that he return the computer  to the seller for a refund. 
But Mr A has said that he had already started  to use the computer and, as it was custom 
built, hed be waiting  for longer if he needed  to reorder it.
Mr A referred his complaint to our service. Our investigator didnt uphold  this complaint. 
In summary,  he found that:
Pay Pals system indicates  that, during this particular transaction,  there was not an 
option to select  PayPal Credit, and 
Mr A chose  another option to make  the transaction. 
Mr A disagreed with our investigators  findings.  In summary, Mr A said that PayPal unlawfully 
took money out of his bank account without his authorisation.  
So the complaint has been referred to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
the transaction
Ref: DRN15999792In situations like this where theres  some uncertainty or disagreement  about  whats 
happened, Ive to decide, on balance, what I think is more likely than not to have happened 
- based  on the available evidence. 
So, Ive to decide what I think is more likely than not to have happened at the time of this 
transaction going through. It seems that the possible likely explanations for what has 
happened, based on what both parties  have said, are:
Mr A didnt  have the available credit  balance so the PayPal  Credit  option wasnt 
available;
The PayPal Credit  option simply wasnt available during this transaction;  
PayPal incorrectly processed  the payment through a card instead of PayPal Credit; 
or
Mr A selected an unintended payment option at the time of the transaction.
Our investigator asked  PayPal for copies of any call recordings  between  them  and Mr A. 
PayPal havent  provided them, but have instead summarised their call recordings and call 
notes. Ive carefully considered those, as well as Mr As recollections of the calls.  
Mr A has said that he did have the necessary  funds  on his PayPal Credit account  as he 
made a transfer  of £150 to this account  on 6 December 2018 - prior to the transaction. 
Mr A contacted PayPal  to check if the £150 payment  had gone through.  Statements have 
also been provided by Mr A to show his available balance. But these are dated 
12 December 2018 and dont show the available balance  or payments awaiting clearance at 
the time of the transaction on 7 December 2018.  
PayPal have shown  us system screenshots to show that Mr As available balance at the 
point of the transaction was less than the price  of the computer. Theyve said the £150 that 
Mr A transferred to the account was still in processing so wasnt available.  I recognise that 
Mr A disputes this. Ive referred to the PayPal Credit website and it states  in the frequently 
asked questions (FAQs)  Make  a Payment section: 
6. How long does it take for payments to reflect on my account?
 Payments will reflect on your PayPal Credit account the same day you make them. 
It may take a few days for your available balance to update and for the payment to 
show on your bank statement.
In any event, PayPal  have said that PayPal  Credit isnt always an available  option. They 
have provided  screenshots for the transaction Mr A made. They show that at the point of the 
transaction there were four funding sources available  four cards. The screenshot  doesnt 
show that there was an option for PayPal  Credit available for this particular transaction. 
Mr A has recreated the sales process  through the sellers and PayPals websites and 
provided a video recording. Whilst I appreciate the time and effort that Mr A has spent doing 
this, the recording  was made over two months  after the transaction had taken place. So I 
cant fairly place the weight that Mr A may have wanted me to on the video, although I have  
noted what hes said about PayPal wrongly  having told him that PayPal Credit  wasnt 
available when paying for goods to be collected in store. 
Ref: DRN15999793Although the transaction process may have been very similar, I cant safely say that it would 
have been exactly  the same  as shown in the video recording. For example, Mr A himself has 
referred to PayPal fixing an issue that could have caused a problem initially. 
Mr A has also provided his internet browsing information for the date of the transaction  but it 
only describes the pages visited rather than showing what  Mr A saw when using the 
websites. 
Ive carefully considered  all of Mr As comments and the information he has provided.  I cant  
be certain about what happened, as its simply not possible  to re-create the process Mr A 
went through when  making the transaction several  months ago. However, payment for the 
transaction was taken  from Mr As bank account,  and I dont  think that was down to a 
processing error by PayPal. 
I take that view given my conclusions about timescales for payments into Mr As 
PayPal Credit account to show  in his available balance and PayPals screenshot  of the 
available options  to pay for the transaction in question. So, on balance, Im not persuaded 
that PayPal have made a mistake. It follows that I cant fairly require them to compensate  
Mr A for the later difficulties he faced because  payment for his purchase  came out of his 
bank account.
the customer service provided by PayPal when Mr A complained  
Mr A complained that he spoke to a number  of different customer advisers at PayPal when 
he realised which account the funds were  taken from and was given various reasons as to 
why his debit card was charged for the transaction instead of PayPal  Credit.  He also said he 
spoke to a customer  adviser who was rude.  PayPal have made an offer of £100  to recognise 
that Mr A was unhappy with the customer service  he received. 
I think thats a fair offer to reflect  the inconvenience  and frustration Mr A was caused,  and I 
dont make any further award. 
other points  raised  
Mr A has also raised additional  points  about  his account being blocked  and PayPal  
demanding payment as a result of his complaint. My decision deals with the complaint 
initially brought to our service - on which Ive decided  that PayPal havent  done anything 
wrong. 
Mr A has the option of making a separate  complaint  to PayPal about any block  placed on his 
account or the demand for arrears if he wishes to do so. PayPal have to have an opportunity  
to respond to any new complaint before our service could consider it. We may be then able 
to consider a fresh  complaint about  that later if Mr A asks us to.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 October  2019.
