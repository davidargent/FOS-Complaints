K821x#15complaint
Mr C has complained about the handling  of a claim  under his central  heating  insurance 
policy with British Gas Insurance Limited.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this matter earlier this month,  part of which is copied 
below: 
On 2 March  2018, Mr C called British Gas to report that his boiler was not working, as it had
lost pressure. British  Gas agreed to come out the next day but on that day told Mr C it could
no longer make the appointment  and tried to put the appointment  back  until 23 March  2018.
Mr C wouldnt  agree to this and so it was arranged that British  Gas would attend on 5 March
2018.
An engineer  came out on 5 March 2018 and apparently replaced the pressure relief valve
and worked on the expansion vessel. However, shortly after the engineer had left Mr C says
the boiler stopped working again. When Mr C told British Gas this it said it couldnt  come out
again until 12 March  2018. British Gas offered to pay £50 towards temporary heaters in the
meantime. As Mr C was not prepared  to wait for seven days without  heating  and hot water,
he asked if he could  get his own engineer to do the work required. British Gas agreed to pay
the cost of a private engineer up to £199.00.
Mr C arranged for a private  engineer to attend  who carried  out some  tests on the work done
by British Gas. He told Mr C that it should  have been obvious that there  was no problem with
the boiler and that there was a leak in the central heating system, which was causing  the
pressure to drop. He had to come out on three  occasions. On the third visit he found where
the leak was coming  from but by then the £199.00 authorised  by British Gas had almost  run
out.
Mr C contacted British  Gas on 19 March 2018  and said that a leak had been found
under his floor in the hallway. An engineer attended  the same  day but didnt have the right
equipment to access the pipe. However, while he was there he apparently caused a leak on
a different pipe and had to arrange  for a second  engineer to come out and help repair this. I
understand that the second  engineer  wasnt able to repair it, so drained the system to
prevent further  damage.
The original  leak was repaired  by a further engineer on 21 March  2018, who dug up the
concrete floor and replaced a piece of leaking plastic  pipe. British Gas re-laid the concrete
floor on 24 March 2018. I understand there have not been  any further problems since  then.
Mr C complained to British Gas about  the service  received. He says his wooden flooring has
been damaged  as a result  of its delays  and that he had lost earnings due to taking time off
work because of British  Gass negligence.
British Gas doesnt accept that it is responsible for the damage to Mr Cs floor. It says the
leak was hidden under  concrete and so would have been hard to locate, even if it had been
able to attend earlier, and it took the private engineer some time to locate  it. British  Gas says
that the damage is a natural consequence  of the original leak and not due to any error  on its
part; and was likely to have ben already in existence prior to the initial visit given the nature
of the fault. The private  engineer should also have ensured that there was no further water
damage, once  he knew  there was a leak somewhere in the system.
Ref: DRN88033542British Gas also says that ordinarily,  this repair would not be covered as the fault was as a
result of poor installation,  which was not completed  by British Gas.  The policy says: 
Preexisting faults:  Our products don't include cover for any faults or design faults that:  
Were already there when  your boiler, appliance  or system was installed,  or were caused  by
anybody other than us when  any change  or additions were made to your boiler, appliance or
system. 
However, it says it agreed for the repair to be completed as a gesture of good will. British  
Gas reimbursed the £180.00  paid to the private  engineer and also offered  £50.00  for
the delay in responding to the claim.
One of our adjudicators looked  into the matter. He recommended that the complaint be
upheld, as he considered that British Gas should  have  been able to tell the problem was not
in the boiler but somewhere else in the heating system when it first attended. This failure  and
the further delays resulted in the leak continuing for longer that it should have done. The
adjudicator therefore  recommended  that British Gas arrange for the repairs  to Mr C's
wooden flooring or agree to cover the cost (to be agreed on production of quotes), however,
he later changed  this to recommend that it pay 50% of the cost.  
The adjudicator also recommended  that British Gas pay Mr C £100.00 compensation, in 
addition to the £50.00  offered  for the delay in responding.
Mr C accepted the adjudicators assessment but British Gas does not, so the matter has
been referred to me.
Mr C also provided some further information  to the adjudicator,  including  photographs of the
damaged area of flooring.  Mr C said he had replaced one area himself, as it was a trip
hazard but another  area, in the WC, still needs replacing as it has lifted  and bowed  but to do
this will require taking tiles off the walls as well, which will make  it a very expensive  job. Mr C
says he lost £1,000 work  and spent around £230  on materials  and tools so far.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There was considerable delay in dealing with this claim  and I am satisfied that British Gass
handling of the claim  will have caused additional  avoidable water  damage. It didnt attend the
first time for two days and didnt identify  that the loss of pressure was due to a leak. It is in
dispute as to whether it should  have  been  able to identify  this at that first visit. However,
given how quickly the boiler pressure seems  to have dropped  (within  an hour of the engineer
leaving on 5 March 2018 and the private engineer has said it lost pressure almost
immediately on opening up the valves) it seems  likely to me that it should have identified that
there was a leak.
British Gas says this would have taken  time to find anyway, and so damage  would  have
been done to the floor,  given the leaking pipe was buried. However, while  the pipe was not
visible it is possible to locate the vicinity of leaks, by isolating sections of the central heating
system and this was done by the private engineer.
I note British Gas also says the private engineer took time to locate the leak and didnt do
Ref: DRN88033543anything to stop the water damage. However,  he could only have drained the system which
would have left Mr C and his family with no heating or hot water  at all. And it was ultimately
British Gass responsibility under the terms of the policy.  Mr C instead had to appoint his
own engineer  as he did not receive the help he was entitled t expect under his policy.  And
when British Gas was told where the leak was, there was further delay as it sent the wrong
engineer to fix it (causing a further days delay)  and then caused a further leak in the same
area. It seems to me inevitable therefore that the water damage was made  worse  by these
issues.
I have to therefore consider the appropriate redress to put this right for Mr C.
The policy includes  up to £1,000, including VAT, for getting access and making good for
each repair.
The policy defines  access and making  good  as being:
 getting  to your boiler, appliance  or system, to fix or service it and then repairing any
damage we may cause  in getting  access to your boiler, appliance or system by replacing
items such as cabinets or cupboards that weve removed and by filling  in holes we
have made  and leaving a level surface  but we wont replace or restore  the original
surface or coverings, for example,  tiles, floor coverings, decoration, grass or plants.
This means  that British Gas was only ever responsible for relaying the concrete floor so
there was a level surface, which  it did on 24 March 2018.
Given this, Mr C would have had to re-lay the wood floor which  was removed  to gain access
to the area of the leak, or pay for it to be re-laid in any event.  So I am not persuaded he
needs to be reimbursed for his time in doing  this work, or the costs of materials and tools
that would  have been required for this anyway (such  as the tools and adhesive).
Mr C says that all the wooden flooring that had to be taken  up could have been re-laid,  if it
werent for the water  damage to it. However, I am not persuaded that all the wood and
underlay could  have been re-laid; it seems  likely  that at least  some would have been
damaged when it was removed.
Mr C also says that a further  area of flooring needs to be replaced (I can see in the photo he
has provided that there is a small area that appears bowed in the WC). This section of
flooring was not taken up to access the leak. Mr C has said this would require tiles to be
removed.
I am not persuaded by this. Mr C previously provided an estimate for the cost of relaying
new flooring to the hall, cloakroom, lobby and WC. This states:
# New flooring will not go under the skirting  or tiles, scotia  beading  will be fitted.
# It is not recommended  to fit wood flooring in the toilet due to possible
water damage, as advised.
# The wood  will be cut around  the WC pan and a sealant used to fill expansion gap. 
This therefore states that it would not have been  necessary to remove the tiles.
Its hard to tell from the photos how much flooring needs to be replaced.  I can see at least  
two pieces appear to have lifted.  Mr C has provided details that the flooring cost around £65 
psm. Its unlikely that more than this would be needed from the size of the WC in the photos.
Ref: DRN88033544Mr C has also asked for loss of earnings  but there is no convincing evidence to support the 
figures he has provided. However,  I can see that he had to attend more  appointments than 
should have been necessary in order to have  the leak resolved and this would have been 
inconvenient.
Given everything Ive said, it seems to me that the most appropriate remedy  is to make a 
global compensation award  that provides a contribution towards  the cost of repairing that 
area of flooring and compensates for the trouble caused, including: the delay in responding 
to the claim; the cancelled appointment on 3 March  2018; the unproductive appointment on 
19 March 2018;  the causing of a second leak and having to have another  engineer  attend 
three hours later; having to arrange his own engineer  and accommodate those additional  
visits.
Having taken all this into account, I intend  to award  the total sum of £400  compensation, to
include the £50 already  offered.
my provisional decision
I intend to uphold this complaint against British Gas Insurance Limited and require  it to pay
Mr C a total of £400 compensation  for the distress and inconvenience  caused by the
handling of this matter (to include the £50 already  offered).
responses to my provisional  decision
I invited both parties to respond to my provisional  decision with any further information or 
arguments they want considered. 
British Gas has confirmed  that it accepts my provisional decision and has not added 
anything further.  
Mr C has also responded. He says he accepts the provisional decision, provided that British 
Gas doesnt seek  to challenge  it. However, he also wanted to make some further points and 
provided some further information, for consideration if it did challenge it, which Ive 
summarised below: 
He provided his terms of business  which shows his hourly charge out rate to 
substantiate the loss of earnings  he claimed.  He spent over eight hours dealing with  
engineers and refitting the floorboards, which meant he was unable  to produce  
billables. The total lost was therefore well over the £1,000 he claimed.  
The areas of undamaged flooring  simply slid out, and were refitted to the floor as it is 
now. Therefore the statement "I am not persuaded that all the wood and underlay 
could have been re-laid; it seems likely that at least some  would have been damaged 
when it was removed"  is incorrect. As is the assertion that only two pieces
of flooring need to be removed in the WC, it is the entire floor that needs to be 
re-laid.
The £65psm  for the flooring does not include fitting, and is just for the 
materials.
The estimate he had provided was to show that it would not be a like-for-like  
repair. This floor company cannot  lay flooring  under tiles. The choice is for 
them to either cut around the tiles and fit beading, or remove the toilet  and 
tiles so that they can lay it properly. 
Ref: DRN88033545my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments again to decide  whats  fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
While both parties have  indicated they accept  my provisional decision, Mr C has made some 
further submissions.  While he said he was happy to have these lie on file if British Gas 
accepted my decision, it is right that I consider  them before  issuing a final decision on what  I 
consider to be the fair and reasonable outcome of the complaint. 
Mr C has provided evidence  of his charging rates and his terms of employment but these 
dont prove  that he lost work as a direct result of the relaying of the floor or appointments 
with British Gas. I also provisionally determined that British Gas was not responsible  for the 
time Mr C spent  relaying part of the floor,  as this would have been  required anyway  and not 
just because of the errors made  by British Gas in handling this claim.  I therefore remain of 
the opinion that compensation to reflect  the time taken  in dealing with additional 
appointments that wouldnt otherwise  have  been necessary is appropriate and I cant  make  
an award for loss of earnings. 
I said it wasnt clear  how much of the floor in the WC was damaged  from the photos 
provided but I could  see at least two pieces have bowed/buckled. But the entire area 
appears to be relatively small and so I considered it was unlikely it would need more than a 
square metre of flooring, which was priced  at £65psm. I acknowledge that this didnt include 
fitting costs. Mr C hasnt provided any evidence that more than a square foot of flooring 
would be needed  for this area.
Mr C provided  a quote for replacement of all the flooring  in the hallway  and WC, as set out in 
my provisional decision. I accept that the existing flooring appears to have been fitted under 
the toilet, skirtings  and wall tiles in the WC. However, the quote  indicates that it would not be 
necessary to remove the wall tiles in order to replace the flooring. In any event, Mr C has not 
provided any other evidence about why this would not be adequate or the cost of removing 
the tiles.  
I therefore remain of the opinion  that global compensation award that provides  a contribution 
towards the cost of repairing  the area of flooring in the WC and compensates  for the trouble 
caused, including:  the delay in responding to the claim; the cancelled appointment on 3 
March 2018; the unproductive  appointment on 19 March 2018; the causing of a second leak 
and having to have another engineer attend  three  hours later; having to arrange  his own 
engineer and accommodate those additional  visits is appropriate.  
Ref: DRN88033546my final decision
I uphold this complaint  against British Gas Insurance  Limited and require it to pay
Mr C a total of £400 compensation  for the distress and inconvenience  caused by the
handling of this matter (to include the £50 already  offered).
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2019.
