The complaint
Mr O complains that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt update his address, which meant 
he didnt get letters telling him he needed to make a payment onto his account. This 
ultimately led to his account being defaulted, and problems with his credit rating.
What happened
Mr O had a student account with NatWest. He said hed told NatWest his new address twice, 
in November 2017 and January 2018. But it didnt update his address. So he didnt get any 
of the post it was sending, telling him he needed to make a payment onto his debt or his 
account would be defaulted. Mr O said hed complained to NatWest.
NatWest wrote to Mr O in early June 2018. In that letter, it said it had given Mr O the benefit 
of the doubt, and accepted it didnt update his address in January 2018, when he asked it to. 
So it also accepted that Mr O didnt get the letters it sent after that, asking him to put money 
in his account as hed agreed to.
NatWest said it had also checked Mr Os expected graduation date. That was 2019, but his 
account had been changed from a student account in 2017. NatWest said it had charged 
him £203.76 in interest and £401 in charges, which was a mistake. It had paid back £323.61 
in interest, so it owed him a further £77.39 in charges, and all of the interest. 
NatWest said it wanted to put this right. So it said it would do the following  
revert Mr Os account from recoveries to branch control,
refund £203.76 in interest, and £77.39 in charges,
compensate £150 for distress,
amend Mr Os graduation date to 2019,
reapply his £1,400 overdraft,
order him a new debit card,
amend his credit file to remove the default marker applied, and
amend his overdraft interest free threshold in line with graduate account terms and
conditions.
NatWest said it had already updated Mr Os address.
But Mr O said that he was still receiving debt collection letters after this. And shortly after 
NatWests reply, later in June, NatWest registered a default on his credit file. Mr O then sent 
us further debt collection letters, dated September and October 2019. He also showed us 
that the default was still on his credit file in September 2019. 
Mr O wanted NatWest to put his account back the way it should be. But he now also wanted 
£3,000 in compensation. 
DRN-1978290NatWest has since shown us that it has paid the compensation it offered Mr O, and refunded 
the outstanding interest and charges listed above. As of October 2019, Mr O owed NatWest 
a little under £1,000. NatWest said it thought the problems happened because it hadnt put 
the overdraft back on to Mr Os account, so his debt went straight back to the recoveries 
team. NatWest said it was sorry about this. 
But NatWest said it had now listened to the call Mr O had with it, in January 2018. And Mr O 
hadnt updated his address then. Hed given his old address. So NatWest didnt think that 
the reason this had all gone wrong in the first place was its fault, after all. 
NatWest said it had promised to fix this, and it would make good on that promise. So it said it 
would still reinstate Mr Os overdraft, and send out a new card. It would remove any adverse 
data on Mr Os credit file, and refund a charge of £8 which was applied in July 2019.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. He said that NatWest had 
accepted it hadnt updated Mr Os address when he contacted it. So it agreed to put things 
right, but it didnt, and Mr O was still being pursued for the debt. Our investigator said that 
this shouldve been a relatively straightforward process, but the time taken to sort it out had 
been excessive. 
Our investigator thought that NatWest should now do all of the things it had already agreed 
to do. He thought that NatWest should also pay Mr O £150 more, to increase his total 
compensation to £300. And he recommended that NatWest amend Mr Os graduation date 
to 2020, if Mr O could satisfy NatWests criteria for that. 
NatWest agreed, but Mr O didnt. He didnt think wed taken account of all the circumstances 
of this case, and the wider effect that this had on him. Our investigator didnt change his 
mind, so this complaint was passed to me for a final decision. 
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
NatWest sent us the call it had with Mr O in January 2018. Mr O didnt give a new 
address on that call, he confirmed his existing address, and didnt suggest hed 
moved. NatWest hasnt sent us the call it had with Mr O in November. Mr O told us he 
also updated his address then. But if hed given NatWest his new address in 
November 2017, or indeed any time before the call in January 2018, I wouldve 
expected Mr O to give his new address on the phone in January, not his old address.
So I dont think its actually NatWests fault that Mr O didnt receive any further letters 
about his debt. I think its more likely that Mr O shouldve updated his address and he 
didnt. 
But NatWest says it will still do what it promised to do. And it has also agreed to pay 
Mr O the additional £150 in compensation that our investigator proposed. I think that 
provides a fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint.
Mr O says this isnt anywhere near enough to make up for what went wrong. But, as 
NatWest has now shown that the original problem wasnt its fault, I dont think I can 
fairly ask NatWest to do any more than it has already agreed to do. So I propose to make essentially the same award that our investigator suggested, 
although for different reasons. NatWest must now do the following, if it hasnt done so 
already - 
revert Mr Os account from recoveries to branch control, 
pay an additional £150 for distress, 
amend Mr Os graduation date to 2019,
reapply his £1,400 overdraft, 
order him a new debit card, 
amend his credit file to remove all adverse entries for this account from June 2019 to 
the date that Mr O accepts my final decision, and
amend his overdraft interest free threshold in line with the appropriate account terms 
and conditions.
Our investigator recommended that NatWest should extend Mr Os student account 
until 2020 if Mr O met its criteria for that. I dont have any evidence about Mr Os 
student status after 2019, and NatWest hasnt had a chance to consider any complaint 
by Mr O about this. So I wont include any recommendation on that in this decision. 
I know Mr O will be disappointed, but I dont think NatWest has to do more than that.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
NatWest said it had nothing to add. Mr O wrote to disagree.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Mr O said that a resolution was reached with NatWest in January. He said that there was 
agreement updating his address was the root cause of the problem. Mr O said that this case 
was only escalated because NatWest had failed to stick to the resolution reached, and used 
the refund and initial compensation to offset his debt, rather than to reinstate his account and 
overdraft facility. Mr O said he continually received debt recovery letters, until a default was 
placed on his credit file. Mr O also sent us proof of his student status.  
Mr O said he didnt feel that £150 was justifiable compensation and a true representation of 
the inconveniences, harassment and stress that NatWest had put him through in the last 
twelve months. He said he was disappointed, he would appreciate me amending my 
provisional decision on this point, and including an apology letter from NatWest. 
I think Mr O is correct to say that what went wrong in this case is that his address wasnt 
updated. NatWest made an offer to settle this complaint, because it thought that was its 
fault. We now know it wasnt NatWests fault. It hadnt made a mistake. 
NatWest is still offering to honour its offer to settle this complaint, including reinstating Mr Os 
account and removing the default from Mr Os credit file. Mr O will benefit substantially from 
this. I do not feel, given that what went wrong in this case wasnt NatWests fault, that it 
would be fair and reasonable for me to ask NatWest to do any more than this. 
Mr O also sent us proof of his student status. But I dont know if this would be sufficient for 
NatWest to extend his student account, as Im not aware of its criteria for that. And, more 
importantly, NatWest still hasnt had a chance to consider that. So I still dont think I should 
include any recommendation on that in this decision.For those reasons, I havent changed my mind on the appropriate outcome in this case. Ill 
now make the award I originally proposed to make.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must do the following, if it hasnt 
done so already - 
revert Mr Os account from recoveries to branch control,
pay an additional £150 for distress,
amend Mr Os graduation date to 2019,
reapply his £1,400 overdraft,
order him a new debit card,
amend his credit file to remove all adverse entries for this account from June 2019 to
the date that Mr O accepts my final decision, and
amend his overdraft interest free threshold in line with the appropriate account terms
and conditions.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 July 2020.
