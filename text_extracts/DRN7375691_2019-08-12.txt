K821x#15complaint
Miss C says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny irresponsibly lent to her 
and she was trapped in a debt spiral.
background
This complaint is about 58 instalment loans Sunny provided to Miss C between  
November 2015  and March 2018.  Some information  about  Miss Cs lending history is 
summarised in an appendix  at the end of this decision.
When Miss C complained to Sunny it upheld her complaint in part. It said itll refund the 
interest and charges on loans 1 to 6 and loans 32 to 43 and as there  was an outstanding 
balance, it would offset the redress against  the outstanding  balance.  Miss C was unhappy 
with the offer and referred her complaint to this service.
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Cs complaint and thought more loans shouldnt have been 
given. In addition  to the loans Sunny admits it shouldnt have given Miss C, the adjudicator  
thought all the other loans shouldnt have been  given  and effectively upheld  Miss Cs 
complaint in full. Sunny  didnt accept  the adjudication and the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss C could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN73756912I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss C could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Cs complaint.
As Sunny has admitted  that there  were  sufficient indications that Miss C shouldnt  have been 
lent loans 1 to 6 and loans 32 to 43, I think its fair it should honour the offer to redress  
Miss C for the those loans.
Like the adjudicator,  Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  history with 
Miss C, with a view to seeing  if there was a point  at which Sunny should reasonably have 
seen that further  lending,  after loan 6, was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful.  And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Cs case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because loan 7 was Miss Cs seventh loan in less than two months and 
some of her previous loans overlapped which meant that she was repaying more than one 
loan at a time.
Miss Cs pattern of overlapping loans continued from loan 7 onwards and when she repaid a 
loan, Miss C was provided  with a new loan generally  within  days of settling a previous one. I 
can see that there was a gap of around  three  months between loans 27 and 28 but given 
that Miss C had been borrowing consistently for around 12 months by this stage, I dont think  
that gap in lending was long enough  to allow Sunny reasonably believe that her finances 
had improved. So Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Miss C was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Cs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
I dont think Miss C was making  any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 58 
was taken out nearly 30 months after Miss Cs first. And it was for a larger  amount  three  
times loan 1. So Miss C had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period. As Sunny will be aware, these are short term loans and are 
not suitable for long term use.
I think that Miss C lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing when it ought to 
have realised the borrowing was unsustainable and:  
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
Ref: DRN73756913the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Cs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So in addition to the loans  Sunny admits  it shouldnt have given Miss C, Im also upholding 
the other loans it lent to her. And Sunny needs to put things right from loans 1 to 58.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss C paid on all her loans  (1 to 58);
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 1 to 6 from Miss Cs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 58 should be removed from 
Miss Cs credit file.
I can see that Sunny wrote off the balance on loan 58, so it may choose  to offset the 
principal loan amount  for loan 58 from the redress.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Miss Cs complaint. Elevate Credit International 
Limited should pay Miss C compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 September 2019.
