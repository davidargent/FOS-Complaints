K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that AvantCredit  of UK LLC failed to change his payment date which 
resulted in him missing payments and incurring charges.
background
Mr M has a loan agreement with AvantCredit.  In August 2018 and September  2018  he 
contacted AvantCredit and requested a change of payment date.  AvantCredit  didnt 
complete the change  and as a result  Mr M missed payments, which led to late fees being 
charged on his account  and a negative marker being  placed  on his credit file.
When Mr M complained to AvantCredit it accepted  that it had failed  to  change his payment  
date and said this was due to system errors. It moved Mr Ms payment date, moved  the 
arrears to the end of the loan with no additional interest added and waived late fees. It also 
said it would  contact the credit reference  agencies to remove any negative  entries on Mr Ms 
credit file.
Mr M contacted this service because  AvantCredit  didnt contact the credit reference  
agencies as it said it would. He says the negative marker on his credit file has prevented him 
from remortgaging and obtaining  credit  elsewhere.
Mr M wants AvantCredit to compensate him for the effects of not having his credit file 
amended. He also wants interest  on his loan waived or the repayments  reduced.
Our investigator partially upheld the complaint. She said AvantCredit should follow through  
with all the things  it said it would do and pay compensation  of £200 to Mr M for trouble and 
upset.
Mr M didnt  agree. He felt that £200 was to low and said he was still receiving default 
notices.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate what a frustrating experience this has been for Mr M. And Im sorry to hear that 
hes experienced difficulties remortgaging and obtaining additional  credit  to address some  
issues at his property.
That said,  I cant be certain that the late payment  marker reported by AvantCredit is the 
cause of these  difficulties, because Mr Ms credit  file shows adverse information from other 
lenders. Its possible that Mr Ms mortgage  company was influenced by this other  adverse 
information. So I cant take the late payment marker  into account when considering what  
level of compensation  is appropriate. 
Its fair to say that this has gone on for some time. Its of concern that AvantCredit hasnt 
done what it said it would do. This has had an ongoing impact on Mr M. AvantCredit has said 
that the email  which shouldve  been sent to the credit reference agencies  wasnt  sent, which 
is why adverse information  continued  to be reported  on Mr Ms credit file. 
Ref: DRN64493532In relation to the default notices which Mr M has been receiving,  AvantCredit has said it 
changed the payment date but the system was still recording  a late payment.  It has said it 
will correct  this manually.
I understand that Mr M wants his repayments  reduced. But although AvantCredit has made 
some errors, the debt owed by Mr M hasnt  been affected by those  errors.  Mr M hasnt been 
asked to pay any additional interest as a result of the missed payments. And although I 
appreciate that Mr Ms mortgage payments have increased, leaving him with less money 
available to pay other outgoings, as Ive already said, I cant be certain that the late payment 
marker is the reason why Mr M wasnt able to remortgage.
On balance, I think that provided AvantCredit  does what it said it would do, this is a 
reasonable response to Mr Ms complaint. I also think that AvantCredit should compensate 
Mr M for his trouble and upset. The sum of £200 is fair.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  the complaint. AvantCredit of UK LLC should  
complete all the actions  it said it would complete and pay compensation of £200 to Mr M.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 August 2019.
