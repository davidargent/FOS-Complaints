K821x#15complaint
Mr P complains that Gain Credit  LLC,  trading as Drafty, lent irresponsibly in 2016.
Mr P also complains about the suspension of the account in 2019.
Mr P has described feeling harassed and exhausted  by Draftys unprofessional approach to 
its collection of repayments.  Mr P has found that its attitude and approach has been 
shocking. He has experienced embarrassment  because of this.
background and my findings
I attach my provisional decision dated 5 November 2019, which  forms part of this final 
decision and should be read with it. In it I explained why I intended to uphold  Mr Ps 
complaint in part. I asked that both parties were given time to send me any further  comments 
or points  they may have by 19 November  2019. 
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Mr P has agreed with my provisional decision and has nothing  further to add. Drafty has 
replied and has agreed with all that was said in my provisional decision. So I see no reason 
to alter the conclusions I reached in my provisional  decision  on 5 November 2019.
I uphold Mr Ps complaint  about irresponsible lending and direct  that Drafty  should put things  
right from the 31 August  2017 drawdown. 
I do not uphold  Mr Ps second  complaint  about the suspension of the account.
I uphold Mr Ps complaint  about the distress  and inconvenience experienced and the details 
of that are set out in my provisional decision which is attached.  
putting things right  what Drafty  is to do
From the drawdown of 31 August  2017 I direct that Drafty should put things right as follows:
calculate the amount of all interest  and charges  Mr P paid from 31 August  2017 until 
the account was paid off;
write off any unpaid interest charged  from that same date;
rework the sums  paid by Mr P to Drafty such that from 31 August 2017  any amounts 
paid to the account are applied to the reduction  of the principal;
amend the credit  file to remove any adverse payment information from August 2017.
If there is a surplus due to Mr P, then this needs  to be paid to him with the added 8% annual  
simple interest*.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Drafty to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr P 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. 
And I award  Mr P a £200 payment for distress and inconvenience.
Ref: DRN05432992I am aware  that Drafty has done  some calculations, but I am not clear that Drafty has 
complied with bullet  point three set out above. I draw Draftys  attention  to that need  to rework 
the account and if there is a surplus  which has been paid to cover  the principal amounts 
drawn down then that will attract the 8% a year simple interest.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision  dated 5 November 2019, 
I uphold Mr Ps complaint  in part. Gain Credit LLC, trading as Drafty, should put things right 
for Mr P in the way I have  set out above.
I do not uphold  Mr Ps second  complaint  about the suspension of the account.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  on or before 29 December 2019.

background
Drafty offered a credit  facility which  commenced  with a limit being  determined  and then the customer  
was able to draw  down the amounts he or she required. The credit was unsecured and had no fixed 
duration. 
Mr P applied for the facility in September 2016 and it was approved with a £500 credit limit. The credit 
agreement set out the total cost of the credit  based on some  assumptions to illustrate the likely  cost to 
Mr P. On the assumption that Mr P drew down the full £500 on the first day and then repaid it over 
twelve months in equal instalments then the total amount payable would have been just under £670. 
This would have equated  to about £56 a month. 
The arrangement did include  a Billing Cycle and it gave the minimum payment required for that 
cycle. It had to be the higher of certain calculations in the agreement at clause 6 which  I have not set 
out here. I have received one of these  monthly statements from Drafty  and a list of repayment 
screenshots from Mr P. 
From information Drafty  has sent to us, I can see that Mr P drew down  £400 on 9 September 2016 
and a further £95 on 12 September 2016. More repayments and drawdowns  took place  after those 
initial two. I have used the Drafty transaction history to set out a partial  list of what Mr P drew down 
and what he repaid. This table is not a substitute for the more detailed records Drafty may have for 
calculating any redress.

additional transactions continue from here and are not included in this table 
Ref: DRN05432994Mr P has continued to use this credit facility. The limit was raised  to £610 around June 2018.  Mr P 
has told us that he repaid  it all in August 2019 and I have seen a screenshot  of a repayment  amount 
of just under £560 to pay off the account on 10 August  2019.
One of our adjudicators  looked  at the complaint  and thought  that Draftys initial approval for the 
account in September 2016 was satisfactory. And he did not think that Drafty  needed to put anything  
right for Mr P. 
Mr P disagreed and has been  waiting  for an ombudsmans review.  
During that time period when Mr P has been waiting for an ombudsman to look at it, Mr P has 
continued to use the account.  It was repaid  in August 2019 as I outlined above.  
Mr P has complained again to Drafty about the suspension of the account  around March 2019. Drafty 
issued a fresh  final response letter  (June 2019) on this point, and the explanation given  to Mr P was 
that it suspended it due to a personalised  assessment  of your account.  
It seems appropriate for me to deal with both complaints in this decision and Drafty has agreed to that 
and has sent to me its complaint file on that second complaint. 
These complaints remain  unresolved and were passed to me for a decision.
my provisional  findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  is fair and reasonable  in 
the circumstances of this complaint. I have considered the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good 
industry practice at the time the credit was offered.
irresponsible lending  complaint
Before lending  money  to a consumer or approving a credit limit a lender should take proportionate 
steps to understand whether the consumer  will be able to repay what they are borrowing  in a 
sustainable manner  without it adversely  impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender  should gather  enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on the 
lending. Although the guidance and rules  themselves did not set out compulsory checks, they did list 
several things  a lender  could  consider before agreeing  to lend.  The key element was that any checks  
needed to be proportionate and had to take into account a number of different things,  including how 
much was being lent and when the sum being borrowed was due to be repaid. 
I have seen a copy of Mr Ps personal  credit file dated  March  2017 which  would cover  most  of the 
period relevant for this complaint. I have seen copies of his bank statements  for the period  up to 
September 2016 and one for February/March 2017. 
Mr Ps records from Drafty show that he told it he worked full time, earned £1,500 and had expenses  
of £523. Correspondence  with Drafty and our adjudicator  reveals that Mr P declared  less expenditure  
than the £523 and this larger figure comes from Drafty using a minimum threshold figure  as Mr Ps 
expenditure declaration  was low. This led Drafty to calculate  that Mr P had a disposable income of 
around £977.   
I need to explain to Mr P that upon first approaching Drafty in September 2016 it would not be 
expected, and would not be proportionate, for Drafty to carry out a full and comprehensive  financial 
review. Mr P was a new customer. And bearing  in mind  the credit limit granted and the monthly 
payments required to repay the facility within a reasonable  period, Drafty  was entitled to rely on the 
information given to it which suggested that Mr P had enough disposable  income to service  a credit 
facility with a limit of £500. 
Ref: DRN05432995Drafty says that it carried  out its own credit search which it says revealed that Mr P had a couple  of 
defaults. It said that the balance on those was around £400 to £500 and Mr P had active  loans with 
other lenders of around £200 to £300. 
Having looked at all that Mr P has given  me and Draftys information and submissions  then I think  that 
the initial  credit facility approval was carried out after checks I would  consider having  been 
proportionate. And the limit approved was likely  to have appeared serviceable  and able to be repaid  
within a reasonable time, as the credit agreement assumptions to illustrate the likely  cost to Mr P 
would have equated to about £56 a month. And in view of the information Drafty  had then at this 
stage of the lending relationship I think that £56 a month would have appeared  affordable. 
After that, Drafty was under  an obligation to monitor Mr Ps account  and it has not explained  to us 
how it did that. And I have taken the time to set out a summary of some of the credits and debits on 
Mr Ps Drafty account and set them out in the table above to show the pattern  of drawdown and 
repayment. From  that I can see that from early  September 2016 to end of August 2017  almost a 
year  Mr P had made some inroads into the main  debt but not much. And I have seen the statements  
since that date until its close in August 2019.
On 31 August 2017, Mr P requested a drawdown  of just under £25. At this stage I think that as Drafty 
was on notice  that Mr P had other debts  when  he took the account, and as the principal amount owed 
for this Drafty account  was not reducing, then I think that 12 months into the lending relationship more  
thorough checks ought to have  been carried  out. I do not think this was done.
Drafty had continued to allow Mr P to use the account despite complaining to it on 7 August 2017. In 
that complaint email  to Drafty, Mr P described the account  as a serious financial  burden. He 
explained that the monthly payments as excessive  and he made  it clear  that he wished to get the 
account closed. Despite this Mr P was approved for an additional drawdown a couple of weeks later 
and for a long time beyond that date. And his credit limit was increased to £610 during the life of the 
account and about ten months after Mr Ps complaint to it. 
So, I think that by continuing to offer the credit facility, Mr P was exposed to additional interest 
charges. My provisional decision on the information and evidence I have now is that Mr P was not 
really coping with the account as he virtually owed the same after almost 12 months as he did at the 
beginning. And it was clearly  inappropriate to continue to allow Mr P to use the account after he had 
complained in clear terms on 7 August  2017.
And from the drawdown of 31 August 2017 I am planning to direct that Drafty should  put things right 
as follows:
calculate the amount  of all interest  and charges  Mr P paid from 31 August 2017 until the 
account was paid off;
write off any unpaid interest charged from that same date;
rework  the sums paid such that from 31 August 2017 any amounts paid to the account are 
applied to the reduction  of the principal;
amend the credit  file to remove any adverse payment information from August 2017.
If there  is a surplus  due to Mr P, then this needs to be paid to him with the added  8% annual simple 
interest*.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Drafty to take off tax from this interest.  It must  give Mr P a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. 
Ref: DRN05432996complaint about suspension  of account 
In view of my provisional findings in relation to the Drafty credit facility  and the proposed redress then 
I turn to the additional  complaint which is about the suspension of the account in early  2019.  My view 
is that this account ought to have been suspended much earlier  and that additional borrowings ought 
to have been  denied Mr P from 31 August 2017. In those circumstances I am not upholding this part 
of Mr Ps complaint. 
Draftys approach 
In relation to the approach overall by Drafty then I do think that Mr Ps complaint  email on 
7 August 2017 ought to have prompted Drafty to have applied forbearance  and to have  recognised 
that Mr P was having difficulties maintaining  this line of credit. 
Instead Drafty continued  to lend to Mr P and increased  his credit limit to £610 and the account was 
not closed until over two years later. The closing balance was more  than the original credit limit, and, 
in my view,  it had got out of hand. I note Mr Ps explanations of his feelings of harassment  and of 
feeling under such pressure to repay each  month that it took on the importance of a priority bill. 
If the account had been approached in the way I think that it should have been in August 2017,  then 
I think  that the two years  of feeling  under  pressure to pay would have been alleviated. So, one of my 
provisional findings  is that on the evidence  and explanations I have now, I do think  that Mr P has 
suffered distress and inconvenience by this wrong  approach. 
I am planning  to direct  that Drafty pays to Mr P a payment to compensate him for that distress and 
currently I am thinking of £200.
