The complaint
Mr K complains about his home insurance policy, which he bought through Nationwide 
Building Society.
What happened
Mr K has purchased his home insurance through Nationwide for many years. He assumed 
that as a loyal and long-standing customer he would be treated fairly and provided with a 
competitive offering. 
On renewal in September 2019, Mr K found that he could get a policy as a new customer 
from Nationwide at less than half the price of his renewal quote.  He feels hes been ripped 
off for a number of years and seeks compensation. He says Nationwide had a duty of care to 
ensure that offers carrying its brand are fair to its customers. 
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. Mr K disagreed, so Ive been asked to make a 
decision. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Ks concern came about because of the price of his insurance policy. Weve looked at 
complaints about that against the insurance companies that underwrote the policy, as they 
were responsible for setting the price. And any unfairness in the premiums charged by the 
insurers will be addressed in those complaints. 
Ive taken on board Mr Ks point about Nationwide having a duty of care. But I think any 
compensation that may be due because of any unfairness in the price of the policy would be 
payable by the insurers, not by Nationwide. Nationwide was not acting as an independent 
intermediary or broker, so it didnt have to search each year for the best home insurance 
policy for Mr Ks needs.
Because of this, I dont uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 September 2020.
