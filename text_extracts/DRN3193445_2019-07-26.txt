K821x#15complaint
Ms H complains that National Westminster Bank Plc sold debts that had previously been 
included in a completed IVA to a third party. She also complains  that once NatWest got the 
debts bank it chased her for repayment. 
background
Ms H had a credit card and loan with NatWest.  In 2011 she entered into an IVA and the debt 
she owed was included.  The IVA completed  in February 2017.  
In April 2017 NatWest  wrote to Ms H and advised it had transferred the debt to a third party. 
NatWest also sent Ms H an annual statement. The third party later contacted Ms H and 
asked her to make payments. 
In June 2017 the third party responded to a complaint Ms H made  and said it wouldnt write 
to her about the debt again.  
Ms H contacted NatWest  in December 2017  and highlighted what  had happened.  NatWest 
arranged to get the debt back  from the third party. 
But NatWest  also contacted Ms H about the outstanding balance in the following months.  
On 18 June 2018 NatWest wrote  to Ms H and said it had decided  to refund £1,673.91 
because it hadnt  followed the right process  when her account was in arrears. It used the 
refund to reduce the outstanding balance of the debt. 
Ms H contacted our service to raise a complaint. She said the situation had made a long 
standing and serious health  condition  worse. 
NatWest responded  to the complaint on 17 September 2018 and apologised for what  had  
happened. NatWest also sent Ms H a cheque  for £100. NatWest  agreed it shouldnt have 
passed the debt to a third party and had taken  steps to get it back. NatWest confirmed its 
decision to use the refund it had previously written to her about  to reduce the outstanding 
balance remained unchanged. 
An investigator at our service looked at what had happened. She agreed NatWest  had made  
mistakes by transferring  the debt and later chasing Ms H for payment. She confirmed there  
were delays in closing the accounts  down and recommended NatWest increase the amount 
offered from £100 to £250. NatWest agreed  but Ms H didnt. 
In response to the investigator Ms H said she didnt think the settlement fairly reflected the 
time, money,  stress and upset shed  endured  dealing with the matter. She pointed out that 
NatWest had continued to send her annual statements about the debt even though  she was 
in an IVA and that it should have stopped pursuing her. 
As Ms H didnt agree and asked to appeal her complaints been passed to me to make a 
decision. 
Ref: DRN31934452my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms Hs IVA was put in place in 2011 and ended in 2017 so I can see why, after making 
payments for a long time, shes so upset by what happened. NatWest has made  a number of 
mistakes here. I agree with her that it shouldnt have sold the debt to a third party once  the 
IVA ended and it shouldnt have later sent her letters requesting  payments.  Ms H has told us 
that the stress of the situation has impacted her health. 
In this case, I think all parties broadly agree about what actually happened.  NatWest  clearly 
has made mistakes and I agree its taken too long to resolve the situation. But I understand 
NatWest has now confirmed Ms Hs debt is closed so I hope  that does go some way to 
drawing a line under the issue. I agree that NatWest  was party  to the IVA and that it had no 
legitimate reason to refer the debt to a third party or chase Ms H after it had ended. 
Ms H says NatWest shouldnt have sent her statements during the IVA but Im not 
persuaded thats correct. NatWest says its required to send those statements. And Ive 
looked at them but cant find any indication NatWest  was using them  to request  additional 
payments above  the IVA. I havent  found anything to show  NatWest  made  a mistake by 
sending statements during the IVA.
The issue  I need to decide is whether NatWests agreement to pay £250 fairly reflects the 
impact of its error  on Ms H. I can see she first contacted NatWest about  the transfer of the 
debt in December  2017 and it took steps to retrieve it from the third party.  The contact note 
for this call doesnt mention Ms H wanted to complain, just that she wanted the debt to be 
dealt with and closed. I appreciate Ms H was unhappy but if she thought  a complaint had 
been raised during that call she could have  contacted the business again after no response 
was received. 
Ms H called NatWest again  in June 2018 and said she was going to complain. But she 
specifically told NatWest  she wanted  to use our service to do that so it didnt take any further 
steps to deal with the issues raised  until it heard from us. Ms H followed through  and raised 
a complaint via our service so Im satisfied she was able to raise her concerns. NatWest  
later issued its response. 
Ive looked at the level of contact NatWest had with Ms H after her IVA ended. And, as Ive 
already said, I agree  it should have taken  steps  to close the debt down much sooner. 
NatWest sent Ms H letters confirming her debt had been sold to a third party and saying she 
was in arrears. NatWest later wrote  to Ms H about  a refund but thats  not related to the error  
it made when transferring  the debt to another business. Ms H says she contacted her IVA 
administrator concerning  what happened  but theres no record  of it taking the matter up with 
NatWest. 
I agree  that the situation was unnecessary  and that NatWest made  mistakes.  Ive considered 
everything Ms H has told us about  the impact of the issue.  But I think the £250 settlement 
NatWest has agreed to pay fairly reflects the errors NatWest made. I note its confirmed  the 
accounts are closed and outstanding debt written  off. As a result,  Im not telling it to increase 
the settlement  figure or taken any further action  to resolve the complaint. 
Ref: DRN31934453my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and direct  National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
Ms H £250  less any compensation already paid. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 August 2019.
