The complaint
Mr U complains Aviva Insurance Limited have unfairly declined his home insurance claim.
All references to Aviva also include its agents.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The policy provides cover for loss or damage of contents in the home caused by theft 
or attempted theft. The policy defines the home as the house/flat, its outbuildings and 
the total area of the plot, as described on the title deeds, at the insured address
Aviva declined the claim as it said the area where Mr U secured his bikes was a 
public area. Aviva said it had seen no evidence to support the area was part of the 
plot shown on the title deeds
Mr U has provided photos of where the bikes were kept. I can see this appears to be 
directly outside a property, not inside a property or its outbuildings
Ive also considered the comments from Mr Us landlord. But this says Mr U has the 
right to use the land for storage of refuse or cycles, not that the land forms part of the 
property. 
Additionally, I havent seen anything to persuade me the area of land shows on the 
title deeds at the insured address. So I dont think Aviva have acted unfairly in 
declining the claim
So for these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Us complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr U to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 October 2021.
