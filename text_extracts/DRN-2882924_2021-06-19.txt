The complaint
 Mr F complains about a personal loan provided to him by Madison CF UK Limited trading as 
118 118 Money, which he says was unaffordable.
What happened
 118 118 Money provided Mr F with a loan of £2,000.00 in April 2019. This loan had a 24-
month term with a monthly repayment amount of £122.70. This all meant the total amount 
repayable of £2944.80 was due to be repaid.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint and thought that 118 118 Money carried 
out proportionate checks and made a fair lending decision based on what it had in front of it.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in June 2021. Both parties have received a 
copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from the decision 
below. I said;
Were 118 118 Moneys checks reasonable and proportionate?
118 118 Money says that it carried out an income and expenditure assessment with Mr F 
prior to providing him with this loan. It says it also carried out a credit check. Mr F declared 
that he was earning around £1636 a month and 118 118 Money worked out his expenditure 
would be around £1064. It arrived at this figure by asking Mr F about his expenditure and 
also cross checking his credit report. The credit search it carried out had no defaults, 
delinquent accounts or county court judgments. But Mr F was utilising all of the credit 
available to him with his revolving credit and had missed a payment on an account.
Ive carefully considered what 118 118 Money has said. But when I consider what I have 
already mentioned about his credit report, the amount of the loan Mr F had asked for and the 
length of the term, I think that 118 118 Money needed to take steps to verify Mr Fs monthly 
income and expenditure. I dont think it should have just relied just on what Mr F had said 
and what was in the credit search it carried out, to check that he could sustainably repay the 
loan repayments over the 24-month loan term.
I dont currently think that the checks 118 118 Money carried out before providing Mr F with 
his loan were reasonable and proportionate.
Would reasonable and proportionate checks have indicated to 118 118 Money that Mr F 
would have been unable to repay this loan?
As reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out before this loan was provided, I 
cant say for sure what they wouldve shown. So, I need to decide whether it is more likely 
than not that a proportionate check would have told 118 118 Money that Mr F would have 
been unable to sustainably repay this loan.
118 118 Money was required to establish whether Mr F could make his loan repayments 
without experiencing significant adverse consequences  not just whether the loan payments 
were technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Mr F has provided our service with bank statements from the period of time before this loan 
was granted. Ive carefully considered the information provided within these statements. 
Having done so, its clear Mr F was gambling significant amounts of money at the time he 
asked for this loan. He also had other short-term loans active at this time also. In these 
circumstances, it is apparent to me that Mr F was unlikely to have been able to repay this 
loan without borrowing further or experiencing financial difficulty.
Bearing all of this in mind, Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would 
more likely than not have shown 118 118 Money that Mr F would not have been able to 
sustainably repay this loan. So, Im satisfied that 118 118 Moneys failure to carry out 
proportionate checks resulted in it unfairly providing this loan to Mr F.
So, it follows that I currently think that 118 118 Money needs to put things right.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response to 
my provisional decision. 118 118 Money responded and said it has no further comments. 
Mr Fs representative responded and also had nothing further to add except to say that 
the debt had been sold by 118 118 Money to a third party, and that Mr F had agreed a 
payment plan with it.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both parties have not made any further points. So, as neither party has anything further to 
add, I dont see any reason to depart from my findings within my provisional decision. With 
that being the case, 118 118 Money now needs to put things right. 
Putting things right
  Having thought about everything, I think it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Mr Fs complaint for 118 118 Money to put things right by:
Buying back the debt if it can do so from the third party. Then removing all interest, 
fees and charges applied to the loan from the outset. The payments Mr F made, 
direct to 118 118 Money and any third-parties, should be deducted from the new 
starting balance  the £2,000.00 originally lent. If it cant buy back the debt from the 
third party, then it should work with the third party to recalculate the amount owed 
based on what I have said.
If Mr F has already repaid more than £2,000.00 then 118 118 Money should treat any 
extra as overpayments. And any overpayments should be refunded to Mr F;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any overpayments, if any, from the date 
they were made by Mr F to the date of settlementIf the amount repaid is less than £2000 then both parties should look to agree a 
payment plan. I would like to remind 118 118 Money of its obligation to exercise 
forbearance when it does this. Mr Fs representative has informed our service that he 
suffered a serious injury some years ago. As a responsible lender it should take this 
into account in its discussions with him about repayment of this loan.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr F a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold Mr Fs complaint and direct Madison CF UK Limited to put 
things right as described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 July 2021.
