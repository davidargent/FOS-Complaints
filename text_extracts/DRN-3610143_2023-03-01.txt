The complaint
Mr L complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr L and his wife entered into an acquisition agreement in November 2010 to buy some 
holiday club membership points. The price of the membership points was £7,949 and Mr L 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that 
amount. He agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £119.49 to Barclays Partner 
Finance. Mr Ls representative says that Mr L and his wife upgraded to a different type of 
membership in 2011 and increased that membership a number of times between then and 
2014. 
Mr Ls representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in February 2017 under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the membership had 
been misrepresented to Mr L and his wife, the holiday company had breached the contract, 
there was an unfair relationship between Mr L and Barclays Partner Finance, unfair pressure 
was applied to them to get them to sign the agreements and a proper assessment of the 
affordability of the loan for Mr L hadnt been made. 
Barclays Partner Finance didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so a 
complaint was made to this service. Mr Ls representative also says that a commission was 
paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company that wasnt disclosed to Mr L. 
Barclays Partner Finance then said that Mr Ls claims were time-barred under the Limitation 
Act 1980. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ls complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of the misrepresentation claim to 
turn it down. He said that he was unable to look into the breach of contract claim as it related 
to the upgraded memberships that Mr L and his wife had bought between 2011 and 2014 
and which didnt relate to Mr Ls loan with Barclays Partner Finance. He said that he hadnt 
seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr L and Barclays Partner Finance 
was unfair and he wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the 
relationship was unfair. He didnt consider that Barclays Partner Finance had acted 
incorrectly in connection with any commission paid to the holiday company and he said that 
he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr L.
Mr Ls representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has referred to a decision issued by this service on a complaint about the 
type of membership to which Mr L and his wife upgraded in 2011 in which it was found that 
the charges were unfair. It says that the charges payable under the acquisition agreement 
are unfair and that the agreement is unfair pursuant to section 140A. It has also provided a 
generic submission from counsel about the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ls complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ls complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that hed 
made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to his 
claims;
Mr Ls claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ls claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company and that the membership was misrepresented to him and his wife and that 
they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under sections 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr L could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the membership in November 2010 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been incurred 
as that was when he also entered into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made 
to Barclays Partner Finance until February 2017, more than six years later so was 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and I consider that his 
misrepresentation claim is now time-barred;
Mr Ls representative has also referred to breaches of contract by the holiday 
company, but I consider that those breaches relate to the upgraded memberships that Mr L and his wife bought between 2011 and 2014  Mr Ls loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance was used to pay for the membership that he and his wife 
bought under the acquisition agreement in November 2010 and Im not persuaded 
that the breaches to which his representative has referred relate to that membership;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract by the holiday company for which Barclays Partner Finance would be 
liable under section 75;
Mr Ls representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr L and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner has provided an account statement which show that Mr Ls loan 
account was still open in February 2017 when the claims were first made so I dont 
consider that Mr Ls claim under section 140A is time-barred;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr L and his wife were 
unduly pressurised into buying the membership points in November 2010, that Mr L 
was unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable sales practices against them  Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mr L complained to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until 
February 2017 (more than six years after the loan had been made to him) and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained to Barclays 
Partner Finance about any such issues before then;
Mr Ls representative says that Barclays Partner Finance didnt make a proper 
assessment of the affordability of the loan for Mr L - Barclays Partner Finance hasnt 
provided any evidence about its assessment of the affordability of the loan for Mr L 
but the loan account statement shows that Mr L made the loan repayments of 
£119.49 each month from January 2011 to March 2013, that he made a loan 
repayment of £6,000 in January 2012 and that the outstanding balance of the loan in 
March 2013 was £451.33;
Barclays Partner Finances account records show that Mr L cancelled his monthly 
direct debit in March 2013 and that he contacted it in April 2013 because hed 
entered into an individual voluntary arrangement  he then made reduced monthly 
repayments of £5 between August 2013 and June 2017;
although its clear that Mr L has experienced financial difficulties, Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for him in 
November 2010 when it was made to him;
Barclays Partner Finance was required to respond to any financial difficulties that 
Mr L was experiencing positively and sympathetically and I consider that by 
accepting reduced monthly repayments of £5 it has done so;
Mr Ls representative says that Barclays Partner Finance should have told him about 
any commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the loan  but Ive 
not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by 
Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company;from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr L 
risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr Ls representative has referred to a decision issued by this service in which it was 
found that the charges were unfair  but this service considers each complaint on its 
individual merits;
Mr L and his wife signed a members declaration in November 2010 which said that 
theyd only be able to use their membership points if all annual fees were paid up to 
date and the current annual membership fee and annual individual management 
charge were identified and it said that the basis of those dues was set out in the 
holiday companys memorandum and articles of association and its scheme rules 
and regulations;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the charges that Mr L 
and his wife were required to pay for the membership points that they acquired under 
the acquisition agreement were unfair;
Mr Ls representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company but Im not persuaded that it shows that Mr Ls relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Ls relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr L and Barclays 
Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Mr Ls claims in 
February 2017, and it then said that his claims were time-barred, so I cant say that 
its response to his claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had properly responded 
to his claims I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it not to have 
upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mr L for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership and the other difficulties that theyve experienced, but I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays 
Partner Finance to refund to Mr L any of the money that hes paid under the loan 
agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 March 2023.
