The complaint
Mr M is unhappy with the amount of compensation HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) has paid to 
settle his complaint about four mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) policies taken 
out alongside personal loans, in particular because of the delay in payment. He is also 
unhappy with HSBCs service in relation to the verification of his identity.
What happened
Mr M complained to HSBC about PPI policies he took out alongside four personal loans 
around 2000 to 2003. In December 2019, HSBC upheld Mr Ms complaint that the PPI 
policies were mis-sold, and said the compensation offered aimed to put Mr M back in the 
position he would have been in had he not taken the PPI policies. 
However, Mr M was living abroad at the time, and as HSBC needed to verify his signature, 
he did this with a local solicitor and forwarded it to HSBC, repeating the exercise when 
HSBC didnt act on the first set of information. When Mr M then returned to the UK, HSBC 
asked him to visit a local branch with his passport for identity verification purposes. Again, 
this had to be repeated. Mr M said he found it difficult to obtain any update from HSBC on 
the PPI compensation, after which he complained to HSBC, and then, in April 2022, to this 
service.
In August 2022, HSBC recalculated the PPI compensation to add further interest because of 
the delayed payment. It then made a payment of £3,492.95 to Mr Ms bank account.
Our adjudicator looked into Mr Ms complaint. She thought that the PPI compensation had 
been calculated correctly, but that HSBC should pay an additional amount of £75.00 in 
respect of the distress and inconvenience caused by the poor service Mr M received.
Mr M responded to say that he wasnt happy with the amount offered, and he asked for the 
complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman. HSBC accepted the suggested payment to Mr 
M in respect of distress and inconvenience
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As HSBC upheld Mr Ms complaint that the PPI was mis-sold I am not looking at the sale of 
the PPI policies in this decision. I am only considering if HSBCs payment of compensation 
for the mis-sold PPI is fair.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ms complaint about the amount of compensation for the mis-
sold policies, but I agree with our adjudicator that HSBC should pay Mr M £75.00 in respect 
of distress and inconvenience. Ill explain why.
When a PPI policy attached to a loan has been mis-sold, the business needs, as far as 
possible, to put the consumer in the position they would have been in had they not taken out 
the policy. Broadly speaking, this would normally involve the business refunding the PPI 
premiums and any interest that has been charged on them, along with simple interest at 8% 
per year for the time that the consumer has been out of pocket because of the PPI 
payments. I should say here that this latter interest is taxable, and a deduction is generally 
made from compensation payments to account for this.
HSBC sent in details of the redress calculated in December 2019 and the updated amount 
calculated in August last year. The December 2019 figures were as follows (the last four 
numbers of the loan accounts are shown in brackets) with a total amount offered of 
£3,239.86.
Policy no. ILPFLN02458384 (6401)  offer £341.14
Policy no. CLPPLN00570218 (3271)  offer £2,193.47
Policy no. ALPPLN03672818 (0863)  offer £517.16
Policy no. DLPPLN02274455 (8214)  offer £188.09
As I noted above, Mr M was living abroad at the time, and the compensation was not paid 
because HSBC needed to verify Mr Ms signature. Because of the delay in payment of the 
compensation, HSBC updated the interest element of the calculation in August 2022 to 
reflect the additional period for which Mr M had been out of pocket. The revised total amount 
was £3,492.95, and this was paid to Mr M on 8 August 2022. The individual figures were as 
follows:
Policy no. ILPFLN02458384 (6401)  revised offer £369.06
Policy no. CLPPLN00570218 (3271)  revised offer £2,362.42
Policy no. ALPPLN03672818 (0863)  revised offer £558.46
Policy no. DLPPLN02274455 (8214)  revised offer £203.01
Ive reviewed the information HSBC provided, and Im satisfied that it has calculated (and 
then updated) the compensation in the way this service would expect, and that it will, as far 
as possible, put Mr M back in the position he would have been in if the mis-sales hadnt 
happened. Im also satisfied that the additional interest paid in August 2022 reflects the 
delay in payment of the compensation. So I dont think HSBC needs to do anything more 
with regard to the compensation calculation.
However, as I noted above, I agree with our adjudicator that HSBC should make an 
additional payment of £75.00 in respect of the distress and inconvenience caused by its 
handling of Mr Ms identity verification. As I noted above, HSBC accepted this.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ms complaint about the 
compensation calculation, but HSBC UK Bank Plc should pay Mr M £75.00 in recognition of 
the distress and inconvenience it caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2023.
