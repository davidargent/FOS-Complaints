DRN-3501507
The complaint
Mr and Mrs N complain about the advice given to them by Totemic Limited, trading as 
PayPlan during their debt management plan (DMP). 
What happened
Mr and Mrs N entered a DMP with PayPlan in 2005 and 2006 respectively.
Between 2005 and 2020, Mr and Mrs N were making payments to PayPlan  which PayPlan 
distributed to Mr and Mrs Ns creditors. In 2020, Mr and Mrs N discovered that some of their 
debts were unenforceable and so felt theyd been making payments unnecessarily. So they 
complained that PayPlan hadnt told made them aware of this. They were also concerned 
about some discrepancies in the payment history. 
 
PayPlan responded to Mr and Mrs Ns complaint. They said they had provided the correct 
advice to Mr and Mrs N about their debts, including when they suggested bankruptcy to 
them. 
Mr and Mrs N werent happy with this response. An Investigator considered their complaint. 
He said, in summary, under the agreement for the DMP, PayPlan do not deal with accounts 
in dispute and, apart from one occasion in 2009, Mr and Mrs N hadnt raised the issue of any 
of their debts being unenforceable.
 
As Mr and Mrs N didnt agree, the complaints been passed to me to decide. 
I previously explained why I didnt think the Financial Ombudsman Service had the power to 
consider anything that happened before 6 April 2007. I wont be considering the setting up 
and advice given about the DMP at the outset as this didnt become regulated until April 
2007. 
Both parties accepted my findings on the jurisdiction matter. So, the complaints been 
passed back to me to consider the merits. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
While Ive considered everything the parties have provided, Ive only commented in my 
decision on the points I consider most relevant to the outcome of the complaint. 
Mr and Mrs N entered a DMP with PayPlan. This means Mr and Mrs N had entered into an 
informal agreement with their creditors to repay their debts. They made a monthly payment 
to PayPlan, which was then distributed to their creditors. 
The terms and conditions set out the service PayPlan offer- which is to help people repay 
their debts. Theres nothing in the terms and conditions to suggest that it is PayPlans role to 
seek debt solutions for Mr and Mrs N. Which, based on their submissions, appears to be the 
suggestion they are making.
 
Mr and Mrs N are also concerned that PayPlan have breached their duty of care to them, by 
not advising them that some of these accounts were unenforceable. Unenforceable here 
means, the time limits under the Limitation Act 1980 for a creditor to pursue the debt in court 
have expired. Mr and Mrs N say this means theyve been paying their debts for a number of 
years unnecessarily. So Ive considered what PayPlan told Mr and Mrs N about this. 
In 2009, Mr and Mrs N sent an email to PayPlan saying theyd heard there were companies 
specialising in helping people in reviewing unenforceable debts. PayPlan explained in reply, 
that it was up to Mr and Mrs N whether they wanted to explore this (and that they had no 
objection to Mr and Mrs N contacting their creditors to request agreements in order to 
explore this) but that if they did, any accounts they were disputing would need to be removed 
from the DMP. 
Ive seen a copy of Mr and Mrs Ns reply to PayPlan. In it they said they were simply 
enquiring about this and since the companies concerned charged for their services  they 
did not have the money to pursue this. The email went on to say Mr and Mrs N were more 
than happy with PayPlans management of our debts. 
At the time, it seems Mr and Mrs N made the decision not to explore any further whether any 
of their debts would be unenforceable. That was their choice. And based on the content of 
the email replies from PayPlan, Im satisfied Mr and Mrs N were given the correct 
information by PayPlan in 2009; namely it was up to them to decide if they wanted to pursue 
this avenue and that if they did, any debts they disputed would be removed from their DMP.
 
There was a similar email exchange in 2016. Again, PayPlan gave Mr and Mrs N the same 
information. And if Mr and Mrs N decided not pursue this any further, that again was their 
choice. 
Mr and Mrs N are also concerned that there are discrepancies relating to payments and the 
list of their creditors. I can see one of these issues stemmed from the name of a business 
having changed over the years the account was with PayPlan and they had initially set the 
dates of the changes out incorrectly to Mr and Mrs N. But I also see PayPlan corrected the 
information when asked about this and explained this to Mr and Mrs N what changes had 
taken place and when. And Ive not seen anything to suggest that Mr and Mrs Ns payments 
were affected by this  as it seems this was only recorded incorrectly in the information sent 
to Mr and Mrs N.  
Finally, Mr and Mrs N were concerned about the payment history, but I havent been 
provided with anything to suggest there were payments Mr and Mrs N made that were not 
credited to their account.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ns complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs N to 
accept or reject my decision before 18 August 2022.
