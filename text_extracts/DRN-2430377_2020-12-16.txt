The complaint
Mr S complains that One Sure Insurance Limited mishandled his motor trader insurance
policy.
What happened
The Financial Ombudsman Service deals with a consumers complaint against one regulated
financial firm at a time. In our final decision we name that firm, but we dont name any other
party.
Im satisfied that Mr S was in business in a modest way and he meets our definition of a
micro-enterprise.
On 24 July 2019, Mr S contacted One Sure to buy motor trader insurance. One Sures terms
of business said that it would act for Mr S as an intermediary between him and an insurer.
The insurer was itself represented by companies other than One Sure. For simplicity, I will
only refer to One Sure and the insurer.
One Sures terms of business also said that One Sure could act as a credit broker between
Mr S and a finance company.
One Sure arranged a policy for a year from 1 August 2019. Mr S paid a deposit of £203.47.
He agreed to pay the balance of the yearly cost by monthly direct debit instalments of about
£80.00. Mr S entered into an agreement with the finance company. In the usual course of
events, I find it likely that the finance company paid the whole of the yearly premium to the
insurer.
By letter dated 27 August 2019, the insurer gave seven days notice that the policy would be
cancelled. Mr S contacted One Sure. It told him he had a gap in cover before April 2019. He
told One Sure hed been abroad from February to April 2019.
By letter dated 30 August 2019 the insurer again gave seven days notice that the policy
would be cancelled. Mr S contacted One Sure again. It said he needed to provide
information about where his vehicles would be parked. Mr S said he had another address.
On 3 September 2019 Mr S paid One Sure an additional £55.00 for adding that address.
One Sure then said the insurer still needed photos of the garage at that address. Mr S
cancelled the policy. One Sure said it would charge a cancellation fee of £85.00.
By email dated 4 September 2019, Mr S complained that hed only paid the £55.00 to stop
the cancellation. He said One Sure should refund that and the cancellation fee.
One Sure wrote a letter dated 17 September 2019 and enclosed some financial details. It
said Mr S had made payments as follows:
collected by finance company (less interest) £  80.13
paid to One Sure £258.47
total £338.60
It also said the amounts payable by Mr S were as follows:
Time on cover £311.72
Mid-term adjustment fee £  35.00
Cancellation fee £  85.00
Loss of commission £  59.86  
Sub-total £491.58
Less paid £338.60
Balance to pay £152.98
By an email dated 17 September 2019, Mr S complained again to One Sure. He asked it to
refund all his payments as follows:
24 July 2019 deposit £203.47
2 September 2019 instalment £  80.53
3 September 2019 additional payment £  55.00
Total £339.00
So his figure for the instalment (and his total of his payments) was £0.40 more than One
Sures. From One Sures phrase less interest, I find that this was an amount of interest.
One Sure says it didnt receive his email. So it didnt send a final response. Mr S brought his
complaint to us on 12 November 2019.
Our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. She didnt think
One Sure had acted fairly. She recommended that One Sure should refund Mr S the
payment of £55.00.
My provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr S 
and to One Sure on 16 November 2020. I summarise my findings:
Mr S felt pushed into cancellation. But  because of the requirements of the insurer  
I didnt find One Sure was responsible for that.
The insurer charged more than a proportional rate compared to a yearly premium of 
about £817.00. I didnt hold One Sure responsible for that. Mr S may wish to take it 
up with the insurer.
One Sures charge for the change of address was £35.00. I found that was in line 
with its terms of business and fair.
One Sures cancellation charge was £85.00. I found that was in line with its terms of 
business and fair.
One Sures charge for loss of commission was £59.86. Thats less than 20% of the 
insurers rebate. So I found it in line with One Sures terms of business and fair.
Subject to any further information from Mr S or from One Sure, my provisional decision was 
that I wasnt minded to uphold this complaint. I didnt intend to direct One Sure Insurance 
Limited to do any more in response to this complaint.One Sure said it had nothing to add in response to the provisional decision.
Mr S says that:
He lost his money and One Sure because they are a professional and they know how 
to provide the proofs to scam people whos here to work and steal their money.
Hes not happy with the decision and took more than a year to get this decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
One Sures terms of business
One Sures terms of business disclosed that the insurer would pay One Sure commission,
typically of between 5% and 20%. I find it likely that if a policy was cancelled, the insurer
wouldnt pay the commission it wouldve paid if the policy had continued for a year  and the
insurer might claw back from One Sure some of the commission it had paid.
Theres no evidence that One Sure charged Mr S a policy arrangement fee.
One Sures terms of business provided that if there was a mid-term adjustment, then a fee of
£35.00 would apply.
The terms of business also provided that if a policy was cancelled after the 14- day cooling
off period, a cancellation fee of £85.00 would apply.
In addition, the terms included the following:
In the event of there being a rebate of premium following an adjustment /
cancellation on the insurance policy, we will apply a charge of 20% of the rebate to
cover any commission clawback that the insurer(s) may apply. Refunds will only be
issued once we receive the monies from the insurers, this can take up to 6 weeks,
but with some insurers it may take up to 6 months.
So, if there was a cancellation and (after deducting a charge for time on cover) the insurer
sent One Sure a rebate of premium, then One Sure would charge 20% of that rebate (to
cover its loss of commission) before refunding Mr S any balance.
Events leading to cancellation
One Sure hasnt shown us the amount of the premium. Mr S has told us the following:
They shouldnt charge me nearly £500 For premium policy £817 for only one month
£817.00 is less than the total of his deposit of £203.47 plus eleven instalments of about
£80.00 (which would include interest). So £817.00 is the most reliable figure I have for the
premium.
Ive seen an email dated 21 August 2019 from the insurer to One Sure. It said he had
parking for two vehicles - but had three vehicles on cover. It asked for details of where the 
other vehicle was parked.The insurer rather than One Sure was responsible for the notices of cancellation.
Ive seen an email from One Sure to the insurer dated 28 August 2019. It said Mr S had a 
gap in cover from February to April 2019 because he had been abroad.
There were times on the telephone when One Sure put Mr S on hold. But Ive listened to the
call recordings and Mr S didnt complain about being put on hold. So I dont consider that
One Sure kept Mr S waiting for an unreasonable time.
From the emails and call recordings I find that One Sure provided a reasonable level
of service in relaying the insurers requests for information and Mr Ss answers.
I have noted that on 3 September One Sure told Mr S that the payment of £55.00 was an
additional premium to the insurer of £20.00 plus a fee of £35.00 to One Sure.
After the insurer added the garage address, it asked for photographs to show the space
inside. I can understand that Mr S felt pushed into cancellation. But  because of the 
requirements of the insurer  I dont find One Sure was responsible for that. And Mr S 
accepted the cancellation.
Loss of Commission
From what One Sure has said about loss of commission, I find it likely that the insurer had
agreed to pay or had paid One Sure £59.86 or more but  because of the cancellation  the
insurer either didnt pay that sum or clawed it back from One Sure.
The insurer and the charge for time on cover
The Financial Ombudsman Service generally finds it fair for a shorter time on cover to be
charged as a proportion of the charge that wouldve applied for the whole year. For example,
we would expect a time of one month to be charged at one twelfth of the charge for the year.
We dont generally find it fair for there to be a short-term rate that is higher than such a
proportion.
However, charges for time on cover are usually set by the insurer rather than by an
insurance intermediary.
One Sures letter of 17 September 2019 included a figure of £311.72 for Mr Ss time on
cover of a little over a month. Later, One Sure told us the figure for time on cover was
£298.18.
Whichever is the actual figure, the insurer charged more than a proportional rate compared
to a yearly premium of about £817.00. I dont hold One Sure responsible for that. Mr S may
wish to take it up with the insurer.
If the yearly premium was £817.00 and there was a deduction of about £300.00 for time on
cover, I would expect a rebate of about £517.00. And, from a call recording of 3 September
2019, I note that One Sure told Mr S the amount of the rebate from the insurer would be
£515.69. 20% of £515.69 is £103.14.
One Sures charges
The charge for time on cover  of about £300.00  isnt a charge by One Sure and I havent
held One Sure responsible for it.One Sures charge for the change of address was £35.00. I find that was in line with its
terms of business and fair.
One Sures cancellation charge was £85.00. I find that was in line with its terms of business
and fair.
One Sures charge for loss of commission was £59.86. Thats less than 20% of the insurers
rebate. So I find it in line with One Sures terms of business and fair.
Conclusion
I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct One Sure to reverse any of its charges
or to do anything further in response to this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct One Sure Insurance Limited to do any more in response to this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 January 2021.
