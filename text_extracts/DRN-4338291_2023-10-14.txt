The complaint
Ms M complains about a decision taken by Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited 
(VWFS) to terminate her hire agreement (agreement) and to seek the return of her car
Ms M has been represented from time to time by a third party, but for ease I will simply refer 
to Ms M in this decision rather than Ms M and her representative.
What happened
On 18 June 2021 Ms M entered into an agreement with VWFS for a car. Under the terms of 
the agreement, everything else being equal, Ms M undertook to pay an advance rental of 
£2,665.64 followed by 35 monthly rentals of £355.11.
On 28 July 2021 VWFS wrote to Ms M to advise her agreement was £2,665.64 in 
arrears (advance rental).
On 14 August 2021 VWFS wrote to Ms M to advise her agreement was £355.11 in 
arrears (1 monthly rental).
On 23 May 2022 VWFS wrote to Ms M to advise her agreement was £355.11 in 
arrears (1 monthly rental).
On 10 June 2022 VWFS sent Ms M a notice of sums in arrears.
On 6 July 2022 VWFS wrote to Ms M to advise her agreement was £710.22 in 
arrears (2 monthly rentals).
On 12 August 2022 VWFS wrote to Ms M to advise her agreement was £1,065.33 in 
arrears (3 monthly rentals) and if payment wasnt made by 31 August 2022 it 
reserved its right, amongst other things, to terminate the agreement.
On 21 September 2022 VWFS issued Ms M with a default notice. Under cover of this 
notice VWFS said that if the car wasnt insured by 10 October 2022 it reserved its 
right, amongst other things, to terminate the agreement.
On 21 October 2022 VWFS issued Ms M with a default notice. Under cover of this 
notice VWFS said that if arrears of £1,420.44 (4 monthly rentals) werent paid by 
9 November 2022 it reserved its right, amongst other things, to terminate the 
agreement.
On 13 November 2022 VWFS sent Ms M a notice of sums in arrears.
On 12 January 2023 VWFS terminated the agreement with the sum of £3,722.32 
noted as being outstanding and due (£1,775.55 arrears plus £1,946.77) and advised 
Ms M of the same.
On 6 March 2023 Ms M paid VWFS the sum of £3,722.32 and asked about having 
her agreement reinstated and about being able to retain the car. VWFS confirmed it 
wasnt prepared to reinstate the agreement and the car would need to be returned.
On 14 March 2023 Ms M raised a complaint with VWFS about its refusal to allow her 
agreement to be reinstated and its refusal to allow her to retain the car.
On 17 March 2023 VWFS issued Ms M with a final response letter (FRL). Under 
cover of this FRL VWFS said it was satisfied that it had done nothing wrong, but it 
would allow Ms M to retain the car until 17 April 2023.
Ms Ms complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
VWFS had done nothing wrong.
Ms M didnt agree with the investigators view and raised concerns that on the cars ultimate 
return VWFS might hold her liable for further rentals.
The investigator considered Ms Ms response to his view but wasnt persuaded to change 
his mind. And because of this Ms Ms complaint has been passed to me for review and 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I can confirm that Ive come to the same conclusions as the investigator and 
for the same reasons. There is also very little I can usefully add to what has already been 
said.
Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on 
board and think about it but because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach 
what I think is the right outcome.
I dont underestimate the position Ms M was in prior to the agreement being terminated, both 
financially and personally, and the effect this would have had on both her health and general 
wellbeing. But equally its not in dispute that VWFS was unaware of Ms Ms personal and 
financial circumstances until after the agreement had been terminated. So although Ive 
sympathy and empathy for the position Ms M now finds herself in I cant reasonably 
conclude that VWFS did anything wrong in terminating the agreement, especially given the 
number of letters it sent prior to termination.
I can appreciate why Ms M might hold the view that having paid VWFS the sum of £3,722.32 
it should reinstate the agreement and allow her to retain the car. But unfortunately for Ms M 
this isnt something, in the particular circumstances of this case, I can reasonably ask VWFS 
to do.
So, in summary, Im satisfied that VWFS did nothing wrong in terminating Ms Ms 
agreement, nothing wrong in refusing to reinstate it and its entitled to the return of the car. 
I think its also worth pointing out that Ms M has had a significant benefit, including a 
financial one, as a result of VWFS allowing her to have continued use of the car since 
January 2023 rather than insisting on its return.
I can see that Ms M has raised concerns that on return of the car VWFS might try and hold 
her to further rentals. However, I can confirm that VWFS has said that there is no 
termination shortfall and nor would there be any further costs to return the car.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 November 2023.
