K822xcomplaint
Mr M is unhappy  with Santander  UK Plcs  decision  not to refund money taken from his 
account as part of a scam.
background 
In setting out the background  to this complaint I think its worth stating that all parties accept 
that Mr M has been the victim of a cruel scam and that a malicious  third party  (or parties) 
has been involved. With that in mind I will refer to some of the actions and events as being  
carried out by the fraudster.
Mr M received a text message on 1 March 2017 and it appeared to be from Santander.  It 
was in the same chain  of genuine texts  hed received from the bank in the past. But it hadnt 
actually been  sent by Santander. Instead,  a fraudster  had used a known method to spoof 
the name of the sender. Thats to say that although  the text was sent from a different 
number, it appeared  as though it was sent by Santander. Its also sometimes referred to as
smishing. The text said:
Santander has noticed your debit card was recently used on 01-03-201716:26:43, at
APPLE ONLINE STORE for 1976.00  GBP. If not you please urgently call fraud  prevention
on 03********* or Intl +443*********  . Do not reply by SMS
Mr M hadnt tried to make the transaction referred  to and, believing  the text was genuinely 
from the bank, he called the number  in the text message. He was concerned someone was 
trying to steal his money. But it wasnt a genuine  Santander number and instead Mr M was 
calling the fraudster.
The call was answered and the person Mr M spoke with took him through security. Mr M 
recalls how it seemed just like any other genuine  call hed had with Santander in the past.
He remembers answering security questions which included giving, among other things,  his 
customer ID. Hes unsure  about what characters, if any, he gave from his online banking 
password. But he knows there were  also questions about his date of birth along with other 
personal information.
Mr M recalls getting straight  through to the fraudster  and that once security was passed  they 
assured him they could help. Mr M was told the payment could be stopped from going 
through and that a new card would  be sent to him. He believed  he was speaking with the 
bank and that someone was helping him. Hes described to us how he went  from panicking  
about someone trying to use his card to thinking the bank was helping him, all within  a few 
minutes.
Mr M, in his later recollections,  thinks  the person he was speaking to may have also taken 
him through  the steps  necessary to set up call forwarding on his phone.  He remembers  
following some  instructions which included adding another caller  to the conversation  and 
entering a string of digits which he thinks may have been a phone number.
Mr Ms online banking was then accessed  by fraudsters most likely using the personal 
information and details theyd gathered from Mr M whilst talking him through  security. Mr M 
has said it wasnt him logging in and that it must  have been the fraudster. He had no idea 
this was happening whilst he was on the call with the fraudster.  One of the existing payees 
Ref: DRN46435282on Mr Ms online banking was amended; the recipient account number and sort code were  
changed at 16:58.
Mr M then received a text from Santander. This was a genuine text, received in the same 
thread as earlier genuine texts and the fraudulent  ones sent on the day, and it contained a 
one-time passcode (OTP). That OTP was used to confirm the changes  that had just been 
made to the payee through online banking. The text message said:
This OTP is to AMEND A PAYEE on a payment.  Don't share this code  with anyone.  Call us 
immediately if you didn't request this.
Mr M has said he doesnt remember seeing this OTP on the day. Hes quite  certain he didnt 
give it to the fraudster. But it seems that it was entered online somehow as the payee was 
successfully amended. Santander  has said the only way for that to happen would be for 
someone to correctly enter the OTP online.  Mr Ms certainty of not handing over the OTP is 
one of the reasons he thinks there  was some kind of call forwarding established.
A payment was then set up online for a total of £9,182.17 at 17:05. Mr M has said he didnt 
do this himself or otherwise authorise  for it to happen. Santander flagged this transaction  as 
suspicious and stopped it from leaving the account.  It then made an automated  security  call 
to Mr Ms landline.  It appears there was an attempt to reach the mobile  phone  as the system 
conducted a check  against Mr Ms sim card which came back  as a match. But Santander  
has confirmed the actual call went to Mr Ms landline.
An answering machine picked up the call and a message was left in which  Mr M was given a 
three digit code. The code was needed  to release the payment that had been set up online. 
The message gave a phone number  for Mr M to call in order  to give over the code. But there  
was no mention of what the code was for specifically; it didnt mention a payment was being 
made out of the account.
I can see from Santanders records that there are then several calls to it where attempts are 
made to verify the payment. Each  is listed  as call disconnected while  trying  to confirm 
details. These calls run from 17:13 until 19:02 but its unclear what  phone  number they are 
coming from; there isnt a record  of that information. Mr M has said he didnt make any of the 
calls. None are successful in releasing the payment.
Mr M has said he didnt listen  to the answerphone  message from Santander  himself.  His 
father heard it and passed on the three  digit code to Mr M.
Mr M then received another spoof  text message, similar to the earlier one, at 19:02. This 
time it said:
Santander has noticed your debit card was recently used on 01-03-201719:02:02, at 
AMAZON ONLINE STORE for 9,182.17  GBP. If not you please urgently  call fraud  prevention 
on 03********* or Intl +443*********  . Do not reply by SMS
Mr M was prompted into calling Santander  by this second spoof text. He thought his account 
was still under threat following  what had happened earlier. He rang the number given in the 
spoof text, again connecting  him to the fraudster but believing  he was calling  Santander. He 
didnt call the number  given in the answerphone message as he hadnt listened to it himself; 
his father  had passed on the code but not the phone number. He gave the three digit code to 
the person he spoke  to as they said they needed  the code to stop the transaction.
Ref: DRN46435283Santander then received  a call, most likely  from the fraudster, at 19:19 and the three  digit 
code was given.  This satisfied Santander that the online payment of £9,182.17, set up 
following the earlier amendment to the payee, was genuine and the money was released. 
The transfer left Mr Ms account  in an overdrawn  position.
Here is a timeline of the key events:
16:32 Mr M receives a spoof text from the fraudster about  an attempted  payment to
APPLE ONLINE STORE
16:56 The fraudster logs on to Mr Ms online banking  and amends a payee
16:57 Santander sends  the OTP to Mr Ms registered  mobile
16:58 The OTP is entered successfully online and a payee  is amended
17:05 The instruction to send a single transfer of £9,182.17 to the amended payee is
made
17:06 Santanders security system  calls Mr Ms landline and leaves an automated
message containing a three digit code
17:13 Attempts to verify the transfer  with Santanders automated  system  begin
19:02 Final unsuccessful attempt to verify the transfer
19:02 Mr M receives a further text from the fraudster,  again about  an attempted
payment to APPLE ONLINE STORE, this time for the amount  of £9,182.17
19:19 Someone calls Santander and gives  over the three digit code and the transfer  is
released
Mr M realised something wasnt right the next day when he logged into his online banking  
and saw the transfer out of his account.  He contacted  Santander to report the fraud and it 
began to investigate. It contacted the receiving bank and was able to recover £190.17,  
although it seems this wasnt actually refunded to Mr M at the time.  But the rest of the money 
had already been removed from the account it had been sent to.
Mr M asked  Santander to refund the rest of his money as he hadnt authorised the transfer 
out of his account and had been the victim of fraud.  Santander considered the claim but said 
it wouldnt be refunding  Mr M in full as hed given away security information  which  made the 
transfer of funds possible. It did refund  him £1,995.70 which represented  the portion of the 
transfer made from Mr Ms overdraft.
Santander said that had Mr M called the number left in the voicemail, as instructed,  he would 
have discovered  the transfer and been able to stop it.
Santander recognised there had been some problems with how it handled Mr Ms fraud  
claim and so it paid him £80 for any distress  and inconvenience suffered.
Mr M was unhappy with Santanders response.  He believed he should have been refunded 
in full as he hadnt authorised the transfer. He thought it was particularly unfair given the 
spoof texts he received  and which  made  the whole situation seem genuine. And in all the 
messages sent to him by Santander there was never any mention of a transfer  being  made  
out of his account meaning he had no idea that was happening. Santander didnt change its 
view and so Mr M asked  us to investigate.
One of our adjudicators looked  into Mr Ms case and didnt uphold it. She said that although 
Mr M was convinced  he was speaking to the bank he did give over security  information. She 
thought it was more likely than not that he did give over the OTP as well as the code from 
Ref: DRN46435284the voicemail. It was only because of his disclosure of those details  that the transfer was 
made. And so she didnt  recommend Santander refund Mr M.
Mr M asked  for an ombudsman to review  his case as he wasnt  happy  with the adjudicators  
conclusions.
my provisional decision
On 21 December 2018 I issued a provisional  decision  on Mr Ms complaint. After considering 
all the evidence and arguments presented by both sides, I was minded to conclude that:
Mr M did not authorise the transactions in question;
Mr M had not acted with gross  negligence;  
Santander should fairly and reasonably refund  the money  obtained from Mr M by the 
fraudster, plus interest  at the rate he would have received had the money  remained  
in his account; and
Santander should pay Mr M £300  for the trouble  and upset he experienced.
Mr M responded to say he accepted  the findings  set out in my provisional decision.
Santander also responded  to say it accepted the findings reached in my provisional decision.  
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  As both parties accept  my provisional  
findings I see no reason  to depart  from these.  
Ive included the relevant considerations here for clarity, along with a summary of the 
findings from my provisional  decision and my direction to Santander  to put things right.
relevant considerations
Santander, as an FCA regulated  firm, provided a current deposit account. As such  the
FCAs overarching Principles for Businesses  apply including the requirement to pay due 
regard to a customers  interests and treat them fairly (Principle 6).
The transfer from Mr Ms account was made in March 2017. So of particular relevance to my 
decision about what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint are the 
Payment Services Regulations 2009  (PSR 2009). I think these sections of PSR 2009 are of 
particular relevance  here:
Consent and withdrawal  of consent
55.(1) A payment transaction is to be regarded  as having been  authorised  by the payer for
the purposes of this Part only if the payer has given its consent  to
(a) the execution  of the payment transaction;
Ref: DRN46435285Obligations of the payment service user in relation to payment instruments
57.(1) A payment service user to whom a payment instrument has been issued must 
(a) use the payment  instrument in accordance with the Terms and Conditions governing its 
issue and use; and
(b) notify the payment service provider in the agreed manner and without undue delay on 
becoming aware of the loss, theft, misappropriation or unauthorised use of the payment 
instrument.
(2) The payment  service user must on receiving a payment instrument take all reasonable 
steps to keep its personalised security features safe.
Evidence on authentication  and execution  of payment transactions
60.(1) Where a payment service user
(a) denies having authorised an executed  payment transaction; or
(b) claims that a payment  transaction  has not been correctly executed, it is for the payment 
service provider to prove that the payment transaction  was authenticated,  accurately 
recorded, entered in the payment service  providers accounts and not affected by a technical 
breakdown or some  other deficiency.
(2) In paragraph  (1) authenticated means the use of any procedure  by which  a payment 
service provider is able to verify the use of a specific payment instrument, including its 
personalised security  features.
(3) Where a payment  service user denies  having authorised an executed payment 
transaction, the use of a payment instrument recorded by the payment service provider is 
not in itself necessarily  sufficient to prove  either that
(a) the payment  transaction  was authorised by the payer; or
(b) the payer acted  fraudulently or failed with intent or gross  negligence to comply with 
regulation 57.
Payment service providers liability  for unauthorised payment transactions
61. Subject to regulations  59 [Notification  of unauthorised or incorrectly  executed  payment 
transactions] and 60, where an executed payment transaction was not authorised  in 
accordance with regulation 55, the payment service provider must  immediately 
(a) refund  the amount of the unauthorised payment transaction  to the payer;  and
(b) where applicable, restore the debited  payment account  to the state  it would have been in 
had the unauthorised payment transaction not taken place.
Payers liability for unauthorised  payment  transactions
62.(1) Subject  to paragraphs (2) , the payer  is liable up to a maximum of £50 for any 
losses incurred in respect of unauthorised payment transactions arising
(a) from the use of a lost or stolen payment instrument; or
Ref: DRN46435286(b) where the payer has failed to keep the personalised  security features of the payment 
instrument safe, from the misappropriation of the payment instrument.
(2) The payer is liable for all losses incurred in respect of an unauthorised payment 
transaction where the payer
(a) has acted fraudulently; or
(b) has with intent or gross negligence  failed to comply with regulation 57.
consent
Regulation 55 says that the payer  must give consent, and it must  be given in the form, and 
in accordance with the procedure, agreed  between the payer and its payment  service 
provider. The payment  services directive  itself (which PSR 2009  implements)  says In the 
absence of such consent, a payment transaction shall be considered to be unauthorised.
But neither  PSR 2009 nor the FCAs 2013  guidance  on PSR 2009  provide a definition of 
consent.
I therefore think it is fair, when considering whether consent was given, to apply the common 
definition of consent, which is to give permission for something to happen.
gross negligence
Whether a customer has acted with gross  negligence  is something that can only be 
assessed on a case by case basis taking into account all the circumstances.  The term is not 
defined in PSR 2009 or in the first Payment Services Directive. However, recital 72 of the 
second Payment  Services Directive provides as follows:
In order to assess possible negligence or gross negligence on the part of the payment 
service user,  account should be taken of all of the circumstances.  The evidence and degree 
of alleged negligence should generally be evaluated  according to national  law. However, 
while the concept of negligence implies  a breach of a duty of care, gross negligence should  
mean more  than mere  negligence, involving conduct exhibiting a significant degree of 
carelessness; for example, keeping the credentials used to authorise a payment transaction  
beside the payment instrument in a format that is open and easily  detectable by third 
parties
Reflecting this, the FCA, in its document setting out its role under the Payment Services
Regulations 2017, says:
 we interpret gross negligence to be a higher  standard than the standard of negligence 
under common law. The customer needs  to have shown a very significant degree  of 
carelessness.
Although neither of these is directly relevant  to this complaint, they are of value  as a relevant 
consideration in the absence of contemporaneous  interpretative guidance, and because they 
inform the meaning  of a concept  that has been in place for some  time (in the Banking Code).
When considering  gross negligence in a commercial contract context, Mance J in Red Sea
Tankers Ltd v Papachristidis  (The Ardent) [1997]  2 Lloyds Rep 547, 586 said:
Ref: DRN46435287If the matter is viewed  according to purely English principles of construction,   Gross 
negligence is clearly  intended to represent  something more fundamental than failure to 
exercise proper skill and/or care constituting negligence  as a matter  of ordinary language 
and general impression, the concept of gross  negligence  seems to me capable of embracing 
not only conduct undertaken with actual appreciation  of the risks involved, but also serious 
disregard of or indifference to an obvious  risk.
Negligence is often  referred to as a failure to exercise reasonable care. But as I have 
described above, gross negligence suggests a lack of care that goes significantly beyond  
ordinary negligence. So I have to consider whether what  Mr M did fell so far below the 
standard expected of a reasonable person that it would  be fair to say he failed with gross 
negligence to keep  his personalised security details safe or to comply with the Terms  and 
Conditions of the account.
the terms & conditions of Mr Ms account

precautions to prevent anyone else from accessing your confidential  information  including  
the One Time Passcode(s) that will be sent to you. You must never disclose your One Time
Passcode verbally to any individual even if they claim to be our employees  or agents or the 
Police.
key provisional questions
In my view, the above relevant considerations mean  that if the transactions were  
unauthorised, it would be fair and reasonable for Santander to refund the amount stolen from
Mr M, unless  Mr M with intent or gross negligence, failed  to comply with the Terms and
Conditions of the account and the obligations set out in Regulation  57.
Santander hasnt  made it completely clear why it wont refund Mr M the full amount of money  
stolen from him. In its final response to him it discusses  the disclosure of personal 
information and security details  including  the OTP and three  digit security code  by Mr M 
to the fraudster. It goes  on to say that it was these disclosures that led to the money being 
transferred out of Mr Ms account.
In these circumstances there are two key questions relevant  to my consideration about what  
is fair and reasonable in the circumstances:
1. was the disputed transfer  authorised by Mr M? and
2. if it wasnt, can Santander demonstrate  that Mr M failed with intent or gross  negligence 
either to comply with the terms and conditions of the account or to keep his personalised 
security details safe?
was the disputed transfer authorised by Mr M?
Im not persuaded, on balance, that Mr M authorised the transfer of funds out of his account.  
I dont know exactly what was discussed between Mr M and the fraudster.  But what does 
seem to be apparent   and largely accepted by all parties  is that Mr M gave the fraudster 
enough information for them to be able to access his online banking. And it also seems  to be 
accepted that Mr M did so as he genuinely  believed he was protecting his account  from 
attack following  the receipt of the spoof  text messages.
Mr M has confirmed  he gave over details such as his date of birth and customer number. He 
told us he isnt sure about what parts of his password he may have given though  I think its 
likely he gave over enough  for the fraudster to gain access to his online banking. Ive seen 
no evidence that would  lead me to think the fraudster obtained those details from 
somewhere else.
We know the fraudster  also used an OTP to amend an existing payee on Mr Ms online 
banking. Im satisfied that the OTP was sent to Mr M and indeed  hes provided  screenshots  
of his phone  which show the message.
Ref: DRN46435289Mr M has said hes sure he didnt  give the OTP to the fraudster. He thinks  it must have 
somehow been  automatically forwarded to the fraudster, and hes described how he felt hed 
been coached  through setting up call forwarding on his mobile.
I have considered the possibilities but there doesnt seem to be a reasonable explanation for 
how the text from Santander  could have  been  received on another handset. Call forwarding,  
even if set up correctly  on a handset, doesnt automatically forward  on text messages. And 
Ive not seen any evidence to suggest  the steps described by Mr M would lead to text 
message forwarding.  Im not saying it could  not have happened  or even that it did not 
happen. Only that I think  its on balance more  likely,  based on the evidence  I have, that Mr M 
did receive the OTP and read it out to the fraudster,  at the fraudsters request. I can see why 
a fraudster would have wanted  to coach Mr M through  a call forwarding process as it could 
divert incoming security calls. But I believe thats unlikely to have meant text messages  
would also be forwarded.
I dont think theres been any duplication  or swapping of Mr Ms sim card here either. The 
banks records indicate that there was some attempted contact on Mr Ms mobile phone after 
the OTP was sent. And theres an entry  recorded  which suggests the sim was checked  and 
came back  as ok.
Ive considered Mr Ms recollections  and, whilst I cant be completely certain,  Im more  
persuaded that he did likely give over the OTP. I think its likely he did this in the belief that 
this was necessary  to stop the payment hed been told was leaving his account. He was 
clearly persuaded  he was speaking with the bank and the fraudster had his confidence at 
this stage. And that lends itself to him being convinced into handing  over the OTP.
But whilst I think  its more likely than not Mr M did pass on the OTP I dont think  that means 
he authorised the transfer. There is no indication that he knew any payments would be 
leaving his account.  On the contrary I think its likely he thought what  he was doing  was to 
stop a payment. And its the fraudster that has actually  set up the payment online,  not Mr M. 
Its also the case that the transfer isnt actually  made  at the point the OTP is entered online.
Santander flagged  the transfer  as suspicious after this point and they blocked  it. Thats  when 
the call to Mr Ms landline was made and the voicemail left.
Mr M has said he didnt pick up the message himself; it was relayed to him by his father. He 
then may not have  been given the full content of the message.  But even if he had there was 
no indication  in the message that a transfer was being made  out of his account. The 
message mentions being from Santanders fraud  department. But theres no detail of any 
outgoing payment  and nothing said about the purpose or reason for needing to call the bank.
This means  that when Mr M called the fraudster again  believing  it to be Santander  he still 
had no idea a payment  was about  to be made.  He didnt know  the code he was giving over 
would be used by the fraudster to release that payment.
The fraudster then used  the code by calling Santander. Its only at this point theres any 
detail given about the transfer thats  about  to take place.  But Mr M wouldnt  have  heard any 
of that information  as he didnt make the call.
Mr M called the bank the following day having  realised something  was wrong. He was 
shocked to find a payment of over £9,000 has left his account. I dont think  he had otherwise 
Ref: DRN464352810been aware that was going  to happen  as the deception unfolded. It follows  then that Im 
satisfied that Mr M didnt consent to or authorise the transaction. He couldnt have done as 
he didnt know a transaction was about  to take place.
My starting point then is that it wouldnt be fair and reasonable for Santander to hold Mr M 
liable for the transaction  as I think,  on balance, it was unauthorised. But I do need to go on to 
consider whether Mr M failed with intent or gross negligence  to comply with the terms and 
conditions of the relationship with Santander  and the obligations set out in the PSR 2009.
did Mr M fail with gross negligence either to comply  with the Terms and Conditions of 
the account,  or to keep his personalised security details safe?
Mr M cant be said to have been  grossly negligent  solely on the basis that he gave away 
security information to a third party. I have to consider the circumstances in which  that 
information was disclosed in order to reach a fair and reasonable outcome.
Mr M has been the victim of a sophisticated  fraud. He was persuaded to give over personal 
information and online banking details. He was also likely tricked into giving an OTP before 
finally passing on a security code from an automated voicemail message. I dont believe, 
however, that on balance  Mr M has been grossly negligent in falling for the tricks of the 
fraudster.
Ive already set out how both the courts and the FCA have interpreted gross negligence and 
how it is a higher bar than ordinary negligence.  And so Ive gone on to consider Mr Ms 
actions in the particular circumstances at hand  and whether  his actions fell so far below  the 
standard of a reasonable person  that it would be fair to say hed failed with gross  negligence 
to keep his security information safe or to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
account.
Gross negligence  isnt an abstract  concept and must be considered  with regard  to what was 
happening at the time.  Mr M was the victim of a sophisticated scam  involving what  is termed 
smishing as well as social  engineering.  Both methods are used by fraudsters to lure 
people into a false sense  of security and to believe theyre talking to their bank. The illusion 
thats created  is to make the victim act with urgency, the driving  force behind that being the 
need to protect  their account. I need to consider Mr Ms actions with these factors  in mind.
Mr M has provided us with copies of the text messages  he received. Its clear they appear in 
the same  chain of genuine texts hed previously  received from Santander. Mr M has said he 
was convinced it was from the bank and Ive no reason to doubt him here. Its borne out by 
what happens after, with him contacting the number  given  in the text. Its a sophisticated 
method used by fraudsters to trick people into thinking theyve  received  a genuine warning 
about suspicious activity  on their account. And it creates the sense of urgency fraudsters rely
on in getting people to act quickly. I can understand why the text wouldnt have raised
suspicions for Mr M and I dont think it would have  raised suspicions for many people, given
the genuine and convincing appearance of the text.
Im satisfied Mr M believed he was taking the right steps to protect his account when he
followed the instructions  given  by the fraudster.  That includes him calling  the number in the
text as well as being tricked into giving over personal and security details. I dont think he
appreciated the risk at the time and so it cant be said he was indifferent  to it or disregarded
it. He genuinely  thought  he was stopping fraudulent activity on his account. And I think  other
reasonable people would  have thought  similarly.
Ref: DRN464352811Mr M has maintained that he didnt  give over the OTP.  Ive already explained why I think  its
more likely than not that he did. But that does leave me in a position where I dont have an
explanation of the context  in which it was handed it over. That is to say I dont know  what
was said by the fraudster to persuade  Mr M into disclosing it. But I think its most likely Mr M
was persuaded  to do so as the fraudster convinced him it was required to stop the payment
referred to in the first spoof text message.
When it comes  to the code provided in the voicemail Mr M has said the fraudster told him the
code was required to stop the payment. And so it seems likely a similar explanation was
given for the OTP. And I can see why, in the moment, Mr M thought he needed to act quickly
to protect  his account.
I wouldnt expect Mr M to know what steps  might actually be necessary for stopping  a
payment. I also wouldnt really expect him to question what the steps might be either,  given
he believed  that he was doing what was necessary.  He had received what  appeared to be
genuine fraud alerts to his mobile  followed by an actual voicemail alert to his landline. Mr M
felt he had to act quickly to protect himself. Hes described moving  quickly from panic to
feeling someone was helping  him to protect  his money. I think a reasonable person  would
have acted in a similar way to Mr M in the same circumstances.
Mr M was  not unreasonably  completely convinced by the fraudster that he was speaking
to his bank and acting to keep his account  safe. I dont think his actions fell so far below  the
standard expected of a reasonable person, in the same circumstances as to amount to gross
negligence.
putting things right
As both parties agree, I now direct  Santander  to:
refund  Mr Ms account with the total £9,182.17;
oaccount should be taken of the £1,995.70 already refunded on 10 March 
2017;
oaccount should also be taken of the £190.17  recovered from the receiving 
bank but that was not credited at the time.  Its unclear whether this money 
has been returned as yet;
pay interest on the above  amounts  at the respective account interest rate, from 
the date of the withdrawal to the date of settlement. If Santander deducts tax from 
the interest element of this award, it should provide Mr M with the appropriate tax 
deduction certificate.
pay compensation of £300 to Mr M. This has been a very worrying time for him, 
not receiving a refund for a transaction he didnt authorise, after having  been the 
victim of the scam.
Under PSR 2009,  and the Terms and Conditions of the account which reflect that legislation,  
Santander is entitled to hold Mr M responsible  for the first £50 of his loss. If it intends to do 
this, it can take this amount from the refund before adding the interest element.

I now direct  Santander UK Plc to settle Mr Ms complaint as Ive set out both here and in my 
provisional decision. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.
