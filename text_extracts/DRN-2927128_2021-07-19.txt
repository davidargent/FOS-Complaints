The complaint
Mrs B complains about the way that TransUnion International UK Limited dealt with her data 
query. She wants TransUnion to pay her compensation for the upset caused and the time it 
has taken to
resolve the matter  
What happened
In May 2020, Mrs B contacted TransUnion to say that shed noticed an entry on her credit
file which she didnt recognise.
TransUnion asked for additional information to verify Mrs Bs identity. In early August 2020,
TransUnion referred the data query to the business that had made the entry. I will refer to
that business as E. It told TransUnion that the referral should be sent to the credit referrals
team which had already been dealing with Mrs Bs account. TransUnion didnt do this and
instead closed Mrs Bs data query.
Mrs B chased TransUnion in September 2020. It raised the data query again and went back
to Mrs B in early October 2020. Mrs B then complained about the delays.
TransUnion issued a final response and upheld Mrs Bs complaint confirming that it had 
supressed the entry pending a reply from E. The entry was then removed in late October 
2020.
The investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Bs complaint be upheld. He thought that
TransUnion had dealt with Mrs Bs initial query within a reasonable time frame. The 
investigator agreed that TransUnion shouldve referred the query on to a different 
department within E. But as Mrs Bs proactive contact helped avoid any delays, the 
investigator thought TransUnions apology was enough.
Mrs B was unhappy with the investigators recommendation. She said that TransUnion 
upheld her complaint. Mrs B listed the number of times she contacted TransUnion about the 
entry.
Mrs B wanted compensation for the lack of customer service and her time and upset.  As 
Mrs B didnt agree with the proposed outcome, the complaint came to me.
After considering Mrs Bs complaint I was minded to uphold it so I issued a provisional 
decision on 12 June 2021. 
In summary, I understood that TransUnion wasnt responsible for the original mistake  that 
was down to E. But I thought the way that it handled Mrs Bs data query caused her 
unnecessary upset.
I accepted that TransUnion had to verify Mrs Bs identity when she queried the entry in May
2020. But it took until August 2020 for TransUnion to contact E which seemed quite a long
time to me.
Further and wholly unnecessary delays occurred after TransUnion raised the data query in
August 2020. It failed to act on Es request to contact a different department. And
TransUnion didnt let Mrs B know what had happened.
Mrs B then had to chase TransUnion in September 2020. By this time, four months had
passed since her original enquiry. Mrs B was understandably annoyed and concerned.
Whilst I understood that the underlying problem wasnt caused by TransUnion, I could see
how frustrated Mrs B had become with the delays and failure to take the right steps. This
meant she had to contact TransUnion on several occasions to get things put right. I didnt 
think that this shouldve happened, and I could understand why Mrs B became upset as a
result.
To put things right, I intended to require TransUnion to pay Mrs B £75 compensation for the
upset and inconvenience caused by the way it handled her request.
I appreciated that this was a relatively modest award, but I took account of the fact that once
Mrs B contacted TransUnion in September, it raised a new query and supressed the entry
from her credit file pending a reply. I also didnt have any evidence to suggest that Mrs B
suffered any financial loss as a result of the incorrect data appearing on her credit file for
longer than might have been necessary.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs B accepts my provisional decision and TransUnion hasnt responded. In the 
circumstances, I still consider it reasonable to require TransUnion to pay £75 compensation.
Putting things right
TransUnion International UK Limited should pay Mrs B £75.  
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Bs complaint. In full and final settlement, I require 
TransUnion International UK Limited to pay compensation as outlined above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 August 2021.
