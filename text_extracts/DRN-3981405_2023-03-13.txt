The complaint
Mrs B complains that Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) closed her account without any notification, 
and she has lost out as a result.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs B says that one of her accounts with Lloyds was closed with no notice and put into 
default. She says this has affected her credit record and she is being pursued by a collection 
agency for the debt.
Lloyds says that it sent her three letters by post notifying her that the account was in debt 
and that if she didnt respond it would be closed, put into default and it would take steps to 
recover the debt.
Lloyds says that Mrs B didnt respond. Mrs B says that the post in her area is unreliable.
Lloyds has provided evidence of the three letters it says it sent, and the letters are what I 
expect to see if an account has gone into debt. In my view they give fair notice that if Mrs B 
doesnt respond Lloyds will take the action it did.
I understand Mrs Bs honest recollections that she didnt think she received any of these, 
and that as she lives in a remote area, the post is unreliable. However, as they were 
correctly addressed, I think its more likely than not that she did receive at least one of these 
letters and so I think she should have responded.
So, although I know Mrs B will be disappointed, I dont think Lloyds did anything wrong in 
this matter and I cant uphold her complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 April 2023.
