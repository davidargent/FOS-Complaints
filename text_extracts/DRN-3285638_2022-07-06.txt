The complaint
Ms C complains about a seller dispute with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) Ms 
C also complains her account was limited then closed. 
Ms C is being represented by a third party. 
What happened
Ms C sold an item through her PayPal account that the buyer then raised a dispute on. The 
buyer claimed the item was never sent and PayPal upheld the dispute in the third parties 
favour. As the payment was made in dollars and then converted, when the money was 
returned, Ms C ended up paying more money that shed originally received, due to the 
exchange rate used. 
Following the buyer dispute, PayPal then closed Ms Cs account. It said Ms Cs account 
posed a risk to the business and ended the relationship. 
Ms C complained about both points, as well as the customer service she received when the 
dispute was ongoing. As PayPal didnt uphold the complaint, Ms C via her representative 
brought the complaint to our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Our 
investigator found that PayPals user agreement was clear that any variation in exchange 
rate used to refund a buyer would be passed on to the seller. So, he didnt find PayPal acted 
unfairly when it charged Ms C more than she received. 
Our investigator went on to find that PayPal had again acted within its terms and user 
agreement when it had closed Ms Cs account. Our investigator was satisfied with the 
reasons PayPal had given and didnt uphold this point either. 
Lastly our investigator felt the way in which the third-party buyer dispute was handled was 
fair. He found the information PayPal asked for regarding the tracking information for the 
sold item hadnt been produced, so the claim had been settled correctly. 
Ms C and her representative didnt agree with the investigators view, so the complaints 
been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding this complaint, for largely the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ill explain why
For me to say PayPal did something wrong, Id need to be satisfied that they failed to act 
within the terms of the accounts user agreement and Seller Protection Programme when 
assessing the claim. Or, if I feel like they did work within these, that it was unfair for it to 
accept the third parties claim in the circumstances of this complaint. And in this situation, I 
dont think thats the case.
Its clear that Ms C didnt provide tracking information for the goods she sold, so I dont find 
PayPal have acted unfairly when they have upheld the claim in the buyers favour. I 
understand the representative has also said how unhappy he is that they closed the dispute 
without contacting him. Having considered this point carefully, Im not sure what impact it 
wouldve made to the claim had PayPal continued to communicate with Ms C or her rep. I 
say this as they didnt have evidence of the item being posted, so the outcome was only ever 
going to be that the buyer got a refund. 
In response to Ms Cs complaint regarding the loss of money due to the exchange rate used, 
our investigator has correctly referred Ms C to the user agreement that says.
You alone are (and PayPal is not) responsible for:
Any difference between the cost to the payer of making the original payment and the value 
of the amount returned to the payer (for instance, as a result of transaction exchange rate 
fluctuations) except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment
So, although the amount was different due to the exchange rate used when converting the 
funds back to dollars to send to the buyer, its Ms C responsibility to pay that difference, not 
PayPals. This is in the user agreement Ms C signed up to.
In summary the money was returned through no fault of the buyer or any mistake PayPal 
made. The money was refunded as Ms C didnt send the item that was purchased. So, I 
dont find it fair to go against these terms or ask that the buyer or PayPal lose out through 
the loss in exchange rate.  
Ms Cs representative has questioned the exchange rate and fees used by PayPal when it 
completed the conversion and refund. Its not our services job to tell PayPal who it should 
use to convert its payments, but we can look at whether the process it used to convert the 
payment was fair. Having seen the calculations for the payment reversal, Im satisfied the 
process was completed fairly. Although Ms C may have been able to get a better currency 
rate elsewhere, it was the job of PayPal to refund the buyer through its account platform. 
This is again detailed in the user agreement. 
Other than as set out below and on the Fees Page, if PayPal converts currency, it will be 
completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.
Its common industry practice for businesses like PayPal to check accounts for activity which 
may fall outside their risk appetite, and accounts will often be limited or closed once the 
review is completed. This is what happened with Ms Cs account. 
PayPal, like most account providers has a broad discretion to decide who they want as a 
customer. I wouldnt generally interfere with their decision to close an account unless their 
reasons were unlawful. Although Ms Cs representative has said this doesnt apply to certain 
accounts, Im satisfied it does cover both personal and business accounts. I have looked into 
PayPals reasons, which it has made our service aware of, and I understand why it closed 
this account and dont think it done so unfairly. 
I find PayPal closed Ms Cs account in line with the terms she agreed to when applying for 
the account. Although Ms Cs representative has mentioned several times that he would like 
to see the reason for the closure, PayPal dont have to disclose this. I hope Ms C and her representative can take some reassurance in the fact Ive seen these reasons and Im 
satisfied PayPal havent acted unfairly.
In summary, based on the information Ive seen from both parties, I havent found PayPal 
have done anything wrong when it has handled and resolved the seller/buyer dispute. Im 
also satisfied with the reason it has given for closing Ms Cs account and I wont be asking it 
to take any further action.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 July 2022.
