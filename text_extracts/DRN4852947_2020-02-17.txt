K821x#15Complaint
Miss C says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny)  didnt complete 
appropriate affordability checks when granting  her loans. Miss C says her loan repayments  
were such  a burden that she struggled to meet her existing household commitments,  and 
this led to her having to seek  further  payday  loans from other  lenders.
Background
Miss C took out 18 instalment loans from Sunny between September  2015 and 
September 2016. A summary of Miss Cs borrowing, based  on the information provided to us

Sunny didnt accept  the adjudicators first findings  on Miss Cs complaint. It provided several 
points it wanted  us to consider further.  However,  Sunny  did make an offer for loans  16 - 18 
which wasnt in-line with the adjudicators recommendations.  The offer was to refund the 
interest on all three loans, along with 8% simple interest and to amend Miss Cs credit file. 
Miss C rejected Sunnys offer for loans 16  18.
In our most recent recommendation, we told Sunny that we dont  think  it shouldve provided  
loans 6  18. And from loan 9 Miss Cs pattern of lending suggested Miss C couldnt 
sustainably repay  her loans. 
Ref: DRN48529472Miss C told us that she agrees with our adjudicators  most recent  findings. But Sunny didnt 
respond. As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to reasonably 
conclude Miss C could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Cs complaint.
Miss C has told us she agrees with our adjudicators most recent findings. Because of this, I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  loans 1  5. So, I wont be making a 
finding about these loans.  But these  loans were part of the borrowing relationship  
Miss C had with Sunny,  so I kept these loans in line will still take these into account when 
considering her borrowing history.
Sunny says it enquired about  Miss Cs monthly income and all expenses,  including any 
short-term lending commitments and it also used information from Credit Reference 
Agencies (CRAs). And it was satisfied based  on what it saw that Miss C would be in a 
position to be able to afford the repayments she was committed to making for some of her 
loans.
Ref: DRN48529473But Sunny was required to establish  whether  Miss C could  sustainably  repay her loans  not
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  Miss C could
sustainably make her repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Considering the number  of loans Miss C had taken, the term of the loans and the size of the 
repayments in comparison  to Miss Cs declared income, I think  Sunny shouldve  been 
carrying out a full review  of Miss C financial position by loan 6. This ought to have included  
asking to verify some of the information she had declared about her finances.  But Sunny 
hasnt shown us that it verified Miss Cs income and expenditure and instead chose to rely 
on what Miss C told it, so I dont think that its checks were  reasonable and proportionate by 
this point.
Proportionate checks for loan 6 would most likely have shown Sunny that Miss C had taken 
out a large loan with another lender with a repayment of around £725 at the time this loan 
was approved. In addition  to this, Miss C was still repaying loans 4 and 5 which had only 
been open for a couple of weeks. This meant by loan 6, Miss C had repayments  totalling 
around £86.62  to make to Sunny. But her total monthly commitments  to all short-term 
lenders was in fact over £811.
Whilst Miss C has sent us some of her bank statements  covering her circumstances for her 
first three loans, I havent  seen her bank  statements  showing her circumstances after this. I 
havent seen anything to suggest Miss Cs declared income to Sunny was incorrect. And 
after deducting Miss Cs commitments to short term lenders  that Ive mentioned  above, this 
would have left her with around £648.  But on top of this, Miss C had her regular living  costs  
which she declared to be £725. This included a payment  towards a mortgage, which  Sunny 
was aware of from the results of its credit  checks. This would have left Miss C with no 
disposable income to meet her financial commitments.  
So, in these circumstances,  I dont think Sunny couldve reasonably believed that Miss C 
would've been able to repay loans 6 - 8 without undue difficulty or without the need to borrow  
again.
Ive also looked  at Miss Cs overall pattern of borrowing with Sunny, with a view to see if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And I think Sunny  shouldve  realised this at the time it 
provided loan 9. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss C was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss C had taken out 9 loans within  six months and Miss C had 
been indebted to Sunny for the entire time,  so she was taking  close  to two loans per 
month. So Sunny ought to have realised  it was more likely  than not Miss C was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in 
her finances and that Miss Cs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Miss C wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 18 was 
taken out around a year after Miss Cs first. And it was for a larger amount - £300. 
Miss C had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.
Ref: DRN48529474Miss Cs first loan was for £100  and loan 18 was for £300. At this point Sunny ought 
to have known  that Miss C was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in 
their income but to meet an ongoing need.  
I think that Miss C lost out when Sunny provided  loans 9 - 18 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time and;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Cs
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost
loans
So Im upholding  Miss Cs complaint about  loans 6 - 18 and Sunny should put things right as
detailed below.
Putting things  right  what  Sunny needs to do
Sunny has already made an offer to remove all interest and charges on loans 16  18 along 
with 8% simple interest. But its unclear what amendments Sunny is making in relation  to 
Miss Cs credit file. So in addition to Sunnys  offer, I think  Sunny should  do the following: 
refund  all interest and charges Miss C paid on loans 6 - 15
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement
remove any negative information  about loans 6 - 8 from Miss Cs credit  file
remove loans 9 - 18 from Miss Cs credit file entirely, this is because the period of 
time Miss C owed Sunny money  means  that any information still recorded about 
these loans is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Miss C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one
my final decision
My final decision is that Im partly  upholding Miss Cs complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Miss C as set out above.   
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 March 2020.
