Mr M complained that 118 118 Money hadnt carried out proper checks before lending to 
him.
118 118 Money looked into his complaint. It said it had carried out proper checks and it 
thought the loans were affordable. 
Mr M referred his complaint to us. Our adjudicator upheld the complaint in part. She didnt 
think 118 118 Money had carried out proper checks in respect of Loan1. 
As 118 118 Money didnt agree, the matter has been referred to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions 
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Ms complaint. These two 
questions are:
1. Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr M would be able to repay the loans without experiencing significant adverse 
consequences?
If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
If not, would those checks have shown that Mr M wouldve been able to do so?
2. Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
The rules and regulations in place required 118 118 Money to carry out a reasonable and 
proportionate assessment of Mr Ms ability to make the repayments under this agreement. 
This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or affordability 
check.
The checks had to be borrower-focused  so 118 118 Money had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would be sustainable. In practice this meant that the business had to 
ensure that making the repayments on the loan wouldnt cause Mr M undue difficulty or 
significant adverse consequences. That means he should have been able to meet 
repayments out of normal income without having to borrow to meet the repayments, without 
failing to make any other payment he had a contractual or statutory obligation to make and 
without the repayments having a significant adverse impact on his financial situation.
In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 Money to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr M. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking. Even 
for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Loan 1
When Mr M applied for the loan, he told 118 118 Money that his monthly income was £1,050 
and his expenses were £347. He lived with his parents. 118 118 Money said it carried out a 
credit search and verified Mr Ms income using industry standard checks. 
The credit search revealed Mr M owed a total of £3,364 over five active accounts. Hed 
borrowed up to the limit on his credit card and had gone over the limit recently. He was 
almost up to the limit on his overdraft. In September 2014 Mr M had taken out a loan of 
£400. I think 118 118 Money should have been concerned about his need to borrow again 
so soon after that.Its not clear to me how much 118 118 Money thought Mr M earned based on its check of 
his income. I think it should have carried out further checks to assure itself that Mr M would 
be able to repay the loan in a sustainable way over the 18 month term. Those checks could 
have included obtaining copy payslips to verify his income and/or it could have asked for a 
copy of his bank statements. As I cant see that this was done, I dont think that the checks 
carried out before providing Mr M with this loan were reasonable and proportionate.
For me to be able to find that 118 118 Money shouldnt have given this loan, I have to be 
satisfied that by not carrying out proportionate checks 118 118 Money has caused Mr M a 
loss. In fact his bank statements for the two month period before he took out Loan 1 shows 
that he earned £450 in September 2014 and £755 in October. That means his credit 
commitments including the repayments for Loan 1 would be likely to swallow up a very high 
proportion of his income and leave him very little to live on.
I think that would have rung some alarm bells for 118 118 Money. In this case I think 118 
118 Money should have realised that Mr Ms income was too low for him to be able to make 
the loan repayments and it shouldnt have lent to him. It follows that I dont think it made a 
fair lending decision.
Loan 2
This loan was taken out about six months after Loan 1 had been repaid. By this time Mr Ms 
financial situation had improved somewhat. He told 118 118 Money his monthly income was 
£1,444 and his expenses were £273. He was still living with his parents.
118 118 Money said it verified Mr Ms income. I dont know the result of that check but bank 
statements for the relevant period show Mr Ms income was in line with what hed told 118 
118 Money.
118 118 Moneys credit search showed that his total borrowing had reduced to £1,992 over 
four active accounts. He was still over the limit on his credit card account but his overdraft 
had gone down. Overall, bearing in mind that this loan was for a smaller amount than Loan 
1 with lower monthly repayments and the fact that 118 118 Money would have been 
reassured by the fact Loan 1 had been repaid in full, I think the checks carried out for this 
loan were proportionate.
Ive also thought about whether 118 118 Money acted unfairly in some other way and I 
havent seen any evidence that it did.
Putting things right
As I have concluded 118 118 Money shouldnt have provided Loan 1, it should:
  refund all interest, fees and charges applied to that loan;
pay interest* of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest, fees and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement; and
remove any negative information about Loan 1 from Mr Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mr Ms complaint and require Madison CF UK Limited 
trading as 118 118 Money to put things right for Mr M as set out above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 April 2022.
