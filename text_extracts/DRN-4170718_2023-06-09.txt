The complaint
Mr P complains about a payment into his account with NewDay Ltd  trading as Marbles 
(Marbles).
What happened
Mr P had a Marbles card. On 15 August 2022, he arranged to pay £31 into the account from 
a business account. Marbles didnt count this as a payment and considered the account to 
be in arrears after that. Arrears were reported as £30.09 (21 August 2022 statement); £29.45 
(21 September 2022 statement); £5.45 (23 October statement); £47.12 (21 November 2022 
statement).
Mr P paid in £44 on 13 September 2022; £43.10 on 17 October 2022; but no payments were 
made from November 2022 onwards. On 22 January 2023 Marbles sent a Notice of Sums in 
Arrears with the balance at £833.77 and arrears £128.73.
Mr P complained. He said he had paid in £31 in August 2022 and Marbles shouldve 
accepted that as the contractual payment to the card. Marbles had reported the arrears to 
the credit reference agencies (CRAs) as a result, and that wasnt fair. Because he 
considered the payment of £31 to be a valid one, he then paid the minimum amount each 
month after deducting the £31.
Marbles said the credit of £31 wasnt accepted as a payment to the card as it was from a 
business account. Therefore, the charges and interest applied were correct, as was the 
reporting to the CRAs. As a gesture of goodwill, they refunded two late payment fees of £12 
and two months interest of £45.41.
Mr P brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said it wasnt clear from Marbles terms 
and conditions that a payment from a business account wasnt allowed as a valid payment 
method. So she could understand why Mr P was confused. Mr P had then paid £44 in 
September 2022 and £43.10 in October 2022  and didnt think he was in arrears. Marbles 
had sent their final response on 7 October 2022 to explain their position. 
Because Mr P didnt make any payments at all from November 2022, she said the reporting 
to the CRAs was valid from that time. But up to the point that Marbles advised him of the 
position  in October 2022, then the adverse information reported to CRAs should be 
removed.
Marbles didnt agree. They said the terms and conditions do not list all the methods of 
payments they dont accept. And they do not say they accept payments from business 
accounts. They asked that an ombudsman look at the complaint. And so  it has come to me 
to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P paid in £31 to the account in August 2022. I can see that from the statement. 
In reviewing this complaint, I think Marbles couldve better explained in their final response 
as to why they didnt view the payment of £31 as a valid payment. Thats because - in their 
terms and conditions and on customer statements, they list the acceptable methods of 
payment  e.g. direct debit, mobile app, online banking, bank transfer or debit card. This is 
broadly how most credit card providers operate. Payments into accounts using these 
methods are then recognised as payments to the account and are considered as part (or 
all) of the monthly contractual instalment. 
That said, I looked at Marbles terms and conditions  and they do not say that any other 
payment methods (other than those stated) are not allowed as contractual payments. So  
thats not clear.
Marbles explained to us that any other payment is only considered in the same way as a 
retailer refund  for returned goods, for example  and that wouldnt count as a payment.
I considered this but then noted that the terms and conditions say We may treat this 
(retailer) refund as a payment to your account. So  Im a little confused as to what the true 
position is here.
And so  I think its reasonable to say that it wasnt clear to Mr P why the payment was not 
treated as a payment to the account. And therefore  - I agree that the adverse reporting to 
the CRAs should be deleted up to October 2022. I say that because thats the date when 
Marbles stated their position.
That said, I can see that from the November 2022 statement and thereafter, Mr P made no 
payments at all. Marbles have an obligation to report accurate information to CRAs  and so 
I agree that the reporting of the status of Mr Ps account from November 2022 should remain 
in place. (continued)
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. NewDay Ltd  trading as Marbles must:
Remove adverse information reported to Mr Ps credit file up to and including 
October 2022. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2023.
