The complaint
Mr R complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their decision to limit his 
account.
What happened
Mr R held an account with PayPal, which had a balance of around Â£160. But in May 2021, 
PayPal took the decision to limit this account and as part of this, the funds on the account 
were restricted for up to 180 days. Mr R was unhappy with this, so he raised a complaint.
Mr R didnt think it was fair for PayPal to limit his account and restrict his access to his funds. 
And he thought it was unreasonable for PayPal not to provide a reason for this. So, he 
wanted PayPal to remove the limitation and allow him to withdraw the funds in the account.
PayPal responded and didnt agree. They thought theyd limited Mr Rs account fairly, in line 
with the terms and conditions of the user agreement Mr R entered into. And they explained 
the photo identification Mr R provided couldnt be verified. But they explained if Mr R could 
provide new photo identification, they may be able to appeal the decision to restrict his ability 
to withdraw the funds before 180 days. Mr R remained unhappy with this, so he referred his 
complaint to us.
While the complaint was with our service, Mr R provided alternative photo identification and 
PayPal took the decision to release the funds. But the account remained limited.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. He thought PayPal had acted 
fairly, in line with the terms of the user agreement, when limiting the account. And he didnt 
think PayPal had acted unreasonably by not disclosing the reason as their user agreement 
explained they had no obligation to do so. So, while he recognised Mr Rs frustration, he 
didnt think PayPal needed to do anything more.
Mr R didnt agree as he didnt think it was fair for PayPal to keep him in the dark for an 
extended period of time. As Mr R didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr R. Ive got no doubt it 
wouldve been worrying for Mr R to discover his account had been limited. And I recognised 
it wouldve been made more frustrating for him as he was unable to access his funds without 
being given a reason as to why this was. So, I can appreciate why Mr R would look at the 
actions taken by PayPal and think they were unfair. But for me to agree PayPal have acted 
unfairly, Id need to be satisfied they acted outside of the terms of the agreement Mr R 
entered into. Or, that they had no justifiable reason to limit Mr Rs account in the first place. 
And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
Ive first thought about whether PayPal had a justifiable reason to limit Mr Rs account. Ive 
seen evidence provided by PayPal which shows why they limited Mr Rs account following a 
review. And this satisfies me that PayPals actions were justifiable. Whilst Im unable to 
disclose what PayPals reason was, I want to reassure Mr R Ive made this decision based 
on evidence I have seen whilst considering the inconvenience has been caused.
Ive then thought about whether PayPal have acted within the terms of the user agreement 
when limiting the account and restricting Mr Rs access to his funds. The user agreement 
explains that, where PayPal believe a customer has breached the agreement, they are able 
to limit your account and hold any funds in the reserve account (including, without 
limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by PayPal). So, I think PayPal acted within 
the user agreement when doing both of these.
The user agreement also explains we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental 
authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions. We have no 
obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you. 
Because of this, I dont think PayPal needed to disclose their reasoning behind limiting Mr 
Rs account and Im unable to say they acted unfairly. So, because of the above, I dont think 
PayPal need to do anything more on this occasion.
Im pleased to see that, despite being able to restrict Mr R from withdrawing the funds in his 
account for more than 180 days, they released these funds much earlier after he provided 
alternative photo identification. I think this shows PayPal acting fairly and reasonably, 
ensuring the financial impact on Mr R following their decision was minimised.
I understand this isnt the outcome Mr R was hoping for. And I recognise it doesnt provide 
Mr R with an explanation of why his account was limited. Nor does it re-instate access to that 
account. But I hope it goes some way to providing Mr R assurances that the actions PayPal 
took were fair.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 January 2022.
