K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that FirstRand  Bank  Limited (trading as MotoNovo)  repossessed a car he 
had acquired via a hire purchase prematurely following missed payments, giving him no 
chance to catch  up. He also says the car was then sold for a significantly lower price than its 
market value, and that the amount outstanding  under the agreement was artificially  inflated 
by extra  charges and admin  fees.
Ref: DRN16604762background
In January 2015 Mr C entered into a five year hire purchase agreement for a used car. 
Unfortunately, in 2016, Mr Cs circumstances changed  and he found himself  financially 
struggling. He missed a payment for the car in January 2016 but was able to make that 
payment in February but then missed  the payment that had been due in February itself.
MotoNovo attempted to contact  Mr C via emails, texts and calls but received no response 
from Mr C. Marchs payment, via direct debit, was made  but due to the outstanding arrears  
MotoNovo issued a default notice that expired  in April 2016 for those arrears to be cleared. 
This notice  warned that if the outstanding  amount was not cleared then the agreement could 
be terminated.
MotoNovo continued  to try and make  contact with Mr C via emails,  texts and phone calls but 
received no response. Mr C then failed to make  the payment due in April 2016.  MotoNovo 
says that due to the lack of contact  and the growing  arrears  it had no option but to seek  to 
repossess the car.
The car was repossessed in May 2016  and subsequently sold at auction.  MotoNovo says 
that after the proceeds of the sale had been cleared Mr C was left with a liability of around 
£6,700 to pay. It says the account balance was made up of the outstanding loan capital, 
interest, late payment  fees and repossession costs that had been  incurred. However,  a 
rebate of interest  was then applied to this amount leaving Mr C owing around £5,000. An 
invoice for this amount was sent to Mr C in June 2016.
MotoNovo says that Mr C hasnt made  any payments to the outstanding debt.
Mr C complained to MotoNovo in 2019  about  its handling of the arrears  on his account, the 
repossession of the car and unfair outstanding amount that was being claimed as due.
MotoNovo didnt uphold Mr Cs complaint. It said it had acted fairly  and in accordance  with 
the hire purchase  agreements terms and conditions.
Mr C disagreed with MotoNovos view and complained to this service. Our adjudicator  didnt 
recommend his complaint should be upheld. He said he didnt think MotoNovo had acted  
unfairly, that it was usual  practice to sell repossessed cars at auctions and that MotoNovo 
had been entitled to add admin fees and penalty  charges  as these were in line with the hire 
purchase agreement.
Our adjudicator said he could see from the contact notes that MotoNovo  had made 
numerous unsuccessful  attempts to contact Mr C. Mr C had only called MotoNovo once in 
April 2016 and this was after the expiry  date of the default notice. Our adjudicator said hed 
seen that during this call Mr C had provided his new address and promised to call back  later 
that day to discuss  the arrears. Mr C hadnt then made any further contact with MotoNovo 
until after the car had been repossessed and sold.
Our adjudicator said that although he accepted 2016 had been a stressful time for Mr C it 
was reasonable  to have expected him to have  made  more  contact with MotoNovo than he 
did to discuss the situation with it. 
Our adjudicator said the hire purchase  agreement set out the consequences of missing any 
payment as it clearly  stated that the car could  be repossessed and sold at auction. The hire 
purchase agreement  also set out the admin  fee and late charges that would be applied if 
Ref: DRN16604763payments were not) made when due. He said MotoNovo  had been  entitled to add the 
additional costs  that it had.
Our adjudicator said that selling a repossessed car at an auction was standard practice in 
the industry. He also said that this meant the price  achieved couldnt be guaranteed. He 
didnt think MotoNovo had acted unreasonably  by selling the car in this way.
Mr C disagreed with our adjudicators view. He said he didnt think  the adjudicator had 
properly investigated  his complaint and that, although he hadnt responded to some of the 
calls from MotoNovo, it also hadnt contacted him when it had said it would. 
Mr C says he did offer a payment of £500  to clear the arrears but this hadnt been accepted, 
nor had the bailiffs discussed any option  of paying the arrears and keeping  the car. Mr C 
says MotoNovo didnt  follow a proper legal or regulatory  framework  in terminating the 
agreement and taking  the car back.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen a copy  of the hire purchase agreement  that Mr C signed to say he agreed to be 
bound by its terms and conditions. This agreement sets out that Mr C must make  monthly  
payments for the car and under the heading  Consequences of missing  payments  says if 
any payment is missed then the car can be repossessed and sold at auction. It also says 
under section 8 that there is a right to end the agreement if you default in making any 
payment due to us under this agreement.
It isnt disputed that Mr C missed payments in February and April 2016 so Im satisfied that, 
under this agreement, MotoNovo was entitled to terminate the agreement and repossess the 
car. Ive also seen that MotoNovo issued  a default  notice in March 2016 informing Mr C that 
if payment of the arrears, which at that time amounted to £340  (being made  up of one 
months missed payment and three sets of late charges for other payments that hadnt be 
made on time), wasnt met by a date in early  April 2016 then the agreement  would be 
automatically terminated and the car repossessed. MotoNovo says Mr C didnt respond to 
this notice.
Mr C disputes that MotoNovos contact record with him is accurate but I havent  seen any 
evidence that contradicts  what  is set out in MotoNovos notes. Where evidence  is 
contradictory or missing  then I must  decide what I think is the most likely thing to happen. 
Ive seen that Mr C did make contact with MotoNovo  in early  February 2016 about  the 
missing January payment. He made a manual payment to clear  the outstanding monthly  
amount but didnt  clear the additional  late fee. There is no note that Mr C did not provide any 
new contact details for himself, nor did he raise any change in his financial circumstances. 
Its noted Mr C said that the next monthly  instalment would be made  on time. 
I think if Mr C had raised any changes then its more likely than not that MotoNovo would 
have noted them, particularly as he had made a late payment in January. Ive also seen that 
during March and April 2016 MotoNovo conducted  its own enquiries in an effort to establish 
whether there had been any recorded  changes to Mr Cs residence.
Ref: DRN16604764The direct debit for the February 2016  payment didnt  clear. MotoNovo says it then made 
five attempts to contact Mr C via his mobile,  including texts and it also sent emails. 
MotoNovo says there was no response  and I think its more likely than not that this is correct 
as, although the March  2016 direct debit  was paid, Mr C had a poor history of contact.
MotoNovo made two further unsuccessful attempts  to contact  Mr C, after the date given in 
the default for repayment had passed,  before terminating the agreement.  Again, given the 
history, I think its unlikely that Mr C had made  any contact in this time.
After the decision  to terminate the agreement had been made  Ive seen that MotoNovo tried 
two further times to make contact with Mr C before attempting to take Aprils  direct debit 
payment. This direct debit was returned unpaid and increased the arrears  that were  
outstanding by a further £275. 
MotoNovo says that although it had decided to terminate  the agreement  it would have  
considered taking payments and reversing this decision  up until the point  the car was re-
possessed had Mr C made contact with it. MotoNovo tried once more  to make contact with 
Mr C and again I think its unlikely this was successful as the decision was then taken to 
pass the matter to a third party  to collect the car. 
MotoNovo has recorded Mr C making contact at the end of April 2016. During this call he 
said he had picked up his mail from an old address  and the arrears  were raised. Mr C 
provided a new address  and then said he would call back  to discuss  his circumstances and 
the outstanding payments. However,  there  is no record of any offer by made by Mr C to pay 
off the arrears, though Mr C says he offered £500. Even though  by this time the arrears 
exceeded £500 I think its more likely than not that if Mr C had offered the lump sum this 
would have been recorded  by MotoNovo.  I think MotoNovo,  given its efforts to contact Mr C, 
would have preferred not to have repossessed the car unless it considered necessary. 
MotoNovo says Mr C didnt call back, as he had said he would, and that it therefore arranged  
for the car to be repossessed around one week later. 
Mr C says he although he ignored some calls from MotoNovo he did make contact and it 
was MotoNovo that should have done  more but, looking  at the evidence, I disagree. Im 
satisfied Mr C only made contact twice which was in early  February  and late April 2016. I 
dont think its likely  that in either  call he explained his circumstances or made any offer to 
clear the arrears. And although I appreciate this was not an easy  time for Mr C I think  it 
would be reasonable to have expected  him to have  either responded more  to MotoNovo, or 
to have initiated  contact in order to discuss things. I cant  fairly say that MotoNovo should 
have acted differently  in the circumstances. 
Ive seen a note that MotoNovo instructed the third party collecting the car that, if Mr C made 
an offer to clear the arrears and could satisfy the agents that the agreement  was affordable, 
then it could accept  this and not take the car. Mr C says this wasnt raised with him by the 
company that collected the car. But I dont think that was unfair as MotoNovo had been clear  
it wasnt an offer that was to be made  to Mr C but rather  it was for Mr C to proactively 
approach the agents and raise it himself.  
I dont think its likely,  given the history that Mr C was in a position where he could have 
cleared all the arrears  which exceeded  the £500  he said he could have paid, and for him 
also to be able to show that, going forward, the agreement was affordable.
Ref: DRN16604765Mr C says the car was sold substantially  below its market value. Ive seen that MotoNovo 
investigated the guide price for the car and placed  a reserve  price  on it at auction  taking into 
account the estimated values. Although the reserve price wasnt quite reached the actual  
sales price wasnt very far below it. Looking myself at the guide  prices for the car I can see 
there was a large range depending on its condition and mileage, and the car did fetch more  
than the lower prices  quoted. 
As already explained, sale at auction is the usual practice in these circumstances as it 
ensures a car is sold quickly.  It also says in the hire purchase agreement  this will be method 
used, so I cant say it was unreasonable for MotoNovo to take this action. 
Mr C says that the outstanding balance has been artificially increased by adding an admin  
fee and other charges. But looking at the hire purchase agreement Ive seen that there is a 
schedule setting out what charges will be applied if there are late payments and if the car is 
then later repossessed. So, I cant reasonably say that MotoNovo wasnt  entitled to add 
them and that Mr C wasnt  aware they would  be added  in these circumstances.
So, for the reasons given above  Im not upholding Mr Cs complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above Im not upholding Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 June  2020.
