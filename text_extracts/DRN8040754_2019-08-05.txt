K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, (QQ)  and
Pounds to Pocket,  (P2P),  gave him loans  that he couldnt afford to repay.
background
Mr C was given 12 payday  loans by QQ between May 2009 and April 2014. And P2P gave 
him six instalment  loans  and six refinance  loans  (Loans 11a to 11c and 13a to 13c) between  
February 2012 and July 2015. Most of the instalment and refinance loans (except Loan 16) 
were repayable by 12 monthly instalments. Loan 16 was repayable  by 11 monthly 
instalments. All the loans have been repaid although Mr C needed  a payment arrangement  
to repay  Loan  18. A summary of the loans taken out by Mr C is shown below:

CashEuroNet didnt  consent to Loans 1 to 9 being  considered and Mr C agreed to withdraw 
these from his complaint.   
CashEuroNet said in its response to this service  that it should  have  looked  into Mr Cs full 
financial position for Loans 12, 14 and 15. If its checks had gone further it would have found 
that Mr C wasnt in a financial position to sustain  the loans for QQ and P2P at the same time. 
So it offered  to refund all interest and charges paid on Loans  12, 14 and 15 and pay 8% 
interest on those refunds  and remove adverse entries about  those  loans from Mr Cs credit 
file.
Mr C rejected CashEuroNets offer.
Ref: DRN80407542 
The adjudicator recommended that the complaint  about Loans 10, 11, 13, and 16 to 18 be 
upheld in addition  to the offer CashEuroNet had already made about Loan 12, 14 and 15. 
CashEuroNet disagreed and responded to say, in summary, that it had conducted adequate 
and proportionate affordability  assessments. It said that the adjudicator hadnt provided 
information about Mr Cs income and expenses  to support his view. It also said that Mr C 
had paid five of his loans  with P2P earlier than the contractual due date. CashEuroNet also 
said that the mere  number  of loans was insufficient to conclude that the loans were  
unsustainable. The lender also provided  this service with a document which  is titled  CEU 
Lending Criteria and Proportionate Checks to show its entire lending process. CashEuroNet 
had also said that starting  from 1 March 2015,  it had implemented  an affordability 
assessment that was consistent with the Financial Conduct Authoritys (FCA) Handbook. 
And as a result it had carried out enhanced checks prior to Loans 16 to 18. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
I note that Mr C has withdrawn his complaint about  Loans 1 to 9. However,  Ive still included 
them in the table above, because although Mr C has withdrawn his complaint about  those 
loans, they form part of his borrowing history with CashEuroNet. So I propose to take 
Loans 1 to 9 into account  when assessing  Mr Cs other loans.
As CashEuroNet  has offered to settle  Loans  12, 14 and 15, I wont  make any findings about 
those loans here. But I shall order CashEuroNet to provide redress  for those  loans later in 
this decision. 
When CashEuroNet first lent to Mr C the regulator was the Office  of Fair Trading (OFT). For 
Loans 10 to 14 the OFTs relevant guidance included its guidance on irresponsible lending 
(ILG). From 1 April 2014 onwards the regulator  was the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  
and relevant regulations and guidance  included  its Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC).  
The ILG and CONC contained similar guidance for lenders  about  responsible  lending.  
With regard to CashEuroNets  assessments  of Loans 16 to 18 after 1 March 2015, this 
service has addressed this specific point  by it in previous decisions. I would remind 
CashEuroNet at this point of the FCA guidance on how complaints are to be dealt with 
promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular DISP  1.3.2A [G] which  says 
that businesses  procedures for complaint  handling  should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
Ref: DRN80407543(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA, other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
So my decision will focus on the specifics of Mr Cs complaint and what both parties have 
said about this.
CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required to 
establish whether  Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the CONC defines sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties 
and in particular  the consumer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
CashEuroNet did a number of checks before it lent to Mr C. It asked  him for details of his 
income. And from Loan 16 it also asked about Mr Cs expenditure. CashEuroNet  also 
Ref: DRN80407544checked Mr Cs employment and housing status. From the information CashEuroNet 
gathered, Mr C was employed and paid rent. 
CashEuroNet also checked Mr Cs credit  file before agreeing to the loans. CashEuroNet  
hasnt provided  us with the results of its credit  checks. 
As Ive said above,  I propose to take Loans 1 to 9 into account  when assessing Loans 10, 11 
to 11c, 13 to 13c and 16 to 18. I note that by Loan 10, Mr C had been  borrowing almost 
continuously for around 33 months  and mostly in quick  succession  from CashEuroNet. I note 
that there  was a gap of around  four months between Loans  4 and 5. But I dont think it would 
have been reasonable  for CashEuroNet  to have seen this gap as an indication that Mr Cs 
finances had moved  on from whatever situation  had required his previous loans. There  had 
been an established period of borrowing before Loan 5 which  I think CashEuroNet ought to 
have been concerned about irrespective of the length of pause between Loans  4 and 5. 
Loans 8 and 9 had been taken out on the day Mr Cs previous loans had been repaid. Prior 
to Loan 9, Mr C had needed  a number of loan extensions to repay  some  of his loans. And 
Loan 10 was taken out only five days after Loan 9 was repaid 
So looking  at the overall pattern of the lending chain since  Loan  1, I think  that by the time of 
Loan 10, CashEuroNet should  reasonably  have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  
or otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet should  have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further lending. The amounts Mr C was borrowing had been  mostly increasing 
and CashEuroNet  ought to have realised  it was likely his indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably. By the time Mr C asked for Loan 10 hed been borrowing from CashEuroNet 
for around  33 months  and he wasnt making any inroads into the amount he owed the 
lender. By that time Mr C had paid a considerable amount of interest to CashEuroNet  to 
effectively service a debt over an extended period.
I can see that as CashEuroNet didnt stop lending at this point, Mr C went  on to take out high 
cost loans for a further 41 months.
I think that Mr C lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from Loan 10 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the length of time that Mr C had been taking out short term loans was likely  to have 
had negative implications on Mr Cs ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
The fact that the loans  were  repaid does not mean that they were  repaid sustainably, 
or without causing Mr C undue difficulty.
I should add Ive considered the other points CashEuroNet made in response to the 
adjudicators view. 
I note that CashEuroNet said that it should  have seen information  about Mr Cs income and 
expenses to support  the adjudicators view. But CashEuroNet will know  from this services  
approach and previous final decisions that the question of whether it responsibly  lent loans 
Ref: DRN80407545to consumers isnt considered  strictly on whether the consumer could afford to repay on a 
pounds and pence calculation only. CashEuroNet will know  that this service  sometimes  also 
considers the lending  pattern as well to see if it ought to have realised that the lending had 
become unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
CashEuroNet said that Mr C paid five of his six loans with P2P early.  But I think  this 
behaviour should have  caused the lender some  concerns. I think that when a consumer 
continuously repays loans early,  this should  raise  concerns with his lender that the consumer 
might not be managing repayments sustainably and that he may be dependent on short  term 
lending to meet an ongoing need.
CashEuroNet has provided this service with a document which is titled  CEU Lending Criteria 
and Proportionate  Checks,  which isnt case-specific. This service has responded to 
CashEuroNets submission of this document on many previous occasions  and so Ill say no 
more about it here.
CashEuroNet also said that the mere number  of loans is an insufficient basis  to conclude  
that the loans  were  unsustainable. But, it will know from previous decisions (as well as 
whats set out on our website) that there are cases where this service considers the overall  
lending pattern and not just the affordability  of each  loan.  When a consumer borrows 
numerous loans  over a long period of time,  its most likely that the loans arent being used 
for their intended purpose of temporary  cash flow problems. As CashEuroNet  will know,  the 
FCA made it clear in a recent letter to CEOs of high cost lending  firms  that a high volume of 
relending..may be symptomatic of unsustainable  lending patterns. And I think that is the 
case here.
So I think that CashEuroNet needs  to pay Mr C some compensation in relation to 
Loans 10,11 to 11c,13 to 13c, and 16 to 18 as well as what it has already  offered in relation 
to Loans 12, 14 and 15. So CashEuroNet should  put things right as follows.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on Loans 10 to 18;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 10 onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  Loans 10 onwards should  be removed 
from Mr Cs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this 
complaint, I order CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid and Pounds  to Pocket, to:
1.Refund all interest  and charges Mr C paid on Loans 10 to 18;
Ref: DRN804075462.Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;  and
3.The number of loans  taken from Loan 10 onwards  means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  Loans 10 onwards should  be removed 
from Mr Cs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 September 2019.
