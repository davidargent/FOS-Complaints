The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc said there was no money available in 
his account. He said that was wrong, and a system error. He also complained about how 
NatWest spoke to him on the phone.
What happened
At the end of May 2019, Mr S rang NatWest because he wasnt able to access any money 
on his account. He said hed kept a careful eye on his account, he was checking the 
balance, and there ought to have been money in there. He needed that money for food.
Mr S said that hed downgraded his account so that transactions couldnt go through unless 
he had funds in the account. So he shouldnt have been in this situation. He thought 
something had gone wrong, and it was NatWests fault. 
Mr S said that NatWest had passed him around different teams when he rang about this 
problem, which wasnt helpful. Mr S has a brain injury and PTSD. He told us he struggles 
with his mental health.
Mr S complained about the language that a call handler used. He said he was discriminated 
against, as the call handler said he was different.
Mr S also said NatWest had promised to resolve his complaint faster than it did. 
NatWest said that Mr S had no money left because of some pending transactions. There 
was nothing it couldve done about that at the time. It thought it had responded to his 
complaint within the required timescale. 
NatWest listened to the call where Mr S said hed been called different and the call handler 
had said that Mr S was different from other customers in respect of his personal 
circumstances. NatWest said that it didnt think the call handler was being derogatory. 
NatWest didnt think it had done anything wrong. But it had paid Mr S £150 to apologise as 
he felt that its staff had been unhelpful and unsympathetic. NatWest said it wouldnt do any 
more than this now. 
Our investigator didnt uphold this complaint. He said that its up to shops and businesses 
who accept Mr Ss card, when they process those payments. If they dont process the 
payment straight away, then theres nothing that NatWest can do. He thought that the 
problem had just been caused by pending transactions. He didnt think that there had been a 
system error at NatWest. 
Our investigator thought that NatWest had responded to the complaint in the correct 
timeframe. He also said he thought Mr S had been spoken to in a dignified manner by both 
call handlers. Mr S was unhappy about some of the language used, but our investigator didnt think that any deliberate offence was intended by the tone and manner that this was 
said. He thought that NatWest had done enough to put things right on this occasion. 
Mr S didnt agree. He said hed been paid more for a single mistake. He wanted NatWest to 
at least double the compensation it had paid. Because Mr S didnt agree with our 
investigator, the case was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked carefully at the transactions on Mr Ss account. And I also think the reason Mr S 
didnt have any money available to him was because of pending transactions. Mr S says this 
is a problem with NatWests systems, but I cant see anything to make me think that. 
It is up to shops and businesses when they take a payment. They dont all do that straight 
away, at the time when Mr S uses his card. And if they dont claim a payment straight away, 
theres nothing NatWest can do to speed that up. Thats why sometimes money isnt taken 
out of Mr Ss account straight away when he uses his card. 
Once NatWest knows that Mr S has used his card, it has to keep that money safe for the 
shop or business hes bought something from. Thats why sometimes money is held, as 
pending transactions, and Mr S cant spend it. 
Most banks work like this. NatWest isnt doing anything unusual here. And I dont think its 
doing anything wrong. I dont think that NatWest made a mistake when it told Mr S that he 
didnt have any money available to spend on 31 May. 
Ive listened to the discussion that Mr S had with the complaints handler on 31 May about 
this. I think this could have been explained better to Mr S on the phone. 
Mr S said NatWest had agreed to resolve his complaint much faster than it did. NatWest did 
respond to Mr S within the timescales that our service sets for complaints, but I note that it 
did so after Mr S contacted it. I think its unfortunate if someone made a mistake about this.  
NatWest then rang Mr S to discuss his complaint and his future banking needs. Mr S wasnt 
happy about some of the language used on that call. He said that NatWest was 
discriminating against him. 
Its not the role of the Financial Ombudsman Service to make a decision on whether theres 
been a breach of the Equality Act 2010. Thats for a court or tribunal to decide. So I wont 
make a decision on that.
I do have to say whether I think NatWest treated Mr L unfairly or unreasonably. And I dont 
think that the language used on this call was unreasonable or unfair. Like our investigator, I 
dont think that the caller intended to offend Mr L. NatWest has said its sorry if it got this 
wrong, and Mr S was offended. 
I think that there were opportunities that NatWest has missed here to provide Mr S with a 
better service. But NatWest has already paid Mr S £150 in compensation. I think thats the 
right amount to make up for what has happened here. 
I know NatWest has paid Mr S the same amount for other problems that he says were less 
serious than this one. But our service doesnt decide on amounts in the same way as NatWest. I have to be consistent with other awards our service makes. And I dont think it 
would be consistent to tell NatWest to pay Mr S some more money now. 
I know Mr S will be disappointed, but I dont think NatWest has to pay him any more money. 
And because of that, I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 May 2020.
