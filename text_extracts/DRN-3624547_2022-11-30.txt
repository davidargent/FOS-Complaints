The complaint
Mr M complains about the service provided by Madison CF UK Limited trading 118 118 
Money when settling his loan. 
What happened
On 4 March 2022 118 118Money gave a settlement figure to Mr M for a loan in his name. 
118 118 Money says the settlement figure was correct at the time of issue, but Mr M went on 
to raise a direct debit indemnity claim for his 28 February 2022 payment. When that payment 
was refunded, the loan fell into arrears. 
On 22 March 2022 118 118 Money received a settlement cheque from Mr M. In the days that 
followed, Mr M tried to get updates from 118 118 Money to confirm it had received his 
cheque and was in the process of settling the account. Mr Ms told us he was given a 
generic timescale of seven to ten working days for cheques to be processed. Mr Ms also 
told us he called numerous times to try and get information from 118 118 Moneys finance 
department but wasnt called back as promised. 
The cheque was cashed and Mr Ms loan was partially repaid on 1 April 2022. But due to the 
direct debit indemnity claim, the loan remained one month in arrears so couldnt be closed. 
Mr M complained to 118 118 Money and it sent him a final response on 11 May 2022. 118 
118 Money apologised about difficulties when trying to call and said higher call numbers had 
impacted its service. 118 118 Money acknowledged there were times when an automated 
message asking customers to call back was played during calls. And 118 118 Money also 
confirmed call backs didnt always happen as promised and that calls are sometimes 
disconnected. 118 118 Money apologised and offered Mr M £50 for the distress and 
inconvenience caused. 
118 118 Money also said Mr Ms loan was reporting arrears on his credit file due to the 
payment hed reclaimed. 118 118 Money offered to remove the missed payment if Mr M 
repaid the outstanding balance. Mr M went back to 118 118 Money and agreed a payment 
plan to clear the missed payment in instalments. As a result, 118 118 Money withdrew its 
offer to amend Mr Ms credit file once the reclaimed payment was repaid. 118 118 Money  
made a final offer of £75 to resolve Mr Ms complaint.
Mr M referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
thought 118 118 Money had dealt with Mr Ms complaint fairly and didnt ask it to do anything 
else. 
In response to the investigator, Mr M asked if theyd listened to all his calls with 118 118 
Money. Mr Ms explained that, if they had, the investigator wouldve heard call backs being 
promised, but not received. Mr M also repeated his concern that the phone lines were closed 
at times and that he found it difficult to settle the outstanding balance with 118 118 Money 
over the phone. Mr M also said he was aware of the timescales for processing a cheque but 
wanted a specific update concerning his funds. Mr M asked to appeal, so his complaint has 
been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Ms been very clear that he called 118 118 Money many times in the days after his 
settlement cheque was sent. Mr Ms asked us to listen to all his calls to verify he wasnt 
called back as promised. 118 118 Money hasnt sent us all its calls with Mr M. But it has sent 
us its contact notes that show numerous calls from Mr M, with a view to getting an update to 
his funds. I want to explain that I dont doubt what Mr M has told us about call backs not 
being received. I understand Mr M wanted an update concerning his funds and whether his 
loan had been repaid. Ive taken this into account when deciding how to fairly resolve Mr Ms 
complaint. 
Mr Ms also told us about instances where the phone lines were simply closed. 118 118 
Moneys confirmed there have been times where caller numbers were heavier than normal. 
And that led to a suspension of inbound calls. Again, I dont doubt having to call back was 
inconvenient for Mr M. But, I have to balance that against 118 118 Moneys ability to answer 
calls in a reasonable time. And 118118 Moneys confirmed it was experiencing unusually 
high call numbers which impacted its ability to perform. Whilst I appreciate the temporary 
closure of phone lines caused some inconvenience, Im satisfied it was reasonable given the 
circumstances. 
Calls were also dropped part way through. 118 118 Money has confirmed technical issues 
can cause this issue to occur. I can understand how frustrating this mustve been for Mr M. 
Ive taken Mr Ms comments into account when deciding how to proceed. 
The focus of Mr Ms case is the difficulties he found getting updates about his cheque funds. 
Mr Ms told us he simply wanted to find out if the cheque had been received and if it was 
being processed. I know those things sound simple, but 118 118 Money has confirmed its 
not information that was immediately available to its call agents. Instead, the agents 
provided general timescales for cheque processing. 
The information Mr M wanted had to come from the finance team which isnt customer 
facing. From the information Ive seen, I think there was a misunderstanding between 
departments concerning whether the finance team could contact Mr M directly. And that led 
to a delay in the information he wanted being provided. But, again, I dont doubt what Mr Ms 
told us about not receiving promised call backs. 
118 118 Money says it withdrew its offer to amend Mr Ms credit file as he wasnt able to 
clear the reclaimed final payment in full. Instead, an arrangement to repay it over three 
months was agreed. As the final loan payment was reclaimed and wasnt paid back in full, 
Im satisfied its fair for 118 118 Money to reflect that on Mr Ms credit file. 
Mr Ms told us he doesnt agree £75 fairly reflects the level of trouble and upset caused. I 
appreciate Mr M found it difficult to speak with 118 118 Money at times and wasnt called 
back as promised on various occasions. But I think that, in part, reflects the nature of his 
query and fact the information was only available to the finance team. And whilst I agree the 
level of service was poor at times, the situation was resolved without unreasonable delay 
when the cheque funds cleared and were applied to the loan balance. Whilst I understand 
Mr M is likely to disagree, Im satisfied the £75 offer 118 118 Money has made reflects the 
level of distress and inconvenience caused and is fair in all the circumstances. My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint because Madison CF UK Limited trading 
as 118 118 Money has already made an offer that is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2023.
