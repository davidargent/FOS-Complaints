Mr and Mrs B say Central Credit  mis-sold  them two payment protection insurance  (PPI)  
policies.
The PPI policies were  sold alongside  two secured loans. 
The first loan was taken in July 2005.  The loan was for £20,000.  And Mr and Mrs B 
borrowed an extra £3,200  to pay for the policy. The type of policy  Mr and Mrs B were sold is 
called a single premium PPI policy  and Mr and Mrs B had to pay interest  on the extra  they 
borrowed.
The second  loan was taken in February 2006.  The loan was for £10,000. And Mr and Mrs B 
borrowed an extra £1,680  to pay for the policy. Again, they were sold a single premium PPI 
policy  meaning  they had to pay interest  on the extra they borrowed.
background
I issued my provisional decision on 8 March  2019.  A copy of my provisional  decision is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional decision sets out the background to this complaint. It explains why I think  the 
complaint should  be upheld  and what I think Central Credit should  pay to put things right.
Mr and Mrs B, through their representative, accepted  my provisional  findings. Central Credit 
didnt respond.
Neither party has provided me with anything further  to consider.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has given  me anything else to consider, I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional findings. So I now confirm those findings.
putting things right
Ive recalculated what Central Credit owes Mr and Mrs B. Ive used the same  method as 
before which  I set out within  my provisional  decision.  
In total, Central  Credit  should pay £11,590.44 (before tax) as it stands at the date of this 
decision.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above and in my provisional decision, Central Credit should 
pay £11,590.44 (before tax) as it stands at the date of this decision. 
After tax, it should pay £10,636.60 to Mr and Mrs B and £953.84  to HM Revenue & 
Customs.
Ref: DRN06583122If Mr and Mrs B accept  my final decision, it will be legally binding on both sides.  
Central Credit must then pay Mr and Mrs B promptly and no later than 28 days  after the date 
Mr and Mrs B accept  this decision  should  they wish to do so. 
After 28 days, it should add 8% simple interest per year for every extra day until the 
compensation is paid.  This will be £1.50  per day before tax  so £1.20 per day should be 
paid to Mr and Mrs B and £0.30  should be passed to HM Revenue & Customs.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask 
Mr and Mrs B to accept or reject my decision before 12 May 2019.

complaint
Mr and Mrs B say Central Credit mis-sold them two payment protection  insurance (PPI) policies.
The PPI policies were  sold alongside two secured loans. 
The first loan was taken in July 2005.  The loan was for £20,000. And Mr and Mrs B borrowed an extra 
£3,200 to pay for the policy. The type of policy  Mr and Mrs B were sold is called a single premium PPI 
policy  and Mr and Mrs B had to pay interest on the extra they borrowed.
The second  loan was taken in February 2006. The loan was for £10,000. And Mr and Mrs B borrowed 
an extra £1,680 to pay for the policy. Again, they were sold a single  premium PPI policy  meaning 
they had to pay interest on the extra they borrowed.
background
Mr and Mrs B, through a representative, complained to Central Credit  that the PPI policies had been 
mis-sold. They didnt receive a response, and so brought the complaint  to our service.
As the matter  hasnt been resolved, its been passed to me for a formal  decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive provisionally considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and Ive taken  
this into account in deciding  Mr and Mrs Bs case. 
Ive provisionally decided to uphold  Mr and Mrs Bs complaint.  Ill explain why.
As Central Credit didnt respond to Mr and Mrs B  and hasnt  responded  to our service  there isnt 
much in the way of any evidence available from the time of the sales of the PPI policies. 
So I dont know how the policies  were presented to Mr and Mrs B. And I cant know for sure whether 
Mr and Mrs B were told that they had a choice about taking the policies  and whether  the policies were 
presented as optional.
what information  do I have?
I have seen the relevant policy documents to Mr and Mrs Bs PPI policies in 2005  and 2006. They  
were two types of PPI policy available   a three star policy and a five star policy. 
Both types of policies covered accident,  sickness and unemployment for up to 12 months per claim. 
And the five star policy  included life and hospital cover. 
From looking  at the policy documents for both policies the cover would  terminate 60 months after the 
start date. 
And if the PPI policies were  cancelled a consumer would have  only got a limited refund.
Also, the lender of the credit  (who wasnt the seller) has provided to this service the credit agreements 
for both loans.
So Ive used  this information  in reaching my decision.
Ref: DRN06583124With single premium policies like the ones Mr and Mrs B took out, as explained earlier,  Mr and Mrs B 
were borrowing more to pay for the policy upfront.  This additional borrowing was then to be repaid 
over the term of the loan  and it attracted interest. 
So it was really important for Central Credit  to explain how this type of policy was paid for and what  
the ongoing cost would be over the term of the loans.  So it needed to explain,  in a clear, fair and not 
misleading way what the total borrowing of the PPI and interest,  over the term of the loans,  would be. 
And what the monthly amount of the PPI would be. This was so Mr and Mrs B could make a fully 
informed decision about the PPI.
As Ive explained, there isnt any information from the time of sale, other than the credit agreements 
so I dont know how Central Credit explained the costs of the policy  to Mr and Mrs B. 
But the credit agreements dont set out the information  about  the cost of the policies.  So without 
anything further, I dont  have any evidence to suggest Central Credit gave Mr and Mrs B clear enough 
information about the cost of the policies.  
The credit  agreement  shows how much  extra Mr and Mrs B were borrowing to pay for PPI. But it 
doesnt say how much extra  they would  have to pay each month or how much extra  interest they will 
pay because of the PPI. And I cant  see that they were told how much theyd have to pay in total for 
the PPI.
Also, single premium  policies were often inflexible.   What I mean by this is that if Mr and Mrs B 
cancelled the policy early,  whether through settling  their loan early or re-financing the loan, they would 
have only got a limited  refund. Mr and Mrs Bs policies  likely had the same limitation.  Again, this is 
important information that needed to be highlighted to Mr and Mrs B.
The term of the both loans  was for 120 months. In my view it was possible that they might  repay the 
loans early. Because the policy only gave a limited refund if it was cancelled early, I dont think it was 
flexible enough.  
 
Also, the cover would have  stopped after 60 months, so Mr and Mrs B, if they wanted to continue to 
be protected would need to take out another PPI policy. Meaning they would still be paying for their 
original policies as the costs were over the terms of the loans while also having to pay for another 
policy.
All things considered, given the above failings, I dont  think Mr and Mrs B would have bought the 
policy if Central Credit  had made clear it might not be right for them.  
So, it follows that I think  Mr and Mrs B have lost out because  of what Central Credit did wrong.  
putting things  right
For the reasons  Ive explained above, Central  Credit  needs  to put Mr and Mrs B in the position theyd 
be in now if they hadnt taken out any PPI. 
The loan agreements show Mr and Mrs B borrowed  extra  to pay for the PPI policies. 
For loan 1, they borrowed an extra £3,200 to pay for PPI.
For loan 2, they borrowed an extra £1,680 to pay for PPI.
The lender tells us both of the secured loans  were redeemed on 19 February  2008.  
For loan 1, Ive worked out that between July 2005 and February  2008 Mr and Mrs B paid an 
extra £1,438.01 because of the extra theyd borrowed.i
Ref: DRN06583125For loan 2, Ive worked out that between February 2006  and February  2008 
Mr and Mrs B paid an extra £538.65 because of the extra theyd borrowed.ii
But the amount they owed in February 2008 was more than it would  have been if they hadnt been 
sold the PPI policies.  Ive assumed the secured  loans were redeemed  because 
Mr and Mrs B remortgaged. And when they remortgaged  Ive worked out Mr and Mrs B had to borrow  
£4,234.13 more  than they would  have  done  because of the PPI policies.iii
I dont know the term of the February  2008 mortgage, the applicable interest rate(s) or if 
Mr and Mrs B have remortgaged since. So Ive assumed  the term was the number  of years left on the 
February 2006 mortgage (eight years) and Mr and Mrs B havent remortgaged since. And Ive used 
the standard variable  rate of the largest mortgage provider in the country to work out how much extra 
Mr and Mrs B have paid each month.iv
Having done so I think Mr and Mrs B have paid an extra £4,844.56  since February 2008.v
So in total Mr and Mrs B have  paid £6,821.22 for the PPI policies.vi 
So I think Central  Credit should:
Refund the extra  Mr and Mrs B have  paid towards the PPI policies.
As Ive explained above, Ive worked  this out to be £6,821.22.
Pay simple interest on a yearly basis on the extra Mr and Mrs B have paid each month. The 
rate of interest is 8% a year.vii
Ive worked this out to be £4,716.92.  HM Revenue & Customs requires Central Credit  to take 
off tax from this interest. So Central Credit needs to pay Mr and Mrs B £3,773.54 and HMRC 
£943.38.
If Mr and Mrs B made any successful claims  on the policies, Central  Credit can take off what they got 
for the claims  from the amount it owes them.  Mr and Mrs B should  therefore  let me know if they made 
any claims on the policies in their reply  to this provisional decision.
If Central Credit or Mr and Mrs B have more accurate  information about what happened  when and 
after they redeemed the secured loans  in February 2008 they can let me know  and Ill use this 
information to recalculate the compensation due.
If Central Credit wishes  to make an offer to settle the complaint in accordance with the alternative  
approach to redress provisions set out at DISP  App 3.7 instead of the proposed settlement, please  
confirm the terms  of the offer and explain  why Central  Credit considers the alternative approach to 
redress to be a fair and reasonable approach to compensate Mr and Mrs B in the particular  
circumstances of this complaint.
my provisional  decision
Taking account of everything Ive seen  so far, I think the PPI policies was mis-sold  and 
Mr and Mrs Bs complaint  should be upheld.
For these  reasons, my provisional  decision  is that Central Credit  needs to pay £11,538.14 before tax 
as it stands at the date of this provisional  decision. After tax it should pay £10,594.76 to Mr and Mrs B 
and £943.38 to HM Revenue & Customs.
I invite both parties to respond by 8 April 2019.  I will then consider any further information I receive 
and look to issue  my final decision.

i Mr and Mrs B borrowed the money over 10 years, and the interest rate was a variable rate 7% above 
the Barclays  Bank Base Rate. Ive used this interest rate to work out what  Mr and Mrs B paid each 
month because of PPI. So I think Mr and Mrs B have paid £1,438.01 towards  the July 2005 secured  
loan because  of PPI: £938.33 in interest and £499.68 towards the extra they borrowed.
ii Mr and Mrs B borrowed the money over 10 years, and the interest rate was a variable rate 6% 
above the Barclays  Bank  Base Rate. Ive used this interest rate to work out what Mr and Mrs B paid 
each month  because  of PPI. So I think Mr and Mrs B have paid £538.65 towards the February 2006  
secured loan because  of PPI: £352.48 in interest  and £186.17 towards  the extra they borrowed.
iii The sum of £1,507.15  and £2,726.98  is £4,234.13.  This is the combined remaining cost of both 
policies on 19 February 2008, as worked  out below:
The first secured loan started in July 2005.  Mr and Mrs B made their first payment  on 7 August 2005 
and made  their contractual repayments. They borrowed an extra  £3,200 to pay for the PPI policy and 
Ive worked out that they still owed  £2,700.32 when they redeemed the secured  loan on 
19 February 2008. The redemption letter confirms a redemption penalty equal to one months  interest 
will be charged. The interest payable  for the following month  would have been  £26.66.  The sum of 
£26.66 and £2,700.32  is £2,726.98.
The second  secured loan started in February 2006. Mr and Mrs B made their first payment on 
21 March  2006 and made their contractual repayments.  They  borrowed an extra £1,680 to pay for the 
PPI policy  and Ive worked out that they still owed £1,493.83 when they redeemed the secured loan 
on 19 February 2008. The redemption letter confirms a redemption penalty equal to one months  
interest will be charged. The interest payable for the following month would have  been £13.32. The 
sum of £13.32 and £1,493.83  is £1,507.15.
iv The largest mortgage providers  standard rate was: 
7.5% from January 2008  to February 2008
7.25% from March 2008 to April 2008
7% from April 2008 to October 2008
6.5% in November  2008
5% in December 2008
4% in January 2009
3.5% in February 2009
3% in March 2009
2.5% from 1 April 2009 to date
If Central Credit or Mr and Mrs B have better information about the actual interest rate charged,  they 
should let me know in reply  to this provisional  decision.
v Ive used the interest rate Ive explained  in note [4] to work out how much Mr and Mrs B have paid 
each month.  Again Ive assumed they made their contractual repayments.
vi This is the sum of the payments they made towards loan 1 between  August 2005 and February 
2008 (£1,438.01) and towards loan 2 between March 2006 and February 2008 (£538.65)  and since 
February 2008 (£4,844.56).
Ref: DRN06583127vii Simple interest is calculated by multiplying each  overpayment by the daily interest rate (8% divided  
by 365) and then by the number of days since each overpayment was made. Ive worked out the 
overpayments were:
Overpayments on loan 1:
£45.59 a month  from August  2005 to July 2006
£46.00 a month  from August  2006 to November  2006

£46.79 a month  from February 2007 to May 2007
£47.20 in June 2007
£47.66 a month  from July 2007 to November 2007
£47.29 a month  from December 2007 to January 2008
£46.93 in February 2008
Overpayments on loan 2:
£22.67 a month  from March 2006 to July 2006
£23.09 a month  from August  2006 to October 2006
£23.35 a month  from November 2006 to December 2006
£23.59 a month  from January 2007 to April 2007
£23.79 a month  from May 2007 to June 2007
£23.97 a month  from July 2007 to November 2007
£23.77 a month  from December 2007 to January 2008
Overpayments on loan 3 (assumed remortgage) :
£56.69 in March 2008
£58.85 in April 2008
£58.35 a month  from May 2008 to November  2008
£57.39 in December  2008
£54.54 in January 2009
£52.70 in February 2009
£51.79 in March 2009
£50.90 in April 2009
£50.05 a month  from May 2009 to December  2015
£49.26 in January 2016
