The complaint
Ms D complains that PayrNet Limited blocked and closed her account. Some of the funds 
were returned to source. She would like the remaining funds released.
What happened
Ms D had an account with PayrNet. In April 2021 PayrNet restricted the account to conduct a 
review. Following the review PayrNet asked Ms D to provide it with evidence of the source of 
the funds in her account. Ms D provided PayrNet with some documents.
PayrNet closed Ms Ds account on 19 August 2021 with immediate effect. It returned some 
of the funds in the account to its original source. 
Ms D has said her benefits were paid into this account and because of the restriction on the 
account she wasnt able to access funds and she didnt have money to pay for food for two 
weeks. She suffered financial hardship and it affected her mental wellbeing.
Ms D told us there had been £1,400 in her account which she now didnt have access to.
Ms D complained to PayrNet. She wasnt satisfied with their response so Ms D complained 
to our service. One of the investigators looked into the complaint. He issued two views. In 
the first view he thought PayrNet should reinstate the account and refund Ms D her entire 
balance from the time the account was blocked. PayrNet later provided some information to 
this service. Our investigator issued a second view. He said he thought PayrNet hadnt done 
anything wrong when it blocked and closed the account. But he wasnt able to establish if 
PayrNet had caused unnecessary delays or whether all the funds have been returned to 
source. Therefore, he partially upheld the complaint.
Ms D told us that she had been saving money through PayrNet and she hasnt been able to 
access this.
PayrNet did not respond to the view, so the matter has come to me to decide.
My provisional decision
In my provisional decision I said:
Account review and closure
Ill start by setting out some context for the review of Ms Ds account. UK legislation places 
extensive obligations on regulated financial businesses. Financial institutions must establish 
the purpose and intended nature of transactions as well as the origin of funds, and there 
may be penalties if they dont. This applies to both new and existing relationships. These 
obligations override all other obligations. I am satisfied PayrNet were complying with these 
obligations when they reviewed Ms Ds account.
It is sometimes necessary to block an account during a review and I see that is what 
PayrNet did in this case. Im satisfied they had legitimate reasons for blocking the account, 
so I dont think theyve acted unfairly here.
Ive gone on to consider f there was any delay in the review of Ms Ds account. I can see 
PayrNet carried out a review and they restricted Ms Ds account in April 2021. But looking at 
it I can see PayrNet could have completed the review sooner than they did. PayrNet should 
have been able to complete the review by 11 June 2021. So, in my view there has been 
approximately a two-month delay.
PayrNet hasnt been able to show a justifiable reason for the delay which took place so I 
think they could have completed their review much quicker. I appreciate this caused Ms D 
stress and upset and it affected her mental health so I think PayrNet should pay her £200 in 
compensation for the delay.
PayrNet subsequently closed the account with immediate effect. Its generally for financial 
institutions to decide whether or not they want to provide, or to continue to provide, banking 
facilities to any particular customer. Unless theres a good reason to do so, this service wont 
usually say that they must keep a customer or require them to compensate a customer who 
has had their account closed.
Ive considered whether PayrNet acted fairly in closing Ms Ds account. Ive looked at the 
terms and conditions of the account and Im satisfied they did. The terms and conditions 
outline that they can close a customers account with two months notice, and in certain 
circumstances they can close an account immediately. In this case PayrNet closed Ms Ds 
account without notice. For PayrNet to act fairly here they needed to meet the criteria to 
apply their terms for immediate closure  and having looked at these terms and all the 
evidence Im satisfied that they have applied the terms fairly. And it was entitled to close the 
accounts as its already done.
In summary, having looked at the evidence I agree that PayrNet acted fairly when it 
reviewed, blocked and closed Ms Ds account. But as Ive mentioned there were some 
delays which had a substantial impact on Ms D and for which I am minded to award some 
compensation.
Return of funds
Ms D told us she had been saving money with PayrNet. I have received information from 
PayrNet- it confirms that Ms D had £300 from her savings returned to source and she will 
need to contact the source to retrieve this money.
Ms D told us there was £1,400 in her account. She has later said that the amount in her 
account was around £800. But having looked at the statements I cant see that is the case. I 
have however looked at her account statement in great detail. I can see that at closure 
PayrNet returned £24.50 to Ms Ds account with a bank I will call bank S. From the 
statements I can see that £24.50 was returned to Ms D. However, the confirmation I have 
seen suggests this payment was made to Ms Ds account on the 3 February 2022 and not 
on the 19 August 21 as is shown on the PayrNet statement. I think PayrNet should pay Ms D 
interest on £24.50 of 8% from 11 June 2021 to 3 February 2022.
From looking at all her statement entries and my calculations I can see that there is a 
balance of £95.04 which seems to be unaccounted for, which from what I can see belongs to 
Ms D. I have asked PayrNet to review this information and explain but they havent been 
able to account for this money. I believe this money is Ms Ds and should be returned to her. Together with 8% interest from 11 June 2021, the date the review should have been 
completed until payment is made.
So subject to any further representations by Ms D and PayrNet I was minded to uphold the 
complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Responses to my provisional decision 
Ms D hasnt provided me with comments to my provisional decision. PayrNet have also not 
provided any comments to my provisional decision 
Although Ms D and PayrNet have not provided any further comments, I have nevertheless 
re-considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I have seen nothing to change my mind 
and so my provisional findings stand.
Putting things right
PayrNet should pay Ms D £200 for the distress caused during the delay of the review. They 
should also pay 8% interest on £24.50 from 11 June 2021 to 3 February 2022. They should 
also pay £95.04 together with 8% interest from 11 June to the date the payment is made.
My final decision
For the reasons stated above I uphold the complaint. I direct PayrNet Limited to pay Ms D 
the following:
£200 for the distress caused during the delay of the review.
8% interest on £24.50 from11 June 2021 to 3 February 2022.
£95.04 together with 8% interest from 11 June to the date the payment is made.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 February 2023.
