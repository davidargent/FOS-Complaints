Mr G says that Ferratum should  have  seen from his borrowing pattern that it was 
irresponsible to continue  lending to him. He says his credit  file would have shown he was in 
financial difficulties and borrowing from other short-term lenders. He says he had mental 
health and gambling issues and was trapped in a debt spiral.  Mr G adds that the final loan 
was approved after hed told Ferratum he was in financial difficulties and had asked it not to 
approve any further loans.
Ferratum says it carried out credit checks and asked Mr G about his income. It says it turned 
down a number  of Mr Gs loan applications and also approved less than the application on a 
number of occasions. Ferratum points out that all but one of the loans were repaid on time or 
early. It accepted it was wrong to approve  the final loan, but said that due to a system  
change it hadnt  correctly recorded  Mr Gs financial difficulties. As a gesture of goodwill, it 
offered to pay Mr G £300 to include the interest  it charged on the final loan.
Mr G did not accept this offer.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She considered it likely that, 
by loan 4, the level of checks that Ferratum should have been conducting would have shown 
Ref: DRN53118772Mr G was borrowing from other short-term lenders. In those  circumstances she said 
Ferratum should  have realised that Mr G would have  been unable to sustainably repay loan 
4, or any subsequent  loans. Indeed, by loan 7, our adjudicator said Mr Gs pattern of 
borrowing was such that it suggested  hed become reliant on short-term loans. So she 
recommended that Ferratum should refund interest and charges on loan 4 onwards  (plus 8% 
statutory interest),  remove negative information about loans 4-6 from Mr Gs credit file and 
remove loans 7 onwards from his credit file in their entirety.
Ferratum responded  to say, in summary,  that it disagreed with the recommendation. 
However, as the loan amount increased at loan 14, it offered to refund  interest on loans 14 
to 19. It said if Mr G accepted the offer, it would also remove  the loans from his credit file.
Mr G did not accept the revised offer.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ferratum needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Ferratum  should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Ferratum was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
Ref: DRN53118773the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 4 to 6 would most likely have 
shown that Mr G:
Had outstanding  short-term loans with at least six other lenders at the same time as 
he was borrowing from Ferratum;
Could  not afford  to make the scheduled  repayments to all the short-term loans out of 
his monthly disposable income;
Was having to borrow  again to meet his living  expenses;
Was unlikely to be able to sustainably repay loan 4 and subsequent loans.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Ferratums lending history  with Mr G, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Ferratum should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Ferratum should  have  realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr G was provided  with a new loan within  days/weeks of 
settling a previous  one. So Ferratum  ought  to have  realised it was more likely than 
not Mr G was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan 
was leaving in his finances and that Mr Gs indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Mr G wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Ferratum.  Loan 19 was 
taken out two years after Mr Gs first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr G had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Ferratum  over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr G lost out because Ferratum  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Gs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 to 19 and Ferratum  should put things right.
Ref: DRN53118774my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Ferratum UK Ltd should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr G paid on loans 4 to 19;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loans 4 to 6 from Mr Gs credit file.
The number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 19 should be removed from 
Mr Gs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Ferratum  to take off tax from this interest. Ferratum must  
give Mr G a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 July 2019.
