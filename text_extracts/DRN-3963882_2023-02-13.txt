The complaint
Mr S complains as a director of X, a limited company, that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
wont close its account. 
What happened
In March 2022, PayPal placed a permanent limitation on Mr Ss accounts. It told Mr S that 
because he had continually filed cases that didnt align with the intent of the PayPal Buyer 
Protection Programme and were contrary to the terms outlined in its user agreement, it had 
determined Mr S could no longer use PayPals services. It said this meant he could no 
longer use or receive funds, or file PayPal buyer protection cases.
Following this, PayPal told Mr S his account had been linked to another PayPal account by 
one or more pieces of personal information. It said if there are outstanding issues with 
regard to buyer protection, chargebacks or negative balances, it places a limitation on all of 
the accounts involved until the matter had been resolved. It said this helps it to prevent 
abuse of its online accounts.
Mr S says he asked PayPal to close three accounts several times. However, PayPal said he 
needed to resolve the account limitation, which isnt something he was able to do. 
Mr S complained to PayPal but the matter wasnt resolved. One of the accounts that had 
been limited was used for X. So, Mr S brought a complaint on Xs behalf to our service.
I issued a provisional decision on 13 January 2023 where I explained why I didnt intend to 
uphold Xs complaint. In that decision I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Based on what Ive seen so far, I dont intend to uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPal has referred to its user agreement which lists restricted activities and actions it 
might take if a customer engages in such activities which includes to: Terminate this user 
agreement, limit your account, and/or close or suspend your account, immediately and 
without penalty to us. And to: Refuse to provide the PayPal services to you in the future.
PayPal has sent us information to support its decision to permanently limit Mr Ss accounts. 
This includes evidence showing that the account for X is linked to Mr Ss personal accounts. 
Im unable to share this information with Mr S. However, Im satisfied that PayPals decision 
to no longer allow Mr S to use PayPals services is fair and reasonable. 
PayPal says it hasnt closed the accounts because it wants to prevent Mr S from opening 
new accounts. It says that while Mr Ss accounts arent technically closed, a permanent 
restriction has the same material effect as account closure for the purposes of triggering the 
data retention period. PayPal says that as its business relationship with Mr S has ended, he 
will no longer receive direct marketing. 
PayPal has referred to the section in its user agreement  Closing your PayPal Account, 
which links to the PayPal Help Centre. In the Help Centre under: How do I close my PayPal 
account? it says: You cant close your account if there are limitations, unresolved issues, or 
a balance. So, Im satisfied PayPal is acting in line with its processes and procedures.
Weve asked Mr S what impact the accounts being permanently restricted, rather than 
closed, is having. Mr S has expressed his frustration that PayPal limited the accounts and 
has said he wants them to be deleted because he will never use them. However, he doesnt 
appear to have been impacted by PayPals decision to permanently limit the accounts rather 
than close them. As Ive said, Im also satisfied that PayPals decision to limit the accounts 
was reasonable.
So, based on what Ive seen so far, I dont think PayPal has acted unfairly.
I gave both parties the opportunity to send me any further information or comments they 
wanted me to consider before I issued my final decision.
Responses
PayPal didnt provide any further comments.
Mr S said hed tried to get in contact with PayPal to solve any issues for months, but he 
wasnt able to get a response. He never wanted to close his PayPal accounts. He was 
frustrated that PayPal hadnt taken him seriously when hed wanted to solve the issues.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I acknowledge what Mr S has said about a lack of communication from PayPal. I appreciate 
he wouldnt have wanted to close the accounts if hed been able to resolve the issues.
However, I dont think it was possible to resolve the issues which resulted in PayPals 
decision to permanently limit Mr Ss accounts (including Xs). And as I said in my provisional 
decision, Im satisfied that PayPals decision to no longer allow Mr S to use PayPals 
services was fair and reasonable. 
So, Mr Ss comments havent made a difference to the conclusions Ive reached. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask X to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 March 2023.
