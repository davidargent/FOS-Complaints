K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs P complain  they were overcharged by Bank of Scotland Plc (trading as Halifax)  
when they repaid a loan early in 2004. 
background
Mr and Mrs P took out a loan with Halifax in September 2000. The loan amount  was £15,000 
and the term was five years. In August 2004  Mr and Mrs P paid the loan back  in full. That 
was around a year before  the original loan term was due to end. 
In 2018 Mr and Mrs P complained. They had been  sent information about  their loan account 
by Halifax in relation  to another matter. They say it shows they overpaid by £114.48. 
Mr and Mrs P complained but Halifax said the complaint had been  made  too late so didnt 
comment on whether theyd paid too much. 
Mr and Mrs P referred their complaint to our service and it was looked at by an investigator 
who initially  said the complaint hadnt  been referred  in time so we couldnt look at it. 
Mr and Mrs P appealed and said theyd only become  aware of the overpayment  when  
looking at the information Halifax sent them in 2018. The case was passed  to me and I 
agreed we could look into the merits of the complaint.  
When the investigator looked at the complaint again she didnt find any evidence of an 
overpayment by Mr and Mrs P. She didnt  ask Halifax  to refund anything to Mr and Mrs P 
and they asked to appeal.  As a result, the complaints been passed  to me to make  a 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the calculations Mr and Mrs P have supplied which  they feel shows  they paid 
too much  interest.  Im sorry to disappoint  them,  but I havent been  able to reconcile the 
figures theyve provided with the evidence Halifax sent them  showing all the payments 
theyve made. So Ive looked at all payments made to the loan by Mr and Mrs P. 
Mr and Mrs P made 46 contractual monthly  payments of £325.27 and a one off payment of 
£340 during the time the loan was active. But the £340 payment was made in February 2002 
after a direct debit  payment  was returned unpaid. That meant  Halifax  applied a £10 fee. As a 
result, the net payment made  to the loan balance  was actually  £330.  
To repay the loan they made a lump  sum payment of £4,002.99 in August 2004 and £36.02 
appears to have been refunded shortly  after that. That makes  a total loan repayment figure 
of £19,259.39. 
Mr and Mrs Ps loan agreement was for £15,000 plus £4,516.20  in interest giving a total 
repayment figure of £19,516.20. That means they saved around £256.81 in interest by 
repaying their loan early. Halifax  calculated  an early settlement figure  which means there  
was a charge  for repaying the loan before the agreed end of term but I havent seen 
anything to indicate Mr and Mrs P were  overcharged  either during the term of the loan or 
when it was repaid.  
Ref: DRN70745472In response to the investigators findings, Mr and Mrs P said they didnt agree because 
theyd consolidated other loans with Halifax and already been charged extra for early 
repayment. They feel this should be taken into consideration here. But if a loan is repaid 
early in order to consolidate  other debts or borrow more it forms a new loan agreement.  
Mr and Mrs P signed the new loan agreement on 1 September 2000,  increasing the amount 
they borrowed. So I think its fair they were subject  to a new early  settlement charge when 
they repaid the loan early  in August 2004.  
Im sorry  to disappoint Mr and Mrs P but I havent  found anything to show theyve been 
overcharged or treated unfairly by Halifax. As a result, Im not telling Halifax  to take any 
further action  to resolve this complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs P to 
accept or reject my decision  before  25 July 2019.
