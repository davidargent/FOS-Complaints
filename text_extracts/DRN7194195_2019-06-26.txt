Ms P complains  that WorldPay (UK) Limited  gave her incorrect information  about what  she 
needed to do when she started operating as a sole trader.
background 
Until recently,  Ms P ran an account with WorldPay for her (now  dissolved) limited company. 
Last year, she decided  to operate as a sole trader rather  than a limited company. Ms P 
changed her main business  account to reflect this. Her bank suggested she should also let 
WorldPay know about the change. Ms P called WorldPay on 18 May 2018  to check  what she 
needed to do. She says WorldPay initially told her she didnt need  to do anything. It then 
said shed need  to set up a new account in her own name  but that this could be done over 
the phone. Ms P says this took over an hour.  
After the call finished, WorldPay sent Ms P an email  asking  her to reply  confirming  that she 
wanted the limited  company account  to close  which  she did. The email also said there was 
a 30 day notice period for all account closures.  But Ms P says shed  been  told this wouldnt 
apply as shed  opened another account  that day. 
A little while  later, Ms P realised no payments were going into her sole trader  account. She 
found out her old, limited  company account  hadnt been closed and payments were still 
being routed  there. Ms P raised  a complaint about  this.
In its final response,  WorldPay admitted it may not have given Ms P clear information about 
what she needed to do. In order for payments to go to Ms Ps sole trader  account  rather than 
her limited  company account, she needed  to reintegrate her website with the new account 
details. WorldPay acknowledged  this may not have been explained during the call. It asked 
Ms P to reply to a message it had sent her on 27 June 2018  titled WorldPay  Pay By Link 
Is Live But Website Is Not Complaint once  the website had been  reintegrated, so that 
payments could be sent to her new account.  WorldPay also offered £100 compensation for 
the service failings. 
Ms P was unhappy  with this response, so asked our service to investigate.  When  we got in 
touch with WorldPay, it offered a further £157.02  compensation   as this was the same as 
the amount held in the limited company account.  It also offered to waive the fees on Ms Ps 
sole trader account from May-  August 2018.  This was on top of the £100 originally offered.
Our investigator put this offer forward to Ms P, but she didnt accept. She said her trip was 
due to last into August,  but she had to come back on 18 July 2018 to sort things out. And 
shed paid the owner of the guest  house  she was staying in €400 for calls to WorldPay.  Ms P 
said shed also spent  time and money  going to areas with WiFi.  She wanted  more 
compensation, money for her calls, and a waiver  of 12 months account fees.
Our investigator felt WorldPays  offer was largely fair. He noted  the £157.02 covered the 
money paid to the limited company, and the fee refund meant  Ms P was only being charged  
for the period when she had use of the account. He also thought the £100  compensation 
seemed reasonable, given that Ms P wouldve always had to make  arrangements to change 
the website. But, although our investigator  felt Ms P hadnt been able to evidence how much 
shed spent in calls, he felt she probably did incur some additional costs. In response to this 
point, WorldPay offered a further £100. Taking  this into account,  our investigator told Ms P 
he thought the offer was fair. As Ms P disagreed, the complaint  was passed to me. 
Ref: DRN71941952my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusions as the investigator. I appreciate this will come as a disappointment to Ms P. Ive 
explained how Ive made my decision  below.
First of all, I want  to be clear about  how Ive approached this complaint. Im conscious that 
Ms P was the director of a limited  company,  which was a separate  legal entity to her as a 
sole trader. The limited  company  dissolved  on 12 February 2019. As it no longer exists, our 
service couldnt look at a complaint on its behalf.  So Ive solely  looked at how this issue  
affected Ms P in her capacity as a sole trader customer of WorldPay.
I know Ms P was keen  for us to listen to the calls she had with WorldPay.  However,  its down 
to me to decide  what information I need to reach  my decision. And WorldPay  isnt disputing 
that Ms P wasnt told to reintegrate her website.  So I dont need to listen these calls to reach  
a finding here. On balance, I accept Ms Ps account. 
Having accepted that WorldPay made a mistake, Ive looked at what  impact this had. Ms P 
has told us she lost out because payments werent going through  to her sole trader account. 
As our investigator has pointed out, Ms P wouldve always had to reintegrate  her website for 
this to happen. But if shed been told during  the initial call, Ms P would at least  have had the 
opportunity to get the website reintegrated earlier. As it was, payments continued to go into 
her limited  account. 
Ive already mentioned that the limited company was a separate legal entity to Ms P. And I 
cant conclusively say the money was due to Ms P as a sole trader rather than the limited 
company. So I can appreciate why it was difficult for WorldPay to release the funds to Ms P 
directly, particularly when  the limited  company  was still running. But as WorldPay  has now 
offered to pay Ms P £157.02   which is the balance remaining in the limited company 
account  that addresses any losses caused by payments going  to the wrong  account.  
Looking more widely at the impact Ms P has told us the error had, I appreciate she feels it 
caused reputational damage to the business as she had to tell customers to make  other  
payment arrangements.  However, Im also conscious that WorldPay  did send Ms P an email 
flagging up the issue with the website  on 27 June 2018. And it clarified this point further 
when it responded  to her complaint on 10 July 2018.  
Ms P has told us she shouldnt be expected to keep  up with her emails when she was on 
holiday, particularly  given her personal  circumstances  and the lack of internet connection. 
However, Ms P did raise the complaint so wouldve  known to expect a response. It was also 
Ms Ps choice to let WorldPay know about her situation  after shed gone away, and whilst 
her business  continued  to operate.
When our investigator made  this point to Ms P, she told him shed  expected everything to be 
wrapped up on the day she called. But actually, what WorldPay should  have done is told 
Ms P to reintegrate the website. So additional  communication and work would have always  
been needed to get everything set up. And I can only reasonably ask WorldPay to cover any 
losses  financial or otherwise  that were  caused by their error, as opposed to costs  that 
would have always been incurred. 
Ref: DRN71941953Ms P has told us she incurred costs  returning  from the UK earlier than planned, such  as her 
taxi fare to and from the airport. But Ms P would have always  needed to pay for her transport 
home at some point.  In addition, its not clear  whether Ms P had a return flight booked   so 
Im not sure there were any additional costs. But even if Ms P did pay an additional  air fare, 
there isnt a clear  enough causal chain for me to hold WorldPay responsible. Ms P has told 
us the website wasnt reintegrated  until August 2018 as the person who needed to do the 
work was also on holiday.  So whilst I can appreciate why Ms P wanted return  home, Im not 
persuaded that her decision to do so was necessitated by WorldPays  error.  As a result, I 
wouldnt expect WorldPay to cover  any travel costs. 
In addition, Ms P wants WorldPay to waive her account fees for a year.  Instead, WorldPay 
has offered to waive the cost of the account up until the point when  payments  started  being  
received. I dont think it would be fair to ask WorldPay  to do more   even on a goodwill  
basis. Ms P didnt have  full use of her account until the website was reintegrated.  And 
WorldPays offer means shes  effectively  not being charged up until this point. I wouldnt 
expect WorldPay to waive the fee now Ms P has full use of the account. 
Ms P has asked WorldPay to cover  €400 in calls costs. Again, Ive considered whether I can 
reasonably conclude that Ms P incurred this level of cost due to WorldPays  mistake.  On 
balance, I accept that Ms P spent more  calling (or trying to call) WorldPay than she would 
have if it had given  her the right information  from the outset. But as Ive pointed  out above,  
Ms P chose to call WorldPay about her business change after shed started  her holiday. And 
looking at the steps she needed to take to get the website reintegrated, its likely she would 
always have needed  to spend time on the phone  to WorldPay and/or the person managing 
her website during  her trip. So on balance, Im not persuaded that the full cost Ms P is 
claiming for is attributable to WorldPays error. The £100 contribution WorldPay  has agreed 
to seems a fairer and more proportionate cost for it to pay. 
Finally, Ive thought  about what WorldPay should do to address Ms Ps distress and 
inconvenience  taking into account  the £100  offered  for calls and the £157.02 offered to 
cover any payment losses. As Ive acknowledged  above, WorldPays error undoubtedly  
caused Ms P some unnecessary hassle and upset. She lost the opportunity  to make the 
necessary website arrangements earlier. And it would have been upsetting  to find out that 
payments werent  going through as expected. However, I do think some  of the hassle 
involved was down  to the process needed to set everything up (as opposed  to WorldPays 
failure to tell Ms P about this). In addition, WorldPay did send emails explaining what  Ms P 
needed to do within two months  of her setting up the account. Given  that Ms P was just 
starting out as a sole trader, I think some responsibility  lay with her to ensure the business 
was able to operate during her trip. Taking  all of this into account, Im satisfied the £100  
offered is a fair reflection  of the distress  and inconvenience caused  by WorldPays error.  And 
I think the overall offer WorldPay has made is a fair and reasonable way to resolve this 
complaint.
Ref: DRN71941954my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, my final decision is that WorldPay  (UK) Limited should:
Pay Ms P £157.02 to cover the balance on the limited company account
Waive the account  fees from May  August 2018 (inclusive)
Pay Ms P £200 for her call costs and to compensate her for distress and 
inconvenience
Any payments that havent already been made should now be made within  28 days of 
receiving Ms Ps acceptance of this decision.
Ms P should note that if she accepts my decision,  it will be legally binding on all parties  and 
she probably then wouldnt be able to take legal action over this matter for additional 
compensation. If, however, she rejects the decision, although her legal rights will remain 
intact, itll be purely a matter between Ms P and WorldPay (UK) Limited as to whether the 
offer still remains open for acceptance.  Strictly speaking, an offer is not binding  on the 
offeror after its been rejected.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 July 2019
