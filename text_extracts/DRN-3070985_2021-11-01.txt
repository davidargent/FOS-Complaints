The complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has recorded a search on his credit 
file.
What happened
Mr M says he intended to buy a product online and saw a PayPal advert at checkout for a 
0% interest offer. He says he applied for the offer but was offered a different interest rate for 
a revolving credit facility. Mr M says he cancelled the application and bought the item with 
his credit card but noticed PayPal recorded a credit search on his credit file. He would like 
that search removed and says he would like compensation for the interest rate difference.
PayPal says Mr M applied for the credit facility and it was obliged to check his credit file. It 
says the account wasnt opened but hasnt made a mistake. PayPal says it cant provide a 
copy of the advert or details of what Mr M saw online.
Mr M brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld the complaint. The investigator 
thought any promotion should not be misleading and should make clear if an interest rate is 
an example. The investigator thought Mr M had provided a detailed description of the advert 
and didnt think PayPal could provide any further information about the advert. The 
investigator also thought there could be an impact on Mr Ms ability to obtain credit and that 
the search details ought to be removed from his credit file.
PayPal doesnt accept that view.
My provisional view
I issued a provisional decision and said that I didnt uphold this complaint.  I appreciated the 
investigators view here and agreed that any advert shouldnt be misleading. And I also 
thought it would have been helpful for PayPal to have provided information about the type of 
adverts it uses in this situation. I also thought it ought to have a record of the exact 
promotion it offered at the time Mr M applied for the credit facility.
 
I had to consider on balance what I thought is more likely to have happened. There is no 
dispute that Mr M applied for the credit facility and I had no doubt Mr M believed he was 
applying for a 0% offer. But I thought on balance that its unlikely PayPal would have 
guaranteed that offer and thought it likely that the offer would have required a formal 
application. And that a search of a credit file would have to be made before any offer was 
made.
So, I didnt think PayPal made a mistake by making the search on Mr Ms credit file and 
thought it likely that it told potential customers that. I was satisfied it was Mr Ms decision to 
apply for the offer and that it was up to PayPal to decide when exercising its commercial 
judgement what, if any, interest rate it offered. 
Overall my provisional view was that Mr M applied for the facility and PayPal in those 
circumstances was entitled in line with its user agreement to make a search on Mr Ms credit 
file. It follows that I said I cant fairly order PayPal to remove it and thought it unlikely it would 
have any significant effect on Mr Ms ability to obtain credit. But I said I would ask PayPal if, 
as a gesture of goodwill, it was prepared to remove the credit search in these circumstances.
I hoped PayPal would be able to provide further information on the type of adverts it uses in 
these sorts of cases and be able to provide a copy of what a customer would have seen 
before my final decision.
PayPal hasnt responded to my provisional decision.
Mr M has responded and doesnt agree. He maintains the advert was misleading and made 
no mention of other options or interest rates.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the same decision that I reached in my provisional decision 
and for the same reasons. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 November 2021.
