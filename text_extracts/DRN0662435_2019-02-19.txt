K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that Provident  Personal  Credit Limited (trading as Satsuma) gave  him loans 
that he couldnt afford to repay.  He asks that it refunds interest  and charges and removes 
information about the loans from his credit file.
background
Mr M took out three  loans with Satsuma between  December 2016 and August 2017.  He 
says it was irresponsible to lend such large  amounts without better  checks, which he says 
would have shown  the loans werent affordable. 
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that the complaint  should  be upheld.  She said Satsuma 
made proportionate  checks  before offering the loans. It asked about Mr Ms income  and 
expenditure and checked  what  hed told it. The information it received suggested the loans 
were affordable.
Mr M didnt  agree. He said Satsuma  should  have made more checks before the third loan. 
He said he hadnt  repaid  the second loan and the amounts  he asked to borrow were 
increasing. Mr M says he had loans from 10 other lenders and ongoing  repayment  plans  and 
this is clear from his credit  report.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
Mr M took out three  loans with Satsuma:
Loan number
Date of loan Amount of 
loanInstalments: Number 
and highest amount Date repaid
1 11 December 2016 £100 3 x £49/month 1 April 2017
2 6 April 2017 £400 12 x £66.40/month -
3 11 August 2017 £500 8 x £125*/month -
*£191.40/month with the instalments for loan 2. 
loans 1 and 2
When Mr M asked  for loans 1 and 2 he told Satsuma his monthly income  was £1,400  and 
his expenditure  was £490. Satsuma says it verified Mr Ms income electronically. It increased  
Mr Ms expenditure to about £1,000, saying this reflected information from the credit bureau  
and its internal models. This left Mr M with monthly  disposable  income  of about £360 
(loan 1) and £400 (loan 2). 
I think, given Mr M stated income,  the amount of the loan repayments  and that these were  
Mr Ms first loans  with Satsuma, its checks were  proportionate. The information it received 
suggested the loans were  affordable.

When Mr M asked  for loan 3 he told Satsuma  his monthly income was £1,400. He said his 
expenditure was £490, including housing (£300), financial commitments  (£40)  and other 
(£150). Satsuma increased his monthly expenditure to £920,  mostly due to it increasing his 
cost of financial commitments to £470.  Mr M would have had about £480 left to meet the 
loan repayments.  
Loan 2 was still outstanding when Mr M took out loan 3. Hed paid the instalments due up to 
then on time.
The results  of Satsumas  credit check show Mr M had 17 short term loans: six less than 
shown on the credit check for loan 2. The length of time since hed taken out a new short  
term loan had increased since loan 2. There are no defaults shown, although there is at least  
one account with late payments. The outstanding  balance for all short  term loans is shown 
as £211, less than the amount shown as outstanding when he took out loan 2. 
Satsuma knew that Mr M had other short term loans and some  late payments. But this 
doesnt mean it cant lend to him, provided it makes proportionate checks and is satisfied the 
repayments are affordable. 
I think the checks Satsuma made  were  proportionate. It asked for information about Mr Ms 
income and expenditure. It did a credit check and increased Mr Ms costs, particularly his 
credit commitments,  based on the results. The information Satsuma received suggested the 
monthly loan repayments for loans 2 and 3 were affordable.
I appreciate that Mr Ms financial circumstances  were more difficult. But I dont think 
Satsuma knew this when  it offered the loans to him. I think it was entitled to rely on the 
information it had received  from Mr M and its credit check. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 March  2019.
