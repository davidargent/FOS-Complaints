Miss T has said Sunny did not lend to her responsibly. She has said it continued  to provide 
loans that she could not afford. Sunny  has said it completed eligibility, creditworthiness  and 
affordability checks for each loan application.  
In the most recent assessment, our adjudicator upheld Miss Ts complaint in part and 
thought loan 11 onwards  should  not have been  given. Sunny didnt agree in full  it made on 
offer from loan 21 onwards. Miss T didnt accept Sunnys offer so the complaint has been 
passed to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss T could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN67105822But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss T could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ts complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss T, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point  at which  Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ts case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 11. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss T was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss T had taken  out 11 loans in just over two months - four loans 
alone had been  taking  out in the November 2015  after five loans had been repaid in 
October 2015. Miss Ts overall  pattern of borrowing suggested that she had become 
persistently reliant on short-term loans. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more 
likely than not Miss T was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying her 
previous loan was leaving  in her finances  and that Miss Ts indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN67105823Miss T wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  44 was 
taken out 22 months after Miss Ts first. Miss T had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 11 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ts indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss T borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ts ability to access mainstream  credit  and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 11 to 44 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss T paid on loans 11 to 44;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 11 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loan 11 to 44 should be removed from 
Miss Ts credit file.
If Miss T still owes  Sunny  any of the principal  balance she borrowed on her final loan
Sunny should  remove all the interest  and charges applied to the outstanding balance.
Sunny should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Miss T went  to towards
the principal. But importantly, Sunny needs  to make sure that Miss T doesnt repay more
than the principal amount borrowed.
If after doing this Miss T hasnt repaid  the principal she borrowed Sunny can deduct this
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Miss T has already paid enough to repay the
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple interest from the
date of payment  to the date of settlement.
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Miss T.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss T a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ts complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN67105824Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 May 2020.
