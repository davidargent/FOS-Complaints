The complaint
Mr W complains about an option to purchase fee that he was charged by Volkswagen 
Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Audi Financial Services, at the end of his hire 
purchase agreement. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr W signed the hire purchase agreement which set out the circumstances in which 
the option to purchase fee would be applied;
I can understand his feelings about being charged the fee even though hes returned 
the car and isnt purchasing it and I consider that the fee could have been more 
clearly described in the agreement  but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that Audi Financial Services has acted otherwise than in 
accordance with the terms of the agreement  and its agreed to waive the fee;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances - we have no regulatory or disciplinary role over 
those businesses so Im unable to require any of them to change the way that it 
conducts its business;
Mr W has asked for compensation for the time that hes spent in raising his complaint 
and for the distress and inconvenience that he says that hes been caused as a result 
of Audi Financial Services misleading terms;
it was Mr Ws choice to make a complaint and I wouldnt normally award 
compensation for time spent in making a complaint; and
Audi Financial Services has agreed to waive the fee and I dont consider that theres 
enough evidence to show that its acted incorrectly  so Im not persuaded that it 
would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to pay any 
compensation to Mr W or to take any other action in response to his complaint. 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 July 2020.
