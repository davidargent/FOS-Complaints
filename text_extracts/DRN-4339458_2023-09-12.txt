The complaint
Ms M holds a current account with National Westminster Bank Plc. She was the victim of a 
romance scam whereby a scammer pretended to enter into a relationship with her. The 
relationship was fraudulent and the scammer persuaded Ms M to send him just over seven 
thousand six hundred pounds from her NatWest account. 
Ms M wants NatWest to refund her all or some of the money she sent to the scammer.
What happened
The scammer contacted Ms M through social media. He quickly built up her trust and 
persuaded her that he wanted a long-term relationship. He created a convincing story that 
he was a soldier with the US army on active service in a remote part of the Middle East. He 
gained her confidence and persuaded her to send him money in four different payments, for 
which he gave highly plausible reasons.
In outline, the four payments were as follows: 
Date Amount Method of payment Scammers 
justification 
10 April 2017 £700.00 Ms M withdrew cash from a NatWest 
branch and used a payment agent to 
send the money.A delivery fee to allow 
him to send some 
gold to Ms M.
20 April 2017 £2,833.62 Ms M transferred the money from a 
NatWest branch. To pay for travel and 
leave from the army.
21 April 2017 £2,843.81 Ms M transferred the money from a 
NatWest branch.A further payment for 
travel and leave from 
the army as the first 
one had been lost. 
10 May 2017 £1,227.53 Ms M transferred the money from a 
NatWest branch.A further payment for 
travel. 
Total £7,604.96
In each case, the scammer gave Ms M a detailed justification. I have only provided a brief 
summary here, but Im satisfied that the scammer was extremely convincing and credible 
throughout and tricked Ms M into believing him. All three transfers went to overseas bank 
accounts and used NatWests urgent process, which transfers money particularly quickly. 
I previously sent Ms M and NatWest a provisional decision on this complaint. In that 
provisional decision, I explained that although Ms M had endured an awful experience at the 
hands of the scammer, for which she had my heartfelt sympathy, I didnt think it would be fair 
for me to tell NatWest to refund her any of the money she lost. However, I said that I would 
give both Ms M and NatWest the opportunity to comment before I made a final decision. 
The time I allowed for comments has now passed. NatWest has not sent us anything further 
about the case, but Ms M has made quite a few comments about my provisional decision 
and still thinks NatWest owes her a refund.
Before I explain what I have finally decided and why, I will provide an extract from my 
provisional decision, which explains my findings up to that point. I will then provide a 
summary of Ms Ms comments.
Extract from my provisional decision 
The core facts of this case are not in dispute. The point of disagreement is that Ms M 
believes NatWest should have spotted that something was wrong and stopped her making 
the payments and that as it didnt, it should refund her all or some of the money she lost; 
whereas NatWest thinks it behaved reasonably throughout and does not need to give Ms M 
any money back.
There is no doubt that Ms M followed NatWests normal procedures when she made the 
payments. The cash withdrawal seems to have followed the standard over the counter 
process and Ms M also followed normal banking procedures for the three transfers. I fully 
accept that she only did this because of the fraudulent actions of the scammer, but she 
effectively authorised NatWest to make the payments. Frauds of this type are often called 
Authorised Push Payment (APP) frauds. 
While banks are normally expected to act on their customers instructions, APP fraud is a 
significant concern in the banking industry and at the time of Ms Ms payments, I would have 
expected NatWest to be looking out for unusual payments, or unusual patterns of payments. 
And if it saw anything worrying, I would have expected it to check with the customer 
concerned before proceeding. This is directly relevant to Ms Ms complaint as NatWest did make some checks, but the critical question is whether they were sufficient and timely in the 
circumstances. 
In outline, although some of the information I have is contradictory, events seem to have 
unfolded along the following lines: 
NatWest did not make any significant challenge over the cash withdrawal.
NatWest may have checked if Ms M was happy about the first transfer but didnt 
ask any probing questions about it. 
NatWest made two interventions over the second transfer. One of its tellers made the 
first intervention before processing the transfer. In outline, it seems the teller warned 
Ms M that she may be falling victim of fraud, but she was still confident the scammer 
was legitimate and told the teller to go ahead. Later the same day, Ms M returned to 
the bank on other business and a manager called her into a private room to tell her 
again that it looked like she was being scammed. 
NatWest did not make any significant challenge over the third transfer. 
It seems the scammer totally entranced Ms M. After the second transfer, he contacted her to 
reassure her he was genuine. He asked for the third transfer which he said would help him 
travel to the UK to meet her. Ms M was uncertain but has told us she agreed to make the 
third transfer as she was anxious to know one way or another whether or not the scammer 
was genuine. 
Clearly, NatWest did not make any meaningful intervention for the cash withdrawal and the 
first transfer. But these were different types of transactions. There was no pattern. And 
although they were large, they were not noticeably exceptional. I do not think I can 
reasonably say that NatWest should have intervened more strongly at that stage. 
Furthermore, given the strength of the scammers hold over Ms M, I think its highly likely 
that if NatWest had intervened, she would have told it to go ahead.
I certainly think NatWest was right to intervene at the time of the second transfer. I think it 
behaved correctly in calling Ms M into a private room. Arguably, it should have done this on 
her first visit of the day, and Im not sure why it didnt. However, again I think Ms M would still 
have told it to go ahead with the payment. I have also considered if NatWest should have 
called the Police at this stage, but I think that given Ms Ms determination to go ahead, such 
a call would not have been appropriate or effective. 
I do think NatWest should have intervened for the third transfer. However, as Ms M has told 
us that she wanted to make this payment as a kind of test to help her decide between the 
scammers claim that he was genuine and NatWests concerns that he may have been a 
scammer, I doubt NatWest could have stopped her proceeding. 
Once Ms M was aware of the fraud, I would also have expected NatWest to try to get her 
money back from the receiving bank. Clearly this would not have been possible for the cash 
withdrawal, but it can also be difficult for transfers as fraudsters often move money on 
quickly once they receive it. 
Ms M seems to have discussed recalling the money with NatWest either soon after or during 
her meeting with the branch manager. I have seen some records from NatWest from the time and Im satisfied that it acted promptly to try to recover the money. It was unsuccessful, 
as the scammer had moved the money on, but I think it acted reasonably.
Im not sure when Ms M told NatWest she had decided the third transfer was fraudulent and 
how NatWest acted to try to recover the money for her. Shes told us that shortly after she 
made that transfer, the scammer told her he was on his way to the airport to travel to the UK 
to meet her. Shes said that at the time she was excited about this. It seems he called her 
again a bit later to say that he couldnt board his flight because he had been detained at the 
airport. Ms M has said that a day later he asked for more money and at this point she 
realised he was a fraud. I think its highly likely that by that time the scammer would have 
moved the money on again. So, even if Ms M had reported the fraud at that time and 
NatWest had acted immediately to try to recover the money for her, I doubt it would have 
been successful. 
Ms Ms response to my provisional decision 
In response to my provisional decision, Ms M has told us that she thinks NatWests 
interventions were weak and washy, that liability should be placed at (NatWests) feet 
and that it should bear some financial obligation for her losses. She has also said 
specifically that if NatWest had called the Police for the second transfer, she would not have 
made any further payments. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I fully accept the sincerity of Ms Ms comments, but they do not change the underlying facts, 
context and conclusions in my provisional decision. I consider the extract above is still 
correct.
The gist of Ms Ms new comments is that if NatWest had been more forceful in its 
interventions, she would have realised she was being scammed and not sent the fraudster 
any further money. I did consider the question of more forceful interventions in my 
provisional decision, but as they are at the heart of Ms Ms new comments I have re-
examined them carefully for each transaction. 
For the cash withdrawal and the first transfer, I provisionally decided that it wouldnt have 
been reasonable for me to say that NatWest should have intervened more strongly at those 
stages. Ms M has not made any specific comments about these transactions and my view 
has not changed. 
For the second transfer, I considered whether NatWest should have called the Police, but I 
doubted that such a call would have been appropriate or effective. Clearly there were two 
parts to this. The first (appropriacy) was whether NatWest had sufficient grounds to ring the 
Police and the second (effectiveness) concerned whether a call to the Police would have 
worked in stopping the scam if NatWest had made one
Ms M has said that she felt very alone while talking to the NatWest manager and that its 
failure to call the Police was half baked. I accept the strength of Ms Ms views, but I do not 
agree with her. Given the plausibility of the scammers story and her determination to go 
ahead, I think that NatWests decision not to call the Police after a discussion at the counter, 
followed by a private conversation with a manager in a private room was reasonable in this 
case. I do not think it was half baked. As mentioned above, Ms M has also told us that if NatWest had called the Police she 
wouldnt have sent any further money to the scammer. To a large extent, as I have decided 
that it was reasonable for NatWest not to involve the Police, this question largely falls away. 
However, for completeness, I have considered Ms Ms comments, but I am not convinced by 
them. Given the full circumstances of this scam, I doubt that the single act of NatWest calling 
the Police and them engaging in the complaint would have shaken Ms Ms belief that the 
scammer was genuine. 
For the third transfer, in my provisional decision I said that I thought NatWest should have 
intervened, but that as Ms M has told us that she wanted to make this payment to test the 
scammers claim to be genuine, I doubted that NatWest could have stopped her proceeding. 
Ms M has not said anything specific about this transfer and my view is unchanged. 
 
So, in summary, I am very sorry for the awful experience Ms M suffered at the hands of the 
scammer and for her financial loss. But I have reconsidered all the information we had prior 
to my provisional decision alongside her subsequent comments, and it seems to me that 
NatWest made some reasonable interventions to try to prevent the fraud. I accept that it 
should have made one more, for the third transfer, but I doubt that would have changed Ms 
Ms mind about proceeding. I also think NatWest made reasonable attempts to recover the 
money Ms M lost from the first and second transfers once she reported them as fraud, 
although unfortunately they turned out to be unsuccessful. I am not sure when Ms M 
reported the third transfer as fraud and how well NatWest responded, but by that time, I 
doubt that even prompt action to try to recover the money would have succeeded. 
I do not think NatWest was at fault for Ms Ms loss.
My final decision
For the reasons I have set out above, I am not upholding Ms Ms complaint about National 
Westminster Bank Plc. I am not going to tell it to give her any money back.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 October 2023.
