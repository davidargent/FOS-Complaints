K820x#14complaint
Miss B says HSBC Bank Plc (HSBC)  mis-sold a Plus packaged bank account to her in 
2007. Shes used  a Claims Management Company (CMC) to make her complaint. 
background
Our adjudicators have  looked into Miss Bs complaint already and didnt  think HSBC had 
mis-sold the packaged  account. The CMC asked  for an ombudsmans  review.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Miss Bs complaint. Having done  so, I dont think HSBC  mis-sold the Plus 
account to Miss B. Id like to explain why I think thats the case. 
Fee free accounts  are widely  available in the United  Kingdom. And I think that Miss B 
wouldve known she couldve had a free account  with HSBC if thats what  she wanted after 
all she had one previously. So I think that Miss B chose to take the Plus account.  
I dont think the Plus account  was recommended to Miss B. In any event, it looks  like Miss B 
benefitted from some of the main benefits  such as the rebate on credit  card interest and 
fee free overseas cash  withdrawals. 
Im open  to the possibility Miss B wasnt told absolutely  everything she needed to know  
about all the benefits. But Ive not seen anything to suggest she wouldve  been affected by 
the main limitations  or exclusions.  So I dont  think clearer  information wouldve made a 
difference and I think Miss B was given enough to understand what she was agreeing  to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Miss Bs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 February  2019.
