The complaint
S, a limited company complains about the way that National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) handled its account.
S wants NatWest to pay the legal and accountancy costs that it incurred.
S is represented in its complaint by a director, Mr S.
What happened
S is a business banking customer of NatWest. In 2021, NatWest carried out a review of S as 
part of its customer due diligence process. NatWest requested information that related to   
Mr S personally. After Mr S complained, NatWest upheld the complaint and paid £300 
compensation. 
Later in 2021, NatWest carried out another review and asked for information that S had 
already supplied. For health reasons, Mr S asked NatWest for additional time to comply with 
its request. But Mr S says NatWest told him that if he didnt supply the relevant information, it 
would close Ss bank account.
Mr S says the constant requests came at a very difficult time for him. After Mr S complained 
again, NatWest offered an additional £400 compensation but Mr S declined the offer. He 
wanted NatWest to pay significantly more than it had offered as he'd taken advice from his 
accountant and solicitor. Mr S also declined NatWests offer to pay £150 compensation for 
any failures in its complaint handling.
The investigator thought NatWest had already done and offered enough to put things right 
for S. 
Mr S disagrees with the investigation outcome. He doesnt think the investigator understood 
his point of view properly. Mr S says the investigator missed the fact that NatWest offered 
£150 compensation in addition to the £700 paid and offered. 
Mr S doesnt think weve taken enough account of the threatening nature of NatWests 
communication when it asked repeatedly for unnecessary information. Mr S thinks that as 
NatWest accepts it was at fault, it should reimburse Ss legal costs. Mr S doesnt think weve 
properly punished NatWest for its actions.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise that Ive summarised this complaint in less detail than the parties and Ive done so 
using my own words. The rules that govern this service allow me to do so. But this doesnt 
mean Ive not considered everything that both parties have given to me. 
Im very sorry to hear about the distress Mr S felt during NatWests review process but this 
complaint is brought by S, a limited company so its own legal entity. A limited company cant 
feel upset or threatened; this means I cant make an award to reflect the impact of NatWests 
actions on Mr S personally. I appreciate that this is likely to be frustrating and disappointing 
for Mr S.
I understand Mr S instructed a solicitor and accountant to help guide him through NatWests 
review process but that was his choice on behalf of S. Im not persuaded that it wasnt 
possible for Mr S to raise his concerns over the review process without professional 
assistance. This means I dont think its reasonable to require NatWest to reimburse S for 
any professional costs or pay a contribution towards them. 
This service isnt a regulator, so we dont punish businesses for their mistakes. When we 
look at complaints, we look to see if a consumer has lost out financially due to the 
businesses mistake. If the consumer has lost out, we will try and put them back in the 
position they wouldve been had the mistake not happened.
In Ss case, apart from professional costs, it hasnt given this service evidence to show that it 
incurred a financial loss because NatWest asked for information when it didnt need to. 
NatWest confirms that S didnt lose access to its bank account so there wasnt any 
disruption to its business in terms of not being able to carry out financial transactions. 
Instead, the inconvenience to S happened when Mr S, as sole director, had to respond to 
NatWests unnecessary requests for information. I assume this diverted Mr Ss time away 
from running the business of S. For this, I agree that NatWests offer to pay a total of £700 
compensation adequately reflects the inconvenience caused to S.
As the investigator told Mr S, NatWests offer to pay £150 compensation was for the way in 
which it handled Ss complaint. Generally, our service cant consider complaints that are 
solely about complaint handling. But as NatWest has already made an offer in relation to its 
poor handling of Ss complaint, I expect NatWest to honour the offer if S accepts my 
decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc has already offered enough to put 
things right. If it hasnt done so already, National Westminster Bank Plc should pay S a total 
of £550. For the avoidance of doubt this in addition to the £300 already paid by NatWest.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask S to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 January 2023.
