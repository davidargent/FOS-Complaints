The complaint
Miss S complains that Shop Direct Finance Company Limited lent to her irresponsibly when 
it agreed to open six catalogue shopping accounts for her and subsequent credit limit 
increases which she says were unaffordable for her circumstances.
What happened
Catalogue 1
Miss S applied for a Littlewoods catalogue with Shop Direct in September 1997 and was 
given a £600 credit limit. The credit limit on this account changed several times between 
December 2007 and December 2011  the details are set out in the table below. Miss S 
made a final repayment to the account in February 2012 and she then didnt make any 
further purchases. The account was closed in August 2012.
 Credit limit change  Amount of increase/decrease  New credit limit
December 2007 (no information available before this date) £2,700
January 2007 -£100 £2,600
June 2008 £500 £3,100
June 2009 -£2,000 £1,100
May 2010  £300  £1,400
August 2010  £300  £1,700
December 2010  £500  £2,200
July 2011  £500  £2,700
December 2011  £500  £3,200
The purchases Miss S made through the Littlewoods catalogue and repaid over 20 or 52 
weeks were interest free. But any purchases repaid over a longer period or on the buy now 
pay later basis would attract interest.
Catalogue 2
Miss S applied for a Isme catalogue (which later became the Very catalogue) with Shop 
Direct in July 1999 and was given a £600 credit limit. The credit limit on this account 
changed several times between November 2006 and August 2016  the details are set out in 
the table below. Miss S made a final repayment to the account in June 2019 and she then 
didnt make any further purchases. The account was closed in February 2020.
Credit limit change  Amount of increase/decrease  New credit limit
November 2006 (no information available before this date) £2,400
October 2007 £200 £2,600
June 2009 -£1,600 £1,000
May 2012  £300  £1,300
July 2012  £300  £1,600
April 2013  £500  £2,100
June 2014  £200  £2,300
September 2015  £300  £2,600
January 2016  £250  £2,850
August 2016  £250  £3,100
Catalogue 3 
Miss S applied for an Index Extra catalogue (which later became the Very catalogue) with 
Shop Direct in April 2003 and was given a £600 credit limit. Miss S missed a payment in 
December 2003 and her credit limit was lowered to £71 (the amount she owed on the 
account). Her credit limit was increased to £175 in March 2004 before again reducing to £74 
in June 2004 after a Miss S fell behind with her repayments, Miss S made a final repayment 
to the account in August 2004 and she then didnt make any further purchases. The account 
was closed in April 2005.
Catalogue 4 
Miss S applied for a Great Universal catalogue (which later became the K&Co catalogue) 
with Shop Direct in September 2003 and was given a £1,800 credit limit. Her credit limit was 
increased to £1,900 in March 2007. Miss S made a final repayment to the account in 
February 2008 and she then didnt make any further purchases. The account was closed in 
August 2008.
The purchases Miss S made through the K&Co catalogue and repaid over 20 or 52 weeks 
were interest free. But any purchases repaid over a longer period or on the buy now pay 
later basis would attract interest.
Catalogue 5
Miss S applied for an Empire Stores catalogue in August 2006. Shop Direct acquired the 
Empire Stores account on 05 June 2008 (it was previously operated by another lender) and 
it was rebranded to the K&Co catalogue. At that time her credit limit stood at £2,200. This 
was increased by £200 in January and in April 2009, taking her credit limit to £2,600. Miss S 
made a final repayment to the account in March 2009 and she then didnt make any further 
purchases. The account was closed in September 2009.
Catalogue 6 
Miss S applied for a Very catalogue with Shop Direct in December 2012 and was given a 
£1,500 credit limit. Miss S didnt make any purchases and the account was closed in August 
2013.
Miss S complained to Shop Direct in September 2019. She said that Shop Direct shouldnt 
have given/increased the credit limits on her catalogue accounts because she couldnt afford 
to repay the amounts within a reasonable timescale. She explained that she was self-
employed and had a poor credit record at the time.
Shop Direct says it did check whether the catalogue accounts and credit limit increases were 
affordable, and based on those checks, Miss S credit file and repayment history suggested 
she wasnt in financial difficulty and could afford the repayments. Unhappy with Shop 
Directs response, Miss S referred her complaint to this service.
Our investigator explained that the Financial Ombudsman Service gained its power to look 
into complaints about consumer credit (including catalogue shopping) on 6 April 2007. And 
that this meant we could only consider her complaint about the credit limit increases which 
happened from after that point. She thought Shop Direct shouldnt have increased Miss S 
credit limits beyond the level they were at when we got our powers in April 2007.
Shop Direct replied to the investigator and pointed out Miss S only ever borrowed a fraction 
of the available credit and the most she owed at any one time was less than the lowest limit 
on all accounts. It meant that Miss S wasnt due a refund. Our investigator agreed that Miss wasnt due a refund but Miss S remained unconvinced, so 
this complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Ombudsman Service isnt free to deal with every complaint it receives. Its 
bound by rules that determine what it can and cant look at. Those rules are set out in the 
Financial Conduct Authoritys (the FCA) Handbook under the Dispute Resolution 
Rules(DISP).
Section 2 of DISP sets out the jurisdiction of the Financial Ombudsman Service. It covers 
areas like whos making the complaint, what its about and which business its about. As our 
investigator explained, the Financial Ombudsman Service got its powers to consider 
complaints about consumer credit (which includes catalogue shopping) on 6 April 2007 and 
we can only consider matters that happened from this point forward  not before. So, for this 
complaint, it means I cannot consider Miss S complaint about any of the lending decisions 
Shop Direct made on catalogues 3 & 4, nor her applications for credit on catalogues 1,2 and 
5. I can only consider her application for catalogue 6 and the credit limit changes on 
catalogues 1,2 and 5 which happened after April 2007.
When the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, or contradictory, Ive made my decision on 
the balance of probabilities  which, in other words, means Ive based it on what I think is 
most likely to have happened given the available evidence and the wider circumstances. 
Weve set out our approach to complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on 
our website. And Ive taken this into account in deciding Miss S complaint. 
Having done all of that, I dont think Shop Direct needs to take action to correct anything it 
may have got wrong with the credit limits it set for Miss S.
Shop Direct needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend to Miss S 
irresponsibly. It should have completed reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that Miss S would be able to pay her credit limits in a sustainable way each time they 
changed. 
Shop Direct has provided statement histories for each of Miss S accounts. They show that 
the most Miss S owed at any point was in October 2016, when she owed £701 on catalogue 
2  any instances when the balance went above this amount, Miss S then returned the 
goods and received refunds within the same month she had been billed and didnt need to 
make repayments on them. So, whilst her combined total credit limit across all accounts 
peeked at £9,800 in June 2008, it is only necessary for me to consider whether the £1,100 
and £1,000 credit limits given on catalogues 1 and 2 respectively in June 2009 were 
appropriate for Miss S circumstances at the time. I say this because the amounts Miss S 
owed did not go above these limits. 
Shop Direct explained that it reduced Miss S credit limits on catalogues 1 and 2 as a 
precaution because she had missed a payment the previous month  her statements show 
that she missed a £5 payment in May 2009 on catalogue 2 (having paid double in April 
2009). Catalogues 1,2 and 5 were active at the time and Miss S was £4 in credit on 
catalogue 1, she didnt owe a balance on catalogue 5, and she owed only £77 on catalogue 
2.
Miss S has provided copies of accounts showing her self-employed income in 2008/9 and 
that she had earnt around £11,400 before tax. She has also provided bank statements which 
show her account had been over £4,000 overdrawn for a sustained period leading up to 
June 2009. I dont think this information alone wouldve prevented Shop Direct from offering the £1,100 and £1,000 credit limits  noting that it was reducing her existing limits by £3,100 
and up until recently, Miss S repayment history hadnt been of concern.
I think it is important to recognise that Im considering events that pre-date Miss S complaint 
by over a decade. So, its understandable that Shop Direct cant now show the external 
information about Miss S wider financial position that it considered at the time. And even if I 
were to put more weight on Miss S testimony and find that Shop Direct shouldve reduced 
her credit limits further still, Im not persuaded a credit limit in the region of £700  the most 
she owed on her accounts at any one time  would have been inappropriate.
I note that under the terms of the Littlewoods and K&Co catalogues, interest was not 
charged if the payment for goods were 20 weeks or 52 weeks. I can see from the statement 
history that the longest time Miss S owed a continuous balance was for 10 months and that 
she hadnt used the buy now pay later facility. So, I find it unlikely that she paid any interest 
on these catalogues (1,4 and 5). 
I accept Miss S was charged for late payments but Im not persuaded that these came as 
result of Shop Direct setting too high a credit limit. I say this because Miss S always owed 
very much less than her credit limit at the time she was charged for late payment.
Finally, Miss S also referred her complaint about catalogue account 6. Shop Directs 
statement history shows that Miss S didnt use this account over the 10 months it was open. 
So, there isnt a need to consider the limit set by Shop Direct because Miss S cannot have 
been caused a loss.
In summary, Shop Direct set credit limits across Miss S catalogue accounts at levels higher 
than I would likely consider responsible based on the evidence I have available. But Miss S 
hasnt lost out because I think more modest credit limits in keeping with the levels of Miss S 
actual borrowing would have been appropriate. For this reason, I dont think Shop Direct 
needs to take action to correct anything it may have got wrong with the credit limits it set for 
Miss S.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 January 2023.
