The complaint
Mr H complains that Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, lent to him 
irresponsibly and without carrying out proper affordability checks. He would like all the fees 
and charges associated with the loan refunded.
What happened
In June 2016 118 118 Money approved a loan of £3,500 for Mr H, which was scheduled to 
be repaid at approximately £274 per month over a term of 24 months. The loan was 
intended to consolidate some of Mr Hs other borrowing. When assessing the application, 
118 118 Money asked Mr H about his financial circumstances and carried out a credit check 
before approving the lending.
Unfortunately, a few months into the term of the loan in October 2016 Mr H ran into financial 
difficulties and appears to have entered a repayment plan which reduced his monthly 
repayments to £50. This plan continued and indeed the repayments increased to £70 in 
October 2017 and then to £79 in August 2018. However, it appears the debt was written off 
in 2019.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H clearly feels very strongly about his complaint and says that 118 118 Money should 
have realised that he was unable to afford this borrowing. And I can understand why the fact 
that he couldnt sustain the repayments so quickly into the term would reinforce that feeling.
But I need to look at what information 118 118 Money had when considering Mr Hs loan 
application, and what information it should have gathered, given what it knew about Mr H 
and his circumstances.
118 118 Money asked Mr H about his income and expenditure. He disclosed monthly 
earnings of £2,400 and outgoings of just under £1,000. Those outgoings were broken down 
into various categories, including housing costs, council tax, insurance, food, and amounts 
needed to service other debts. More than half of Mr Hs declared outgoings came under this 
final category. But as he reported that he was single and living with his parents, the 
comparatively modest amounts he declared for other monthly living costs dont seem 
implausible. So, based on what Mr H told it about his financial situation, 118 118 Money 
could have concluded that he had a disposable income of nearly £1,500. Clearly more than 
enough to service a monthly repayment of around £274.
However, in addition to asking Mr H about his financial circumstances, 118 118 Money 
carried out a credit check, which showed a different picture to that disclosed by Mr H. 
Crucially, it showed that he had a far bigger debt burden, with monthly repayments in the 
region of £1,200  around twice what he had declared in his application. 118 118 Money 
says it noted this, and so increased Mr Hs outgoings, and decreased his approximate 
disposable income, accordingly. Following that significant adjustment, Mr H appeared to 
have a disposable income of about £700 per month. Still enough to service the proposed 
monthly repayment of around £274.
Mr H says that the repayment to 118 118 Money simply replaced existing debt repayments, 
and so didnt reduce his outgoings. But that is to some extent the point of a consolidation 
loan  alternative borrowing to overall improve someones financial situation. Given the 
purpose of this loan, 118 118 Money could have factored that into its affordability 
assessment  that is, that some of his other debts would be cleared, and so the repayment 
to 118 118 Money would not be fully in addition to Mr Hs existing monthly borrowing bill. 
However, it doesnt seem to have done that, instead working on the premise that his existing 
monthly debt repayments would continue, with this new borrowing on top of that. And even 
on that basis, the borrowing looked affordable based on the available information.
I accept that the information 118 118 Money had, in the form of Mr Hs disclosures and the 
credit check it completed, might not have actually presented a full picture of Mr Hs 
circumstances. But 118 118 Money wasnt advancing a particularly large sum of money, the 
term of the loan was towards the shorter end of the spectrum, and it was at the very start of 
a lending relationship with Mr H. And in these circumstances, it was entitled to trust and rely 
on the information he gave it. When the credit check showed a higher level of indebtedness 
than Mr H had disclosed, 118 118 Money factored that in to its assessment. But, ultimately, 
all the available information at the time showed that Mr H was able to service the undeniably 
large amount of debt he had, and had enough disposable income to take on this further 
commitment.
Ive seen nothing to suggest that 118 118 Money ought to have carried out more in-depth 
checks than it did. And the information it had showed that this borrowing ought to have been 
affordable for Mr H. I accept, and am very sorry to see, that wasnt actually the case. But it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to say that 118 118 Money should have identified that 
in June 2016.
My final decision
Having considered all the evidence, I dont think that 118 118 Money did anything wrong, so 
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 December 2020.
