The complaint
Mr H complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has not refunded payments he says 
he did not authorise.
What happened
Mr H says that he did not have access to his PayPal account for an extended period of time. 
He says when he was able to regain access to it in late August 2021 he discovered that 
payments had been made which he did not recognise. Mr H contacted PayPal to dispute 
these payments.
PayPal looked into what Mr H had said. It refunded one of the payments Mr H had said he 
was disputing  although PayPal says this refund was an error  but refused to refund any 
further payments as it said there was no evidence fraud had taken place.
Mr H disagreed, so he referred his complaint to our service. One of our Investigators looked 
into Mr Hs concerns. But as Mr H had not supplied a full list of all the payments he was 
disputing, the Investigator did not feel they could safely reach a conclusion regarding Mr Hs 
complaint. Mr H maintained that he had sent us a list of the disputed transactions, so as no 
way forward could be agreed the complaint was referred to me for a decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 30 November 2022. Neither PayPal nor 
Mr H responded to that provisional decision with any additional comments or evidence.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision I explained the following:
The relevant law here is the Payment Services Regulations 2017, and broadly speaking
Mr H is responsible for any payments that he has authorised (either by making them himself
or allowing someone else to) and he isnt responsible for unauthorised payments.
PayPals records show that in September 2021 Mr H contacted it to dispute payments made 
from his PayPal account while he says he was unable to access it. It appears this may have 
been from as far back as 2019. PayPals records show that although it investigated the 
payments and did not agree there was any sign of fraud, it had inadvertently told Mr H that 
one payment for £85 would be refunded. So PayPal refunded the £85 to Mr H as it had 
previously promised. PayPal also noted that it could only see that Mr Hs account had been 
blocked for one day, not for the extended period Mr H says his account was blocked for.
Mr H has not provided a full list of the payments he says he didnt make, or any specific date 
range where he says he wasnt using the account. He has though noted a couple of retailers 
that he says he did not make payments to. 
PayPal has provided evidence to show the log in activity on Mr Hs account. This data shows 
that Mr Hs account was accessed regularly via mobile log in until March 2021. And some of 
the IP addresses that Mr Hs PayPal account was logged into from do match with the 
general area where Mr H lives. I can also see that the email address associated with Mr Hs 
PayPal account has remained the same throughout the period from 2019 to the present. If a 
third party had gained access to his account, then its not clear why they wouldnt have 
changed this. During this period PayPals evidence does show payments made to retailers 
that Mr H has said he did not make payments to, but at least some of these transactions 
were made for goods to be sent to Mr Hs home address.
Without more specific detail from Mr H about which payments he claims he did not make, its 
difficult to say that there is any clear evidence of fraud here. I say this because:
-The payments that appear to be in dispute do not reflect what we would usually 
expect if there had been fraudulent activity  the payments were for small amounts 
over a long period of time. 
-Evidence supports that at least some of these payments were for goods to be sent to 
Mr Hs home address  which would again be very unusual activity for a fraudster.
-PayPals evidence suggest its likely that Mr H was accessing his PayPal account via 
mobile for at least some of the period that seems to be in dispute.
I appreciate this will be disappointing for Mr H, but with what Ive seen so far, I dont consider 
that I can reasonably say PayPal has treated him unfairly. The evidence available does not 
support that there has been fraudulent activity here, so it follows that it was reasonable for 
PayPal to decline to refund the disputed payments.
As neither PayPal nor Mr H provided any further comments or evidence in response to my 
provisional decision I see no reason to change my findings. So I remain satisfied that PayPal 
has treated Mr H fairly and wont be asking it to refund any of the disputed payments to 
Mr H.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 January 2023.
