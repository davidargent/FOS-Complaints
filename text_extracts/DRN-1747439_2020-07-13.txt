Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Bs complaint and thought the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because he didnt seem to be managing his finances and 
appeared to be dependent on this type of borrowing. Cashfloat didnt respond to the 
adjudicators assessment. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Cashfloat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Cashfloat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Cashfloat was required to establish 
whether Mr B could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Cashfloat needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 4.     
Mr B didnt respond to the view. As there is no dispute about these loans, I wont be making 
any findings on them.
Cashfloat says it carried out checks before it lent loan 5 to Mr B and the results of these 
checks didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Mr Bs fifth loan in five months, I think 
Cashfloat should have been looking to build a clearer picture about Mr Bs finances before 
lending him this loan. 
I say this because Cashfloats records show Mr B was borrowing from other short-term 
lenders and the repayments for all these loans were increasing his monthly outgoings. This 
behaviour is most likely an indication that he was in a cycle of debt and was further 
borrowing to cover the hole that repaying his previous loans was leaving in his finances. And Cashfloat ought to have realise that Mr B would have struggled to sustainably repay this loan 
without borrowing again. I think this was proven to be the case when he returned to borrow 
again just over a week after he repaid loan 5. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Cashfloats lending history with Mr B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Cashfloat should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Cashfloat should have realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because: 
At this point Cashfloat ought to have realised Mr B was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr B had taken out six loans in eight months. So Cashfloat ought 
to have realised it was more likely that Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. 
Mr Bs first loan was for £200 and loan 6 was for £300. By now, Cashfloat ought to 
have known that it was unlikely that Mr B was borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 6 onwards Mr B was provided with a new loan within days of repaying a 
previous one. 
He also wasnt really making any inroads to the amount he owed Cashfloat. Loan 16 
was taken out around three and half years after his first. Mr B had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Cashfloat over an extended period.
I think that Mr B lost out because Cashfloat provided borrowing for loan 6 onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Mr B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding Mr Bs complaint about loans 5 to 16 and Cashfloat should put things right. 
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 5 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loan 5 from Mr Bs credit file;
the number of loans taken from 6 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 to 16 should be removed from Mr Bs 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Cashfloat to take off tax from this interest. Cashfloat must give   
Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Bs complaint. Western Circle Ltd 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2020.
