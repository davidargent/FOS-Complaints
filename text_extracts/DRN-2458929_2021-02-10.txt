DRN-2458929
The complaint
Mr D complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wrongly removed a credit he received 
to his account.
What happened
Mr D sold a mobile phone using an online website. The buyer paid him £706 using PayPal 
as the payment service. The buyer said that the item was significantly not as described 
(SNAD). Mr D complains that PayPal refunded the money to the seller, but he didnt receive 
the item back.
PayPal says that it received tracking information from the buyer showing delivery and that 
the item was signed for. It provided this to Mr D. It made a decision on the dispute on the 
information available.
Our investigator recommended that the complaint be upheld and Mr D paid £706. He said 
that hed looked at the relevant terms and conditions of PayPals buyer protection. Under 6a 
it stated that PayPal may require the buyer to post back to the payment recipient, to PayPal 
or to a third party (as PayPal may direct) an item that the buyer claims is SNAD and to 
provide Proof of Delivery. It went on to say that:
Proof of Delivery for tangible items means online documentation from a postal company that 
includes all of the following:
1. A status of delivered (or equivalent) and the date of delivery.
2. The recipients address, showing at least the city/county or postcode (or international 
equivalent).
Our investigator said that PayPal had only provided the tracking number and told him it had 
provided Mr Ds address to the buyer. Mr D said that this delivery hadnt related to his 
postcode. And our investigators own attempts on the postal tracking website didnt establish 
that the item had been delivered to Mr Ds address and indicated that a different postcode 
seemed to have been used. He wasnt persuaded that the item had been sent to the correct 
address and also didnt think that PayPal had followed its own terms and conditions. Mr D 
had engaged with both the buyer and PayPal over the dispute and was thought genuine.
PayPal didnt agree. It said that it hadnt been provided with any evidence and couldnt take 
Mr Ds or our investigators word about things. The tracking had proved delivery. And it had 
contacted Mr D on 1 December 2019 to ask him to respond and sent him reminders and he 
hadnt done so. The terms of its seller protection required him to respond in a timely manner. 
Mr D hadnt confirmed the item hadnt been delivered and had the opportunity to do so. 
PayPal stressed that it had made its decision on the dispute on the information available.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr D has provided a number of documents about this dispute. Hes shown that he 
responded to comments from the buyer about the concerns. And that on 1 December 2019 
Mr D, not the buyer, asked PayPal that this be escalated to a dispute. On 3 December 2019 
he set out that dispute as requested and said that given that the phone had been used he 
would offer £500 to the buyer if it was returned. On 3 December 2019 he received a 
response from PayPal stating that weve decided the best course of action is to have the 
buyer return the item to you. On 6 December 2019 it wrote to him again and said when you 
receive the item, please let us know through the Resolution Centre in your PayPal account. 
Otherwise, well try to use the tracking information provided by the buyer to confirm delivery. 
The payment was refunded to the buyer and on 10 December 2019 Mr D wrote to PayPal to 
say that he hadnt had the phone back. In response PayPal said that following its email of 1 
December 2019 because we didnt receive a response within the timeframe provided we 
had to decide this claim in favour of the buyer.
I dont think PayPal has fairly established that Mr D didnt respond appropriately within any 
timescales provided. While he didnt say that the phone hadnt been delivered before 10 
December 2019 he had actually been asked to confirm when it was. And the tracking 
information PayPal has provided showed that an item had been delivered on 5 December 
2019 which wasnt communicated to him. The real question then for him on 6 December 
2019 was whether he had the phone back or not.
Mr D says he hasnt received the phone. In the absence of any evidence that he did our 
investigator tried to find any other tracking information. And frankly I think it was up to 
PayPal to demonstrate that the phone was sent and delivered to Mr Ds address  not for  
Mr D to prove a negative. Having said that the results from our investigator are also entirely 
consistent with what Mr D says and support him having a genuine loss.
While PayPal makes the decision on such a dispute I dont think that has been reached fairly 
here. And I accept as most likely Mr Ds account of events taking into account the email 
correspondence that supports that. I have nothing to show that the item was both sent back 
by the buyer and delivered to the correct address for Mr D in line with the terms and 
conditions. And I dont think Mr D was given a reasonable opportunity to challenge that it 
hadnt been given that lack of evidence.
Putting things right
I agree with our investigator that Mr D should be credited with £706 to put him back in the 
position he ought to have been in.My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to 
credit Mr D with £706.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 March 2021.
