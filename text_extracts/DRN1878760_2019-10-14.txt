K822xcomplaint
Mr D says Casheuronet UK LLC trading  as QuickQuid lent to him irresponsibly. He feels  that 
they didnt do sufficient checks to make  sure he was in a position to repay the loans. He 
says his financial situation was poor and QuickQuid shouldve seen this and not lent to him.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that Mr Ds complaint should be 
upheld from loan 3a onwards. 
QuickQuid didnt fully agree  with what our adjudicator said but it made an offer to pay 
compensation for loans 7 to 10, and apply this compensation to his outstanding  balance on 
loan 11. Mr D didnt  accept this offer. So as no agreement has been  reached the complaint 
has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN18787602QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr D 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.  Ive decided to uphold Mr Ds 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Mr D didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 3. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr D had with QuickQuid. 
So they are something  I will take into account when considering the other loans he took.
The loans Mr D was taking were  all repayable over a number of months. QuickQuid says 
that Mr D wouldve been able to save on the earlier lower  repayments to make  the higher 
final one. But by loan 3a he clearly wasnt doing  this as this was his third loan in quick 
succession. And the amounts he was borrowing had increased by a large  amount. 
For loan 3a Mr D borrowed a significant  amount  against his monthly income. And the highest  
repayment was close to all of the disposable  income  that QuickQuid recorded he had. And 
Mr D had experienced previous problems repaying  some of his earlier  loans. 
Ref: DRN18787603So I think QuickQuid shouldve realised  that Mr D wouldnt have been able repay  loans 3a 
and 4 in a sustainable way as it was likely he was having problems managing his money. So 
I think that QuickQuid shouldnt have given loans  3a to 4 to Mr D and I think hes lost out as 
a result of this. So Im upholding  Mr Ds complaint about loans 3a and 4.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 5 to 11 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids 
lending history with Mr D, with a view to seeing  if there was a point at which  QuickQuid 
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. 
And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ds case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
5. I say this because:
up to loan 5 the amounts Mr D was borrowing had been significantly increasing. He 
borrowed £250 for loan 1 and, after the increase, £1,400 for loan 5. And going 
forward Mr D was provided with a new loan within  days  of settling a previous one. 
So QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr D was having  to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ds indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.  This was borne 
out later on when Mr D had significant  problems  repaying loans 9 and 10 and he 
hasnt fully repaid  loan 11
Mr D wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. Loan  11a 
was taken out over 4 years after Mr Ds first. And it was for a larger  amount. 
Mr D had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect; service a debt to QuickQuid 
over an extended period.  QuickQuids  records show that Mr D borrowed more than 
£18,000 over a four year period  and he paid just under £8,000 in interest. I dont see 
how QuickQuid can say that its reasonable to lend for this amount, over this time, 
using a product  that is meant  to help with short term cash  flow problems
I think that Mr D lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans and extensions was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 to 11a and QuickQuid should put things 
right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 3a to 11a;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 and 4 from Mr Ds credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 11a should be removed from 
Mr Ds credit file.
Ref: DRN18787604If Mr D still owes  QuickQuid any of the principal balance he borrowed on his final loan 
QuickQuid should  remove all the interest  and charges applied  to the outstanding balance. 
QuickQuid should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Mr D went  towards 
the principal. But importantly, QuickQuid needs to make sure that Mr D doesnt repay more 
than the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Mr D hasnt repaid  the principal he borrowed QuickQuid can deduct  this 
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr D has already paid enough to repay the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple*  interest from the 
date of payment  to the date of settlement.
And if QuickQuid no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr D.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ds complaint.
Casheuronet UK LLC should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 November  2019.
