The complaint
Mrs K is unhappy with how NewDay Ltd responded to concerns she had about potential 
fraud occurring on her account.
What happened
Mrs K had a NewDay administered credit account. In October 2021, Mrs K received an email 
from NewDay which stated that her credit account application had been received and that a 
new PIN would be sent to her. This was of concern to Mrs K as she hadnt made a new 
application or requested a new PIN. A similar email was received by Mrs K the following 
month, in November 2021. Mrs K wasnt happy about this and was concerned that fraudulent 
activity might be occurring on her account. So, she raised a complaint.
NewDay looked at Mrs Ks complaint. They issued a response which began by referencing 
an incorrect complaint issue. However, the complaint response then continued by confirming 
that NewDay had no record of sending the emails to Mrs K that Mrs K had concerns about 
and suggested that the emails might have been received from an illegitimate sender.
Mrs K wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this 
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint and liaised with NewDay about it. 
In response, NewDay reassessed Mrs Ks complaint and agreed that the initial response 
hadnt been of the standard they aspire too, including that it hadnt attempted to address or 
alleviate the fraud concerns that Mrs K had. Because of this, NewDay made an offer of £30 
compensation to be paid to Mrs K in acknowledge of the lack of content within their initial 
complaint response and the trouble and upset that this may have caused.
Upon completing their review, our investigator felt that NewDays offer of £30 compensation 
did represent a fair and reasonable resolution to what had happened. However, Mrs K 
remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how Mrs K might have had concerns having received the emails that she 
did. However, NewDay have confirmed that they have no record of sending these emails to 
Mrs K, and having reviewed the emails its notable that the email address from which they 
were sent isnt a match to NewDays own email address format.
As such, Im satisfied that the emails that Mrs K received were most likely sent by an 
illegitimate party and were an attempted scam  albeit a sophisticated and convincing one. 
And given the professional looking content and format of these emails, I can appreciate why 
Mrs K believed that they may have come from NewDay directly.
Luckily, Mrs K seems to have recognised that the emails may not have been legitimate, and 
so approached NewDay advising of her concerns about potential fraud. So, I can appreciate 
how it must have been unsettling for Mrs K to have received a response from NewDay that 
initially addressed a different concern to the one that shed raised, and which then did little to 
alleviate her concerns about potential fraud occurring on her account.
NewDay have acknowledged these points themselves during their correspondence with this 
service, and theyve made an offer to pay £30 compensation to Mrs K in recognition of any 
upset or trouble their response to Mrs K may have caused. 
Matters of compensation can be subjective, with an offer considered as being fair and 
reasonable by one party not being considered as being such by someone else. But the £30 
that NewDay have offered here does feel fair to me, given the full circumstances of this 
complaint, and I can confirm that its commensurate with what I may have instructed 
NewDay to pay as compensation to Mrs K, had they not already offered to do so.
In arriving at this position Ive considered that NewDay dont appear to have sent the emails 
under consideration, and only became aware of them when Mrs K brought her concerns to 
NewDay. As such, the compensation under consideration here isnt for the issuance of 
incorrect emails by NewDay, but only for the way which NewDay responded to Mrs Ks 
concerns about those emails. And while I accept that NewDays response should have been 
more accurate and reassuring, I feel the £30 NewDay have offered to Mrs K does provide 
fair compensation for the standard of that initial response that NewDay issued to Mrs K.
So, while I will be upholding this complaint in Mrs Ks favour, I will only be doing so in order 
to formalise the £30 offer of compensation to Mrs K that NewDay have already made. I 
realise this might not be the outcome that Mrs K was wanting, but I hope shell understand, 
given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
Putting things right
NewDay must make a payment of £30 to Mrs K.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2022.
