The complaint
Ms B complains that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, should not have agreed her credit card 
application or increased her credit limit as the lending was both unaffordable and 
irresponsible.
What happened
Ms B is represented in this complaint. However, for the sake of simplicity in this decision I 
have referred to all the submissions from Ms Bs representative as being made by Ms B. 
Ms B applied and was accepted for an Aqua credit card with NewDay in November 2016. 
Over the next three years she was offered several credit limit increases. The dates of these 
are as follows:
Date Limit
1st increase March 2017 £1,250
2nd increase September 2017 £2,250
3rd increase January 2018 £2,750
1st Decrease July 2018 £1,450
4th increase July 2019 £2,450
In December 2021 Ms B complained to NewDay. She said she was provided with credit she 
could not afford nor was it sustainable given her financial circumstances.
In its final response NewDay said it was satisfied Ms B had been provided with the account 
correctly and in line with NewDays responsible lending policy. It went on to say that it was 
satisfied that each credit limit increase was provided to Ms B correctly, again, in line with its 
lending policy. It said it was also satisfied adequate checks were completed to ensure these 
were affordable. 
Ms B didnt agree and brought her complaint to this service. Our investigator concluded the 
checks NewDay did during the application stage of the credit card were reasonable and 
proportionate and he didnt think there was any indication that Ms B would have had difficulty 
repaying the account. But he thought that the checks NewDay did prior to the first credit limit 
increase and for the subsequent increases, were not reasonable and proportionate. He also 
concluded that had NewDay done such checks they wouldve likely shown that Ms B 
wouldnt have been able to make her repayments sustainably and that NewDay wouldnt 
have lent to her on that basis. 
 
NewDay didnt agree and asked for a final decision from an ombudsman. It said it still 
believed it acted fairly and that sufficient checks had been done. It said they had no 
indication of any financial strain for Ms B and there was nothing which indicated that Ms B 
would struggle to make repayments. It said she had no arrears, no defaults, no payday 
loans, no over limit fees, and no late payment fees.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible 
lending - including the key relevant rules, guidance, and good industry practice - on our 
website and Ive taken that into account when I have considered Ms Bs complaint.
Before granting credit, NewDay was required to carry out a reasonable and proportionate 
assessment of Ms Bs ability to sustainably repay the debt. This is often referred to as an 
affordability check. This check had to be borrower-focussed. This means it needed to be 
concerned with whether Ms B could sustainably afford the borrowing (considering her 
specific circumstances), rather than how statistically likely she was to repay. The latter is the 
risk posed to NewDay as the lender, or their credit risk but this is not necessarily the same 
as an assessment of affordability.
Whats considered reasonable and proportionate will vary depending on several factors and 
there isnt a one-size-fits-all approach to what is considered proportionate. 
Account application
Date Limit
Account opening November 2016 £250
NewDay said it doesn't rely on evidence of income and expenditure by way of bank 
statements. It said, for example, when assessing creditworthiness, it used the information 
submitted by Ms B, which was then verified against several external data sources.
NewDay went on to explain it assesses applications for affordability via a credit reference 
agency income and expenditure model. It said the underwriting data for Ms Bs application 
showed that NewDay completed reasonable and proportionate checks before accepting the 
application. 
As part of the checks NewDay did at the time of the application Ms B told NewDay that she 
worked as a part-time contractor, and her annual income was £18,000. The checks NewDay 
did with credit reference agencies showed she owed approximately £200 to other creditors, 
and all her credit accounts were up to date with no sign of any historic credit problems.
Its important to note that the checks must be proportionate to the amount being lent  so the 
higher the amount, the greater the checks likely should be, and the lower the amount, then 
less thorough checks can potentially be made. In this case the original application was for a 
modest credit limit of £250. I think the checks done by NewDay were reasonable and 
proportionate and I've not seen any evidence that this credit limit would be unaffordable for 
Ms B. 
1st Credit limit increase
Date Limit
1st increase March 2017 £1,250
NewDay offered Ms B a credit limit increase from £250 to £1,250 three months after the 
account was opened. Given it was such a short time after the account opening there isnt a 
lot of data to support how she was managing the account for NewDay to rely on when 
deciding to increase her credit limit. NewDay hasnt provided any evidence that it sought further information after the account opening. So NewDay wouldve likely relied on the 
information Ms B provided when she opened the account and on information from credit 
reference agencies either at the time of the application or updated two to three months later. 
As I mentioned above an opening credit limit of £250 was modest but as Ms B's lending 
increased so I would expect NewDays affordability checks prior to lending more to be 
deeper. A £1,250 increase is a fourfold increase on her original limit and given its proximity 
in time to the account opening it appears NewDay relied only on the application information 
when assessing the affordability of this increase.
I say this because Ms B's lending appeared to have increased sharply after she opened her 
NewDay account according to the credit data provided to NewDay. She had only one 
account when she applied for the card, with £200 owed to her creditors. When NewDay 
applied the credit limit increase this had increased to four accounts with nearly £1000 owed 
to creditors. So, I believe further reasonable and proportionate checks to verify her income 
were likely needed to ensure payments would be sustainable for the increased credit limit.
Ms B provided this service with bank statements from November 2016 onwards. In her 
application data Ms B said she was a part-time contractor with an annual income of £18,000. 
This would equate to an average of £1,500 per month. From the bank statements I can see 
that Ms B's income from employment was intermittent and significantly lower than £1,500 
per month  around £200-400 in the months prior to the increase. Ms B was also in receipt 
of tax credits and child benefit which formed a substantial portion of her income. Im 
persuaded that had NewDay verified her income it wouldve shown that Ms B would be 
unlikely to sustainably afford repayments on a credit limit of £1,250. And I think it unlikely it 
would have increased Ms B's credit limit as it did.
Subsequent credit limit increases
Date Limit
2nd increase September 2017 £2,250
3rd increase January 2018 £2,750
1st Decrease July 2018 £1,450
4th increase July 2019 £2,450
NewDay applied two further credit limit increases proactively to Ms B taking her credit limit to 
£2,750. As Ive concluded that NewDay should have completed further affordability checks 
prior to the first increase and I think it likely these checks wouldve impacted NewDays 
lending to Ms B it follows that this wouldve also impacted the lending decisions of 
September 2017 and January 2018. I note from NewDays affordability data Ms Bs 
unsecured credit had increased to almost £1,946 in September 2017 and £3,632 in January 
2018. Had NewDay verified Ms Bs income for the increases in these periods it would have 
likely seen that Ms Bs financial situation hadnt improved. Her monthly income through 
employment appeared to remain substantially below £1,500 and she was relying on her 
benefits and financial payments from her partner. In August 2017 Ms B was able to make 
payments totalling £1,360 to her NewDay credit card account but, having examined her bank 
statements, Im persuaded this was only possible because of significant payments into her 
bank account by her partner. 
It is also noticeable that Ms Bs bank statements consistently do not show any utility, council 
tax or rental payments going out and that along with tax credits she is in receipt of child 
benefit for one child. This indicates to me she has a dependent child and that she herself 
was likely financially dependent on her partner or others. 
In July 2018 NewDay wrote to Ms B to say it had reviewed her account and was reducing her credit limit to £1,450. But NewDay hasnt explained how it came to decide that a £1,450 
credit limit was affordable for Ms B. I can see that Ms B hasnt missed payments or 
exceeded her limit. In its response to this service NewDay said that Ms B fell into financial 
hardship a year after her final credit limit increase. And that there is no evidence of her 
financial difficulty prior to the increases.  In its letter to Ms B dated July 2018 NewDay said it 
felt the limit of £1,450 to be more appropriate. This suggests to me that NewDay was 
somewhat aware of the need to reduce Ms B's credit limit, because it did, which would 
indicate Ms B was under some financial pressure. At the time of the credit limit increase 
there is a public record (e.g. County Court Judgement) noted on Ms Bs credit file. 
A year later NewDay increased the credit limit again to £2,450. As Ms B already had one 
public record on her credit file and an increasing debt burden (around £4,500) since the 
credit limit had reduced, I consider that further reasonable and proportionate checks were 
likely necessary to see if the new limit was affordable. I say this because NewDay had 
reduced her credit limit to what it thought was more appropriate. And so, I would expect that 
a subsequent decision to increase the credit limit would be based on new or revised 
information about Ms Bs financial situation to ensure that increasing the limit was also 
appropriate.
While I accept that Ms B was making payments and not exceeding her limit this represents 
an assessment of the risk posed to NewDay, it doesnt necessarily mean the payments were 
affordable. Further checks could have included verification of Ms Bs income, and at this 
point Im persuaded that proportionate checks should have also included a review of Ms Bs 
income verses expenditure. I say this because NewDay had previously reduced her credit 
limit while Ms Bs debt burden had increased along with the public record appearing on her 
credit file.
Had NewDay done this it would likely have seen that Ms B continued to rely on benefits, 
including by now Income Support, and assistance from her partner. And that Ms B had 
started to make payments to a debt collection company.
Ms Bs debts appear to reduce occasionally. But I note no substantial payments towards her 
NewDay account from Ms Bs own bank account. And as our investigator noted it doesnt 
appear to make any difference to her overall situation. Ms Bs financial circumstances hadnt 
changed much, if at all, since NewDay agreed to increase the limit in March 2017. And so 
there appears to be no obvious reason that she would be able to take on more credit beyond 
the first increase.
In summary I'm persuaded that NewDay should have implemented further affordability 
checks prior to the credit limit increases in September 2017 and January 2018. I'm also 
persuaded NewDay was aware that Ms B was under some financial pressure because it 
reduced her credit limit in July 2018. And as a result of that I think NewDay should have at 
least verified Ms B's income prior to the increase in July 2019. Had it done so I think 
NewDay would have concluded that payments on the credit limit of £2,450 wouldnt have 
been affordable for Ms B. So, Im persuaded that NewDay shouldnt have increased Ms Bs 
credit limit from £250. 
After our investigator issued their view Ms B noted that her second NewDay credit card 
account had not been considered within this complaint. I note that on the original complaint 
to NewDay only the Aqua credit card was the subject of the complaint. In its final response 
NewDay only considered the Aqua credit card. If Ms B believes that her second credit card 
was unaffordable and that NewDay lent to her irresponsibly she must first complain to 
NewDay so that it has a chance to investigate prior to bringing the complaint to this service.Putting things right
As I don't think NewDay should have increased Ms B's credit limit from £250 I don't think it's 
fair for it to charge any interest or charges on any balances which exceeded that limit. 
However, Ms B has had the benefit of all the money she spent on the account.
To put things right NewDay Ltd must:
Rework the account removing all interest, fees, charges, and insurances (not already 
refunded) that have been applied to balances above after March 2017.
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Ms B along with 
8% simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. NewDay should also remove all adverse information recorded 
after March 2017 regarding this account from Ms Bs credit file. 
Or, if after the rework the outstanding balance still exceeds £250, NewDay should 
arrange an affordable repayment plan with Ms B for the remaining amount. Once Ms 
B has cleared the outstanding balance, any adverse information recorded after 
March 2017 in relation to the account should be removed from her credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs may require NewDay to take off tax from this interest. If it does,
NewDay must give Ms B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she should ask 
for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, must put 
things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 January 2023.
