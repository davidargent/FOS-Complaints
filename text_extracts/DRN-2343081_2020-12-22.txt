The complaint
Miss A complains that the credit provided to her by Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as 
Tesco Bank, wasnt affordable for her.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by our 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
Miss A applied for a Tesco Bank credit card in January 2015 and her application was 
accepted with a credit limit of £1,800  I consider that to have been fair and 
reasonable;
Miss A applied for an increase in her credit limit to £2,500 in August 2017, but by 
then shed stopped paid work - Tesco Bank says that it made some credit checks 
which showed that she had a net monthly income of £1,500, that she had unsecured 
debts of £6,500 and that her indebtedness index was 6  and it increased her credit 
limit to £2,500;
Miss A exceeded that credit limit in June 2018 and didnt make the minimum monthly 
repayment the following month  Tesco Bank agreed to not charge interest for six 
months;
Miss A complained to this service and then contacted Tesco Bank in January 2020 
and asked it for help with the interest that she was paying  but it said that shed 
been able to maintain her minimum monthly payment so it was unable to freeze any 
interest charges as the account wasnt in arrears;
our investigator didnt think that Tesco Bank had carried out proportionate checks 
when considering Miss As request to increase her credit limit and that, had it done 
so, it wouldve found that she was unemployed and would struggle to repay any 
additional borrowing  so he didnt think that it was fair for Tesco Bank to have 
increased her credit limit;
he recommended that Tesco Bank should rework Miss As account to remove the 
effect of any interest and charges accrued on the account as a result of the credit 
limit increase that took place in August 2017;
Tesco Bank says that Miss A exceeding her credit limit shows that her initial credit 
limit wasnt appropriate for her and that shes maintained her payments which shows 
that the credit limit was affordable for her  it also says that she completed an 
application process for the credit limit increase which required her to provide details 
of her income and that the  information that she provided was similar to that in her 
original application;
a credit provider should make proportionate checks about the affordability of credit 
before its provided to a customer  whats proportionate will depend on the 
circumstances of the credit;
Miss A had had a credit limit of £1,800 since January 2015 and she applied for that 
limit to be increased to £2,500 in August 2017;
Im not persuaded that the checks carried out by Tesco Bank were proportionate in 
these circumstances  Miss A had exceeded her credit limit seven times during the 
period that shed had the credit card and in that time her unsecured debts had 
increased from £1,922 to £6,500  and I consider that it would have been reasonable 
to expect it to have done more than it did to check that the increase in her credit limit 
would be affordable for her;
Miss A had provided it with information to show that her income was similar to that in 
her original application  which wasnt correct  but I consider that, if it had carried 
out proportionate checks, it would have discovered that she wasnt employed and 
that an increase in her credit limit wasnt affordable for her; 
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Tesco Bank to 
rework Miss As credit card account to remove the effect of any interest and charges 
accrued on the account as a result of the credit limit increase that took place in 
August 2017; and
Miss A has had the benefit of the credit that was provided to her and Im not 
persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Tesco Bank to write-
off any of the credit that it provided to her  but I suggest that she contacts it again 
about her financial difficulties to try to agree an affordable repayment arrangement 
for the amount that she owes to it (after her account has been reworked as described 
above)  Tesco Banks required to respond to her financial difficulties positively and 
sympathetically.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Tesco Bank to rework Miss As credit card 
account as described above.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss As complaint and I order Tesco Personal Finance plc, 
trading as Tesco Bank, to rework Miss As credit card account to remove the effect of any 
interest and charges accrued on the account as a result of the credit limit increase that took 
place in August 2017.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 January 2021.
