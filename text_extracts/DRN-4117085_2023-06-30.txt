The complaint
Mr H complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA failed to properly deal with his claim of 
fraud.
What happened
Mr H noticed three payments were made to a company Ill refer to as D. Mr H had an 
agreement with D to let them take payments from his bank account with his account with 
PayPal. PayPal were the payment processor for these payments. 
Mr H told PayPal that he hadnt authorised the three payments and he thought they were 
fraudulent. PayPal didnt think the payments were fraudulent from the information they had 
and advised Mr H to contact D about them. PayPal then told Mr H that the disputed 
transactions were later refunded to his account by D.
Mr H had several calls with PayPal about the issue and believed they didnt want to help him 
and treated him poorly. Mr H suffers from conditions that were made worse by the stress 
caused by this.
PayPal also refunded a different payment in error which meant money kept going in and out 
of Mr Hs linked bank account. 
PayPal provided two vouchers to Mr H totalling £70 to recognise the stress hed felt but 
didnt think theyd treated him poorly or dealt with his claim of fraud wrongly.
After making a complaint to PayPal about the situation, Mr H brought it to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service for an independent review. It was looked into by one of our 
investigators who considered evidence from both Mr H and PayPal about the situation.
After reviewing the evidence, the investigator didnt uphold the complaint against PayPal. 
She thought that there had been some errors (the additional refund), but the response from 
PayPal was fair.
Mr H disagreed and specifically wanted the phone calls hed had with PayPal listened to. He 
also said that he could no longer access his account. PayPal provided copies of the calls 
between Mr H and themselves. They also confirmed the account had extra security added to 
it due to the fraud issues raised at the time. PayPal said that once completed, they would 
automatically be removed and Mr H would be able to access to the account again. 
Mr H continued to disagree with the outcome and asked for a further review of his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are three businesses involved in the transactions disputed by Mr H. PayPal, his bank 
and D. Its clear there was some confusion when dealing with the claims raised by Mr H. But 
this complaint is only about PayPal.
Id like to confirm to Mr H that Ive considered all the evidence related to his complaint. I 
havent mentioned all the issues he raised because I didnt think it was necessary to reach a 
fair conclusion.
The disputed transactions were refunded about three days after they were taken from the 
account. So Im not considering this part of the complaint. Thats because Mr H is back in the 
position he would have been if the payments hadnt been taken from his account. 
Ive listened to the calls between Mr H and PayPal about this issue. Its clear that during one 
call, the conversation was challenging and both Mr H and the agent would talk over each 
other, making it hard to understand what was said. This call ended suddenly, and Mr H 
thinks the agent he was dealing with put the phone down on him. I recognise the strength of 
Mr Hs feelings here, and that he thinks the call was ended by the agent. Its not possible to 
work out if it was ended on purpose or if the call just disconnected. I do accept that Mr H was 
annoyed by the call, but I dont think PayPal were trying to avoid dealing with the matter.
Regarding Mr Hs access to the account  PayPal have said that the extra security (at the 
time of their response) hadnt yet been completed by Mr H. My understanding is that once 
this is completed, the account can be accessed and the vouchers used. 
It looks like PayPal added more confusion with another refund which meant money was 
moving in and out of the account, no doubt causing more distress to Mr H as he didnt know 
what was happening. This didnt result in Mr H losing any money permanently and PayPals 
response, which was to provide vouchers worth £70 was, I think, a fair way for them to 
recognise the extra stress caused to Mr H. I wont be asking PayPal to do anything else 
regarding this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2023.
