The complaint
E, a limited company are unhappy about the way National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)  
handled their business bank account, reserve account and loan.  
What happened
 E complained to NatWest about the way their accounts had been handled. They raised 
several concerns but in summary said:
In December 2019, NatWest cancelled a direct debit set up from Es 
business current account to their loan account in error. They then used that 
cancellation as grounds for closing  the company bank accounts without 
notification on 23 January 2020.
Es point of contact at NatWest was withdrawn along with access to online banking 
after the loan was passed to recoveries. NatWest continued to apply interest to the 
loan account, despite E being unable to discuss it with anyone or review the 
statements. 
NatWest refused to sign a letter of indemnification for a third party bank. In 
doing so, NatWest stopped E from being able to open an alternative 
business bank account.
In February 2020, a third party made a payment to their closed current account. 
This payment should have been returned to the payee, but NatWest allocated the 
money to the loan account instead. NatWest also refused to help when the 
payment was challenged. 
When a payment was due to HMRC in respect of a VAT amount due, HMRC 
were advised by NatWest that E had stopped trading. NatWest also 
compromised Es position with HMRC because there was a severe delay in 
NatWest providing them with their account statements.
In a letter dated 7 August 2020, NatWest enclosed a letter showing details of 
another individuals account, including personal information. This is therefore a 
data protection breach which NatWest should investigate and take seriously. 
Since January 2020 NatWest have continued to change their address details, 
making it difficult to ensure that any communications are delivered correctly or 
appropriately. Theyve also failed to provide adequate assistance or answer all of 
Es questions. 
In response, NatWest said they didnt think theyd done anything wrong as theyd correctly  
followed their debt recovery processes and procedures. However, they'd reconsider some of 
the complaint points if additional information was provided. Specifically, they requested 
evidence in relation to Es concerns about HMRC, details of the funds E believed NatWest 
had allocated to the loan account in error, and a copy of the letter dated  7 August 2020. E 
didnt provide this information before referring their complaint to our service.
Our investigator concluded NatWest had treated E fairly, so they didnt uphold the complaint. 
They didnt think it was likely NatWest cancelled the direct debit and said this wasnt the 
reason Es accounts were closed in any event. They also said NatWests request for 
additional information was reasonable under the circumstances.
As this didnt resolve things, Ive considered the complaint afresh. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigators conclusions for the following reasons.
NatWest havent been able to confirm who cancelled the direct debit. However, the 
contact notes suggest Es representative asked for the direct debit to be delayed in 
December 2019. The representative also said they intended on making a manual 
payment and they were aware of the precarious nature of the account. In response, 
NatWests adviser said E could cancel the direct debit directly, but debt recovery 
action would take place if the payment wasnt received. The contact notes for a 
conversation in January 2020 also say He ( Es representative) advised that they 
were being sensible by cancelling the DD as they did not have funds available. So, 
while I cant say for certain what happened, the available evidence does suggest it's 
more likely E cancelled the direct debit than NatWest. The contact notes also 
suggest E were aware of the different payment methods open to them and the 
importance of making payments on time.
Im satisfied its likely NatWest would still have closed Es accounts regardless of the 
direct debit issue. I say this as E had unfortunately struggled to adequately maintain 
the loan account for some time, despite being referred to NatWests specialist team 
in January 2019 for help. I also note that a formal demand and 60 day closure notice 
was sent to E on 19 November 2019. These notices explained the company 
accounts would be closed, if the loan arrears werent cleared and the account 
brought back up to date. As E didnt comply with these notices, Im satisfied NatWest 
acted fairly by closing the accounts when they did. Im also satisfied E were given 
sufficient warning of NatWests intended actions for the same reason. 
Once Es bank and reserve accounts were closed, the loan was passed to NatWests 
debt recovery team. As a result, online banking was stopped and statements were no 
longer automatically issued. I appreciate E found this inconvenient, but I dont think 
NatWest acted unreasonably here, as this is their normal process for business 
accounts in recoveries. I also dont find this process surprising or unusual as many 
banks act in a similar way.
E have said NatWest should remove the interest they applied to the loan after it 
moved to recoveries as E couldnt discuss it with anyone. This request isnt 
supported by the available documentary evidence as the call notes show, E had 
conversations with NatWest in January and February 2020. Im aware E have said 
the conversation in January didnt take place, but I see no grounds for disregarding 
the notes NatWest have provided to evidence this call. I also note that all of 
NatWests contact details are clearly stated on their website. So, I dont agree E were reasonably prevented from discussing the account or making payment 
arrangements. 
Im unable to establish why E didnt receive the requested account statements until 
September 2020. However, Im satisfied NatWest sent them within a reasonable time 
frame of each request being made. Specifically, I note that statements were first 
requested on 31 March 2020 and NatWest processed this request on 7 April 2020. I 
also note that further statements were sent to E on later dates including                       
September 2020.
NatWest havent been able to provide a copy of the indemnification letter they were 
asked to complete. So, I cant be certain what it said. However, Ive reviewed 
NatWests internal notes about this issue, and they say they declined to sign the 
letter as it would impact the loans security. I appreciate this made things difficult for 
E, as it meant they couldnt open the bank account they wanted. But under the 
circumstances, I dont think NatWest acted unreasonably. The loan security was put 
in place to protect NatWests position. So, I wouldnt reasonably expect them to 
discharge this security until after the loan is settled. This remains the case, 
regardless of any potential negative impact to E.
NatWest have said they arent aware of any credits being made to the current 
account after it closed. However, theyd be willing to investigate this concern further 
should E provide additional details. E havent responded to this request, so I dont 
think NatWest acted unreasonably by not investigating this concern any further. In 
any event, Ive checked the loan statements to see if anything appears unusual. I can 
see a payment was received from a third party in February, but this appears to be a 
direct external payment into the loan account. The statements dont suggest NatWest 
interfered with this transaction, or that the money was transferred from the closed 
current account. So, under the circumstances I dont think there is enough evidence 
to suggest NatWest made an error here.
E havent provided any documentary evidence to support their concerns about 
NatWests contact with HMRC. NatWest have also denied any error in relation to this 
and Ive not identified anything that would support Es position, based on the 
information I've reviewed. So, I dont see any grounds for upholding this concern. 
NatWest have asked E to send them a copy of the letter they received on                  
7 August 2020, as E have said it included a third partys personal information. Im 
satisfied this was a reasonable request as NatWest have a responsibility to 
investigate any potential data breach. A copy of the letter would therefore help them 
understand what happened and if necessary - put things right for the third party 
involved. If E no longer have a copy of the letter, Im sure NatWest would appreciate 
confirmation of this and any additional information that might help them investigate 
the matter. I appreciate the reasons this issue may have caused E some concern, 
however as the potential error appears to relate to a third partys data rather than Es, 
I dont think it had a significant impact. If E have any concerns about the way 
NatWest have handled their own data, they'd need to discuss this with NatWest in 
the first instance. They are also free to contact the Information Commissioners Office 
(ICO) as this is the body which deals with alleged data breaches.
Finally, while Ive seen some evidence that suggests NatWest use different reference 
numbers for Es different accounts, I havent seen anything which suggests they gave 
E multiple different addresses to use. Im also satisfied NatWest have provided E with a reasonable response to their complaint points and questions based on the 
information Ive reviewed.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask E to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 January 2022.
