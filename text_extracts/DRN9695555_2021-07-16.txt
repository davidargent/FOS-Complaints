Mr T says Nationwide Building Society mis-sold  him a payment protection  insurance  (PPI)  
policy. 
background and summary to complaint
Mr T bought  the policy in 1997 at the same time as taking out a loan. He applied  for the loan 
and PPI policy in a branch. 
The policys  one-off upfront  premium of £141.40  was paid in advance  by being added  to the 
loan (a single premium)  where it attracted interest  over the term of the loan. The loan was 
repayable over a 36 month term and the policy term matched that of the loan The monthly 
loan repayment  was £52.53 with the PPI costing an additional £4.95 making the total 
monthly repayment £57.48. 
The policy provided  cover  for Mr T for accident,  sickness, unemployment and life  subject to 
its exclusions and limitations.  It offered to repay  Mr Ts monthly loan repayment for up to the 
remaining loan term in the event of a successful disability claim and 12 in the event of 
unemployment. 
At the time,  Mr T was employed as a security  officer. He has told us he was entitled  to 12 
months worth of employee  benefits  although when Nationwide checked  this with him he 
confirmed it was in fact 6 months at full pay followed by 6 months at half pay. He also told us 
he was also entitled  to death  in service benefits.  But he didnt have any other  means of 
repaying their loan should he be unable  to work. Mr T has said he was in good  health at the 
time of the sale, although he told us about having  had a tonsillectomy when he was aged 
around 14.
Nationwide has sent us screenshots to show that the loan account closed in June 1998
Mr Ts representative  has made lengthy  and substantial representations on his behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have  read and considered  them all carefully. In 
summary, Mr Ts representative  says:
Nationwide failed  to meet  the sales standards which  applied  at the time. In those  
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on 
handling PPI complaints  under  DISP  APP 3, it should be presumed  Mr T wouldnt 
have taken out the policy and the complaint should be upheld.  Mr Ts representatives 
believe there to be no evidence to rebut that presumption;
The policy excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress,  which  are some  of the 
most common reasons people  are off work. This significantly reduced  the value of 
cover;
The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a 
successful claim  meant the policy was of inherently poor value as shown by the low 
claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good  faith means Nationwide  should 
have told Mr T about the poor value; 
The cancellation terms  were  unfair;
Ref: DRN96955552The common law duty of utmost good faith also means Nationwide  should have 
explained the significance of the exclusions and limitations of cover to Mr T and the 
impact they would have had on his chances of making a claim.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint  both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Mr T disagreed  with the adjudicators opinion  for 
several reasons.  
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; relevant regulators rules, guidance  and standards;  relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mr Ts. I dont intend to set that out in 
much detail here but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Ts complaint
This sale took place  in 1997 before the General Insurance Standards Council (GISC) 
published its code  of practice in June 2000  and before the sale of general insurance 
products like this became  regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC code, the FSAs (and 
FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses  and insurance conduct rules (ICOB and 
ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint,  nor is the FCAs Perimeter  guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself concluded  in 1998. That means the unfair relationship  provisions 
set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court judgment in Plevin  about  
s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance made by the FCA about the handling  of 
complaints about  the non-disclosure of commission  in light of the Plevin  judgment,  arent 
applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at that time, which Im satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular,  The Association of British Insurers  General Insurance Business 
Code of Practice for all intermediaries  (Including  Employees of Insurance Companies) other  
than Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. 
The ABI code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
Ref: DRN96955553The Resume for Intermediaries  
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected  of 
intermediaries like Nationwide at the time. So Im satisfied I should  take the ABI code and 
these other  publications into account when deciding, what  is in my opinion,  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of Mr Ts case.  
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including:  the law relating to 
negligence, contract  (including the express  and implied duty on professional advisers to give 
advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence; the law relating to the utmost  duty of good 
faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness). 
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  Im also required  to take into account  what 
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Office of the Building  Societies 
Ombudsman  might have been expected  to reach  in relation to an equivalent complaint. I 
note that under the Building  Societies  Ombudsmans terms of reference  the Ombudsman  
was required to decide complaints by reference to what  was, in his opinion, fair and 
reasonable in all the circumstances. 
Im also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first issued 
by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating  to the sale 
of PPI. This sale took place before insurance  mediation became a regulated activity, so 
Nationwide was required to take into account  the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were  
guidance when  considering Mr Ts complaint.  
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me that the key questions I need  
to consider in deciding  what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all circumstances of this 
complaint, are:
-If Nationwide gave  advice, whether  it advised  Mr T with reasonable care and skill  in 
particular, whether the policy  was appropriate  or suitable for him, given his needs  
and circumstances.  
-Whether Nationwide gave Mr T sufficient, appropriate and timely information to 
enable him to make an informed  choice about whether to take out the policy, 
including drawing  to his attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading 
way  the main  provisions  of the policy and significant limitations and exclusions. 
-If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Mr T, I 
must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Mr T suffered loss or 
damage and what  I consider would amount to fair compensation for that loss or 
damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mr T and 
Nationwide, Ive decided  not to uphold  Mr Ts complaint. Ive set out my reasoning  below. 
did Mr T know He had a choice?
Ref: DRN96955554Nationwide had to make it clear that the PPI policy was optional. Ive seen Mr Ts loan 
application form. There was a section on the form about adding  PPI where the applicant 
could either  tick yes or no to having this type of cover. I see that Mr T ticked the yes 
option and also signed his name directly below this. He signed the application at the bottom 
too. Also, I see Mr Ts credit agreement, which he also signed, said the PPI was optional.
So, taking everything  into account, I think there is strong evidence  that Mr T knew new the 
policy was optional and he agreed to take it out without undue pressure.
did Nationwide provide  advice?
Nationwide says it didnt  provide advice  during  this sale. Mr T hasnt recalled whether he 
was advised to take out the PPI. However,  looking at what  happened  when Nationwide  sold 
Mr T the PPI, taking into account what I know about  how sales of these single premium 
policies tended to take place, Im not persuaded that it provided advice. This means 
Nationwide didnt have  to check if the PPI was suitable for Mr T. Instead,  it had to give him 
sufficient, appropriate  and timely  information to enable Mr T to make an informed choice 
about whether  to take out the policy, including drawing to his attention and highlighting  in 
a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main provisions of the policy  and significant 
limitations and exclusions.  
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not that Mr T was given a broad description of what  the 
policy was intended  to cover (that is that the policy would protect his payments if Mr T was 
unable to work through accident,  sickness and unemployment.)  I have reached this 
conclusion given the wording set out on the PPI application form. I think its unlikely Mr T 
would have taken  out the policy  without any sense of what the policy  was. And I think Mr T 
knew that the single premium  being  added to the loan was £141.40, the interest  added  to 
the premium was £36.80 and the total cost was £178.20 (as this information was, in my 
view, sufficiently clear on the loan agreement Mr T signed.)  
But the evidence  from the time of sale doesnt tell us whether  Nationwide gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit or about the exclusions or limitations  before Mr 
T agreed to take out the policy. 
So I dont  think Nationwide gave Mr T sufficient, appropriate and timely information  to enable 
him to make  an informed  choice about  whether to take out the policy, including drawing his 
attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main  provisions of 
the policy and significant limitations and exclusions.  
Ive considered how my findings interact  with the FCAs  list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out at DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, Im persuaded there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Mr Ts representative has raised a number 
of general points in regards  to the requirements on a business when providing information  in 
PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like Mr Ts. Ive considered  
these carefully and summarised them  as:
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mr Ts representative considers to be poor 
Ref: DRN96955555value  and the fact that much of the premium went  to the business  rather than the 
insurer. 
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just 
told Mr T about the limitations  and exclusions, it should have gone further and 
explained the significance of them to him. 
Im not persuaded by Mr Ts representatives views  on this. The duty of utmost good  faith in 
insurance law imposed a duty on both parties  to the contract  to disclose material facts  and 
not to make  material misrepresentations. While I cant be certain what  a court  would say  I 
think its unlikely a court would  find that this extended to the insurer  having  to disclose the 
claims ratio information or explaining  the significance of the limitations and exclusions in the 
way Mr T has suggested. And taking  into account  the law, industry  codes and standards of 
good industry practice applicable to this complaint,  I dont think its fair and reasonable to 
conclude that Nationwide  ought to have done  either. 
What effect did Nationwides shortcomings  have on Mr T? To what extent did Mr T 
suffer loss or damage  as a result?
Ive found that Nationwide didnt  do all it should  have  done  when it sold this policy  to Mr T. 
So Ive gone  on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude Mr T 
suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer  this, I must decide  whether or not Mr T 
would have still taken  out the policy, had Nationwide done things properly. 
Mr T says he would not have taken  it out and believes I should  presume this to be the case  
given the significant failings identified  above.  Ive considered  the representations of both 
sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
As this was a non-advised sale, Mr T had to weigh up in his own mind the cost of the policy  
against the benefits offered and the potential consequences if he didnt insure against the 
risk of being  unable  to work. 
As Ive found above, Mr T chose to take this policy out. So I consider that its reasonable to 
conclude he had some  interest in the benefits offered by this type of insurance. But he made 
this decision based  on incomplete information.  So what Mr T thought he was getting is not 
exactly what he got. The extent to which this differed is a relevant consideration when 
determining if Mr T has suffered any loss or detriment. 
As Ive already  said, the information Mr T was given about the cost of the policy was clear.  
But the information about other aspects of the policy, such as the limitations  and/or 
exclusions wasnt as clear  as it should have been. 
Im not persuaded Nationwide made clear exactly what Mr T would get back in return  in the 
event he made a successful claim. But I think its unlikely Mr Ts expectations about what  the 
policy would pay in the event of a claim (an amount sufficient to meet his loan payments) 
were significantly  different to what the policy actually did.
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mr T thought  he had bought  and 
what he actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to medical  conditions  that Mr T knew  about or 
ought to have known about  before the start date of the policy;  
Ref: DRN96955556The policy limited, and in some situations,  excluded unemployment  cover  if Mr T 
wasnt a permanent employee; and
The requirement that in order to be eligible for a disability claim  Mr T be unable to 
do his own job or any gainful occupation  which his experience,  education or training 
reasonably qualified him to do.
I do accept that there is a possibility the limitations  and exclusions above  might well have 
caused Mr T pause for thought  and may well have  caused  him to conclude that the policy  
wasnt as good  as he thought and he might have decided not to proceed. The limitations on 
the cover, when  coupled with the other  shortcomings in this sale,  might have dissuaded 
some consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mr T from taking out the policy. 
But the evidence  about Mr Ts circumstances at the time of sale shows that the policy wasnt 
fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for him he was eligible for its benefits and it provided  
cover that, despite its limitations and exclusions, couldve proved valuable  to him should  the 
insured risks have  become a reality. Although Mr T told us about  having a tonsillectomy 
when he was aged 14, many years before the policy  was taken out and the policy wouldnt 
have provided  cover  had he needed  time off work  because of this condition,  I dont think  
better information about this exclusion would have put him off agreeing  to it. I say this 
because I havent  seen anything to suggest  that there were any adverse consequences 
arising from the tonsillectomy and in any event  typically I wouldnt expect this type of medical 
procedure to lead to any long term problems. 
And I havent seen  any evidence  to suggest  he wouldve been caught by any of the other 
significant exclusions. So I still think he had some good reasons to take the policy  out.
The policy didnt exclude back or mental  health conditions or place  any additional restrictions  
or more  onerous evidential requirements  in the event of a claim on those grounds than 
would have applied  to any other  disability  claim.  And I think  its unlikely Mr T would have 
expected to make a disability claim on the policy without first providing some  evidence to 
support that claim.
If Mr T had known  he could only claim for disability  if he was not only unable  to do his job but 
also unable  to do any job which in the insurers view he might reasonably be qualified  for, it 
might have played into his thinking  about what he would do. And I accept it may have given 
him pause for thought   although  given Mr Ts circumstances, on balance,  I still think  he 
would have been interested in taking out the cover.
The policy did provide  a pro-rata refund if it was cancelled  early, so the policy provided 
flexibility if Mr T decided to repay  the loan early and cancel the policy.
Having considered all of the evidence  and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not Mr T would still have taken  out the policy. The policy was sufficiently close to what  
its likely  he thought he was getting  and provided  benefits that would  help him manage the 
consequences were  Mr T made  redundant,  or unable to work through accident  or disability. 
In the circumstances I consider it more likely than not that Mr T would have taken out the 
policy in any event notwithstanding the limitations on cover.
Ref: DRN96955557Mr Ts representatives  say the rules about  how to handle PPI complaints (DISP  App 3) make  
it clear that, where a significant failing is identified,  it should be presumed  the consumer 
wouldnt have taken  out PPI, unless there is evidence to outweigh  the presumption.  They  
say we should follow this other than in exceptional  circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration  so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
Ive thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, Ive found it would be reasonable to conclude there were 
substantial flaws in the sales process. In those circumstances,  DISP  App 3 says it should be 
presumed Mr T would  not have bought  the PPI he bought unless, in the particular 
circumstances of the complaint, there  is evidence  to rebut the presumption. 
Im satisfied, applying DISP App 3, it is reasonable to conclude the presumption is rebutted  
in the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account Mr Ts 
circumstances as detailed  above, I consider it reasonable to conclude  the position  Mr T 
found himself in as result  of the sale was the same  position he would  have been  in had the 
breach or significant failings not occurred. 
Mr T believes the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws in the sales  process 
were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were  highly material and we have failed to give 
proper weight to the evidence  including his own comments that he would not have taken 
out the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out at DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), Im only doing  so because I dont consider, in this case, that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mr T in the position he would have been in if he had not 
bought the policy. 
That is because,  while I accept its possible he wouldnt have taken out the policy, Im 
satisfied that of the two possibilities, its more likely than not that he would  still have taken 
out the PPI had he been given clear,  fair and not misleading information about the policy he 
was buying.
So Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable  in those circumstances, to conclude 
Nationwide should  pay Mr T compensation, as that would  put him in a better position than he 
would have been in if everything  had happened as it should have done.  
Ive also thought about the approach Mr Ts representative says a court might take if it were 
to find had been in breach of its duty of utmost good  faith.  But this doesnt  persuade  me to 
alter my conclusions about what is fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of the 
complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the circumstances of this case. For 
the reasons Ive already  set out I dont  think  it would be fair and reasonable to put Mr T in a 
better position than if everything had happened  as it should have done. 
Ref: DRN96955558my final decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 August 2021.
