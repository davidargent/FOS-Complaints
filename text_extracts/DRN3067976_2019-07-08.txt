Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Cs complaint and thought that loan 9 and loans 11 to 13 
shouldnt have been given. Provident  agreed with our adjudicator  and made an offer to settle 
the complaint  on the same basis the adjudicator  recommended. 
Ms C disagreed. She said that she should receive compensation for all of the loans. As no 
agreement was reached the complaint  was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  high cost and short-term lending - including  all of the relevant rules, 
guidance and good industry  practice  - on our website. 
Ref: DRN30679762Provident needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Cs complaint.
Ms C and Provident have  accepted our adjudicators opinion  about loan 9 and loans 11 to 
13. Because of this I dont  think there is any ongoing  disagreement about these loans. And 
having looked at all of the circumstances around  these loans I agree with the proposed 
compensation for them. So I wont  look further into this lending here. 
But they were part of the borrowing relationship Ms C had with Provident. So they are 
something I will take into account when considering the other  loans she took.
As my table above  shows Ms Cs lending followed a pattern  over the time she and Provident 
had a lending  relationship. Ms C would typically take between  one to four loans at a time. 
She repaid these  without any problems. There would then be a break in the lending. The 
shortest break was over six months between  loans 5 and 6 with the longest being over a 
year and half between  loans 1 and 2. 
So, given the number of loans and the length of the breaks, I think  it wouldve  been 
reasonable for Provident to treat Ms C as essentially being a new customer  when she 
borrowed again after a break. Because of this, less thorough checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate. I think this applies in the groups of loans  that started with loans 1, 2, 4, 6 
and 10. 
Looking at the information both sides have supplied I can see that Miss B wasnt  employed 
during the time she borrowed from Provident. That said she did receive regular benefits and 
Ive seen a record  of the information Ms C provided  when she completed her loan 
applications. On average Ms C said she had a weekly income of around £250  and she had 
regular weekly outgoings of around £150.
All of these loans were  for relatively  modest  amounts.  And they were repaid over a longer 
period. So the repayments were lower. Given the loan repayments  were low, and bearing  in 
mind the other factors Ive talked about in respect of Ms Cs lending  pattern,  I think  it 
wouldve been reasonable for Provident to think that Ms C could afford the repayments  to 
loans 1 to 8 and loan 10. 
I havent seen  any further information  that shows its likely Provident was made  aware of any 
financial problems Ms C mightve been  having. Or anything that wouldve prompted it to 
investigate her circumstances  further.  So I think it was reasonable for Provident to rely on 
the information it obtained.
So overall, in these circumstances, I think the assessments  Provident did before  approving  
loans 1 to 8 and loan 10 were proportionate. And I think its decisions to lend for these was 
reasonable. Im not upholding Ms Cs complaint about them.  
Ref: DRN30679763As I said earlier,  Provident should put things right for loan 9 and loans 11 to 13 as it has 
offered to do. 
putting things right  what Provident  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms C paid on loan 9 and loans 11 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
All entries about loan 9 and loans  11 to 13 should be removed from Ms Cs credit file.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Provident  to take off tax from this interest. Provident 
must give Ms C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Ms Cs complaint.
Provident Personal Credit Limited  should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 August 2019
