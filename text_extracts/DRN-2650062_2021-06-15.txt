The complaint
Mr A complains about the amount that hes been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, for damage to a car that had been 
supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement.
What happened
A nearly new car, which had been driven for 100 miles, was supplied to Mr A under a hire 
purchase agreement with Mercedes-Benz Finance that he signed in August 2017. The hire 
purchase agreement had been mis-sold to him so it was agreed that it would waive excess 
mileage charges of £453.70 and that he could end the agreement early. 
The car was collected from him and was then inspected by a third party on behalf of 
Mercedes-Benz Finance in February 2020. The inspection report identified that the car was 
dirty, missing a wheel key and had damaged wheels and bumpers. Mercedes-Benz Finance 
charged Mr A £608 for cleaning the car, the missing wheel key and the damage to the 
bumpers but he complained to it about the charges. It said that it was satisfied that the 
charges had been raised correctly so Mr A complained to this service. 
Our investigator recommended that his complaint should be upheld in part. She thought that 
the charges, other than the £78 charge for the missing wheel key, were in line with the terms 
and conditions of the agreement and the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association 
guidelines  but she recommended that Mercedes-Benz Finance should remove the charge 
of £78 for the missing wheel key.
Mercedes-Benz Finance has accepted that recommendation but Mr A has asked for his 
complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary that he doesnt feel that 
hes liable for the charges, he didnt inflict the damage and there was only limited damage to 
the car when it was collected from him and then driven to be inspected  and that the 
damage could have been incurred after it was collected from him. He says that none of the 
damage, other than to the rear bumper, was shown on the collection report, the damage to 
the bumper was fair wear and tear and hes not liable for any damages that were caused in 
transit.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the hire purchase agreement that Mr A had signed included Mercedes-Benz 
Finances vehicle return standards which said:   you must return the vehicle in line 
with the Vehicle Return Standards  When the vehicle is returned to us, a Vehicle 
Return Standards Inspection will be carried out by trained technicians at the 
nominated De-fleet Centre. The vehicle must be: Free from any broken or damaged 
items with no missing components or parts ; Free from any defects or conditions 
that would be in breach of statutory requirements; Free from accident damage; In 
good, clean and marketable condition;
it also said: if you fail to take reasonable care of the vehicle and fail to maintain the 
vehicle in accordance with the manufacturers guidelines and/or the Vehicle Return 
Standards, you will have to pay our costs either of repairing and/or refurbishing the 
vehicle, or the cost of the consequent reduction in the sale value of the vehicle, as 
compensation;
it was agreed that Mr A would return the car before the term of the agreement ended 
and Mercedes-Benz Finance waived excess mileage charges of £453.70;
the car was collected from Mr A, a collection report was completed and the car was 
then taken to a de-fleet centre for an inspection  which was in accordance with the 
vehicle return standards that Mr A had accepted; 
the inspection report identified that the car was dirty, the alloy wheel key was 
missing, unsatisfactory repairs had been made to the front wheels, the front bumper 
was scratched and the rear bumper was dented;
Mercedes-Benz Finance charged Mr A £10 for cleaning the car, £78 for replacing the 
wheel key, £210 for repairing the front bumper and £310 for repairing the rear 
bumper;
I consider it to be clear from the collection report and the inspection report that the 
car was dirty when it was collected from Mr A and the car was driven for 160 miles 
between the collection report (which recorded its mileage as 24,666) and the 
inspection report (which recorded its mileage as 24,826); 
although the collection report did refer to the condition of the car, the collection took 
place when it was dark and Mr A had agreed to an inspection in accordance with the 
vehicle return standards at the de-fleet centre;
Mr A says that the damage could have been incurred after the car was collected from 
him and, although that could be true, I consider it to be more likely than not that the 
damage was caused in the 24,566 miles that he drove in the car in two and a half 
years rather than in the 160 miles that it was driven between the times of the 
collection and inspection reports;
Mercedes-Benz Finance has accepted our investigators recommendation that it 
shouldnt charge Mr A for the missing wheel key  and I consider it to be more likely 
than not that the damage to the bumpers was present when the car was collected 
from Mr A and that the damage is more than would reasonably be considered to be 
fair wear and tear;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mercedes-Benz 
Finance has acted incorrectly in charging Mr A for cleaning the car and the damage 
to the bumpers; and 
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Mercedes-Benz 
Finance to remove the £78 charge for the missing wheel key from Mr As account but 
I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to remove any 
of the other charges, to pay any other compensation to Mr A or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Finance to remove the £78 
charge for the missing wheel key from Mr As account.My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr As complaint in part and I order Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, to remove the £78 charge for the 
missing wheel key from his account.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2021.
