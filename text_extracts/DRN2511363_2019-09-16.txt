K821x#15complaint
Miss R complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to her in 
an irresponsible manner.
background
Miss R was given 14 loans by Sunny between September 2015 and November 2017. Each 
of the loans was scheduled to be repaid in six monthly instalments. But Miss R repaid each 
of the loans before they were due and she has no outstanding debt with the lender. 
A summary  of Miss Rs borrowing from Sunny is as follows;

Miss Rs complaint has been  assessed by one of our adjudicators. She didnt think  Sunny 
had been wrong  to give the first four loans  to Miss R. But she didnt think Sunny should  have 
agreed to give Miss R the remainder of the loans. So she asked  Sunny  to pay Miss R some  
compensation.
Sunny didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Miss R accepts my decision it is legally binding  on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN25113632Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Miss R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss R could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Rs complaint.
Sunny did some checks before lending to Miss R. It asked her for details of her income, and 
her normal  expenditure.  And it gathered some further information about  her finances from a 
credit reference agency. Sunny has provided  us with a summary of those credit  check  
results and they dont  appear to show anything of additional  concern to Sunny such  as 
bankruptcy, county  court  judgements or that Miss R was having other difficulties  managing 
her money.
Ref: DRN25113633But I think the way in which Miss R was borrowing  from Sunny should  have caused some 
concerns to the lender.  Generally the amounts that Miss R borrowed were relatively small. 
And since she agreed to repay those loans over six months, her monthly repayments were 
smaller than they might have been  if shed taken a normal payday loan. But Miss R often 
borrowed again before  repaying  all her earlier borrowing. She often had two or three  loans 
outstanding at a time.  And towards  the end of her relationship  with Sunny there was a time 
when she had four loans  outstanding. So when looking  at the affordability  of the loans I think  
Sunny needed  to be mindful of the total amounts that Miss R needed to repay each month.
The repayments that Miss R needed to make on her first four loans were relatively modest 
compared to the income that she declared  to Sunny, even after taking account  of her 
needing to repay multiple loans at the same time. So given Miss Rs repayment  amounts, 
what was apparent about her circumstances at the time, and her history  with the lender, 
I dont think it wouldve been  proportionate for Sunny to ask her for the amount of information 
that would  be needed to show the lending was unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Miss R provided or the information Sunny 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
she was saying.  So I dont think Sunny  was wrong to give these four loans to Miss R.
I think by the time she asked for loan 5, Sunny should have realised that it was no longer 
reasonable to base  its lending decision solely on the information  that Miss R was providing. 
I think it needed to take steps to independently verify the true state  of her finances. And had 
it done so Sunny would  have seen the problems that Miss R was facing in managing her 
money. She was borrowing from a number of other short term lenders  loans that she 
would need to repay at the same  time as her loans from Sunny. I think  it would have been 
clear to Sunny that it was unlikely  that Miss R would  be able to repay further  borrowing in a 
sustainable manner,  and so it shouldnt have  given this loan to her.
I think by the time Miss R asked for loan 6 Sunny should have realised that the pattern  of 
Miss Rs borrowing alone should have indicated  that further lending  was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt  provide any further 
loans. 
I say this because:
By the time Miss R asked for loan 6 shed been  borrowing  from Sunny  for a lengthy 
period. This was now her sixth request in less than a year and in that time she wasnt  
making any inroads  to the amount she owed the lender. By then Miss R had paid a 
considerable amount of interest to Sunny to effectively service a debt over an 
extended period.
I accept that there was a small gap between Miss R repaying her third loan and 
asking for loan 5  loan 4 had been repaid before loan 3. But I dont think  that gap 
was sufficient to give any reassurance  to Sunny that Miss Rs finances were  back  on 
track.
From  loan 6 to loan 13 Miss R was provided  with new loans whilst previous 
borrowing was outstanding. As I noted earlier, at the end of this chain of borrowing  
Miss R had four loans  outstanding at the same  time. So Sunny  ought to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Miss R was having to borrow further  to cover the 
Ref: DRN25113634hole the repayments she was making  on her previous  loans was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Rs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
There was a much longer gap of almost seven months between Miss R repaying 
loans 11, 12 and 13 and her asking  to borrow again. But given what  had gone before 
I dont think it would  have been  reasonable for Sunny to conclude this was an 
indication that Miss Rs finances had moved on from whatever situation  had required 
her previous loans,  and particularly given the increased amount she asked  to borrow 
here.
I think that Miss R lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Rs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Miss Rs ability  to access  mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market  for 
these high-cost loans.
So overall I am upholding Miss Rs complaint  about  loans 5 to 14. Sunny needs to pay her 
some compensation.
putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Miss R after, and including, the loan that 
she took on 18 July 2016 (loan  5). So for each of those loans Sunny should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Miss R on the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Rs credit  file in relation to loan 5.
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 14 should be removed from Miss Rs 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Miss Rs complaint and direct Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things  right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 October  2019.
