K821x#15complaint
Mr M says Elevate Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny, irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 13 short term loans Sunny provided to Mr M between 
December 2014  and April 2017. All the loans have  been repaid.  All the loans were  repayable  
by six monthly instalments. Mr Ms lending history is as follows:

Sunny told this service  that as it had charged  Mr M interest for 12 to 18 months, this 
suggested that Mr M could have  been using some  of his credit for reasons  other  than short 
term borrowing needs. So Sunny considered it would have been  appropriate  for it to have 
reviewed Mr Ms circumstances from Loan  11 which it hadnt  done. So it offered to refund 
the interest paid on Loans 11 to 13 and pay simple  interest of 8% on the refunds and amend 
Mr Ms credit file to reflect this. 
Mr M rejected Sunnys offer.
our adjudicators view
Our adjudicator recommended  that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld  in part. As Sunny had 
offered to settle  Loans 11 to 13, the adjudicator said she wouldnt comment  on the 
affordability of these loans. Otherwise she concluded that Loan  10 shouldnt  have  been  
given to Mr M.
Mr M disagreed and responded to say that hed been borrowing payday loans extensively 
since 2009 from other lenders. Hed also had a defaulted account nine months  before  
Loan 1 which should have  shown  on his credit file. He had also maxed  out on his credit 
cards and he was consistently  around  £3,000 overdrawn on his current account. Mr M also 
said that Sunny had rejected a loan application  hed made in February 2016, so he had to 
seek a loan elsewhere.
Ref: DRN08876872Sunny responded to the adjudicators view to say that it hadnt  acknowledged the break  in 
lending between Loans 11 and 12 in its earlier correspondence with this service. So it was 
changing its offer. Sunny  now offered to refund the interest paid on Loans  10 and 11 and 
pay simple interest of 8% on the refunds and remove the entries  on Mr Ms credit  file to 
reflect this. 
Mr M rejected Sunnys offer. He said that he wanted  the ombudsman  to take into account  
the wider financial  issues relating  to his financial position at the time of the loans.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr M 
and to Sunny on 8 August  2019.  I summarise my findings:
Id noted that Sunny  in response to the adjudicators view had offered to provide a refund of 
interest paid by Mr M on Loans 10 and 11 and pay statutory interest on those  refunds  and 
remove the entries on Mr Ms credit  file to reflect this. So, except for ordering  Sunny to 
provide the offered redress later in this decision, I said that I wouldnt make any other 
findings about those loans  other than to provide  context in relation to the other  loans.
Id explained that when  Sunny lent to Mr M the regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) and relevant regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit  Sourcebook  
(CONC). Id said that the CONC contained guidance  for lenders about responsible lending. 
Id noted that Sunny  needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice this meant that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to 
make sure Mr M could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These  checks  could take 
into account a number of different things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment 
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages 
of a lending relationship, I thought  less thorough  checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But Id said that certain  factors  might  point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and 
reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  
These factors included:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Id noted that there might  even come  a point where  the lending  history and pattern of lending  
itself clearly demonstrated that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN08876873Id thought that it was important for me to say that Sunny was required to establish whether 
Mr M could  sustainably repay his loans   not just whether the loan payments were affordable 
on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it didnt automatically follow  this 
was the case.  This was because the CONC defines sustainable as being without undue  
difficulties and in particular the consumer  should be able to make repayments, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it followed that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wouldnt be able to make their repayments  sustainably  if they were unlikely to be 
able to make  their repayments without borrowing further. 
Id carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all meant for Mr Ms complaint.
Sunny had made a number of checks before it lent to Mr M. It had asked him for details of 
his income and from the information it provided to us, it appeared from Loan 4 that Sunny 
had asked him for details of his expenditure. Mr Ms declared income for Loans  1 to 4 was 
£2,200 and from Loans 5 to 11 it was £2,360. This had reduced to £2,350  for Loans  12 and 
13. Sunny  had also said that it asked Mr M for details of his other  credit  commitments.  It then 
checked its credit file data for these and included  them as expenditure for the purposes of its 
affordability calculation.  Whilst  Sunny hadnt provided this service with information  about 
Mr Ms expenditure for Loans 1 to 3, Sunny showed  Mr Ms other  credit  commitments as 
between £189  and £205 for those loans. 
Sunny had also checked Mr Ms credit file before agreeing to the loans. It had provided  us 
with a brief summary  of the results  of its credit checks. It said that Mr M had no other short  
term loans with other lenders. And there  wasnt any adverse information such as bankruptcy, 
IVAs or debt management  plans. 
Mr M had provided his credit report to us. I could see that Mr Ms credit report  showed a 
default on a credit card account in April 2014. But I was also aware that when a lender 
carried out a credit check, the information  it saw didnt usually provide the same level of 
detail that a consumers credit  report would and it wasnt necessarily up to date. A lender 
might only see a small portion of a borrowers credit file, or some data might  be missing  or 
anonymised. I was also aware that not all payday and short term lenders reported to the 
same credit reference agencies. So, this might explain  any differences between the 
information provided by Sunnys credit check and Mr Ms actual situation.
Mr M had referred to other short term lending from 2009. I could see from Mr Ms credit 
report that he had a large number of short term loans from 2009  to September  2013.  I didnt 
know if Sunny would have seen these  on its credit check. But even if it had, the reduced 
amount of short term borrowing from September 2013 until December 2014 (just two other 
short term loans) and one other short  term loan whilst he was borrowing from Sunny might  
have suggested  to Sunny that Mr Ms financial situation had moved on from whatever 
situation had required his previous loans. 
Loans 1 to 4
Loan 1 was for £350 and repayable by six monthly instalments. Mr Ms highest monthly loan 
repayment amount  for Loan 1 was around £111. Loan 1 was still outstanding when Mr M 
Ref: DRN08876874took out Loan 2 for £400 around 12 days later. Id noted that the highest  total monthly 
repayment due for Loans 1 and 2 was around £228. And Loans 1 and 2 were still 
outstanding when Mr M took out Loan 3. I could see that the highest  total monthly repayment 
due for Loans  1, 2 and 3 was £261.79.  Id noted the repayments for Loans  1 to 3 were 
relatively modest compared  to Mr Ms declared  income, although I thought Sunny might 
have been concerned that Mr M was borrowing a third loan from it whilst two loans remained 
to be paid. But Id also noted that Loan  3 was for the amount of £100 and his total monthly 
repayments would increase by just less than £34. This was also early  on in the lending  
relationship between Sunny and Mr M. Although hed asked for three loans in around three 
weeks, potentially his need for the credit could  have resulted from one-off or emergency 
shortfalls in his disposable  income. So I didnt think at that stage of its relationship with Mr M 
that Sunny had any reason to doubt the information hed provided. 
And given  Mr Ms repayment  amounts, what was apparent about his circumstances at the 
time, and his history  with the lender, I didnt think it wouldve  been  proportionate for Sunny to 
have asked him for the amount of information  that would have been needed to show  Loans 1 
to 3 were unsustainable. So I didnt think Sunny was wrong  to give Loans  1 to 3 to Mr M. 
Mr M took out Loan 4 less than three months after hed finished repaying Loan 2. He needed 
to make monthly loan repayments of around £103.  I thought these were again relatively 
modest compared to Mr Ms declared disposable income. 
Given Mr Ms repayment amounts, what was apparent about his circumstances at the time,  
and his history with the lender, I didnt  think it wouldve been proportionate  for Sunny to have 
asked him for the amount of information  that would have been needed to show  Loan 4 was 
unsustainable. So I didnt  think  Sunny  was wrong  to give Loan  4 to Mr M. 
There was a gap of around  six months  between when Mr M repaid Loan  4 and when he took 
out Loan 5. I thought this was significant enough a gap at this stage of Mr Ms borrowing 
history with Sunny to constitute a break in the chain of lending. So I didnt think that Loans 5 
onwards formed part of the same chain of lending Id referred  to above in terms of 
Loans 1 to 4. 
Loans 5 to 9
Loan 5 was for £400 to be repaid over six months  with a monthly repayment of around 
£116.69. 
I noted that Mr M then applied a month  later for another loan but Sunny rejected  the 
application. I didnt  know the reason for the rejection. This was in the lenders discretion. But 
I didnt find it unusual  or untoward for a loan to be provided after an application had been  
rejected.  
Before Mr M had paid off Loan  5, Sunny agreed  Loan 6 for £450 and twelve days later, with 
Loans 5 and 6 outstanding, Sunny provided  Loan  7 to Mr M with the highest total monthly 
repayment for all three loans of around £287. Id noted that the total highest monthly 
commitment for Loans 5 to 7 was still relatively modest when compared to Mr Ms 
disposable income. 
So given Mr Ms repayment amounts, what was apparent about his circumstances at the 
time, and his history  with the lender, I didnt think it wouldve  been  proportionate for Sunny to 
Ref: DRN08876875have asked him for the amount of information  that would have been needed to show  Loans 5 
to 7 were unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr M provided before Loans  5 to 7 or the 
information Sunny shouldve  been aware of, which meant it wouldve been  proportionate to 
start verifying what he was saying.  So I didnt think Sunny was wrong  to give Loans 5 to 7 to 
Mr M. 
Mr M took out Loan 8 whilst Loan 6 was still outstanding with the highest total monthly 
repayment for both loans  of around £354 repayable for around five months. I didnt think  it 
was unreasonable for Sunny to still rely on Mr Ms declared disposable income  of around 
£1,200. But by the time of Loan 8 and as the repayments were a significant  proportion of 
Mr Ms disposable income, I thought Sunny should have supplemented the information it 
held by asking  Mr M some more detailed  questions,  such as whether he was borrowing from 
other short term lenders  at the same time.
I couldnt see any other short term loans in Mr Ms credit  report which were repayable at the 
same time as Loan 8. But, I would also have normally looked at a borrowers bank  
statements for the month before  the loan to see what proportionate checks would likely have 
shown. Unfortunately Id not seen Mr Ms bank statements. Id noted that the adjudicator had 
asked Mr M for his bank  statements in January  2019  so he had had ample time to provide  
these. So I couldnt  say that if Sunny had completed sufficient checks, it would  have found  
that Mr M couldnt afford to repay Loan  8 sustainably. So I couldnt say that Sunny was 
wrong to give Loan 8 to Mr M.
Loan 9 was also taken out whilst  Loan  6 was still outstanding.  But as Loan  9 was 
Mr Ms fifth loan in just over five months, I thought Sunny should  have been concerned that 
Mr M might have  become  reliant on its lending. And I didnt think  it was reasonable for Sunny 
to base its assessment  before Loan  9 on the information provided by Mr M without  taking 
steps to independently  check  what hed declared. So I thought it might have been  
proportionate at this time for Sunny  to have independently reviewed the true state of Mr Ms 
finances. As far as I could  see Sunny didnt do this. 
Again I would have  normally  looked  at the borrowers  bank statements for the month before 
the loan to see what proportionate checks would likely have shown. And again  Id not seen  
Mr Ms bank statements. So I couldnt say that if Sunny  had completed sufficient checks, it 
would have found that Mr M couldnt  afford to repay Loan  9 sustainably. So I couldnt say 
that Sunny was wrong to give Loan 9 to Mr M.
Loans 12 and 13
I noted that there was a gap of almost seven months  between Loans 11 and 12. I thought 
this was significant enough a gap to constitute  a break in the chain of lending.  So I didnt 
think that Loans 12 and 13 formed part of the same chain of lending  Id referred to above in 
terms of Loans 5 to 11. 
Loan 12 was for £350 and repayable by six monthly instalments. Mr Ms highest monthly 
loan repayment  amount  for Loan  12 was around £102. Mr M repaid  Loan 12 six days later.  
And around  three weeks  later Mr M took out Loan  13. The loan amount had reduced to £300  
and it was to be repaid  by six monthly  instalments of around £90. Id noted the repayments 
for Loans 12 and 13 were  relatively modest compared to Mr Ms declared income. 
Ref: DRN08876876Given Mr Ms repayment amounts, what was apparent about his circumstances at the time,  
and his history with the lender, I didnt  think it wouldve been proportionate  for Sunny to have 
asked him for the amount of information  that would have been needed to show  Loans 12 
and 13 were unsustainable. So I didnt think Sunny was wrong to give Loans 12 and 13 to 
Mr M. 
So I said that I intended to uphold this complaint  in part in relation to Loans 10 and 11 as 
Sunny had already offered to settle these. Subject to any further representations by Mr M or 
Sunny my provisional  decision was that I intended to uphold  this complaint in part. I intended 
to order Sunny to:
 1. Refund all interest and any charges Mr M paid on Loans 10 and 11;
 2. Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date they   
were paid to the date of settlement*; and
 3. Remove all entries about Loans  10 and 11 from Mr Ms credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Sunny responded to my provisional decision to say that it was satisfied with it.
Mr M responded to my provisional decision by sending  this service a list of his other loans, 
his credit report and some  of his bank statements.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
As Id said above  with regard to Loans 8 and 9, I dont think  that Sunny had made 
proportionate checks before these loans. I said that I would have normally looked at the 
borrowers bank statements for the month  before the loans to see what  proportionate  checks 
would likely  have shown.  Mr M has provided this service with some information  about his 
financial circumstances which includes a list of his loans,  his credit report  and some bank 
statements. It appears that weve not received  all his statements for the months before 
Loans 8 and 9. Having  read the information  weve received, I cant  safely  say that Sunny 
wouldve seen that Mr M couldnt  sustainably make  the repayments to Loans  8 and 9 if it had 
made proportionate  checks. So Im still not upholding  his complaint about these loans. 
Otherwise Mr M hasnt provided  any information that persuades  me that the outcome I 
reached in my provisional decision  was unreasonable  or incorrect. So my final decision is 
the same  as I outlined  in my provisional  decision and for the same reasons.  It follows  that I 
uphold part of the complaint and require Sunny to pay Mr M some  compensation as set out 
below.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this 
complaint, I order Elevate  Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, to:
Ref: DRN088768771. Refund all interest and any charges Mr M paid on Loans 10 and 11;
2. Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date they    
were paid to the date of settlement*; and
3. Remove all entries about Loans  10 and 11 from Mr Ms credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 October  2019.
