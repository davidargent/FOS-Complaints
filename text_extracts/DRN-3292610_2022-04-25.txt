The complaint
Mrs T complains that she couldnt pay into her account with Capital One (Europe) plc 
(CapOne) because of the pandemic and they told her the wrong balance.
What happened
Mrs T had a credit card from CapOne. On her statement dated 1 September 2020, the 
balance was £216.09 and the limit was £200. On 17 September 2020, she made a payment 
into the account of £167.67. The balance on the statement issued on 1 October 2020 was 
£34.69.
Mrs T complained. She said she couldnt get into the bank to pay into the account because 
of travel restrictions and bank branch closures  due to the pandemic. She said shed called 
CapOne on 14 September 2020 to get the balance to pay off the account; but she was told 
the wrong figure by the call handler. So, she said she only paid off the amount of £167.67  
as she was told. As a result, the account remained open and she was then charged more 
fees and interest. Latterly, in April 2021, she told us she was living in Cyprus and could not 
access the banking system from there to pay the card account. She said CapOne had then 
issued a default notice.
CapOne said that Mrs T had spoken to them on 7 September 2020, with the balance then 
£216.09. They then refunded a late payment fee of £12 and interest of £4.14. Mrs T then 
made a payment of £167.67 on 17 September 2020. Interest of £2.41 was debited to the 
account on 1 October 2020, leaving a balance of £34.69. They refunded a further late 
payment fee of £12 on 9 November 2020.
Mrs T brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said CapOne acted reasonably. CapOne 
didnt have a record of a call from Mrs T on 14 September 2020. Mrs T had made a mobile 
banking payment of £167.67 on 17 September 2020  and she could then have seen the 
balance via her mobile app. Our investigator said that there wasnt any evidence in 
CapOnes records of a conversation on 14 September 2020. CapOne had refunded late 
payment fees of £24 and some interest, which was a fair response from them. He said that 
Mrs T should review her statements to see her up to date balance position, and to 
understand it.
Mrs T asked that her complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs T complains about two things  firstly that she couldnt pay into her account in 2020 due 
to the pandemic. She had a vulnerable small baby, and her husband had lost his job due to 
the pandemic. Because of the lock downs, she couldnt travel to a bank branch, and if she 
couldve done, they were closed. And then after she moved to Cyprus, she couldnt pay in 
from there either. She also complained that she called CapOne on 14 September 2020 and 
was given the wrong figure to pay in to clear the balance  and so this then meant she was 
charged more interest and fees.
On the first complaint, Ive listened to what Mrs T has said. She says she was paid in cash  
and I therefore assume she paid that cash into a bank account, from which she then made 
payments to her CapOne account. Or possibly, paid cash direct to her CapOne account. 
There were lock downs of various kinds through 2020. The Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) made various announcements during the period and it was acknowledged that some 
bank branches would operate reduced opening hours and would also exercise precautions 
such as social distancing. But they werent told or advised to close branches  although 
some had to be temporarily closed where there were staff shortages due to illness. I dont 
have specific knowledge of any temporary closures where Mrs T lived  as the closures 
wouldve been ad hoc, but they would have been temporary and depended on the staffing 
situations. I also think that Mrs T couldve used any branch of any bank, or post office, to use 
for paying in  not necessarily a specific branch of a bank. So  on balance, I dont accept 
that any temporary closure of a bank branch is a valid reason for her not paying into her 
CapOne account. I also see that Mrs T made a payment by mobile phone on  17 September 
2020  and so she did use that method also to access her account and pay into it, and any 
bank closures wouldnt have affected her mobile phone access.
Mrs T says she now cant access her account from Cyprus. But as Ive said, she does have 
CapOnes mobile banking app and presumably that can be used to access her account and 
pay into it from there. If thats not the case because of local restrictions, I dont think I can 
fairly say thats the fault of CapOne.
Mrs Ts second complaint is that she was advised of the wrong balance when she called 
CapOne on 14 September 2020. As a result, she didnt pay enough in and this left a 
balance, on which she was charged interest and fees. I listened to the call Mrs T had with 
Cap One on 7 September 2020  in it, Mrs T said she couldnt get to a bank to pay in. 
CapOne refunded a late payment fee of £12 and interest of £4.14, but the call ended without 
discussing anything else. I then listened to the call that Mrs T had with CapOnes complaints 
team on 4 November 2020  she said shed been misinformed of the balance on 14 
September 2020, and therefore paid in what she was told was the balance. So, Ive then 
considered this. CapOne say they have no record of a call on 14 September 2020  and Ive 
seen their records  nothing is recorded. But the calls of 7 September and 4 November are 
recorded. So  I must make a decision based on the probability of what I think happened 
based on the balance of evidence.
Looking at Mrs Ts card statements - on her statement dated 1 September 2020, the balance 
was £216.09 and the limit was £200. She wouldve had that statement before her if she 
called on 14 September 2020. On 17 September 2020, she made a payment into the 
account of £167.67; via her mobile phone  Ive seen evidence of her logging in on her 
phone. So,  the payment was short by £48.52. Mrs T had said there were some pending 
transactions that she wasnt told about which was the difference. But looking at her 
statement on 1 October 2020  thats not the case. There arent any other transactions. 
There was interest passed on 1 October 2020 of £2.41  so that cant have been the 
difference here. The call handler referred to that in the call on 4 November 2020  which 
may have caused some confusion in Mrs Ts mind. So  the difference wasnt due to 
pending transactions. And  Mrs T must have seen her balance on her mobile banking app 
and on her statements  I think its reasonable to say that consumers do have a 
responsibility to manage their accounts  I think thats the case here. The balance on the 
statement issued on 1 October 2020 was £34.69 and in January 2021 it was £61.10. In September 2020 and November 2020, Cap One refunded late payment fees of £24 and 
interest of £4.14  and I think that  was a reasonable thing to do in Mrs Ts situation.
Mrs T has said that CapOne have sent to her a default notice  and I would encourage her 
to look at her statements and her mobile app to see where her account is now, and contact 
CapOne to agree the way forward.
And so  I wont be asking Cap One to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 May 2022.
