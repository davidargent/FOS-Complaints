The complaint
Mrs B complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Skoda Finance, wasnt of 
satisfactory quality. Shes being helped with her complaint by a friend.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mrs B under a hire purchase agreement with Skoda Finance that 
she signed in June 2016. The car had a fuel leak in March 2021 and the garage that 
repaired it said that it suspected that the fault was due to an injector fuel line not being 
properly tightened. Mrs B complained to Skoda Finance but it said that the agreement ended 
in December 2019, the warranty expired in June 2019 and the fault occurred in March 2021. 
It also said it was reasonable to expect the issue to have been evident earlier on in the 
agreement if it was inherent from the factory. 
Mrs B wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service but our investigator 
didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that it would be fair 
to hold Skoda Finance liable for this repair as too much time has passed since Mrs B 
entered into the agreement. 
Mrs Bs representative, on her behalf has, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. She says, in summary, that:
there's evidence on a web forum of other cars having the same problem and proper 
torque isnt put on the bolts;
its not a serviceable part and is in an inaccessible place in the engine so the problem 
wouldnt have been picked up during a routine service; and
if it hadnt been for the pandemic, the problem is likely to have become apparent 
sooner, quite possibly during the warranty period, but Mrs B drove significantly fewer 
miles during the pandemic.
Mrs B says that the car isnt fit for purpose and it's a potential time bomb - and that she now 
drives around with an axe and a fire extinguisher as she has a fear of the car catching fire.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Skoda Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs B - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mrs B was  a new car and I consider that it was 
reasonable for her to expect that it would be free from even minor defects;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car was supplied to Mrs B in June 2016 and the fuel look occurred in March 2021 
about four years and nine months later;
Mrs B paid Â£348.96 for the fault to be repaired in April 2021 and the garage that 
repaired the car said that it suspected that the fault was: due to injector fuel line 
not being properly tightened - its job sheet shows that the car had been driven for 
35,646 miles at that time; 
Mrs B was able to use the car for about four years and nine months before the fuel 
leak occurred and the car was driven for 35,646 in that time  if there had been a 
fault with the car when it was supplied to Mrs B I consider it to be more likely than not 
that it would have become evident much sooner than that and at a lower mileage;
Mrs Bs representative has referred to evidence on a web forum about other cars 
having the same problem and proper torque not being put on the bolts  but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the fault with Mrs Bs car 
occurred because of an issue with the manufacturing of the car;
she also says that the problem is likely to have become apparent sooner if it hadnt 
been for the pandemic and possibly during the warranty period - but Skoda Finance 
says that the cars warranty expired in June 2019 (about nine months before the 
government imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic) and the fault occurred 
after the car had been driven for 35,646 miles;
Ive seen no evidence to show that there continues to be a fault with the car so I 
consider it to be more likely than not that the repair has dealt with the fault;
I sympathise with Mrs B for the issue that she had with the car and for the concern 
that she now has about driving it  but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to 
Mrs B or that it wasnt fit for purpose; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Skoda Finance to reimburse Mrs B for the repair cost that she incurred, to pay her 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 May 2022.
