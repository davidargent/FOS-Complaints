K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) allowed a cancelled direct 
debit to be paid and also gave him incorrect information about when the direct debit was 
cancelled.
background
Mr M says he cancelled  a direct debit three days before it was due in March  2019 to be 
taken out of his account but NatWest  authorised  the payment. He says the same problem 
took place the following month and when he called NatWest about this, it told him he had 
only just cancelled the direct debit. Mr M says he made a Subject Access Request  (SAR) 
that wasnt complied with and was incorrectly told he needed to cancel the direct debit with 
the company it was set up to pay.
Mr M says NatWest  had no authority to allow the direct debit  payments  to be made and 
question how it could  do so in these circumstances and without his authorisation. He would 
like compensation  and for NatWest to be fined.
NatWest accepts it made a mistake  dealing with part of Mr Ms complaint. It accepts it should 
have checked  the date Mr M cancelled the direct  debit  and explained to him what had 
happened- that the company had requested the money under the direct  debit scheme.  And 
explained that it didnt pay the company  but temporarily took the money  from Mr Ms account 
before returning  shortly  afterwards. NatWest has apologised  and paid Mr M Â£30 
compensation and says its complied with the SAR. 
Mr M brought his complaint to us and our investigator thought  NatWest  had dealt fairly with 
it. The investigator thought the direct debit payment had not been made but the company  in 
question had made a request for it. The investigator  recommended Mr M tell that company 
that he had cancelled the direct debit to avoid future problems. And thought NatWest had 
complied with the SAR.
Mr M doesnt accept that view and says NatWest hasnt complied with the direct debit 
guarantee.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to a similar 
overall view as the investigator. I realise Mr M will be disappointed by my decision.
There is no question here that Mr M cancelled  the direct debit some time in advance of the 
payment date. So I appreciate his frustration to be told by NatWest when he called it, that 
wasnt the case and that it had only just been  cancelled. I accept that as a result of that 
mistake Mr M wasnt given an explanation  about what had happened. But Im satisfied 
NatWest has now apologised for that mistake and has provided Mr M with an explanation 
about what did take place. Im also satisfied that NatWest has paid a fair and reasonable 
amount of compensation which I think fairly reflects the level of its mistake and the impact it 
had on Mr M. I also dont  think  Mr M has suffered any financial loss for the reasons I will 
explain.
Ref: DRN07821392I think on balance here that although  Mr M cancelled the direct  debit,  the company that was 
due the payment still requested it from NatWest.  I dont  think  that is unusual in these  
circumstances and I think it unlikely  that Mr M had told the company  that he had cancelled 
the direct  debit. But I have  not seen any evidence that NatWest allowed the direct debit to be 
processed. I think what took place is that NatWest  took the money  out of Mr Ms account and 
returned it shortly afterwards as part of its internal  process for dealing with this type of 
situation.
I accept that may not have been  clear to Mr M and so I appreciate why he may have thought  
the direct  debit may have processed  against  his instructions. But Im satisfied the payment 
didnt take place and that he didnt lose any money.  So I dont think NatWest  has breached 
the Direct  Debit Guarantee. NatWest  hasnt explained why its systems treat a cancelled 
direct debit in this way but I think it acted fairly by recommending  that Mr M tell the company 
what he had done  to avoid further problems. Mr M hasnt told us of any further problems 
since April 2019 so I think it likely that the problem has been resolved.
Overall whilst I accept  NatWest didnt deal with Mr Ms complaint as it should have Im 
satisfied that its acted fairly be giving Mr M an explanation about what took place and by 
paying a fair and reasonable  amount  of compensation. I can see that NatWest has appeared 
to have complied with Mr Ms SAR and that Mr M hasnt told me that is not the case. So in 
those circumstances  I dont propose to say anything further about that part of the complaint. 
I also make  clear that we are not the regulator  of banks  and building societies and so I cant 
order that NatWest be fined as Mr M would  like.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 February  2020.
