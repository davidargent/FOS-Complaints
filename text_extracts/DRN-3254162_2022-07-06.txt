The complaint
Ms M is unhappy with how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have dealt with a transaction 
she made through it.
What happened
Ms M has explained that she purchased a tumble dryer, priced at £294.97, online on 30 
September 2021. She explained that when purchasing the item, she paid part of the balance 
with a voucher, and selected to pay the remainder of the balance for the item through 
PayPal credit. 
To pay via this method, Ms M noted she went through the relevant application process and 
agreed repay the £294.97 for the tumble dryer over a period of 18 months. With the 
repayment being around £18 a month. Ms M said the transaction went through as expected, 
and she received confirmation of the payment for the tumble dryer being made through 
PayPal credit.
Following this, Ms M said she received a text message from her bank  telling her she was 
going into her overdraft on her current account and would be charged for being within this. 
This didnt seem right to Ms M. So, she checked the transaction history on her bank account, 
and saw that PayPal had taken the funds for the tumble dryer straight from her current 
account, rather than the payment being made by credit. Ms M said this shouldnt have 
happened and complained to PayPal about the situation.
PayPal has said it hasnt done anything wrong here. It noted that its systems showed that 
the funding source Ms M selected for the transaction was her bank account, rather than 
PayPal credit. It said that whilst Ms M had made an application for credit, which was 
approved, this was blocked because Ms M went back and went to alter her address (which 
she didnt then actually change), which triggered a block on Ms M being able to select 
PayPal credit as a funding source.
PayPal said that it would have then shown Ms M that her bank account was being used for 
the transaction, and she then ordered the item. It said Ms M wouldnt have been able to pay 
through PayPal credit at this point.
Because Ms M is unhappy with the situation, she referred her complaint to this service for an 
independent review.
Our investigator looked at this complaint and thought it should be upheld. They said that Ms 
M had provided a screenshot showing she had paid for the item with PayPal credit. And so, 
PayPal shouldnt have taken the payment through another method. With this in mind, the 
investigator recommended that PayPal return the £294.97 to Ms Ms bank account, and 
instead place these funds on PayPal credit as originally intended. 
The investigator also acknowledged that Ms M had said she went into her overdraft because 
of the problem. And said it would be fair for PayPal to provide Ms M with £50 compensation 
for the trouble and upset shed experienced.
Ms M agreed with our investigators recommendations. PayPal disagreed. It again said 
PayPal credit was blocked as a funding source, and so Ms M had to have selected to pay for 
the tumble dryer directly through her bank account instead. It provided a screenshot of what 
it said Ms M would have seen  demonstrating that she would only have been able to select 
available funding sources, such as her bank account. So, Ms M wouldnt have been able to 
complete the transaction using PayPal credit. 
Because PayPal disagreed with our investigators opinion, this complaint has been referred 
to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding this complaint. Ive explained why below.
When considering a complaint such as this, the starting point is the terms of the user 
agreement between PayPal and Ms M. This being because it is the basis of the contract 
between the two parties. On looking at the user agreement I can see that PayPal explains 
the following: 
Linking and Unlinking a Funding Source
()
You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card, a prepaid card (where available) a bank 
account or PayPal Credit (where available) to your PayPal account as a funding source.
We may limit the availability of your funding sources to manage risk.
Ms M has said she applied for PayPal credit, and linked this as a funding source  so she 
was able to choose to pay for the tumble dryer via this method. 
Ive seen screenshots from PayPals system, which confirm this. They show Ms M 
successfully applied for PayPal credit, and it was added as a funding source very shortly 
after. 
Given this, and Ms Ms testimony, Im satisfied Ms M applied for this funding source, with the 
intention of using it to buy the tumble dryer  along with the voucher she had. PayPal doesnt 
dispute this. But it does say that before Ms M completed the transaction it blocked PayPal 
credit as a funding source for this transaction. And it said this would have been clear to 
Ms M. 
It said it would have been clear because it can see Ms M navigated away from the checkout 
page. And when she returned, PayPal credit would have been removed as a payment 
option. And Ms M couldnt have selected it. So, if Ms M had reviewed the page, she would 
have seen her bank account was now the payment method being used. PayPal has provided 
a generic screenshot, to show the sort of thing Ms M would have seen as payment options  
after PayPal credit had been removed. 
I accept the terms and conditions in the user agreement say PayPal is able to remove a 
funding source. And I acknowledge the generic screenshot provided, with PayPal credit 
removed as an option. But Im not satisfied that Ms M wasnt able to select PayPal credit in 
this instance.I say this because Ms M has provided her own screenshot. This shows a record of the 
transaction, after purchase was completed. And it shows PayPal credit and a voucher being 
used. Had this payment method been blocked, and therefore Ms M unable to select it, I 
wouldnt expect the payment confirmation to show her having used this method. It wouldnt 
have been a selectable option. 
This service also reached out to the third-party website the tumble dryer was purchased 
through. And it also said payment was made through PayPal credit too.
 
Given the above, Im satisfied it is most likely that Ms M was able to select PayPal credit, 
and it wasnt made sufficiently clear to her that a payment method had changed, so the 
funds would be taken from elsewhere. So, it doesnt seem reasonable for PayPal to simply 
take the funds out of Ms Ms bank account. Ms M has said if it had been made clear that she 
couldnt pay with PayPal credit in that instance, she wouldnt have carried on with the 
transaction, as she didnt have sufficient funds to buy the item at the time. And Ms M has 
provided me with her bank account statements to show this. 
With this in mind, Im requiring PayPal to credit Ms Ms bank account with the £294.97 it took 
from her account. Ms M does of course still need to pay for the tumble dryer. So, PayPal 
should debit the £294.97 from her PayPal Credit account, as per her original application. 
Ms M has said she isnt seeking to have any overdraft charges returned to her, given these 
charges are linked to other things too. But shes raised the distress and inconvenience the 
situation caused her.
Its clear the situation has been distressing and inconvenient to Ms M. She didnt realise the 
transaction had been taken from her account until her bank warned her of entering her 
overdraft. And on realising this, and the difficult situation she found herself in, I can see why 
Ms M would have been worried. With this in mind, I agree that the compensation of £50, 
recommended by our investigator is fair. I think it recognises the upset the situation has 
caused. So, Im requiring PayPal to pay this too.
My final decision
Given the above, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I require PayPal (Europe) 
Sarl et Cie SCA to:
Refund the £294.27 to Ms M, and instead debit the balance from her PayPal credit 
account. Ms M will then need to pay off the balance through PayPal credit, as 
originally agreed.
Pay Ms M £50 compensation for the trouble and upset caused to her.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2022.
