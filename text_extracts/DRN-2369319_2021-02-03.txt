The complaint
X complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) refused to return a payment 
without her providing identification.
What happened
X says she made a payment to a friend who was organising an end of year gift for a school 
teacher. To arrange this, she made payment of £20 via PayPal as a guest as she didnt hold 
a PayPal account. X says she received an email from PayPal asking for identification but 
wasnt sure if this was correct so checked the payment had been made from her credit card 
account and left it at that. A few days later her friend told her she hadnt received the 
payment and X then sent an email to PayPal enclosing identification by way of a utility bill. 
PayPal told her that this wasnt sufficient and refused to make the payment or refund the 
money to her. X says she isnt a customer of PayPal and doesnt want to send any further 
identification in order for them to return the money she sent. 
PayPal says they have acted in line with the terms and conditions of the user agreement and 
while X isnt a customer by her making the payment as a guest, she has a relationship with 
them. PayPal says they need the further identification asked for to meet their regulatory 
requirements. 
X wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the information available and upheld Xs complaint. The 
investigator felt although the information requested from PayPal wasnt unreasonable, in the 
circumstances as X doesnt now want to proceed with the payment the monies should now 
be returned. 
PayPal werent happy with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to 
an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
  Having done so I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision. 
When looking at this complaint I have considered the case on its own merits and if PayPal 
have acted fairly by holding on to the payment sent by X. 
What happened here is X attempted to make a payment of £20 to a friend using PayPal as a 
guest as she didnt hold an account with them. PayPal held on to the payment because they 
identified it as a potential risk. I can see PayPal asked X to provide identification in order to 
meet their regulatory requirements and while a form of identification was provided, this 
wasnt sufficient for them to either make the payment or return the monies back to X. 
X says she didnt have an account with PayPal and didnt feel the need to provide further 
identification to someone whom she has no relationship with. X now wants the monies 
returned having made alternative arrangements. PayPal says by making the payment as a 
guest, X has entered into a relationship with them and as such is subject to their terms and 
conditions.
I have understood both sides of the argument here and understand both PayPals actions in 
wishing to fulfil their statutory obligations and Xs concerns in providing identification and 
sensitive information to someone she has no ongoing relationship with. PayPal in their final 
response letter asked X to provide the further identification by logging onto her account, but 
this wouldnt have been possible as she doesnt hold an account, emphasising that X wasnt 
being difficult but underlining their request was not straightforward. 
I am satisfied that there are situations where regulations and account terms and conditions 
need to be balanced with the individual risk presented. Here PayPal have a user of their 
service who has provided them with an explanation of the payment and now understands 
that, under their rules, they cant make it, so has asked for the monies to be returned 
instead. I cant see the payment of £20 in this case, given the fact in addition some 
identification has already been provided, gives sufficient cause for concern for PayPal to 
hold on to the payment indefinitely. Nor has PayPal explained exactly why it needs further 
information, or why the regulatory requirements its mentioned here mean that it cant, or 
shouldnt, now return the money to X.
So, to be clear, I accept that PayPal have taken a decision in line with their terms and 
conditions and what they understand to be their regulatory requirements. But, sometimes 
strictly following processes and procedures will result in an unfair outcome for a customer in 
individual circumstances. In my view  thats whats happened here. 
I understand PayPal wont be happy with my decision, but I uphold Xs complaint.
Putting things right
PayPal should return the £20 to the credit card account where X made the payment from 
initially.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask X to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 March 2021.
