The complaint
Mr M complains about the service he received from National Westminster Bank Plc following 
his applications to open two accounts.
What happened
On 29 January 2020 Mr M applied via the internet to open two accounts, one with NatWest 
and one with RBS. The NatWest account was opened on 30 January 2020 and Mr M 
credited it with £30. He credited a further £1601 on 3 February 2020 and then transferred 
£1601 back out.
A digital application was sent to Mr M for the RBS account, as well as a paper application. 
Mr M responded to the digital invite before he received the paper application. The 
documents which Mr M submitted were rejected. Mr M subsequently returned the paper 
application and the account was opened on 5 February 2020.
On 5 February 2020 NatWest made a decision to close both accounts. It sent Mr M a letter 
to advise him of its decision and asked him to attend at his local branch to arrange collection 
of his funds.
Mr M contacted NatWest and said he hadnt received the funds reclaim form. He also 
explained that he couldnt go to a branch because he lived in apart of the UK where there 
werent any NatWest branches.
NatWest apologised to Mr M and sent him £50 compensation. It said he could visit a branch 
of another bank to collect his funds.
When Mr M collected his funds he found that a charge of £1.16 had been applied to the 
account before it was closed.
Mr M complained to the bank and then to this service. He doesnt think the charge is fair. He 
also said hed incurred costs in travelling to the b ranch to collect his funds.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She said NatWests terms and conditions said 
that the use of the account was chargeable. She also said that because Mr M hadnt used 
any of the facilities provided with the account, NatWest hadnt acted fairly in applying the 
charge, but the compensation paid already by NatWest was sufficient to resolve the 
complaint.  
Mr M didnt agree so Ive been asked to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand that it must have been disappointing for Mr M when the accounts were closed. 
Ive thought about whether NatWest acted fairly and reasonably. Having done so, Im 
satisfied that NatWest made a commercial decision to close the accounts, which it is entitled 
to do in line with the terms and conditions. 
Mr M has said that he understands that the bank can close an account at any time. But hes 
unhappy about the service he received and the charge which was applied to the account.
I can see that when NatWest closed the account, it sent Mr M a letter advising him of its 
decision and asking him to complete a funds reclaim form and attend a local branch to 
collect his funds. But NatWest omitted to include the funds release form which meant that Mr 
M had to spend time contacting the bank to obtain one.
NatWest has acknowledged that it made an error here and has paid compensation. Ive 
thought about whether it was reasonable to require Mr M to attend at a branch to collect his 
funds. NatWest has explained that it needed to do this so  it could confirm Mr Ms identity 
and make sure that the funds were released to the correct person.  On balance, I think this 
was a reasonable requirement by NatWest.
Ive thought about whether NatWest acted fairly in applying charges to the account. Mr M 
has said that he didnt use any of the account facilities. NatWest has said that the terms and 
conditions of the account make it clear that there is a charge for the account. It says it has 
applied the charge to reflect the amount of time the account was open.
Give the very short amount of time that the account was open before NatWest closed it, and 
given that Mr M didnt use any of the facilities for which the charge applied, I dont think it 
was fair for NatWest to apply the charge. That said, I think the compensation already paid is 
sufficient to compensate Mr M for the service failings and the small charge applied.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2021.
