The complaint
Mr and Mrs T complain that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly declined their application 
for additional borrowing under their mortgage. 
What happened
Mr and Mrs T applied for additional borrowing under their mortgage in late 2019. NatWest 
declined. Mrs T says shes been told theres an internal marker which means NatWest wont 
lend to them.
NatWest said Mrs T shouldnt have been told theres an internal marker as this is for internal 
use only. It paid compensation of £250 for any upset caused. Mrs T says this misses the 
point: shed like the marker removed. Mr and Mrs T wants to re-organise their borrowing at a 
better interest rate and Mrs T says the marker is preventing this. 
Our investigator said businesses are entitled to make a commercial decision whether to lend 
to a customer. She said it was reasonable for NatWest to take customers borrowing 
histories into account, including accounts theyre linked to. Our investigator said NatWest 
had considered Mr and Mrs Ts application for additional borrowing fairly. 
Mr and Mrs T didnt agree. Mrs T said theyd made a complaint previously about a business 
account linked to Mr T, which NatWest had upheld. She didnt know of a problem with that 
account that would explain a marker. And she wasnt linked to the account, so that wouldnt 
explain a marker on her accounts. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest is, like other lenders, entitled to make a commercial decision about its lending 
policies and whether to lend to a customer. It must also treat customers fairly and apply its 
policies fairly.
Mr and Mrs T says NatWest recorded an internal marker which means it wont lend to them.
NatWest says Mrs T shouldnt have been told theres an internal marker. It paid 
compensation for the upset this caused. Regardless of whether Mrs T should have been told 
about internal markers, she was told and this has caused her concern. 
Mr and Mrs T made a joint application for additional borrowing under their mortgage. 
NatWest says it takes a range of information into account when deciding whether to lend. 
This includes borrowing with other lenders, credit scores and searches as well as other 
accounts a customer has, or has had, with NatWest. I think this is fair. Mr and Mrs T applied 
for additional borrowing under their mortgage, and the rules on mortgage regulation require 
NatWest to carry out stringent assessments of affordability before lending. But with any 
lending application, NatWest has to lend responsibly, including checking that a loan can be 
repaid sustainably.
If a customer has had difficulty repaying money this can be an indication that further 
borrowing might not be affordable. It might also indicate a risk for NatWest that the customer 
might not be able to repay further borrowing. I think in these circumstances theres nothing 
unfair in NatWest using an internal marker to indicate that further borrowing might not be 
affordable for a customer, or where lending to a customer would be outside its lending 
policy.
I dont think I can fairly require NatWest to remove any internal markers for Mr T or Mrs T. 
NatWest explained to us why the marker was there and provided evidence to support what it 
said. I dont think its acted unfairly. 
Even if the marker was removed, this doesnt mean NatWest would offer Mr and Mrs T 
additional borrowing. It would still need to review their application, assess whether the 
lending is affordable and whether it meets its lending criteria. Its likely it would review Mr 
and Mrs Ts other accounts and borrowing history with NatWest. 
NatWest says internal markers are for its own use only. As unrelated lenders wouldnt know 
about any internal marker, this wouldnt affect Mr and Mrs Ts ability to borrow elsewhere. 
I should say though that this doesnt mean NatWest hasnt  or cant  record information 
which is available to other lenders. It has to record accurate and up to date information about 
customers accounts with the credit reference agencies. Mr and Mrs T havent provided 
evidence that NatWest has recorded adverse information with the credit reference agencies 
which they consider inaccurate or unfair.
In the circumstances, I think £250 paid by NatWest was fair and reasonable compensation 
for the upset caused by its error  telling Mrs T about the internal marker. I dont think its fair 
and reasonable to require it to take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T and Mrs T to 
accept or reject my decision before 26 February 2021.
