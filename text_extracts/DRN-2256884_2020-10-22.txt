The complaint
Mr W is unhappy that Sainsbury's Bank Plc charged him £50 to cancel his motor insurance 
policy. 
What happened
Mr W complained to us after Sainsburys charged him £50 when he cancelled his policy, 
after selling his car. Sainsburys said it had applied the fee set out in its terms and conditions 
which Mr W had agreed to when taking out the policy.
Our investigator thought Sainsburys had fairly charged Mr W for cancelling the policy. Mr W 
disagreed. He thought £50 was disproportionate to the cost involved in cancelling the policy.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The terms and conditions of Mr Ws policy say he will be charged £50 if he cancels it. I 
understand Mr W feels that charging £50 isnt proportionate to the administration costs 
involved. However, from my experience of similar complaints I consider this amount to be 
proportionate to the administration task and I dont find that Mr W is being charged an 
unusually high amount. So, I think its fair for Sainsburys to charge for carrying out the task.
I appreciate my decision will come as a disappointment to Mr W, but Im not going to 
interfere with Sainsburys decision to charge a £50 cancellation fee, as set out in the terms 
of the policy.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2020.
