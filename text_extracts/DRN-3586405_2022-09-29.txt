The complaint
Mr A complains he made two overpayments under his hire purchase agreement with 
Mercedes-Benz Financial Services UK Limited (MBFS) and he says it wont provide him 
with a refund of the overpayments. 
What happened
Mr A acquired a car under a 48 month hire purchase agreement with MBFS in July 2018. 
The car cost around £37,500. Under the agreement, Mr A was required to make 48 
payments of £389.46, followed by a final payment of £15,950 if he wanted to keep the car. 
In August 2021, Mr A contacted MBFS and queried the payments he had made towards the 
account. MBFS responded and said for one month, a Direct Debit indemnity claim (DDIC) 
report was received. Following this, on 24 January 2022 the agreement ended as Mr A 
traded the car in and purchased a separate car.
Mr A also complained to MBFS about the additional payments he said he made. At the time, 
MBFS told Mr A that his February 2021 payment was debited on 1 March 2021 as the 
original payment date fell on a non-working day in February 2021. It said following this, Mr A 
made a DDIC for this payment and so his account fell into arrears and he was required to 
make an additional card payment to settle the amount returned to him for the DDIC. Mr A 
disagreed and said he had made his payments on time.
MBFS issued its response to Mr As complaint in March 2022. It said it received a DDIC 
report from Mr As bank in April 2021 which said one payment hadnt been taken 
successfully. So it said when Mr A made a further payment in April 2021, it was for the 
payment it didnt receive from Mr A. It also said it couldnt see it had taken any further 
payments from Mr As after the agreement was settled.
Unhappy with this, Mr A referred his complaint to this service. He said MBFS had admitted it 
overcharged him. He said hed provided it with evidence to show that he paid both his 
normal monthly payments paid by Direct Debit and two additional manual payments in 
February 2021 and April 2021. To put things right, he said he wanted the two additional 
payments refunded to him and compensation of around £3,000.
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt think Mr A had overpaid towards the 
agreement. She said the total amount owed under the agreement including the optional 
purchase payment, equalled the amount Mr A had paid. She said the DDIC report matched 
Mr As agreement number and so she was satisfied MBFS returned this payment to Mr As 
bank. She explained this is why Mr A was required to make a second payment in April 2021. 
She said she didnt think Mr A had overpaid in February or April 2021.
Mr A disagreed and reiterated his complaint. He also said he was never refunded any 
payments by MBFS despite making two additional payments, which he says he was told to 
make these payments by MBFS when it said his Direct Debit payments had been 
unsuccessful. 
As Mr A remains unhappy, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive read and considered the whole file and acknowledge that Mr A has raised a number of 
different complaint points. Ive concentrated on what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on 
any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on board and think about it  but 
because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right 
outcome.
Mr A was supplied with a car under a hire purchase agreement. This is a regulated 
consumer credit agreement which means were able to look into complaints about it. 
What I need to decide in this case is whether Mr A made any overpayments towards his hire 
purchase agreement. If I think he did, I need to think about whats fair to put things right.
Mr A says he made two overpayments in both February 2021 and April 2021.
The statement of account provided by MBFS appears to suggest two manual payments were 
made. But the statement of accounts provided by MBFS is dated end of May 2022 and the 
agreement ended in January 2022. So it isnt entirely accurate. In light of this, Ive 
concentrated on the bank statements provided by Mr A and the other supporting information 
provided by MBFS.
The bank statements provided by Mr A show transactions from 9 February 2021 onwards. 
Mr As monthly payments were due at the end of each month. Between 9 February 2021 and 
the end of February 2021, no payments were made to MBFS. So Im satisfied no payment 
was made to MBFS by Mr A in February 2021. But MBFS has confirmed that the payment 
due for February 2021, was paid to it on 1 March 2021 and Mr As bank statement confirms 
this. So from the evidence provided to me by Mr A and MBFS, Im satisfied no overpayment 
was made to MBFS by Mr A in February 2021.
Following this payment, a payment was made by Mr A to MBFS on 31 March 2021. This was 
for the instalment he owed towards his agreement for March 2021. Im satisfied that up until 
this point the account was up to date. 
The bank statements show further payments made by Mr A to MBFS by Direct Debit on     
30 April 2021 and then a card payment on 4 May 2021. Whilst the bank statement shows the 
payment was made by Mr A on 4 May 2021, Im satisfied this payment was initiated by Mr A 
in April 2021. For completion, a payment was also made to MBFS by Mr A by Direct Debit on 
1 June 2021  which was for the instalment owed by Mr A for May 2021. 
To demonstrate this, this is what the bank statements Mr A has sent in show:
Instalment dueDate of 
payment
February 2021 1 March 2021
March 2021 31 March 2021
April 2021 30 April 2021
 4 May 2021
May 2021 1 June 2021
From this information, it would suggest that the payment made by Mr A on 4 May 2021, was 
an overpayment. However, Im not satisfied it was. Ill explain why. 
MBFS has sent this service a log of the DDIC reports it received for Mr As account. From 
this, it confirms a DDIC report was received for the payment made by Mr A in February 
2021. It says it received the DDIC report notification in April 2021 and it has provided the 
reference number for this DDIC report. 
This is further supported by system notes from a call made by Mr A to MBFS on                 
30 April 2021. The notes state that Mr A has had notice from his bank that he made a double payment to MBFS and that he paid MBFS twice in March 2021. The notes say that during 
this call, MBFS told Mr A that it received a DDIC report from Mr As bank and he had an 
outstanding payment due from February 2021. The notes also confirm a manual payment 
was made by Mr A for the February 2021 instalment and the account was now up to date 
with no arrears. 
From this information, Im satisfied that a DDIC report was received by MBFS from Mr As 
bank in April 2021 for February 2021s payment. Whilst the call took place in April 2021, I 
think the DDIC was more likely initiated in March 2021 when Mr A was made aware two 
payments were made to MBFS during that month. Its unclear who initiated this, but Im 
satisfied a DDIC report was received by MBFS in April 2021.
Im not disputing that Mr A didnt make a payment twice in March 2021. He did. This is 
evidenced by the bank statements hes provided. However, its been established that the first 
payment in March 2021 was a payment for February 2021s instalment. And the second 
payment was for March 2021s instalment. So both these payments were for instalments that 
were due to MBFS and whilst Mr A made two payments to MBFS in March 2021, these were 
payments that were owed under his agreement.
To demonstrate that hes overpaid, Mr A has provided this service with bank statements. He 
says that hes provided bank statements with no gaps and this is more than enough proof to 
show no payments were returned to him. 
One of these bank statements shows transactions starting on 16 March 2021 and ending on 
31 March 2021. Mr A has also sent in part of another bank statement which starts on            
1 April 2021 and ends on 8 April 2021. 
However, Mr A hasnt sent this service a copy of the full bank statement for 31 March 2021. 
The bank statement which shows part of the transactions dated 31 March 2021 shows an 
account balance of £948.45 for the date ending 29 March 2021. But it doesnt show an 
outstanding balance for the transactions that were processed on 31 March 2021. As the 
statements from Mr As bank show an outstanding balance for every other day where 
transactions have been processed, this implies that that statement Mr A has provided is 
missing at least one transaction processed on 31 March 2021.
Ive seen that, for 31 March 2021, the banks statements Mr A has provided show that 
payments totalling £1,858.46 were paid out of the account. This would leave Mr A with an 
account balance of £910.10. A further two payments totalling £854.76 were paid into the 
account the same day. This would leave Mr A with an account balance of -£55.25. This is 
where the statement ends for 31 March 2021.
For clarity, this is what the bank statement figures show: 
Account balance on 29 March 2021: £948.45
Transactions on 31 March 2021: payments out: £1,858.46, payments in: £854.76
Account balance on 31 March 2021: -£55.25
The next part of the bank statements Mr A has provided show transactions for 1 April 2021. 
These show two payments made out of the account totalling £44.66. The account balance is 
shown as £289.46 for the date ending 1 April 2021. However, this cant be the case if, as   
Mr A says, all of the transactions processed on his bank account for 31 March 2021 are 
showing on the bank statements he provided. 
I say this because if the balance is £289.46, as stated on Mr As bank statements for the 
date ending 1 April 2021, then his balance should have been £334.12 (£289.46 + £44.66) for 
the date ending 31 March 2021. But the figures on the bank statement Mr A has provided us 
for 31 March 2021 suggest the balance should be -£55.25. And so there is a discrepancy of 
£389.37 (£289.46 + £55.25 + £44.66). In addition, the provider of the bank statement lists the account balance on its bank statements at the end of each day. So Im satisfied Mr A 
hasnt provided this service with the full statement for 31 March 2021. 
I want to make it clear that Mr A has disagreed for this service to approach his bank provider 
on his behalf to confirm details about the DDIC in question. Mr A has also said he wants this 
service to make a decision based only on the information hes already provided.  
Taking this into account, Ive considered whether I think either MBFS or Mr A has provided 
this service with enough information about the payments to the account. 
Having done so, the information provided to me by Mr A doesnt satisfy me that he didnt 
receive any funds back from MBFS or his bank account provider through a DDIC, as he 
hasnt provided this service for the full list of transactions for 31 March 2021. To be clear, Im 
not saying that he did receive these funds. What Im saying is that he hasnt provided 
enough information to show that he didnt receive them, as he hasnt provided the full 
statement for 31 March 2021. I am satisfied however that MBFS has shown it did receive a 
DDIC report from Mr As bank, as it has provided this service with a copy of the DDIC report 
reference number. 
So overall, based on the information currently provided to me, Im not satisfied that Mr A has 
shown he did make any overpayments towards his hire purchase agreement. And so it 
follows that I dont think MBFS has overcharged Mr A.
My final decision
I do not uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October 2022.
