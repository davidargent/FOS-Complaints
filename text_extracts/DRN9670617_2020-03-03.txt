K820x#14complaint
Mr K complains that the money he transferred using MoneyGram International Limited 
(MoneyGram) was collected by an unknown and unauthorised third party.
background
Mr K used MoneyGram to transfer  approximately Â£600 in foreign currency from overseas to 
his sister, Ms K, in the UK in September 2018. The money was collected two days later but 
Mr K contacted MoneyGram four days after that and said that the money hadnt been  
collected by his sister. He complained to MoneyGram but wasnt  satisfied  with its response  
that it wasnt going to reimburse him - so he complained to this service.
The investigator didnt  recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She said that shed 
reviewed the records  of how the funds were obtained. The information  provided showed the 
person who collected the funds knew the names  of the sender and receiver,  as well as the 
eight-digit reference number provided  by MoneyGram to Mr K for the transaction.  
MoneyGrams records also showed that a passport was provided, at the point of collecting 
the funds, as ID in Ms Ks name although a copy wasnt taken of this, in line with its 
procedures. It also provided evidence that the specific  reference was used to look up the 
transaction when  the funds were collected.  
The investigator noted MoneyGrams terms and conditions state they will make  payment to 
an individual who is identified as the listed recipient. And as all the required details  were  
provided, at the time of collection, the investigator didnt think  anything was wrong with the 
release of the funds albeit, in hindsight,  to a fraudster.
In light of her findings, the investigator didnt  recommend that MoneyGram  needed to refund 
to Mr K the funds he sent but were  intercepted before they reached  his sister.
Mr K has asked  for his complaint to be considered  by an ombudsman.  Hes presented  no 
new evidence, simply reiterating that MoneyGram  didnt  act correctly. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I fully recognise that if Mr K has been deceived in some way into giving away  the reference 
number provided  by MoneyGram, being  a victim  to such  a fraud is upsetting  for the 
individual involved. Such events are cruel and carefully planned  and involve the loss of funds  
that leaves all victims feeling in a way they never  should have to. 
If thats what happened, Im very sorry  that Mr Ks suffered  that way. But it remains  that I 
cant ask MoneyGram to pay compensation simply for Mr K having  suffered as a victim of an 
unpleasant and costly scam. 
In short,  I agree with the findings  and conclusions of the investigator and I have very little to 
add to what she said previously although  I have, of course, looked  carefully  through  all the 
evidence that both Mr K and MoneyGram  have provided. 
Ref: DRN96706172When Mr K asked  MoneyGram to remit monies for him, the funds intended to be collected by 
his sister, the system operated by MoneyGram was that he would be provided with a 
reference number  for him to pass on to his sister.  And on her presentation of that number, 
along with his name and her name (and ID to show that it was his sister that was presenting 
the information),  the funds would be released.
Mr K was aware of how MoneyGram would remit the funds and Im satisfied that it followed 
that procedure  in this matter.  Its records show  that the individual  who collected the funds in 
the UK, sent by Mr K from abroad, knew all of the necessary information and was able to 
produce a passport, adequately evidencing  to MoneyGram that it was Ms K who was 
collecting the funds,  regardless  of whether it was or not.  
Im very sorry that Mr K has lost the remitted funds but if this has happened as a result  of a 
third party intervening in the process  for collecting the funds, then I cant require  MoneyGram 
to compensate Mr K simply  because of the loss hes suffered. 
Its correctly followed its procedures here, procedures that Mr K agreed  to when committing 
to remit the funds in this transaction and Im afraid I dont consider  theres  any basis for me 
to say it would be fair and reasonable to require MoneyGram to reimburse  Mr K with the 
monies hes lost.     
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 April 2020.
