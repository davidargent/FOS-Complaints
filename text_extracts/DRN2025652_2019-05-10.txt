K821x#15complaint
Miss K complains  about the short term loans she took out with CashEuroNet  UK LLC trading 
as QuickQuid. Miss K says that QuickQuid  lent irresponsibly to her. 
background
Miss K took out six payday  loans between October  2015 and December 2017. Loans 3 to 6 
had three  repayments.  There  were  two smaller repayments followed  by a larger repayment 
at the end of the term. Some of the information QuickQuid has given us is shown in the table 
below:

QuickQuid has looked at Miss Ks complaint and said that it shouldnt  be upheld.  It said that 
it did appropriate checks for all of the loans. And these checks showed that the lending was 
affordable based  on Miss Ks declared  monthly  income. It also said that it didnt think that 
Miss K was dependent on short term lending and she didnt notify  it of any hardship  she may 
have been having. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ks complaint and recommended  that QuickQuid refund 
the interest and charges that she paid on loans 4, 5, 6a and 6b. QuickQuid didnt agree with 
this recommendation  and so the case has come  to me, as an ombudsman,  for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Having done so, Ive decided to partially  uphold Miss Ks complaint. Having reviewed the 
evidence I have available I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  given Miss K loans 4, 5, 6a 
and 6b Ill explain why.
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Miss K and QuickQuid said. He thought  Miss Ks 
complaint should  be partially upheld. He thought that QuickQuid had made  proportionate 
checks for loan 1. So he thought that its decision to approve this loan was reasonable. 
Ref: DRN20256522He didnt think that QuickQuid had made proportionate checks  for loans 2 to 6a. But Miss K 
hasnt been able to provide any further information to show what QuickQuid wouldve seen 
had it made  better checks. 
He thought the information QuickQuid recorded showed that Miss K could afford the 
repayments for loans  2, 3 and 6. But, he thought that the information  QuickQuid recorded 
showed that Miss K was unlikely  to be able to sustainably repay loans  4, 5, 6a and 6b.
QuickQuid briefly said that it still thought the checks it made were proportionate  and the 
lending was affordable. It provided further  detail  about the checks  it had made  when it 
approved loans from 2015 onwards in a document called CEU Lending Criteria and 
Proportional Checks.
QuickQuid first mentioned  this argument in its QuickQuid submissions to us in which it said:
 We started implementing changes to the affordability assessment in June 2014 and all 
the changes were completed  by Feb 28th 2015. Starting 1st March, 2015  before Miss K 
borrowed her first loan, QuickQuid had implemented an affordability review that is consistent 
with the FCA Handbook  and that was in place  at the time we received authorisation by the 
FCA. We confirm  that this assessment was conducted properly and individually for each of 
these last six loans.  
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument  directly and through 
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to expand on this point any further here, though  I 
have considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision.
Turning to the specifics of Miss Ks complaint. The FCA was the regulator at the time Miss K 
borrowed the loans  in question. Bearing in mind  the rules and guidance  set out in its 
Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), I would  expect 
a lenders affordability assessment to vary with circumstance.  (I am not quoting the specific 
regulations here because, as before, I would expect  QuickQuid to be conversant  with these 
through previous ombudsman decisions, particularly recent decisions, which set these out in 
detail.) 
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher  the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
Turning to the specifics of Miss Ks complaint. Miss K didnt disagree with our adjudicators  
opinion not to uphold loans 1, 2, 3 and 6. Because of this I dont think  there  is any ongoing 
disagreement about these loans. So I wont be making a decision  about this lending.  But 
they were part of the borrowing relationship Miss K had with QuickQuid. So they are 
something Ive taken into account when considering  the other loans she took.
Ref: DRN20256523QuickQuid says: 
it recorded Miss Ks monthly income  as being  £1,300 for loans 1 to 4 and £1,100 for 
loans 5 to 6 
it recorded her monthly  expenditure as £325 for loans 1 to 3, £1,050 for loan 4 and 
£410 for loans  5 to 6b
it validated the information it obtained using credit reference  agency data and 
adjusted Miss Ks expenditure using what it found. 
did QuickQuid make proportionate checks before approving these loans
Ive carefully thought  about what QuickQuid and Miss K have provided and what  both sides  
have said. 
Our adjudicator said that QuickQuid hadnt made  proportionate checks before approving  
loans 2 to 6. But Miss K has been  unable  to provide any further  information  to allow me to 
say what it wouldve seen  had it made  better checks. So I wont comment further on the 
checks QuickQuid made  before approving  these  loans.  
But Ive looked  to see if the information QuickQuid obtained shouldve led to it concluding 
that Miss K was unlikely to be able to sustainably repay loans 4, 5, 6a and 6b. 
what I think proportionate checks would most  likely have  shown
Miss K borrowed £200 for loan 4. There  were three  repayments for this loan. The final larger 
repayment was just about the same as the amount of disposable income  that QuickQuid had 
recorded for Miss K of around £250.
QuickQuid has said it was reasonable to lend when the final higher repayment didnt leave 
Miss K with much to spare  as she couldve put money aside on the earlier lower repayments 
to make the higher one. Ive looked to see if it was appropriate to lend on this basis. 
Loan 4 was Miss Ks fourth loan in just over a year and the amounts she had borrowed  up to 
this point had been increasing.  Shed had some problems repaying loan 3. And she was 
asking for longer to repay the lending in general. So I dont  think  it would be reasonable for 
QuickQuid to say that Miss K was likely  to be able to put money  aside for the first two 
smaller repayments to make the third larger one. 
So I dont  think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid to assume that Miss K could sustainably 
repay loan 4 and I dont  think its decision  to approve it was reasonable.
There was a break between loans 4 and 5 of over six months.  But Miss K now had a lending 
relationship with QuickQuid for a significant  time.  And the highest  repayment for loan 5 was 
just under £700. This was a very high amount  given  Miss Ks recorded income of £1,100. 
QuickQuid recorded  that Miss K had a disposable income of around £700. 
So, because of the size of the repayment and the overall length of the lending  relationship, I 
dont think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to lend on the basis  that Miss K could  put money 
aside for the first two lower repayments  to make the third higher one. So I dont think  it was 
likely that Miss K would  be able to sustainably repay this loan and I dont think  QuickQuids 
decision to approve  loan 5 was reasonable. 
Ref: DRN20256524Miss K took loan 6 straight  after she had repaid loan 5. But the amount she borrowed, £350, 
was quite a bit lower.  It was due to be repaid over three months  and the highest repayment, 
at just over £400, was within  her recorded disposable income  of nearly  £700.  So I think 
QuickQuids decision to approve loan 6 was reasonable. 
But Miss K increased this loan just under a week after she started it, and then again a few 
days later.  This took the highest repayment  to just under £700 and then to over £800. 
Miss Ks recorded disposable income was still around £700.  I dont think  it was likely  Miss K 
could sustainably make  these repayments, they were too high.  And I dont think  QuickQuids  
decision to approve  loans 6a and 6b were reasonable.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss K paid on loans 4, 5, 6a and 6b;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about 4, 5, 6a and 6b from Miss Ks credit file;
If Miss K still owes QuickQuid any of the principal balance she borrowed on her final loan 
QuickQuid should  remove all the interest  and charges applied  to the outstanding balance. 
QuickQuid should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Miss K went  to 
towards the principal.  But importantly, QuickQuid needs to make  sure that Miss K doesnt 
repay more  than the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Miss K hasnt repaid the principal  she borrowed QuickQuid can deduct this 
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Miss K has already paid enough to repay the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple* interest from the 
date of payment  to the date of settlement. 
And if QuickQuid no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Miss K.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss K a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Miss Ks complaint. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 June 2019.
