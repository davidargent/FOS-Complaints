The complaint
 Mr R complained because PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA refused to close his account with 
a nil balance, after fraudulent transactions had been made on the account. It also sent letters 
asking for payment, and referred the account to debt collectors.
Mr R is terminally ill and a representative has been helping him with his complaint.
What happened
In March 2021, Mr R saw that £1,077.35 was debited from his bank account via PayPal. Mr 
R, who is terminally ill at home, hadnt authorised the transaction. Mr R found he couldnt 
access his PayPal account, because the fraudster had changed the mobile number recorded 
on the account. He contacted PayPal.  PayPal told him that the email address and home 
address which Mr R had provided didnt match what was on the account  so it said it would 
wait for Mr Rs bank to investigate. 
Further debits were made to Mr Rs PayPal account in March and April. Mr R complained 
again to PayPal, which told him to report it to Action Fraud, which Mr R did.
Mr Rs bank did investigate, and confirmed that the transactions were fraudulent. It 
reimbursed Mr R with the money the fraudsters had taken. 
But when Mr R rang PayPal again to report what his bank had found, it refused to close his 
PayPal account, and in Mr Rs words fobbed me off.
Mr R then started to receive letters from PayPal asking for payments. On 3 June he received 
a letter asking for £814.13 and on 8 June a letter asking for £129.61. Mr Rs representative 
rang PayPal and said Mr R hadnt and couldnt have made the transactions, and in any case 
he still didnt have access to the account because the fraudster had changed the details.
Mr R also sent a detailed recorded delivery letter to PayPal on 15 June. This set out the 
fraudulent transactions, and pointed out that his bank had contacted PayPal about these. Mr 
R also said that hed contacted PayPal multiple times  on 13 March, twice in April, and 
again both times after PayPals June letters asking for payment. Mr R said that that his bank 
had advised him that, because PayPal hadnt closed the defrauded account, he shouldnt 
have any card attached to his account. This meant that from 16 April Mr R hadnt had any 
means of paying for goods by card transactions.
Mr R said he hoped PayPal would now look into this thoroughly and close the account. He 
said hed contact this service if PayPal failed to act.
PayPal didnt acknowledge Mr Rs letter. Instead, on 3 July, Mr R received another letter 
from PayPal asking for £814.13. His representative rang PayPal and was told an 
investigation hadnt been requested in the right way. Several of the transactions were 
discussed and PayPal told Mr Rs representative to ring again in 10 days. 
Mr Rs representative rang PayPal again on 7 July, when she was told PayPal had accepted 
the transactions were fraudulent and the account would be closed. She asked for this in 
writing, and was told it could take several weeks. Mr R didnt receive any such confirmation.
Instead, on 2 August Mr R received a letter from a debt collection firm instructed by PayPal, 
asking for £120.66. Mr Rs representative rang the debt collection firm and explained the 
situation. It told her that because of the fraud and Mr Rs terminal illness, it would close down 
the case and return it to PayPal. But it warned her to ring PayPal again in a few days, as 
there was a risk PayPal might just send it to a different debt collection firm.
Mr Rs rep did ring PayPal on 6 August. She was told that Mr R had to send an email with 
details. This was sent  and a reply came which Mr R couldnt see because he couldnt 
access his account as the fraudster had changed the details needed for login. Mr R sent two 
further emails but had no reply.
So Mr R contacted this service.
When our investigator first contacted PayPal, it said several times that it couldnt send us 
any details because the information which Mr R had supplied on his complaint form, didnt 
match what was on the PayPal account in Mr Rs name. This was because the fraudster had 
changed the details. 
In mid-September, PayPal replied to us and said Mr R had raised this as an enquiry not a 
complaint. It said it hadnt been able to investigate because it hadnt been able to locate the 
account, as Mr Rs information didnt match what was on the account. 
This time, PayPal did write to Mr R. On 21 September it sent its final response letter. It said it 
had reviewed the account and could see that multiple unauthorised transactions and account 
changes had taken place from March 2021. It acknowledged that Mr R had reported this. 
The letter confirmed that no money was owing to PayPal and that collections attempts have 
now ceased. The letter said it understood Mr Rs frustration that there had been fraudulent 
activity on the account. It said it had permanently limited Mr Rs account.
Mr Rs representative got in touch with our investigator again, and pointed out that the 
account was still in Mr Rs name. She said surely PayPal should close the account 
permanently and, as other organisations do, write off any remaining fraudulent balance. She 
said PayPals previous responses to the many phone calls had been inadequate  and 
hackers are very clever at finding new ways to infiltrated accounts, so Mr R had no 
confidence in PayPals assurances. Mr R wanted the PayPal account in his name to be 
permanently closed.
The investigator raised this with PayPal. PayPal said that:
 In terms of this account, we have permanently limited the account due to this unauthorised 
activity and I can assure Mr R that no further unauthorised activity will be able to take 
place due to this restriction.  The account is unusable but remains open due to the negative 
balance that exists. Due to the fraud that occurred on this account it will remain open but 
permanently limited. Due to the fraud trends, it will allow us to link to other accounts with 
similar trends and help us to identify these issues.  We understand that unauthorised activity 
can occur and therefore PayPal does not make customers liable for any unauthorised 
transactions or activity in this instance the creation of a PayPal Credit account. Mr R was 
protected in this circumstance and the correct actions taken.PayPal also said that as the balance was negative, it couldnt close Mr Rs account and it 
would remain open. It said it had taken all the correct actions to avoid him having any further 
problems.
Our investigator issued his view, which upheld Mr Rs complaint. He said PayPal should 
close Mr Rs account. The terms and conditions of Mr Rs account said that an account 
holder could close an account at any time, provided the account holder has paid off the 
balance in full. As PayPal had acknowledged the balance was fraudulent, it should close Mr 
Rs account. The investigator also said that PayPal had caused Mr R unnecessary stress 
and inconvenience, and should pay Mr R £75 for distress and inconvenience it had caused 
him.
PayPal refused.
It said that our service hadnt provided enough information to allow PayPal to locate Mr Rs 
complaint. And as soon as it received the information it had reviewed the case and had 
taken the necessary actions.
So Mr Rs complaint was referred to me for an ombudsman decision.
My provisional findings 
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. Before doing so, I considered all the 
available evidence and arguments to decide what would be fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Closure of Mr Rs account
First, PayPal eventually accepted that the transactions on Mr Rs account were carried out 
by a fraudster. This was borne out by his banks findings too. Under the Payment Services 
Regulations 2017, account holders are not liable for transactions they didnt authorise. So Mr 
R is not liable for the fraudulent transactions. I said that it was entirely understandable that 
Mr R wants confirmation that the account has been closed. PayPals eventual response to 
Mr Rs complaint, six months after he told them about the fraud, still refused to close the 
account, for what appear to be system problems. So I said that subject to any comments in 
response to my provisional decision, I intended to order PayPal to close Mr Rs account 
completely with a nil balance, and to confirm in writing to him that it has done so.  
Mr Rs credit file
I considered it was likely that PayPal would have recorded adverse information against Mr 
Rs credit file. This wouldnt necessarily be something which Mr R and his representative 
would have found out, but I explained that I intended to order PayPal to remove any adverse 
credit information it may have placed against Mr Rs credit file.
Mr R and his representative will subsequently want to assure themselves that this has been 
done. If they need help in how to do this, they can get access to Mr Rs credit file through a 
variety of methods  some free to use, which we can provide further information on if 
necessary.
Compensation
I considered how PayPals failures to act sympathetically, efficiently and in a fair or timely 
manner impacted on Mr R. I found that PayPals multiple failures to deal adequately with Mr Rs complaint  as Ive set out in the facts above - led to significant distress, inconvenience, 
frustration and upset for Mr R. 
When this service considers compensation, we look at all the circumstances of the individual 
complaint. Here, PayPal repeatedly failed to engage with Mr Rs complaint, despite the fact 
that he and his representative made every effort to contact PayPal every time PayPal failed 
to act, or ignored their explanations by sending letters requiring payment of the fraud debt, 
and then escalated it to debt collectors.  And in the circumstances of Mr Rs terminal illness, 
I found that PayPals mistakes here would have had a significant impact on him.
Some of the main points I considered were:
- Mr R and his representative made it quite clear to PayPal from the outset in March 
2021 that the issue was one of fraud. Its common for fraudsters to change details on 
an account, so I considered that PayPal should have had procedures in place, and 
should have used these, to deal with situations where a genuine customer alleges 
that a fraudster has taken over an account. Instead, it repeatedly said that it couldnt 
identify the account because the details didnt match. I also accepted that Mr Rs 
bank contacted PayPal to confirm that the transactions had been fraudulent, but this 
didnt appear to have made any difference to PayPals refusal to deal with the 
complaint.
- Even after Mr R had reported the fraud, PayPal sent multiple letters chasing Mr R for 
money he didnt owe. Each time, Mr R or his representative got back in touch with 
PayPal  but it made no difference and the complaint still wasnt investigated 
properly in a timely way.
- After finally acknowledging that the transactions had been fraudulent, and despite all 
Mr R and his representatives efforts, PayPal then referred the case to a debt 
collection firm for it to pursue Mr R further. 
- It was unimpressive that when contacted by this service about Mr Rs complaint, 
PayPal initially still said the details didnt match the account  and then argued that 
Mr R and his representative had only raised an enquiry, not a complaint. And when 
PayPal did eventually issue a final response letter to Mr R in September, it still 
refused to close the account in full. I consider its entirely understandable that Mr R 
and his representative would no longer have any trust whatsoever in PayPals 
assurances. 
- All this would be bad enough with any account holder. But, tragically, Mr R is 
terminally ill with cancer. He told us that hes under the care of nurses and receiving 
four carer visits a day. I considered that Mr Rs representative would have told 
PayPal about these circumstances. But in any event, Mr Rs situation and 
circumstances here meant that PayPals handling of this situation had a significant 
impact on him at what was already a very difficult time for him. 
- In their submissions, Mr R and his representative focused primarily on the facts and 
events of what happened. This was understandable when there was such a 
protracted period without a solution  and I considered that the facts and events 
spoke for themselves about the distress, upset and frustration Mr R would have felt 
as a result. Mr R said it had been going on for months and he felt he was getting 
nowhere. I accepted that this would have been enormously distressing  and this 
would have been much worse for him in the context of his medical diagnosis. Taking these factors into account, I considered that a fair and reasonable amount of 
compensation for PayPal to pay Mr R would be £750.
Responses to my provisional decision
Mr Rs representative said that Mr R was very happy with the provisional decision.
PayPal didnt reply to the provisional decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments, I see no reason to depart 
from my provisional decision. 
My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold Mr Rs complaint.
I order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA to:
- Close Mr Rs PayPal account permanently with a nil balance, and confirm in writing 
to Mr R that it has done so; 
- Remove any adverse credit information which it may have reported to Mr Rs credit 
file, and confirm in writing to Mr R that it has done so; and 
- Pay Mr R £750 compensation for the significant distress and inconvenience it caused 
him through its repeated failures to deal with Mr Rs complaint in a timely, 
sympathetic, efficient and fair manner.
- Mr R has asked for the compensation to be paid by cheque, as he doesnt want 
PayPal to have any direct connection with his bank account.  So I order PayPal to 
pay the compensation to Mr R by cheque.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2021.
