The complaint
Miss R complains that Oodle Financial Services Limited, trading as Oodle Car Finance, 
wont allow her to reject the car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement 
and end that agreement. Shes being helped with her complaint by her partner.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Miss R under a hire purchase agreement with Oodle Car 
Finance that she electronically signed in May 2019;
there were some issues with the car so she complained to Oodle Car Finance and it 
arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert in August 2019;
the experts report confirmed that there were faults with the car and that those faults 
would have been present at the point of finance inception so Oodle Car Finance 
agreed that she could reject the car and arrangements were made to collect it from 
her partner;
theres disagreement about the exact arrangements that were made but I dont 
consider that the disagreement affects what then happened or how this complaint 
should be determined  and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that Oodle Car Finance has incorrectly used or disclosed Miss Rs partners address;
before the car was collected it was damaged in a fire in what Miss R says was an act 
of arson;
she says that shed cancelled her insurance before that happened and Oodle Car 
Finance then said that Miss R remained liable for the payments under the agreement 
as she hadnt returned the car to it;
Miss R complained to Oodle Car Finance and then to this service  our investigator 
didn't feel that it would be fair or reasonable to ask Oodle Car Finance to write-off the 
full outstanding balance of her account because it had lost its asset  she calculated 
that the value of the car was £3,561 but she considered that Oodle Car Finance 
should remove two monthly payments of £135.21 from that figure for the trouble and 
upset that Miss R had been caused and for the time that shed been unable to use 
the car  so she said Oodle Car Finance should be asking Miss R to pay no more 
than £3,290.58;
Miss R had accepted the terms of the agreement which said:
You must insure the vehicle and keep it insured at all times at your expense 
with a reputable insurer, to its full replacement value under a fully 
comprehensive policy against such risks as are ordinarily insured against;
Miss R has been asked since January 2020 to provide details of the insurance policy 
for the car and evidence to show that shed cancelled the policy before the fire  but 
she hasnt yet provided the requested information;
whether or not the insurance was cancelled or the car was never insured, it seems 
clear that the car wasnt insured at the time of the fire and Miss R was required under 
the agreement to insure the car - I consider that she had breached the agreement 
because the car wasnt insured when it remained in her possession  and I dont 
consider it to be appropriate for there to be any further delay in a decision being 
made on this complaint;
its clear that the car was faulty and that Oodle Car Finance had agreed that Miss R 
could reject it so the car needed to be returned to Oodle Car Finance and it would 
then end the agreement  but the car was damaged in a fire before it was returned to 
Oodle Car Finance;
I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for Oodle Car Finance to end the 
agreement at no further cost to Miss R because she hasnt returned the car to it  but 
the car was faulty and it had agreed that she could reject it so I dont consider that it 
would be fair or reasonable for Miss R to be liable for the full outstanding balance of 
her account;
Miss R should have returned the car to Oodle Car Finance and shouldve kept it 
insured  had she done so the agreement wouldve been ended  but because she 
didnt do that Oodle Car Finance has lost out on the value of the car and I consider 
that its fair and reasonable that Miss R should be liable to it for the valuation of the 
car;
the investigator has calculated that the value of the car was £3,561 and I consider 
that to be a reasonable valuation to use in these circumstances;
Miss Rs use of the car has been affected by the faults with it and shes been caused 
distress and inconvenience by those faults  so I agree with the investigators 
recommendation that she should be compensated for that and that two monthly 
payments of £135.21 would be fair and reasonable compensation and that they 
should be deducted from the value of the car; and
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Oodle Car 
Finance to reduce the outstanding balance of Miss Rs account to £3,290.58 (which 
is £3,561 less £270.42).
Putting things right
I find that Oodle Car Finance should reduce the outstanding balance of Miss Rs account to 
£3,290.58  but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require it to take any other action in response to her complaint. 
I suggest that Miss R contacts Oodle Car Finance to try to agree an affordable repayment 
plan with it for that amount. Its required to respond to any financial difficulties that shes 
experiencing positively and sympathetically.
My final decisionMy decision is that I uphold Miss Rs complaint in part and I order Oodle Financial Services 
Limited, trading as Oodle Car Finance, to reduce the outstanding balance of her account to 
£3,290.58.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 December 2020.
