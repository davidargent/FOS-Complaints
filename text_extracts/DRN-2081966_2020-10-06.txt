The complaint
Ms W complains that Rock Insurance Services Limited, trading as BigBlueCover.com, didnt 
provide enough information to her when she purchased her travel insurance policy, and 
provided her with poor customer service.
What happened
In March 2019, Ms W purchased an annual multi-trip travel insurance policy through 
BigBlueCover.com. 
 
In July 2019, Ms W wanted to enquire as to whether she could add cruise cover to her 
policy, so she could decide whether to add cruise cover to the annual multi-trip policy she 
already had. Or, whether to buy a policy for separate cruise cover. 
So, she called BigBlueCover.com for a quotation. But Ms W said that she was told it wasnt 
possible to provide her with a quote for adding cruise cover to her current policy. And that 
she was given conflicting information during the call about the reason for this. 
Ms W said the initial representative she spoke to explained the reason she couldnt add 
cruise cover to her policy was because she had purchased her insurance cover through a 
third party website. But when Ms W spoke to a manager, they told her that that cruise cover 
couldnt be added, because of the specific terms and conditions of the policy she already 
had. Ms W was concerned she had been provided with mis-leading and conflicting 
information during this call.  
Ms W also thought BigBlueCover.com hadnt given her sufficient information at the time she 
purchased the policy, so as to know what cover she had. And she said the frequently asked 
questions page on BigBlueCover.coms website said she could add cruise cover to her 
policy at any time. Ms W also noted that the terms and conditions of the policy didnt say she 
wasnt able to add cruise cover.
In addition to this, after Ms W completed the purchase of the policy, she was sent an email 
providing her policy documentation. But Ms W didnt feel the policy documentation was sent 
to her in a reasonable way, so she contacted BigBlueCover.com about this. It then sent the 
documents to Ms W by email again, but in a different format.
In their response to Ms Ws complaint, BigBlueCover.com described Ms Ws online journey 
through the third-party comparison site and the BigBlueCover website, at the time the policy 
was purchased. They said Ms W had opted for a policy that didnt include cruise cover. 
And this was made clear at the time of the purchase.  It also said it was satisfied it had 
provided Ms W with the policy documentation it needed to.
 
As Ms W remained unhappy, she brought her complaint to this service for an independent 
review. 
  
Our investigators view was Ms Ws complaint shouldnt be upheld. She noted the terms and 
conditions didnt allow for the addition of cruise cover on Ms Ws policy. And she felt the 
correct policy documentation had been provided to Ms W after the cover was purchased.
 
The investigator noted Ms W had received conflicting information during her call to 
BigBlueCover.com. But this had been rectified at the time of the call. And because of this, 
she didnt think there was anything further BigBlueCover.com needed to do, to put things 
right.
 
As Ms W didnt agree with the investigators view, her complaint was referred to me to 
decide.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold it. Ill explain why.  
As I understand it, Ms W doesnt dispute that the policy met her needs at the time of 
purchase. Only that she wasnt aware that cruise cover wasnt available to her if she chose 
to add it to the policy later. And that when she did contact BigBlueCover.com to look into the 
possibility of adding cruise cover, she was given the wrong information at first. 
Ive listened to the call recording of this conversation provided by BigBlueCover.com. The 
call handler said Ms W couldnt add cruise cover to her policy as shed purchased the policy 
through a comparison website. Then, when Ms W asked to speak with a manager, the 
manager apologised and confirmed the terms and conditions of Ms Ws policy didnt allow 
her to add the additional cover, regardless of how the policy was purchased. 
Given the above, I understand why Ms W questioned the validity of the information initially 
provided during the call. But this was rectified during the same call - once Ms W was 
transferred to a manager. And whilst the matter was frustrating for Ms W, who had to raise 
her concerns further to receive the information she needed, Im satisfied this didnt have a 
further detrimental impact on Ms W or her use of the policy she already had. Im satisfied the 
apology offered by the manager was sufficient in the circumstances.
Ive also looked at BigBlueCover.coms website. And I can see the FAQ page says upgrades 
are subject to the terms and conditions of a policy. So, Ive considered the specific policy 
documents containing the terms and conditions which would have been sent to Ms W when 
she took out the policy. 
On page three under the heading Eligibility it says;
You should note that the policy will NOT cover you if:

You require cover for a cruise holiday.
 
And on the same page under the heading Cover the following term says: 
 
This policy wording contains all possible levels of cover on offer. Sections of cover that 
apply to your policy will depend on your choice of cover, upgrade options and the 
premium you have paid and will be shown on your certificate of insurance. 
 Having looked at the policy wording, there is no mention of cruise cover, except for the 
above statement noting the policy will not provide this element of cover. So, I think this 
makes it clear that cruise cover isnt a possible element of cover, either at the start of the 
policy, or later if it was something a policyholder wanted to add on. I can also see the 
insurance certificate lists the possible options available on the policy to Ms W. And cruise 
cover isnt listed. So, Im satisfied BigBlueCover.com made it clear cruise cover couldnt be 
added to the policy. And therefore, Ms W was given clear, fair and not misleading 
information on the details of her policy.  
Ms W has said her policy didnt say she couldnt add cruise cover at a later date. But I 
wouldnt expect a policy to detail everything it wouldnt cover  it only needs to deal what it 
does provide cover for. And this is what the policy documents do. So, Im satisfied the policy 
was clear in what Ms W had purchased.
 
Ms W said shed found it necessary to request additional documentation after receiving an 
inadequate email from BigblueCover.com when she first purchased her policy. She didnt 
feel the policy documents she was sent made her cover clear. So, Ive considered a re-
generated copy of an email sent to Ms W at the time of purchase. 
I can see the email would have contained an overview of the policy Ms W had selected. And 
provided links to allow the policyholder to download the full policy wording, terms of business 
and insurance product information document. This is a common way for insurance 
companies to provide documentation to their policyholders. And it provides full details of the 
specific cover chosen, and well as the general terms and conditions of the policy. So, Im 
satisfied this was a fair way for the details of the policy to be provided to Ms W.
   
However, I can see Ms W requested further documentation was sent to her in a different 
format. And BigBlueCover.com did do this. It sent the documentation again via email but 
using PDF formats instead. So, Im satisfied BigBlueCover.com did what it could to 
provide Ms W with the necessary policy information at the time of purchase, and when she 
asked for additional support. Ms W did confirm at the time she was happy with this further 
format sent to her. So, I dont think BigBlueCover needed to do anything more.
In summary, Ms W purchased a policy that didnt provide cruise cover - or allow her to add 
cruise cover later. And as this was made clear within the policy documents at the time of 
purchase. I cant fairly say Rock Insurance Services Limited, trading as BigBlueCover.com 
acted unfairly in the way it provided details of the policy in the first instance. And Im satisfied 
the apology it provided for a later confusing telephone call about the reason cruise cover 
couldnt be added, was a fair thing to do.   
  
    
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Ms Ws complaint. And I dont require Rock 
Insurance Services Limited, trading as BigBlueCover.com to do anything more.  
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 November 2020.
