The complaint
Mr S complains that AXA PPP Healthcare Limited hasnt paid a benefit under his private 
health insurance policy. He doesnt think the policy terms are clear.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The terms of Mr S policy say that an NHS cash benefit is paid for each night you 
receive free treatment under the NHS when all of the following applies:
(i) You are admitted for in-patient treatment before midnight
The policy defines in-patient as a patient who is admitted to hospital and who 
occupies a bed overnight or longer, for medical reasons.
I think the above terms make it clear that to have a valid claim for the NHS cash 
benefit, the policyholder needs to be admitted to hospital (before midnight) and stay 
overnight, or longer.
Mr S told AXA he was admitted to hospital on 9 March 2022 around 3pm, and he was 
discharged on the same day around 11.30pm. I think AXA acted in line with the terms 
of the policy when it said Mr S didnt meet the definition of in-patient because he 
didnt stay at the hospital overnight  he was discharged the same day that he was 
admitted. This meant he wasnt entitled to the NHS cash benefit under the above 
policy terms.
Im sorry to disappoint Mr S, but I dont think AXA has acted unfairly or unreasonably 
here.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr S complaint about AXA PPP Healthcare Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 January 2023.
