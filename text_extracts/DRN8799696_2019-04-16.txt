K820x#14complaint
Mr R says Nationwide Building  Society  mis-sold him a mortgage payment protection 
insurance (MPPI) policy.
background
Mr R took out an MPPI policy with a mortgage  in 1999. He paid a monthly  amount for it.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr R disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Rs case.  
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Rs complaint because:
The credit agreement he signed  showed the PPI, including the cost,  and described  it as 
Optional Credit Insurance. So I think Nationwide made Mr R aware that he had a 
choice about buying  the MPPI, and that he chose to take it.
Nationwide didnt recommend the MPPI to Mr R so it didnt have to check  if it was right 
for him. But I think it was, considering he had no sick pay entitlement at the time,  and 
had no savings or other  way of keeping up with repayments if he was off sick or made 
redundant. 
The cost of the policy  was clearly shown on the credit agreement. This included  the 
basic premium, the interest payable  on this, plus the total monthly  and overall cost. So I 
think Mr R wouldve understood  how much he would need  to pay for it. 
Its possible  that Nationwide didnt  point out the main things the policy didnt  cover. But 
Mr R doesnt appear  to have been affected  by any of those things. 
Ive taken into account Mr Rs comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2019.
