K821x#15complaint
Mr K says Provident Personal  Credit Limited lent to him irresponsibly. He says he couldnt 
afford the loan repayments and he struggled to repay them. He says the loans ran 
concurrently because  he needed to reborrow again  to repay  the loan he already had. His 
credit reports wouldve shown significant debt problems. 
background
This complaint is about 18 home  collected credit loans Provident  provided to Mr K between 
August 2007 and June 2017.  Ive included a table at the end of this decision that shows  
some of the information  that Provident  has provided  about the lending.  
The first adjudicator that looked at this complaint  didnt uphold it. In time the complaint was 
passed to an ombudsman who issued a provisional  decision  about some of the lending.  The 
ombudsmans decision was that, despite the lack of information, much of the loans should 
be upheld. Provident  didnt agree with the ombudsmans provisional decision
After obtaining  some further information  the complaint was looked at again  by a second  
adjudicator. This adjudicator partially upheld the complaint.  She thought Provident wasnt  
wrong to have approved loans 1 to 3. But she thought that it was evident  that the lending 
pattern had become harmful by loan 4 and so Provident shouldnt have approved any loans 
after this time. 
Mr K agreed with the adjudicators opinion.  Provident didnt respond  and so the complaint 
has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  high cost credit - including all of the relevant  rules,  guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Provident needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr K 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Provident should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN64583652the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Ks complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
Mr K accepted our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 3. Because of this I dont think  
there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So I wont  be making a decision  about 
this lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr K had with Provident. So 
they are something  I will take into account  when considering the other loans  he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 4 to 18 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Providents  
lending history with Mr K, with a view to seeing  if there was a point at which Provident should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Provident should have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ks case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
4. I say this because:
Mr K had had been indebted to Provident  for 16 months. At this point Provident ought  
to have realised Mr K was not managing to repay  his loans sustainably as he had 
been debt for a significant amount of time and there was no indication that this would  
change;
Mr Ks first loan was for £350  and loan 4 was for £500. This further shows this point 
Provident ought to have known  that Mr K was likely  to need high cost credit for some 
time. This turned out the be the case;
from loan 4 onwards  Mr K was provided with a new loan to settle the one he already 
had. There were  no breaks in the lending. This again indicates he had an ongoing 
need for money and he was unable to repay  his loans sustainably.
Mr K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Provident. Loan 18 was 
taken out just under 10 years after Mr Ks first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr K 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Provident over an 
extended period.
Ref: DRN64583653I think that Mr K lost out because Provident continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ks indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time.
the length of time over which Mr K borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 to 18 and Provident  should put things right.
putting things right  what Provident  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans 4 to 18;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 4 to 18 should be removed from 
Mr Ks credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Provident to take off tax from this interest. Provident must 
give Mr K a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ks complaint.
Provident Personal Credit Limited  should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 July 2020.
