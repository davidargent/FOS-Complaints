The complaint
Mrs G and Mr T complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for a timeshare trial membership. Theyre being represented in their complaint by a 
claims management company. 
What happened
Mrs G and Mr T entered into a trial membership agreement in June 2018 for the right to 
reserve five holiday weeks within the following three years with a timeshare company. The 
price of the trial membership was £4,395 which they paid using a loan from Shawbrook 
Bank. They signed a fixed sum loan agreement for that amount which they agreed to repay 
by 24 monthly instalments of £205.45.
Their representative complained to Shawbrook Bank in July 2020 that the product was 
misrepresented to Mrs G and Mr T, there had been a breach of contract, a commission was 
paid but wasnt disclosed, there was an unfair relationship between them and Shawbrook 
Bank and that the loan wasnt affordable for them (although no reasons were given as to 
why the loan wasnt affordable).
Shawbrook Bank said that it was satisfied that Mrs G and Mr T were willing to make 
reasoned decisions based on the information that they received at that time. It said that they 
both signed the application, a separate standard withdrawal form, a members declaration, 
an information statement and the fixed sum loan agreement. It said that theyd tried to book 
a particular stay during September but were told that the hotel was only available up until 
mid-August  and that the timeshare company confirmed that theyd made no further holiday 
requests. It said that it had fully adhered to legislation about the payment of commission. 
Mrs G and Mr T werent satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our 
investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that 
Shawbrook Bank had acted unfairly when it decided not to uphold their claim and she 
believed that it was unlikely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair debtor 
creditor relationship.
Mrs G and Mr Ts representative says that it doesnt agree with those recommendations and 
has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs G and Mr Ts complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the timeshare 
company and that Shawbrook Banks response to their claim under section 75 wasnt 
fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mrs G and Mr Ts claim 
under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mrs G and Mr T entered into a trial membership agreement with the timeshare 
company in June 2018 for the right to reserve five holiday weeks within the following 
three years  and they also signed the trial membership agreement conditions, a 
declaration about their understanding of what had been agreed, and a document 
containing the form of withdrawal notice - which they also signed;
the trial membership agreement said, immediately above their signatures, that they 
agreed:  to be bound by this Agreement and the Membership Agreement 
Conditions as stated overleaf and the Trial Membership Regulations, Rules of 
Occupation of the Club and ancillary documents  and acknowledge receipt of the 
Information Statement ;
the declaration about their understanding of what had been agreed set out 17 bullet 
points, the first of which said: We understand that we have entered into an 
Agreement for the purchase of a Trial Membership and have received a copy of our 
agreement together with its terms and conditions; and included other information 
about what had been agreed;
the trial membership agreement conditions contained information about their right to 
withdraw from the agreement and they had signed the standard form of the 
withdrawal notice that could be given  and they had agreed that: The consumer has 
the right to withdraw from this contract without giving any reason within 14 calendar 
days from the conclusion of the contract ;
Mrs G and Mr T also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank 
to pay for the trial membership and, immediately above their signatures, it said This 
is a Credit Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you 
want to be legally bound by its terms; and their right to withdraw from the loan 
agreement was clearly set out;
Mrs G and Mr Ts representative says that the product was misrepresented to them 
but I consider that it was clear enough from the documents that they signed that they 
were buying the right to reserve five holiday weeks within the following three years 
with the timeshare company and Im not persuaded that theres evidence to show 
that the product was misrepresented to them or that they were induced into entering 
into the trial membership agreement by a misrepresentation made by the timeshare 
company;
Mrs G and Mr T had the right to withdraw from the trial membership agreement within 
the first 14 days but they didnt exercise that right and they didnt complain to 
Shawbrook Bank or the timeshare company about their issues with the product until 
July 2020  more than two years after theyd signed the agreements;
their representative says that theres been a breach of contract and a breach of 
fiduciary duty by the timeshare company  but Shawbrook Bank says that evidence 
from the timeshare company shows that Mrs G and Mr T tried to book a particular 
stay during September but were told that the hotel was only available up until mid-
August and that theyd made no further holiday requests - Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract by the 
timeshare company in these circumstances;
Mrs G and Mr Ts representative says that there was an unfair relationship between 
Mrs G and Mr T and Shawbrook Bank as commission was paid but wasnt disclosed to them - section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a court the power, 
amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under 
a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the 
debtor and the creditor;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was 
paid by Shawbrook Bank to the timeshare company but from what this service 
has seen across the industry, if commission was paid it tends to be low and of 
less than 10% and Im satisfied that Shawbrook Bank didnt breach any duty in 
making any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory duty to disclose the 
amount of commission paid in these circumstances - and I dont consider that the 
level of commission that was normally paid in this type of situation was 
sufficiently high to mean that Shawbrook Bank should have appreciated that not 
disclosing any commission to Mrs G and Mr T risked the relationship being unfair 
under section 140A;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mrs G and Mr T and Shawbrook Bank in these circumstances 
and I consider it be unlikely that a court would find that the relationship was unfair;
Mrs G and Mr Ts representatives claim letter to Shawbrook Bank said that the loan 
was unaffordable for them - although no reasons were given as to why the loan 
wasnt affordable - Ive seen no other evidence to show that the loan was 
unaffordable for them and they didnt complain to Shawbrook Bank about the 
affordability of the loan until July 2020, more than two years after the loan was made 
to them, and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan 
wasnt affordable for them;
I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to Mrs G and Mr Ts claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that it has acted incorrectly; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Shawbrook Bank to 
refund to Mrs G and Mr T any of the money that theyve paid for the trial 
membership, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in response 
to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs G and Mr Ts complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G and Mr T to 
accept or reject my decision before 16 June 2022.
