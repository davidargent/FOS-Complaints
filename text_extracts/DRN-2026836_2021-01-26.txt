The complaint
Miss C complains that Barclays Bank PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont pay her the money
that shes claimed for the cost of rectifying issues with her kitchen.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Miss C used her Barclaycard credit card in August 2018 to pay £6,500 to a kitchen 
supplier for it to supply and fit a kitchen in the newly built house that she was buying;
she had some issues with the kitchen so she complained to the supplier and she 
then made a claim to Barclaycard under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 
in August 2019;
it said that she hadnt provided a copy of the contract and that it was unable to 
proceed with her claim on the information that it had received  but it did pay Miss C 
£50 compensation in February 2020 because of its handling of her claim;
Miss C complained to this service but our investigator said that, in the absence of the 
contract, she was unable to establish whether there had been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Miss Cs complaint about Barclaycard, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the kitchen supplier and 
that Barclaycards response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  
but Im not determining the outcome of Miss Cs claim under section 75 as only a 
court would be able to do that;
Miss C has provided evidence, including a receipt from the kitchen supplier, her 
correspondence with the kitchen supplier about the issues with the kitchen and a 
signed statement about what happened and also a statement from her partner, in 
support of her complaint;
its clear from that evidence that Miss C had issues with the kitchen but the kitchen 
supplier has rejected most of those issues and explained the additional work that was 
outstanding;
other than the receipt for the payment Miss C hasnt provided the contract with the 
kitchen supplier, or other evidence, to show what had been agreed with the kitchen 
supplier  and without that evidence Im unable to determine whether theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the kitchen supplier;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract or misrepresentation by the kitchen supplier or that Barclaycards 
response to Miss Cs claim has been unfair or unreasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclaycard to pay to Miss C the money that shes claimed for the cost of rectifying 
issues with her kitchen, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 23 February 2021.
