The complaint
Miss S says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to her. Miss S says Sunny didnt carry out sufficient checks to make sure the lending 
was affordable for her. She got into a cycle of debt.        
What happened
This complaint is about 28 short-term loans Sunny provided to Miss S between March 2016 
and April 2019. Miss Ss borrowing history for the first ten loans is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount
1 17/03/2016 21/04/2016 6 £150.00
2 03/05/2016 30/09/2016 6 £400.00
3 17/07/2016 02/11/2016 6 £100.00
4 06/10/2016 11/03/2017 6 £300.00
5 10/11/2016 31/01/2017 6 £100.00
6 07/12/2016 11/03/2017 6 £100.00
7 13/02/2017 31/07/2017 6 £150.00
8 22/03/2017 04/05/2017 6 £150.00
9 07/04/2017 15/08/2017 6 £150.00
10 03/05/2017 04/05/2017 6 £50.00
Miss S took out a further 18 loans between May 2017 and April 2019. The amounts 
borrowed ranged from £50 to £300. There was a gap of seven months between loan 22 and 
loan 23.
Sunny has written off the outstanding balance on loans 27 and 28.
DRN-1471636Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ss complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been given as the borrowing appeared unsustainable for Miss S.
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan 16 to loan 22. We put the 
offer to Miss S, but she didnt want to accept it.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss S could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss S could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. Miss S didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Miss S had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ss complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why.
I should confirm that I am treating the borrowing as one chain of lending. I appreciate there 
was a break of seven months between loans 22 and 23. But by the time loan 22 was repaid 
Miss S had been borrowing from Sunny for over two years so I dont think the break between 
the two loans is sufficient for me to consider there was a new chain in lending when loan 23 
was applied for.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss S, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ss case, and like the adjudicator, I think that this 
point was reached by loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss S was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss S had taken out six loans within ten months. So Sunny ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Miss S was having to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and Miss Ss 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
From loan six onwards Miss S was provided with a new loan within weeks of settling 
a previous one. A further indication that the lending was unsustainable and Miss S 
was borrowing regularly to make ends meet.
 
Miss S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 28 was 
taken out 37 months after Miss Ss first. And it was for the same amount. Miss S had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Miss S lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ss indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Miss S borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Miss Ss ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 So, Im upholding the complaint about loans six to 28 and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
A. Sunny should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss S towards
interest, fees and charges on these loans, not including anything Sunny has already
refunded.
B. Sunny should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by
Miss S which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss S
originally made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Sunny may  if it chooses to  use the total of A plus B to repay any principal
which Sunny has written off.
D. Sunny should pay any remaining refund to Miss S. If there is no refund left and still a
balance outstanding made up of written off principal, it would not be fair for Sunny to
pursue this further.
E. The overall pattern of Miss Ss borrowing for loans six to 28 means any information
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely from
Miss Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Ss complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
