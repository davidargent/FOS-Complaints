The complaint
Mr M complains that PrePay Technologies Limited (PrePay) took longer than it said it would 
to refund the balance on his account. 
What happened
Mr M asked PrePay to close his account and refund his balance.
On 10 July 2020, PrePay told Mr M that he would receive the refund of his balance (Â£1.32) 
within 30 days. But, by 10 August 2020, Mr P had not been received the refund, so he 
emailed PrePay to chase it up.
PrePay responded to Mr Ms email apologising for the delay. It explained this was due to the 
volume of refund requests it has received. The refund was paid a few days later.
Unhappy with the response from PrePay Mr M referred his complaint to us.
One of our investigators looked into what Mr M had said and asked PrePay to submit its 
complaint file to us. It responded to us and issued a formal final response letter to Mr M. It 
accepted there had been a delay in refunding the account balance and said this was due to 
an influx of refund requests and pressures on its staff due to the pandemic. It upheld         Mr 
Ms complaint and apologised for the delay. But it didnt offer any compensation.
Having considered everything both Mr M and PrePay had said and provided, our investigator 
didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint. While she accepted that there had been a delay in refunding 
Mr M with his balance, she didnt consider the delay to be so significant that it warranted a 
compensation award. 
Mr M didnt accept this outcome and he asked for his complaint to be reviewed by an 
ombudsman. So, the complaint has come to me for a final decision.

What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This includes all the emails he has exchanged with our investigator. Having done so, Ive 
come to the same overall conclusions as our investigator. I know Mr M will be disappointed 
with my decision, so Ill explain why.
This complaint stems from a previous complaint Mr M had raised about the introduction of a 
monthly charge for the account he held with PrePay. It was these changes that prompted   
Mr M to close his account. As Mr M is aware, the issue about the introduction of the monthly 
charge has been responded to separately. So, while Im aware of the background of his 
previous complaint, this decision is solely considering the delay Mr M experienced in 
receiving the refund of the balance of his account when he asked for the account to be 
closed.
Its not in dispute that there was a delay in PrePay refunding Mr Ms account balance  he 
was told it would take 30 days and it took a few days longer. And, as a result of not receiving 
the refund within 30 days, Mr M went to the trouble of sending a chaser email to PrePay.
But for me to uphold his complaint, I would have to find that the delay resulted in Mr M 
making a financial loss or that he was caused material distress and inconvenience. 
As PrePay did refund Mr M with his account balance. And given the small amount involved 
and that the refund was made within a few days of when PrePay said it would, Im satisfied 
he hasnt suffered any financial loss as a result of the delay. 
PrePay has explained that the delay was due to the volume of refund requests it had 
received. It also said the covid-19 pandemic had impacted on its service standards. 
Ive seen that Mr M feels that issue of Covid-19 is a red-herring. And that the reason for the 
delay was self-imposed by PrePay given its decision to introduce a monthly fee for the 
account which prompted more customers to close their accounts. And, hes also said that 
the 30 days quoted by PrePay for returning his money in the first place was too long.  
But I havent seen anything to suggest that PrePay was obliged to refund account balances -
when an account is closed, within a prescribed timeframe. But when PrePay wrote to Mr M it 
explained that it would take 30 days. Its is possible that the change to the charges Mr M has 
mentioned was the reason behind the subsequent delay. But I also think that the Covid-19 
pandemic and the associated restrictions imposed by the UK Government is also likely to 
have had an impact. Many businesses which could continue to operate throughout this 
period had to quickly adapt to take into account government guidelines  for example, 
having to make arrangements for staff to work from home. So given the wider 
circumstances, I dont think setting an initial timescale of 30 days and there being a small 
delay thereafter was unreasonable. 
In any event, I dont think the reason for the delay impacts on the outcome of the complaint. 
To award compensation Id need to be satisfied that the delay caused Mr M material distress 
and inconvenience. I appreciate that Mr M may have spent more time dealing with PrePay 
prior to this complaint  his previous complaint about the introduction of a monthly fee. But 
this complaint solely relates to events relating to the delay in receiving the refund of the 
account balance. And after PrePay closed his account, Ive only seen that Mr M had to send 
one email to chase the refund up. 
Overall, while Im sorry Mr M was disappointed that PrePay didnt refund him within the initial 
timescales it said it would, Im not convinced the impact was sufficiently great to warrant an 
award of compensation. Im satisfied that PrePay did enough when Mr M chased up the 
refund  it apologised and provided an explanation for the delay and the refund was 
provided a few days later. So, Im not going to ask PrePay to do anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 April 2021.
