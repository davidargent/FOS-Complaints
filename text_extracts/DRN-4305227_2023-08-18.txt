The complaint
Mr Y complains about a buyer dispute claim he raised with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
(PayPal). 
What happened
Mr Y complains that he purchased a pair of shoes from a third-party website, but when they 
arrived, they didnt fit. 
Mr Y says he tried to contact the seller to exchange the shoes but when he didnt get a 
response, he raised a claim through PayPal. 
PayPal declined the buyer dispute, as it said the item didnt meet expectations, and this isnt 
covered under its buyer protection policy. Mr Y remined unhappy, so our investigator looked 
into the complaint. 
Our investigator found the dispute had been handled fairly. PayPal offered Mr Y £50 
compensation, as it says he is a valued customer. As PayPal had offered more than the cost 
of the item as a goodwill gesture, our investigator found this fair. 
Mr Y responded to the investigators view and said the offer wasnt high enough. Mr Y also 
said PayPal had broken the Equality Act. 
Our investigator looked into the additional information but didnt change his view, so the 
complaints been passed to me for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
For me to say PayPal did something wrong in relation to the claim, Id need to be satisfied 
that they failed to act within the terms of the accounts User Agreement. Or, if I feel like they 
did work within these, that it was unfair for it to decline the buyer dispute in the 
circumstances of this complaint. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
Mr Y also signed up to PayPals User Agreement when he opened his account.
Its clear that the item Mr Y received was the correct one but didnt fit. Mr Y has confirmed 
this in his testimony to our service. The User Agreement that details the protection Mr Y gets 
as a buyer, clearly says that there is no cover for items that dont meet expectations, as is 
the case here. 
So, I dont find it unfair or against the User Agreement when PayPal have declined to uphold 
a buyer dispute claim in these circumstances.
Mr Y has said that PayPal have broken the Equality Act. Ive thought about this point 
carefully and Ive taken this into account because its relevant law. But my remit is to decide 
cases on a fair and reasonable basis. So, if Mr Y wants a decision that PayPal have 
breached or broken the Equality Act 2010, then hed need to go to court. 
I have thought about the points Mr Y has raised in relation to why he thinks Papal have 
broken the Equality Act though. Mr Y appears to have come to this view because PayPal 
didnt respond to his emails. PayPal have confirmed that the only information they have in 
relation to this claim is from our Service. So, it looks like there has been a breakdown in 
communication and this is likely the reason for a lack of response. 
PayPal did fail to log a complaint on behalf of Mr Y when his email to the business was 
missed. Having considered this failing, Im satisfied that the total amount of compensation 
PayPal have agreed to pay compensates Mr Y for this. Mr Y brought his complaint to our 
service shortly after his tried to raise a complaint with PayPal. So, although I understand it 
must have been frustrating not to get a response, Mr Ys complaint did get dealt with a short 
time after. 
Mr Y has also highlighted a disability that he hasnt made PayPal aware of. Id expect 
PayPal to act on this information once aware of it. As PayPal werent aware at the point Mr Y 
had tried to raise a claim, Im satisfied that PayPal havent done anything wrong here. It 
would also be beneficial for Mr Y to tell PayPal what adjustments he needs if any.
Putting things right
Given the only error Ive seen here is PayPal not logging Mr Ys complaint, Im satisfied that 
the £50 compensation its offered fairly compensates Mr Y for any trouble or upset it caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and instruct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
to pay Mr Y £50 compensation
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 September 2023.
