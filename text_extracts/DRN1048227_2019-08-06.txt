K820x#14complaint
Mr P complains that the loans he had from MYJAR  Limited were  unaffordable to him.
background
Mr P had seven loans from Myjar between February  2016 and January 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Due Repayment* Repaid
1 6 Feb 2016 £125 31d 8 Mar 2016 £156.00 15 Feb 2016
2 16 Feb 2016 £150 35d 22 Mar 2016 £192.00 14 Mar 2016
3 20 Mar 2016 £100 40d 29 Apr 2016 £132.00 25 Apr 2016
4 27 Apr 2016 £550 181d 25 Oct 2016 £171.14 14 Oct 2016
5 13 May 2017 £875 346d 24 Apr 2018 £131.55 21 Nov 2017
6 14 Jan 2018 £900 164d 27 Jun 2018 £262.08 15 Jan 2018
7 16 Jan 2018 £900 190d 25 Jul 2018 £287.01 Outstanding
* Maximum  scheduled monthly  repayment over the term of the loan
Myjar says it asked  Mr P for additional information  about his financial circumstances when 
he complained  but it didnt  receive  any. It says it asked Mr P about his income and 
expenditure and checked  his credit file at the time of the applications.  It says Mr P didnt  
contact it about  financial  difficulties until after the final loan had been approved.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She was satisfied that 
Myjar had done  proportionate checks and that nothing in the available  information  indicated 
the loans were unaffordable.
Mr P requested an ombudsmans review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Loans 1, 2 and 3
When Mr P applied  for his first three  loans,  he told Myjar that his monthly income  was 
£2,500. As the repayments due on these loans were all under  £200, and Mr P repaid  each  of 
them early, I consider Myjar did enough  checks before approving  the loans. I cant see there 
was anything in the available information  that would  have indicated  the loans were  
unaffordable and so I cant conclude Myjar was wrong to approve them.
Loan 4
Loan 4 was Mr Ps fourth in relatively  quick succession, and it was for a much  larger  amount 
over a longer  term. Mr P told Myjar his income was now £3,000, but I consider  a 
proportionate check should have included asking  him about  his monthly expenditure too. I 
can see Myjar did that and Mr P said he spent £150 on other  credit  commitments. I dont 
consider thats  unreasonable  given  Mr P said he lived with his parents and so Im satisfied 
Myjar would  have found loan 4 to be affordable.
Ref: DRN10482272Loan 5
There was a seven-month  gap between Mr P repaying loan 4 and applying  for loan 5, so I 
think its reasonable for Myjar  to have considered loan 5 as part of a new loan chain and for 
it not to be concerned that Mr P was becoming  reliant on short-term lending. Mr P said his 
income was £2,500 and Im satisfied that Myjar would have found Mr P could afford  the £131 
repayments.
Loan 6
Mr P repaid  loan 5 early and applied for loan 6 almost  two months later.  Myjar checked his 
income and expenditure and, again,  I consider  such checks were proportionate to the 
circumstances of the loan. There was nothing  in the available information to indicate  Mr P 
was in financial difficulty, so I cant say Myjar was wrong to approve loan 6.
Loan 7
Although Mr P repaid loan 6 within  a day, Mr P applied  for the same amount again almost  
immediately. Again, I consider a proportionate  check should have included  asking Mr P 
about his income  and expenditure, but I can see Myjar did this. Mr P declared he had 
income of £3,000 and monthly  expenditure of just £100. There was no other  information  that 
indicated Mr P may have  difficulty making  the £287  repayments, so Im satisfied it was 
reasonable for Myjar to approve loan 7.
In summary,  I find Myjar did proportionate  checks for all the loans and would have found 
nothing to indicate Mr P couldnt afford  to make the repayments.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 September 2019.
