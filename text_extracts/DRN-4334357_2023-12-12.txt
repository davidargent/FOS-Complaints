The complaint
Mr H complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) prevented him from 
withdrawing funds from his account. 
What happened
Mr H withdrew money from a betting account to his PayPal account, saying this was his only 
option, but hasnt been able to withdraw his funds from PayPal. He said in order to access 
his account PayPal required him to remember the card details of an old and expired card 
that was on the account, or the 10-year-old mobile number  neither of which he could recall. 
Mr H said when he contacted PayPal his request to change his mobile number was refused. 
He said he was given no option to provide ID, prove address and identity. Mr H complained 
to PayPal but after 12 weeks had heard nothing and is still without access to his money. He 
said he wanted access to his funds and interest plus consideration of the inconvenience.
PayPal responded to Mr H about his difficulty logging in to his account to say it couldnt find 
any conversation about this. PayPal asked Mr H for his new phone number so this could be 
added to his PayPal account as well as an active bank account. It said this would remove his 
account from its current unverified status and he would then be able to access his funds.
PayPal said Mr Hs account holds a balance of £23 and hes not been able to complete the 
'Strong Customer Authentication' (SCA) to access his PayPal account. PayPal said the SCA 
is a regulatory requirement for its UK accounts from the Payment Services Directive to help 
keep online card purchases more secure and prevent fraud. To assist Mr H PayPal asked 
him to provide his new mobile number, but hasnt received this information.
Mr H wasnt satisfied with PayPals response to his complaint and referred it to our service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that it be upheld. He said Mr H couldnt complete the 
SCA when trying to send a payment due to his mobile number being an old one and not 
being able to receive the code to complete the security process. He said PayPal followed the 
payment authentication rules correctly and asked Mr H to provide his new phone number. 
Mr H disagreed with the investigator and requested an ombudsman review his complaint. He 
said the investigator had missed the point in that he had contacted PayPal to access his 
account and they were unhelpful and ignored his complaint. He said this had nothing to do 
with 'the payment request' as hes been unable to request payment without providing his old 
mobile number that he cant access. He said PayPal didn't help him with any new steps at all 
and didnt write to him in January 2023 asking for a new mobile number. He said if hed been 
asked to provide an updated mobile number he would have done so immediately.
The investigator said PayPals records show it responded to Mr Hs complaint by email and 
this was opened. Mr H said it was impossible for him to have opened the email as he cant 
log into his PayPal account. The investigator resolved the login difficulties and Mr H was 
able to access his account. He requested his customer service complaint be considered. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H complains that PayPal didnt assist him to get his money back and blocked him from 
doing so. Im pleased that Mr H was able to access his account funds of £23 from July 2023. 
He said this took hours of his time and caused him unnecessary distress.
Ive looked carefully at how PayPal dealt with Mr Hs payment request to see if it acted in 
accordance with the regulations and its User Agreement and to see if it has treated him 
fairly. 
PayPal has described the regulatory requirements it must operate within in relation to 
customer accounts in order to minimise the risk to help keep online card purchases more 
secure and prevent fraud. PayPal said that it cannot override the SCA as the two-factor 
authentication for electronic payments is a regulatory requirement for UK PayPal accounts 
and it applied SCA to Mr Hs account. PayPal has applied the regulations as required. 
I have looked at the PayPal User Agreement that governs the relationship between Mr H and 
PayPal. The terms of the PayPal User Agreement apply and legally bind each user every 
time they use the PayPal service. From what I have seen the terms of the agreement have 
been followed by PayPal in its dealings with Mr H. 
Nevertheless I was sorry to learn about Mr Hs frustrating experience in trying to access his 
funds and in communication with PayPals customer assistance advisers. He says he has 
received poor, unhelpful service. The calls and contact with PayPal were unsuccessful as he 
still couldnt access his account, but I dont think PayPals staff were unhelpful. PayPal 
responded to Mr Hs complaint in January 2023, but Mr H said he couldnt access this 
message. PayPal said that if Mr H provided his new mobile number, it would add this, and 
his account would be accessible. This was eventually achieved via our service in July 2023. 
On a practical level I think PayPal tried to help Mr H overcome the security authentication by 
providing a new mobile phone number. However, a workaround would have been useful 
when it was clear that Mr H didnt know his old mobile number and couldnt log his new 
number via PayPals online system. It wasnt PayPals fault that Mr H didnt know his old 
mobile number or details of an expired card, or that it put SCA on to his account. I think the 
SCA meant that PayPal wasnt prepared to respond to Mr H by email directly or via a 
complaints system he used, but I think it needs to be creative when customer 
communications get stuck.
Mr Hs experience made him very angry, but his account balance was only £23 and so the 
detriment to his financial situation was limited. I can see Mr Hs frustration in trying to access 
his funds and in his communications with PayPal, but I havent found that PayPal made a 
mistake. PayPal applied the security measures that are set out within its procedures as 
shown in the User Agreement and so I cannot require it to take any action with regards to Mr 
Hs complaint.  
 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2024.
