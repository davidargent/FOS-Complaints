The complaint
Mr J complains that Totemic Limited trading as PayPlan made errors when setting up a Debt 
Management Plan (DMP). 
What happened
In March 2021 Mr J and his representative (Mrs J) spoke with PayPlan to discuss 
arrangements for setting up a DMP. Mr J had previously dealt with another organisation (S) 
that provides debt advice but didnt go ahead with its services. Mr and Mrs J spoke with 
PayPlan and reviewed a copy of his credit file to get a picture of how much he owed and the 
businesses involved. 
During the process of setting up a DMP, an account with a debt collector (L) was found. Mr J 
queried the debt and told PayPlan he wasnt sure what the account related to. A suggestion 
that the account may relate to a debt with a credit union (M) was made. PayPlan asked Mr J 
to check with M and S to confirm the details of the proposed debt. Mr J was also referred to 
L for information about the debt reported on his credit file. Details of the debts to be included 
in the DMP were sent to Mr J.
After PayPlan contacted L on Mr Js behalf it advised he had an account with another 
business (B). But the information returned by L showed a lower outstanding balance. 
In May 2021 PayPlan sent Mr J a list of creditors and details of the proposed DMP. The total 
outstanding balance to all creditors was noted as about Â£17,000. 
In July 2021 it came to light Mr Js debt with M hadnt been included in the DMP. The debt 
was ultimately closed by M and sold to a debt collector. PayPlan went on to add the account 
to Mr Js DMP and a new financial statement was sent to his creditors. 
Mr J complained that PayPlan hadnt included the debt with M in his DMP. PayPlan sent Mr 
J a final response and agreed there had been some confusion that led to the debts with L 
and M being mixed up. But PayPlan said both Mr and Mrs J had been asked to check 
whether the accounts with M were included in the previous DMP arranged with S. PayPlan 
also said Mr and Mrs J had been asked to contact L directly as well. 
Mr Js complaint was reviewed by an investigator at this service. They thought PayPlan had 
dealt with Mr Js complaint fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else. In response, Mr J 
made various points and said PayPlan had upheld his complaint and that it had failed to 
check and include important information when arranging the DMP. As Mr J didnt accept, his 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First, Im aware Ive set out the background to this complaint in far less detail than the parties 
and Ive done so using my own words. Im not going to respond to every single point made 
by all the parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on what 
I think are the key issues here. 
Our rules allow me to take this approach. It simply reflects the informal nature of our service 
as a free alternative to the courts. If theres something I havent mentioned, it isnt because 
Ive ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual argument 
to be able to reach what I think is the right outcome.
Mr J says the debt with M shouldve been included in the DMP arranged by PayPlan but 
wasnt. Ive looked at the timeline and interactions between Mr and Mrs J and PayPlan as 
well as the information that was provided. Whilst I agree there was confusion over the debts 
Mr J had at the time, I think its fair to say that PayPlan asked for information to help 
establish the correct position. Ive listened to the calls with PayPlan and seen emails and 
correspondence that was sent. Im satisfied that at an early stage in Mr Js dealings with 
PayPlan it asked him to provide additional information about his debts, contact his creditors 
and get further information from S. 
In response to the investigator, it was explained that Mr Js email address had changed so 
he didnt receive PayPals messages. Whilst that may be the case, PayPlan wouldnt know 
Mr J had changed his contact information unless it was informed. Im satisfied PayPlan was 
using what it thought was up to date details to try and get in touch with Mr J. I can also see 
attempts to call Mr J were unsuccessful.
Whilst I agree there was confusion by PayPlan, I havent been persuaded it acted unfairly 
when arranging the DMP. When full details of the debt were made known to PayPlan it 
quickly took steps to include it in a revised DMP which was reasonable in the circumstances. 
The account with M was ultimately closed and transferred to a debt collector. But I havent 
been persuaded this was caused by PayPlans actions. I think its reasonable to note that Mr 
Js DMP payments were due to be made from April 2021 onwards but were often missed. 
Direct debit instructions were cancelled and regular payments, in line with the DMP, werent 
made. So whilst I can see the account with M did close, I think that reflects the financial 
difficulties Mr J was facing at the time rather than errors with the way PayPlan dealt with his 
DMP. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr J but as Im satisfied PayPlan dealt with his complaint fairly Im not 
telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Js complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2022.
