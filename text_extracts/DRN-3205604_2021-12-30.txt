The complaint
Mr R complains about how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA dealt with his account following 
an unpaid direct debit payment. 
 
What happened
Mr R holds a PayPal revolving credit account. He electronically signed the terms and 
conditions relating to that account on 21 February 2020. After opening his credit account 
with PayPal, Mr R set up a monthly direct debit from his current account to settle the 
contractual minimum monthly payment.
Until August 2020, direct debit payments had been successfully received by PayPal from Mr 
Rs current account. However, in August 2020, PayPal didnt receive Mr Rs payment. 
Following this, Mr R said his credit score was detrimentally affected. So, he complained.
PayPal didnt uphold Mr Rs complaint as it didnt think it had made an error. It said it had 
emailed Mr R on 8 and 9 August 2020 to inform him that his payment was outstanding. And 
it stated that it sent him a statement, dated 16 August 2020, which also explained that the 
payment needed to be made. PayPal also said it had sent Mr R a letter confirming the status 
of his account on 8 September 2020. 
Mr R said he received the emailed correspondence from PayPal. But this was diverted to his 
spam account. So, he didnt see it in time. He accepted he had received the statement. But 
he said he hadnt received any posted letter from PayPal. And he said PayPal hadnt 
properly notified him about his missed payment  he thought that, if hed received a letter 
about his account, it would have avoided his credit status being affected. He therefore wasnt 
happy with how PayPal had responded to his complaint and referred it to our service.
Our investigator assessed the evidence Mr R and PayPal had provided but they werent 
persuaded PayPal had made an error or acted unfairly. So, they didnt recommend 
upholding Mr Rs complaint. But Mr R disagreed with our investigators view and asked for 
his complaint to be referred to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My role is to assess whether I think PayPal made a mistake, or treated Mr R unfairly, such 
that it needs to now put things right. And, having thought carefully about everything he and 
PayPal have said, Im afraid to say that I dont think it did. I appreciate Mr R will be 
disappointed by this outcome. But I hope he can understand the reasons behind my 
decision.
Where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or contradictory, as some of it is here, I 
must base my decision on the balance of probabilities. 
Ive read and considered all the information provided by Mr R and PayPal, but Ill 
concentrate my decision on what I think is relevant to decide the complaint. If I dont 
comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on board and think about 
it. Its because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right 
outcome.
The account Mr R holds with PayPal is a revolving credit product like a credit card, with a 
credit limit (Â£3000 in this case). Under the account terms and conditions Mr R is required to 
make at least the minimum payment each month. Mr R set up a direct debit from his current 
account to meet this requirement.
The evidence Ive seen satisfies me that PayPal correctly requested Mr Rs August 2020 
payment from his current account  as it had in the months before. It appears that Mr Rs 
bank rejected PayPals request for the funds that were due as Augusts minimum monthly 
payment. But Im satisfied there wasnt an error on PayPals part that led to the funds not 
crediting Mr Rs credit account in light of the earlier payment activity.
Ive thought about what action PayPal took to alert Mr R to the fact that his payment hadnt 
been received and whether this was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
PayPal said it emailed Mr R on 8 and 9 August 2020 to inform him that his payment hadnt 
been received and needed to be made by an alternative method. These emails didnt set out 
the consequences of missing a payment. But I dont think they needed to as the 
consequences are outlined in detail within the credit agreement that Mr R signed in February 
2020 when he opened his account. The terms state:
Missing your minimum payments could have severe consequences, including us taking 
legal action against you, and may make obtaining credit more difficult. If you miss payments, 
in addition to paying us interest and charges: 
A. we may temporarily limit or restrict your use of your credit limit; 
B. we may demand early repayment of the total amount of outstanding credit; 
C. your credit records may be affected in a way that makes it more difficult or expensive to 
obtain further credit; and 
D. you may face legal action to recover what you owe.
As the credit agreement it written in clear, intelligible language, Im satisfied that Mr R ought 
to have been aware of the actions that could follow a missed payment.
Mr R accepts PayPal emailed him in August 2020; but he said he didnt see them because 
they were diverted to his spam folder. I appreciate that this must be frustrating. However, it 
isnt something for which I can fairly hold PayPal responsible. And, as PayPal sent Mr R 
emails to his registered address explaining that it hadnt received his minimum monthly 
payment, I cant say it didnt take steps to alert him about the status of his account.
PayPal also sent Mr R a statement on 16 August 2020, which he received and saw. This 
statement stated that PayPal hadnt received his monthly payment, which was overdue. I 
can see this statement refers to PayPal being legally obliged to send a paper statement if 
the minimum payment is not made. So, Ive considered whether PayPal met this obligation.
PayPal said it posted a notice of arrears letter to Mr Rs registered address on 8 September 
2020 advising him that his account was in default and the action that may be taken. But Mr R 
said he didnt receive any posted communication from PayPal.Ive seen a copy of the letter PayPal says it sent Mr R. PayPal hasnt been able to produce 
evidence showing that this letter was posted, which is unfortunate. But it doesnt mean the 
letter wasnt posted as PayPal said. I can see the letter was correctly addressed to Mr R at 
the address it holds on file. And I note this is the address that we have recorded for him.
I accept what Mr R says about not receiving any posted correspondence from PayPal. But 
this is perhaps due to issues with the post where he lives. While its very unfortunate when 
things get lost in the post, I dont think it would be fair for me to hold PayPal responsible for 
that. Its not something over which it has any control. 
Mr R has told our investigator that PayPal should have satisfied itself that hed received 
correspondence about the status of his account. But I dont think thats a reasonable 
expectation. Im satisfied that, in emailing and writing to Mr R, PayPal gave him a number of 
opportunities to credit his account with the required monthly minimum payment. It was Mr 
Rs responsibility to ensure the payment was made as required by the account terms and 
conditions. I also think that if Mr R had seen his current account statements, he ought to 
have noticed that his Augusts payment to PayPal hadnt debited and that this required his 
urgent attention.
Mr R believes his credit file has been detrimentally affected by what happened. But financial 
businesses should make sure that the information they report to credit reference agencies is 
accurate. As Mr R didnt make his monthly payment on time, he hasnt maintained his 
account in line with its terms and conditions. And I cant say PayPal acted unfairly and 
unreasonably in reporting this information. So, I cant ask it to remove it as its a true 
reflection of what happened. 
While I recognise Mr Rs strength of feeling about this complaint, Im satisfied that PayPal 
appropriately notified him that it hadnt received his payment. Im not persuaded PayPal 
made a mistake or treated Mr R unfairly following his account going into arrears. It follows 
that I wont be telling it to do anything more.
I realise Mr R will be disappointed with this decision. But it brings to an end what we, in 
trying to resolve his dispute with PayPal informally, can do for him. Im sorry we cant help Mr 
R any further with this.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 January 2022.
