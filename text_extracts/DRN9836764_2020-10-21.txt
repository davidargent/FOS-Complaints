K820x#14Complaint
Ms C complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA will not accept her claim for a refund 
for a phone she purchased which was damaged. She would like PayPal to accept  the claim 
and refund the payment.  
Background
In January 2018 Ms C bought a mobile phone from a seller on a third party  website Ill call E 
via her PayPal account. Unfortunately  Mr Cs said the phone  wasnt working and she made 
contact with the seller  to explain  the problem. 
The seller  agreed  for Ms C to return the item but because the delivery address  wasnt  
correct the item was returned to Ms C. Ms C also received a replacement phone  from the 
seller but explained that this didnt work either.  Ms C complained  to E but they didnt find in 
her favour and suggested she contacted  PayPal.  
In May 2018  Ms C contacted PayPal and raised  as claim saying the item wasnt  significantly 
as described. 
PayPal considered Ms Cs claim against  their buyer protection policy but said that due to the 
length of time that had occurred since the phone had been delivered it wasnt  possible for 
them to assess the items  condition  on arrival.
Ms C was unhappy with their response, so complained to our service. As PayPal hadnt had 
the opportunity  to look into Ms Cs complaint so we referred the complaint back to the 
business. PayPal  issued their final response and confirmed that their position remained the 
same  and they wouldnt  be upholding Ms Cs complaint. 
One of our investigators  looked into Ms Cs complaint. He was satisfied that PayPal had 
correctly applied the terms and conditions of their buyer protection policy   and therefore,  it 
was fair for them to reject the claim.  
Ms C didnt accept our investigators view. And said she understood that she had a 6 month 
guarantee from E and shed raised  her claim within the 180 day window to PayPal. Ms C 
also argued that neither PayPal or E acted  as they should. 
As Ms C didnt accept  our investigators  findings  its been passed to me for a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And in doing so Ive reached the same 
conclusion as our investigator  for broadly the same  reasons. 
I realise this will be frustrating to Ms C but, Id firstly like to outline to that Im only able to look 
at PayPals actions  when considering her complaint and not those E  as E arent  regulated 
by the Financial Conduct Authority and therefore  our service doesnt have the power to 
consider complaints against them. 
Ms C complained to PayPal in May 2018   so almost  four months after receiving her phone 
in January 2018. Ive looked  at PayPals buyer  protection policy  and in particular  section 
Ref: DRN9836764213.8 What is significantly not described? In summary this says the item is materially different 
from the last description  of the item before it was received. PayPal have argued that 
because of the length of time Ms C had the item it isnt possible for them  to assess whether 
or not on arrival the item was significantly not as described. They argue that during the time 
Ms C had the item damage could  have occurred due to mis-treatment, storage or use. 
Ive considered PayPals points  here, and I realise this will be disappointing to Ms C but Im 
afraid I agree PayPal  have applied their policy fairly. I think  on balance its fair for PayPal to 
conclude they cant be satisfied the phone  arrived significantly not as described. I say this 
because I dont think its possible for PayPal to reasonably determine the condition of the 
phone when Ms C didnt contact them until four months after the phone  arrived   I 
appreciate Ms C contacted E sooner  than this but this doesnt change the evidence that 
PayPal had when  reaching their conclusion. 
Ive also thought about information that Ms C told our investigator. At one point Ms C 
explained that on arrival the phone worked fine but later broke  down. This would suggest  
even if Ms C had contacted PayPal sooner, they would likely have reached the same 
conclusion. 
For the reasons  Ive outlined above I wont be asking PayPal to do anything further here.  
My final decision
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 November  2020.
My final decision is I dont  uphold Ms Cs complaint.
