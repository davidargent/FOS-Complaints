 The complaint
Mr H complains that Stagemount Limited (trading as QuidMarket) didnt carry out enough 
checks before lending to him. 
What happened
Mr H had one loan from QuidMarket, in September 2012, as follows:
Loan Date Amount Repayment Due Repaid
1 6 Sep 2012 £225 £289.13 28 Sep 2012 £10 + interest  rolled over
Rollover 1 28 Sep 2012 £215 £279.63 26 Oct 2012 £10 + interest  rolled over
Rollover 2 26 Oct 2012 £205 £274.23 28 Nov 2012 £10 + interest  rolled over
Rollover 3 28 Nov 2012 £195 £253.62 21 Dec 2012 £10 + interest  rolled over
Rollover 4 21 Dec 2012 £185 £254.54 28 Jan 2013 £10 + interest  rolled over
Rollover 5 28 Jan 2013 £175 £243.06 28 Feb 2013 Outstanding
 
Mr H says QuidMarket didnt carry out proper affordability checks and that he was taking out 
one loan to repay another. He says the entirety of his income was going on repaying loans 
which were clearly unaffordable to him.
QuidMarket says it asked Mr H about his personal circumstances, his income and 
expenditure and checked his credit file. It says that based on the information it had, it 
approved the loan and Mr H was entitled to roll it over. However, it has offered Mr H a 50% 
reduction on his loan balance as a goodwill gesture.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. He considered 
QuidMarket should have reasonably suspected Mr H was experiencing underlying financial 
difficulties by the time he asked for his fourth rollover. He recommended interest and 
charges (plus 8% statutory interest) should be refunded on the fourth and fifth rollovers  and 
that any associated adverse information should be removed from his credit file.
QuidMarket responded to say, in summary, that Mr H repaid £10 of the amount borrowed 
each time he made a payment so his balance was reducing. It added that it was not a 
regulatory guideline to limit rollovers to three or fewer and there was no clear evidence that 
Mr H was struggling financially.
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our approach to complaints about short-
term lending (including the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice) on our 
website. QuidMarket was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks to make 
sure Mr H could afford to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr H was borrowing, and his lending history. But 
there was no set list of checks QuidMarket had to do.
Ive seen the checks QuidMarket carried out before approving Mr Hs lending and I cant see 
there was anything in the available information to show the loan was unaffordable. But by 
the time hed rolled it over three times, only reducing the capital by £10, I consider this 
should have indicated to QuidMarket he could be struggling financially. I say that because:
By this time, Mr H had paid more in interest than the initial loan;
Good industry practice at this time pointed to three rollovers being the maximum 
borrowers should be allowed given the link between rollovers and financial difficulties.
 
The Finance and Leasing Association published its latest version of its code on 1 February 
2012  limiting permitted rollovers to three. Then, on 25 July 2012, the Consumer Finance 
Association (CFA) published its own Lending Code, which also limited rollovers to three. 
Members of the CFA were given until 26 November 2012 to bring their practices into line 
with the code. I acknowledge QuidMarket says it wasnt a member of these associations, but 
I still consider the codes were evidence of standards of good practice.
Given Mr H had already paid more interest than the original loan, and given the guidance of 
good industry practice at the time, I dont think QuidMarket acted fairly by allowing a fourth 
rollover. So I find QuidMarket was irresponsible to extend the lending in this way.
My final decision
My decision is I uphold this complaint. Stagemount Limited (trading as QuidMarket) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr H paid on rollovers 4 and 5;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on refunds from payment date to settlement date*;
Write off any unpaid interest and charges on rollover 5, apply the refund to reduce 
any capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr H; 
Remove any negative information about rollovers 4 and 5 from Mr Hs credit file.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuidMarket to take off tax from this interest. QuidMarket 
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if he asks. If QuidMarket 
intends to apply the refund to reduce a capital balance, it must do so after deducting tax. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 June 2020.
