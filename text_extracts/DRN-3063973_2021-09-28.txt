The complaint
Ms S complains about Aviva Insurance Limiteds handling of an insurance claim against her.
What happened
Ms S took out a car insurance policy with Aviva in June 2017. In August 2018 she was 
involved in an accident with a third party. Each driver blamed the other for causing the 
accident.
The third partys insurer asked Aviva to accept liability in September 2018. Aviva was 
handling the claim, but it was still open when Ms S first approached this service in February 
2020. Ms S is unhappy that Avivas failure to settle the claim promptly meant her premiums 
increased by about £25 per month at her renewal in July 2019.
Ms S is also unhappy that Aviva failed to defend the claim appropriately, asked her several 
times for information shed already provided, failed to ask her passenger for a witness 
statement, and failed to update her about the claim.
Aviva explained that it was defending the third party claim and, under the policy terms, it 
could settle a claim on Ms Ss behalf. It said liability claims could take several months and 
even years to settle and timings were out of our hands. It apologised for its poor service 
and offered Ms S £75, in addition to £75 it had offered her in October 2019. Ms S didnt 
accept that and complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ls complaint should be upheld. He was satisfied 
that Aviva handled the claim in line with the policy terms, including temporarily increasing Ms 
Ss premium and removing her no claims discount. He found that Avivas offer of £150 
compensation to recognise its poor handling of the claim was fair.
Ms S disagreed with our investigator, so the case was passed to me to consider.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this on 23 August 2021. I said:
There are two elements to Ms Ss complaint: Avivas handling of the third party claim; and 
the increases to her premium. Ive considered each of these below.
Avivas handling of the claim
Ms S didnt make a claim on her policy. It looks like she was waiting for a decision on liability 
for the third party claim before doing so. The third party claim was finally settled in May 2020 
and recorded as a non-fault claim with no impact on Ms Ss no claims discount.
Under the terms of Ms Ss policy, Aviva can take over, conduct or settle a claim as it sees fit 
(General Conditions, paragraph 2). This is common in car insurance policies and Aviva 
doesnt need Ms S to agree this. This also means Aviva can make a decision Ms S doesnt 
agree with. If it does, I can decide if that decision was fair and reasonable.
Aviva recorded an open claim against Ms S while it investigated the claim. This is because it 
couldve been liable for the full third party costs. This is consistent with the policy term above 
and I dont think this was unreasonable.
Having said that, I agree with Ms S that some of Avivas handling of the claim was poor:
It didnt get a statement from Ms S until December 2018, almost four months after the 
accident.
It didnt recognise that Scottish law meant passengers can be considered 
independent witnesses. As a result, it didnt ask Ms Ss passenger for a statement 
until October 2019, over a year after the accident. Aviva accepts that it should have 
recognised this sooner.
It failed to ask the third party insurer for dashcam footage of the accident or ask why 
this hadnt been provided as evidence of Ms Ss fault. Aviva told us that it cannot 
see reference to any dashcam footage from either party. That isnt right. Ms S 
mentioned the other drivers dashcam twice in her December 2018 statement.
It failed to reply to her concerns about the length of time it was taking to settle the 
claim.
Having said that, I see that Aviva refused to accept shared liability for the accident and 
maintained this position in correspondence with the third partys insurer from December 
2018. I dont think Aviva can be held fully responsible for the claim not being closed until 
May 2020. Im also satisfied that Avivas decision to defend the claim was appropriate and in 
Ms Ss best interests.
Overall, I think Aviva was slow to get evidence which might have resolved the claim sooner. 
This had an impact on Ms Ss premiums (see below) and her decision about whether to 
claim for the minor damage to her own car.
Ms S complained about delays settling the claim in October 2019 and again in January 
2020. On both occasions, Aviva offered Ms S £75 to apologise for its poor customer service. 
This gives a total of £150. In the circumstances, I think this is fair. It isnt clear to me whether 
Aviva has paid this but if it hasnt it should do so.
Premium increases
Ms S told us that her premium increased from £46 to £71.46 per month. Aviva said this 
wasnt right and that Ms Ss premium was recalculated when the claim was closed in May 
2020. This meant Ms Ss premiums were reduced from £55.11 to £40.08 per month. Ms S 
cancelled her policy in December 2020.
Section 8 of Ms Ss policy (No Claim Discount) explains what might happen when a claim 
hasnt been settled at renewal: If a claim is still outstanding at renewal, we may reduce your 
no claim discount provisionally, until our investigations are complete. We may then decide to 
restore your no claim discount and refund any extra premium you may have paid. That 
appears to be what happened in this case, so I dont think Avivas decision to provisionally 
increase Ms Ss premium was unfair.
However, Ive looked at Ms Ss annual premiums. These were:£558.52 for the policy year 2018/2019 (£46.54 per month).
£862.15 for the policy year 2019/2020 (£71.85 per month).
£506.15 for the policy year 2020/20211 (£42.18 per month).
Ms Ss premium history confirms she paid these amounts in each of those years.
The premium for 2019/2020 stands out. This is an increase of 54.4% and matches what Ms 
S told us. The cover was the same  same car, same annual mileage, same excess, same 
named driver  so I think its reasonable to conclude that this increase was due to the open 
claim against Ms S and temporary removal of her no claims discount.
When the claim was closed in May 2020 I see that Aviva adjusted Ms Ss premium for 
2020/2021. Her annual premium was initially quoted at £637.22, but in July 2020 Aviva 
reduced this by £131.072.
So it appears that only the 2020/2021 premium was reduced when the claim was closed. But 
even if I was to assume the reduction was a backdated adjustment for the 2019/20 premium, 
that means Aviva charged Ms S £731.08 for that policy year. This would still be an increase 
of 30.9% and  given Ms S didnt make a claim or make any changes to her policy  doesnt 
seem right. I cant see any changes to Ms Ss cover that would warrant such an increase.
Aviva confirmed that the claim was closed as non-fault and Ms Ss no claims discount was 
reinstated. But I dont see that it ever adjusted the 2019/2020 premium to allow for this. That 
means I think Ms S paid too much for her car insurance in 2019/2020. Subject to any 
comments from Aviva on this, I think it should recalculate the 2019/2020 premium. It should 
refund Ms S the difference between what she paid and this newly calculated premium, plus 
interest.
Id like to see that calculation when Aviva replies to this provisional decision. Alternatively, 
Aviva should tell me why it shouldnt recalculate Ms Ss 2019/2020 premium.
Responses to my provisional decision
Ms S didnt reply to my provisional decision or to our subsequent attempts to contact her.
Aviva said, in summary:
The premiums quoted in my provisional decision were before Ms Ss no claims 
discount was reinstated and her premiums adjusted in July 2020.
It adjusted Ms Ss premiums for both 2019/20 and 2020/21.
It refunded Ms S £301.63 for 2019/20 via bank transfer on 20 July 2020, reducing her 
2019/20 premium to £560.52.
It confirmed that the £131.07 adjustment in July 2020 was for Ms Ss 2020/21 
premium.
It had issued two cheques to Ms S for £75 each. These were never cashed and are 
now out of date.
If Ms S contacts Aviva with her payment details it will transfer £150 to her.
1 Reduced from £637.22 after the third party claim was closed in May 2020
2 Ms S cancelled her policy in December 2020 and paid a pro-rated final premium in January 2021What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I said in my provisional decision, Ms Ss premium history didnt show an adjustment for 
2019/20 after the third party claim was closed. However, Ive reviewed the new evidence 
provided by Aviva and Im satisfied that it adjusted Ms Ss 2019/20 premium by £301.63 in 
July 2020. This reduced her premium to £560.52.
We asked for proof of this payment. Aviva sent us a copy of an internal file note from 15 July 
2020 that says: £301.63 will be refunded to [Ms Ss bank account] by direct debit on 
20/07/20. 
I dont think a file note is conclusive proof of payment. However, weve been unable to 
contact Ms S to confirm she received the bank transfer. If she didnt, she should contact this 
service as soon as possible.
This means Ms Ss adjusted premiums were:
£558.52 for the policy year 2018/2019.
£560.52 for the policy year 2019/2020.
£506.15 for the policy year 2020/2021.
So Im satisfied that Aviva has now adjusted Ms Ss premiums appropriately after closing the 
third party claim. Im also satisfied that Avivas offer of £150 to apologise for its poor 
customer service is fair for the reasons set out in my provisional decision.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint for the same reasons set out in my 
provisional decision and require Aviva Insurance Limited to:
Pay Ms S £150 to reflect the distress and inconvenience its handling of the claim 
caused her. 
If it hasnt already done so, pay Ms S £301.63 to adjust her 2019/20 premium.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 October 2021.
