Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ms complaint and thought the loans from 4 onwards shouldnt  
have been given because Mr Ms behaviour indicated he was struggling financially, and the 
pattern of his borrowing  looked like he was becoming reliant on these types  of loans.  Sunny  
disagreed but offered to uphold Mr Ms complaint about loan 10 onwards. This offer was put 
to Mr M, but he rejected it. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN96487122the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period during which  a 
customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may signal 
that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.  Having done so, Im partially  upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 3. Mr M 
didnt respond  to the view. As there no longer appears to be a dispute with these loans, I 
wont be making any further findings  on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 4 to Mr M and the results  of these checks 
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Ms fourth loan in just over two months, I think 
Sunny should  have  been looking to build a clearer picture about  Mr Ms finances before 
lending him this loan. 
I say this because  when Mr M applied for loan 4, I think there was enough of a suggestion 
from his borrowing behaviour that he was having problems managing  his money. This loan 
was taken out on the same day Mr M repaid loan 3 and was for a larger  amount. It also 
wasnt the first time that Mr M had repaid a loan and then immediately borrowed again.  
Given the nature of this type of loan, I would question why someone would repay loans  only 
to quickly come back and borrow again.  
 
I also think the fact Mr M repaid his loans much  earlier than planned  should  have caused 
some concern to Sunny.  As that might be the sort of behaviour  that would indicate someone  
was facing problems  and needing to refinance  loans on a regular basis. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
Ref: DRN96487123was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached by loan 8. I say 
this because: 
at this point Sunny  ought to have  realised Mr M was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr M had taken  out eight  loans in nearly four months  and often took out 
loans in quick succession. For example, loans 4, 5 and 6 had been taken out over a 
period of five days. And Mr M then took out loan 7 less than three  weeks later.  So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  that Mr Ms indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably. 
Mr M also wasnt really making  any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 13 
was taken out eight months  after Mr Ms first loan and was for double the amount.  
Mr M had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny  over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny provided  borrowing for loan 8 onwards because:
These loans had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended  period.
The length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Ms complaint about loans 4 to 13. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  4 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 to 7 from Mr Ms credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  8 to 13 should be removed  from Mr Ms 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr M a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 May 2020.
