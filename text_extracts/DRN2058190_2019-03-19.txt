K821x#15complaint
Mr S has complained about short-term loans granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Mr S says he couldnt afford these loans and that QuickQuid didnt 
take appropriate steps to check whether he could afford them when he took them out. 
background
QuickQuid initially agreed a flexible credit agreement (flex credit) for Mr S in August 2015. 
This was a credit facility  that allowed him to draw down money up to a pre-agreed credit 
limit, with a view to repaying  it  potentially over a period of up to 10 months.  
It then agreed nine short-term loans  for Mr S between  August 2015 and March 2017. The 
loans ranged from £100  to £700 and were  due to be repaid over between  one and three  
months. On three of these loans Mr S took out top-ups, this is where  he took out further 
borrowing under  the same  agreement,  before paying back the initial amount borrowed.
He also re-financed one of his loans, taking  out further funds under the same agreement, 
and extending  the repayment  schedule accordingly.
Ive included a table summarising the lending at the end of this document.
One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Ss complaint already and recommended  the 
complaint be upheld in part. He thought the checks QuickQuid carried  out for the initial 
flexible credit facility, and for loans 1  3 were proportionate. But he thought that the checks  
carried out from the first top-up on loan 3 (3a) onwards werent. And that QuickQuid 
wouldve seen that loans 3b  9 wouldve been unaffordable for Mr S, and would not have 
agreed to them, had it carried out proportionate  checks.
Mr S raised no objections to the initial view. QuickQuid responded further, disagreeing with 
the assessment.  So the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.
As the flex credit facility and loans 1  3 are no longer in dispute, my decision will focus on 
the remaining  loans,  loans 3b  9.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time
QuickQuid initially said it carried out appropriate and proportionate affordability assessments, 
which included, among other things, running checks to determine the reasonableness  of 
Mr S's self-reported income based on the employment details he provided.
Our adjudicator, having looked  at everything, thought that QuickQuid didnt carry out 
proportionate checks for Mr Ss applications  from the first top-up on loan 3 (3a) onwards, or 
for the top-ups and refinances of those loans.  And he thought that had it done so, it wouldve 
likely understood that loans  3b  9, and the subsequent top-ups and refinance,  wouldve 
been unaffordable for him. These findings were set out in some detail in a view to the lender. 
Ref: DRN20581902QuickQuid responded  to the view. It said that the checks it carried out included validating  
Mr Ss income and expenses before funding all loans. And that it started  implementing  
changes to affordability assessments in June 2014  and all the changes  were completed by 
28 February 2015.
And that from 1 March  2015, before Mr S borrowed his first loan,  it had implemented  an 
affordability review that was consistent with the FCA Handbook and was in place at the time 
it received authorisation by the FCA. And that its assessment was conducted properly and 
individually for each of these  applications.
This service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic argument directly  and through  
earlier final decisions. So Im not going  to expand on it any further here, though I have  
considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision.
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the FCA guidance in how complaints are to be 
dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] 
which says that businesses procedures for complaint handling should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
And QuickQuid should by now be aware, that my role is to look not only into the rules  and 
regulations set by the regulator  at the time of borrowing but also the law, good  industry  
practice and all the available evidence and arguments to help decide whether I think  what  its 
done is right or not. And in this case I don't think it was right to provide Mr S with some  of the 
loans he borrowed from 2015  onwards.
So my decision will focus on the specifics of Mr Ss complaint and what both parties have 
said about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr S borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in mind  
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
Ref: DRN20581903-the longer  the lending relationship
So turning  to Mr Ss case. At the time he took out the second  top-up on loan 3 (3b), hed 
been borrowing  from QuickQuid for around  two months. And within five days  of taking out 
loan 3, hed approached QuickQuid on a further two occasions to top-up this loan again. This 
meant that after taking  out loan 3b, Mr S wouldve now owed £600  in outstanding capital to 
QuickQuid, as well as the interest repayments  he needed to pay.
So I think by now, given  the sharp  increase in the amount Mr S was borrowing in a relatively  
short space of time; as well as the number of advances Mr S had now taken, QuickQuid 
shouldve become concerned at this point,  about his possible reliance on this type of credit. 
And as result,  from this point on, shouldve built a full picture of Mr Ss financial position, and 
verified the information it was given before agreeing to lend any further. 
Mr S has provided bank statements from around  the time of the above applications. So Ive 
used these, and all the other evidence provided by both parties, to work out what I think 
QuickQuid wouldve found out, had it carried out proportionate checks  at the time of taking 
out loans 3b  9. 
Having done so, I can see that when  Mr S applied for his second top-up on loan 3, hed 
declared a monthly  income of around £3,600. But the evidence provided suggests  his net 
monthly income was actually a little higher than this, at around £3,900. Proportionate checks  
wouldve also shown QuickQuid that when Mr S applied for loan 3b, his total monthly  
outgoings were  around £3,250. This included around £1,630  on his monthly living costs, and 
around £740 on his regular monthly credit commitments.
But proportionate checks wouldve also shown  QuickQuid,  that at this time, that Mr S had 
repayments due to five other short-term lenders totalling around  £880. So it wouldve seen 
that his disposable income  at this point,  after deducting the above  expenditure from his 
monthly income, was actually around £650. And given that the highest monthly repayment 
due on this loan was around  £750,  I think QuickQuid wouldve likely concluded that this loan 
was not sustainably affordable for Mr S at the time it was approved,  and as a responsible 
lender, would not have agreed to this loan, had it carried out proportionate checks.  
Loan 3c was the third top up Mr S took out on loan 3 within a week of the original advance.  
In approving this top-up, QuickQuid increased  his outstanding capital balance to £800, and 
his highest monthly  repayment on this loan to almost £1,000. So for the same reasons  as 
loan 3b; with a disposable income of around  £650,  I think QuickQuid would not have 
approved Mr Ss application for loan 3c either,  had it carried out proportionate  checks.  
From loan 4 onwards, I think  QuickQuid shouldve continued to carry out a full review of 
Mr Ss financial circumstances before agreeing to lend to him any further.  And I dont think 
theres much value to be gained from setting out full income and expenditure positions across 
the next thirteen advances (loans  4  9, including  all of the refinances  and top-ups).  But I 
can assure both parties that Ive reviewed this information before reaching  my final decision. 
Having done so, I can see over the nine months that followed, when the remaining 13 
advances were taken  out, Mr Ss monthly income  fluctuated from between  around £1,950  to 
just over £3,100.  His monthly expenditure also fluctuated greatly throughout these months,  
largely due to differing levels of outstanding short-term credit  with other lenders at the time of 
each application,  which ranged from £0 to almost  £1,200 in some months. And his total 
Ref: DRN20581904monthly expenditure including his living costs and regular credit  commitments, ranged from 
around £1,500  to over £3,500 at times. 
The net result of this meant that at the time Mr S applied for loans 5, 6 and 9 (including  the 
top-ups and re-finances of those loans), his monthly  expenditure exceeded his monthly 
income considerably  by around £300 - £600,  which  meant  he was not in a position to be able 
to commit to any further credit repayments  at those times. I think proportionate  checks  
wouldve revealed this to QuickQuid, and I dont  think it wouldve agreed to loans 5, 6 or 9; or 
any of the subsequent top-ups or re-finances  of these  loans.  
Before taking out loans 4, 7 and 8, Mr Ss expenditure didnt seem to necessarily exceed his 
monthly income, but he wasnt left with much  at the time of his applications. At the time of 
taking out loans 4, a full review of Mr Ss financial circumstances wouldve shown QuickQuid 
that Mr S had a disposable monthly  income of around £113. And with a monthly repayment 
of £185 due on this loan,  as a responsible lender, I dont  think  QuickQuid wouldve approved 
this application  knowing this. 
Proportionate checks wouldve revealed to QuickQuid that Mr S had a monthly disposable  
income of around  £300 when he applied for loan 7. Yet the highest monthly repayment on 
this loan at the time it was approved was almost  £500. And this figure  increased with the 
subsequent top-ups QuickQuid went on to agree. So again, had QuickQuid carried out 
proportionate checks, it wouldve seen this loan wouldve been unaffordable  for Mr S and as 
a responsible lender, wouldnt  have agreed  to loan  7 or any of the further top-ups it approved.  
Loan 8 was taken out around a month  and a half after loan 7 was settled, and looking at the 
evidence provided  from around this time,  it appears  that Mr S wouldve had a disposable 
monthly income in the region of £160 at this point. 
The highest  monthly repayment due on loan 8 was £131. So its possible Mr S may have had 
a small sum of money  left over after repaying the credit.  But QuickQuid needed to check that 
Mr S was in a position to meet the repayments on this loan in a sustainable  manner. And 
from what Ive seen,  Im not persuaded that the amount Ive identified  was sufficient for him 
to be able to do so sustainably. So I dont think QuickQuid shouldve  approved  loan 8 either.  
The top-ups  Mr S took out on loan 8 only increased his monthly repayments further, resulting 
in the total monthly repayments now due on this loan, when added to his existing financial 
commitments, exceeding his net monthly income. So again,  I dont think  QuickQuid wouldve 
agreed to any of the top-ups on loan 8 either, had it carried out proportionate checks. 
In summary,  I dont the checks  QuickQuid carried out on any of the loans Ive considered 
(loans 3b  9) were proportionate.  And I think had it carried out proportionate checks, it 
wouldve realised that none of these  loans were sustainably affordable  for Mr S, and as a 
result, would not have agreed  to them. 
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
For the reasons  outlined  above, I think QuickQuid should not have agreed to loans 3b  9 for 
Mr S. So it needs to refund all of the interest and charges Mr S paid on these loans.
Specifically, it should:
refund the interest and charges paid for the second and third top-up it agreed on loan 3 
on 14 October and 15 October 2015
Ref: DRN20581905refund the interest and charges paid for the loans it agreed  on loan 4 from June 2016  to 
loan 9 in March  2017, including  all top-ups and re-finances on these  loans
pay interest on these  refunds at 8% simple from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement
remove any adverse  information about these  loans  from Mr Ss credit  file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mr Ss complaint  in part. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 April 2019
