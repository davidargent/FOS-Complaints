The complaint
Mr J complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly removed his overdraft 
facility and registered a default on his credit file.
What happened
Mr J says NatWest removed his overdraft facility of Â£2,000 in early 2021 following him 
entering a Debt Management Plan (DMP) and said it would default his account. He says 
NatWest then re-instated his account when his account was taken out of the DMP. Mr J says 
NatWest then removed the overdraft facility again in around September 2021 and registered 
a default on his credit file in January 2022. He says he was not treated fairly, and the default 
should be removed. Mr J says the default date is wrong in any event.
NatWest says Mr J entered into a DMP which meant his overdraft facility was removed and a 
default registered. It says Mr J made a repayment offer via his DMP in August 2021 which it 
accepted but correctly removed the overdraft facility and sent Mr J a default notice. NatWest 
says it correctly registered the default after about three months of arrears in January 2022.
Mr J brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator thought NatWest followed its process for customers in a DMP by removing the 
overdraft facility and by registering a default after three months. The investigator thought 
NatWest sent the default notice and couldnt hold it responsible for the safe delivery of mail if 
Mr J didnt receive it. And thought the overdraft facility was repayable on demand in any 
event in line with account terms and conditions.
Mr J doesnt accept that view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr J will be disappointed by my decision. I also make clear that I appreciate that 
there is a significant amount of background including an earlier complaint about the same 
issue, but I have concentrated in this decision on the main complaint here which is the 
default and removal of the overdraft facility.
The Information Commissioners Office (ICO) provides guidance on when a default should 
be registered. It says it should be between three and six months of arrears and in 
circumstances where the relationship between the parties has broken down. There is no 
doubt here that Mr J was in financial difficulties as he was in a DMP and can see that he 
asked NatWest at one point to write off the debt due to those difficulties. I can also see that 
NatWest first removed the overdraft facility in early 2021 and said it would default the 
account. So, think Mr J ought reasonably to have been aware that by including the NatWest 
account in the DMP there was a risk of default and the overdraft facility being removed.
Im satisfied that in August 2021 an offer was made to NatWest via Mr Js DMP which 
started the process again. I dont think NatWest acted unfairly by writing to Mr J and telling 
him it would accept the offer but that the account would default, and the overdraft facility 
would be removed. I think NatWest was at that stage trying to help Mr J and was acting 
positively and sympathetically to his position. I find it was Mr Js choice to include his 
NatWest account in the DMP.
I appreciate Mr J says he didnt receive the default notice in August 2021. I cant fairly hold 
NatWest responsible for that as its not involved in the safe delivery of the mail. But I have 
made clear that NatWest was following exactly the same process that had started earlier in 
the year and that Mr J ought reasonably to have known a default would be registered.
Im satisfied that the DMP offer was made in August 2021 and that there followed three 
months of arrears. So, I dont think NatWest acted unfairly by registering a default in January 
2022 when it was clear, the relationship between the parties had broken down. I cant see 
that Mr J could have repaid the debt within a reasonable time period due to his 
circumstances and that a default was inevitable here.
I also think that an overdraft facility is repayable on demand in line with agreed account 
terms and conditions and so could have been removed at any stage in any event.
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest told Mr J that his account would default and it difficult to 
see what else it could do in these circumstances to assist Mr J when he entered a DMP. It 
follows that I cant fairly order NatWest to remove or backdate the default. I have not seen 
any evidence the default date is wrong.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 August 2022.
