K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc changed its minimum overdraft limit 
without telling him. 
Mr A complains that the way his overdraft has been  handled by NatWest isnt in line with the 
Consumer Credit and Financial Conduct  Authority  rules. 
Mr A also complains about the service he received when discussing what  happened with 
NatWest. 
background
Mr A has a NatWest current account with an overdraft.  Mr A has been reducing his overdraft 
limit and says hed hoped to have fully repaid the money owed  by the start of 2019 so he 
could switch banks.  
In September  2018 Mr A called  NatWest  to reduce his overdraft limit to £150 but was told 
the minimum overdraft offered was £250.  NatWest  says the policy  changed shortly before 
Mr A asked to reduce  his limit. 
Mr A discussed the change and his options with NatWest but has said that the service he 
received was poor and he wasnt called back as promised. NatWests initial response to his 
complaint didnt deal with his concerns about the new minimum overdraft limits it had 
introduced. NatWest responded again and explained Mr A wasnt  notified of the change in 
policy because it didnt  affect him when it was introduced. NatWest paid Mr A £60 plus 
phone costs because  of the poor service he received. 
Mr A referred his complaint to this service and an investigator looked at it. The investigator 
thought NatWest had dealt  with Mr As complaint fairly so didnt  ask it to do anything else. 
Mr A asked for his complaint to be appealed  so its been passed to me to make  a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The focus of Mr As complaint is about NatWests  decision to change the minimum overdraft 
limit to £250.  I can see that Mr A has reduced  his borrowing with NatWest significantly and I 
understand why he wanted to bring down his limit further. But Ive not found anything to 
show NatWest has made  a mistake or treated Mr A unfairly by changing the minimum 
overdraft limit to £250. Ill explain  why. 
NatWest can decide  how it operates and what overdraft limits its willing to offer its 
customers. NatWest is entitled  to say that the minimum overdraft  limit it will offer is £250 and 
this service cant tell it to change that decision,  even  if its previously operated differently. 
Mr A has said he thinks NatWest shouldve let him know but I dont agree because  when it 
changed the policy his overdraft limit wasnt affected. Id only expect NatWest to notify Mr A 
if his account  was directly  affected by the change in its policy. Its not practical  for a business 
to tell all its customers about  every change it makes  to its processes.
Ref: DRN41439462Mr A has told the investigator that he now feels trapped  by the overdraft  debt. But I havent 
found that to be the case as he can continue to make reductions to the amount he owes  and 
ultimately ask NatWest to cancel the overdraft once  the accounts in credit.  
I understand it will be up to Mr A to manage  the repayment  of the final £250 he owes  but I 
dont think that makes NatWests decision unfair. And I think  its reasonable to note that Mr A 
is only charged interest based  on what he owes,  not the level of his overdraft limit. So if Mr A 
owes less than his overdraft limit hell only pay interest on that amount. I havent  found that 
Mr As been  financially disadvantaged by NatWests decision to change its minimum 
overdraft limit to £250. 
Mr A has raised concerns that the way hes been  charged on his overdraft isnt fair because  
its Consumer Credit.  Mr As listed various  FCA principles and says that NatWests actions 
arent in line with the rules. But Ive looked at the regulations in place for consumer credit  
and those set by the FCA and I havent  found  any evidence  that NatWests  broken the rules  
or charged  Mr A incorrectly.  
Mr A complains that hes been charged  a fee for having an overdraft facility  as well as 
interest on the funds  he owes. But theres nothing in the rules that says NatWest shouldnt  
charge fees and interest when a customer uses an overdraft. Ive carefully considered 
everything Mr A has said about  the Consumer Credit aspect of his complaint but I havent 
found that NatWests  made a mistake or treated him unfairly. 
Its clear that Mr A shouldve  received better service when he contacted  NatWest  about the 
changes it made. I can see he wasnt called back as requested and the initial response to his 
concerns wasnt complete. NatWest has also given two slightly  different dates for the 
introduction of the new policy.  Overall, I agree that the service Mr A received wasnt  good  
enough. NatWest  has paid Mr A £60 for the service he received and £16.20 to cover his call 
costs. 
Ive carefully considered  everything Mr A and NatWest have provided and Im satisfied the 
settlement its paid fairly reflects  the impact of the service provided. I havent  found NatWest 
made a mistake or acted unfairly when it changed its minimum overdraft limit. Im satisfied 
the accounts been charged correctly and in line with the terms. NatWests paid fair 
compensation that reflects  the impact of the service Mr A received. As a result, Im not telling 
it to take any further action. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2019.
