The loan repayments varied from £11.53 a month for loan 8 to £83.33 a month for loan 7. 
Loans 1 to 5 were for 24 months in length and loans 6, 7 and 9 were for six months. Loans 8  
and 10 were for 24 months. 
Mr As representative has submitted on his behalf that Lending Stream failed to carry out the 
checks it ought to have done plus it said:
Our client contends that, as a result of this unaffordable lending, a financial situation 
(which was already poor) has been made worse.
It submitted documents in support, one of which was the Claim Audit Form which I will come 
back to in the main part of the decision. 
After the complaint had been sent to Lending Stream it responded with its final response 
letter (FRL) on 13 December 2022. Lending Stream explained why it was treating 
loans 1 to 4 as a separate lending chain to loans 5 to 10. This was due to the sixteen months 
gap between paying off loan 4 and applying for loan 5. And I agree with this approach. 
Lending Stream gave reasons why it considered that it had done all it should have done to 
comply with the irresponsible lending regulations. 
However, for loans 8 to 10, Lending Stream upheld Mr As complaint and said: 
Although these loans were affordable, we have thought about the number of loans 
and the time between each loan being taken out. We can see that it might not have 
been a good idea for us to make these loans.
It also said that there had been a settlement sum paid out in the past for loan 8 and so the 
settlement offer in this FRL did not include that loan when calculating the refund. I have no 
details of this or any confirmation of this happening. But this offer included the step that 
Lending Stream would ask the credit reference agencies to remove loans 8 to 10 from the 
records. 
On 30 December 2022 Mr As representative referred the complaint to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service. 
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that the offer from Lending 
Stream to uphold loans 8 to 10 was fair and reasonable but did not think that it needed to do 
anything more to put things right for any other loans. 
Mr As representative forwarded Mr As response which was that he disagreed and wanted 
an ombudsman to review the complaint. Mr A gave no additional reasons or sent any further 
evidence.
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Lending Stream had to assess the lending to check if Mr A could afford to pay back the 
amounts hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Lending Streams checks couldve taken into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, 
and Mr As income and expenditure. 
I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been 
proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Lending Stream should have done more to 
establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr A. These factors include:
Mr A having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mr A having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);Mr A coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr A. 
Lending Stream was required to establish whether Mr A could sustainably repay the loans  
not just whether he technically had enough money to make his repayments. Having enough 
money to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mr A was able to repay 
his loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without 
having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, 
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it 
follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Mr As complaint. 
I agree with Lending Stream and our adjudicator about the break in the lending chain. A 
sixteen month period would have been a  clear indication to Lending Stream that Mr A had 
no need of its credit. I would have considered it reasonable for Lending Stream to have 
treated Mr A as a new customer  effectively  when he returned for loan 5. So, it would 
have been reasonable of it to rely on the information Mr A gave to it for first few loans in that 
second loan chain. And that is how I have approached the complaint. 
Mr As representatives submissions are ones which refer to the loans Mr A had as a high 
interest revolving credit accounts. This was incorrect as Mr A had ten instalment loans with 
Lending Stream. So, this was plainly wrong and I do not consider their submissions carry 
much weight. 
The representative cited several extracts from earlier Financial Ombudsman decisions in 
support, and these related to revolving credit outcomes some of which were about a lender  
I recognise which offers credit facilities attached to current accounts. All these extracts are 
irrelevant not least because they related to the wrong sort of credit for this complaint.
Further, each complaint brought to the Financial Ombudsman Service are considered on 
their individual merits.  
Mr As representative relied on Mr As Claim Audit Form as the basis of the complaint. It 
said: 
Based on the Claim Audit Form and the approach FOS has taken on previous similar 
complaints, we feel as though you should not have lent to Mr A. In doing so, you 
contributed to his debt spiral.
That Claim Audit Form which was completed by Mr A and signed as accurate and sent to 
Lending Stream and to us as part of his complaint demonstrates several things to me:
- Mr A cannot recall much about the application process other than it was on-line
- he did confirm he has paid them all off and used his wages to do so
- he was employed full time and earned £1,600 a month when he was borrowing from 
Lending Stream- his monthly mortgage/rent was £600, he spent money on bills and food, and £100 a 
month on repayments to credit cards and other credit commitments, 
- he stated that taking loans from Lending Stream was the only way to get credit and 
he knew the rates were high but he needed the loans
- his total outgoings were £1,200 and so his available funds before repaying any loans 
to Lending Stream were £400 each month. 
On Mr As own evidence he had enough to repay these loans. So, his complaint based on 
affordability is not persuasive. And the figures sent to us in the Audit Form differ from the 
figures in the applications made to Lending Stream, details of which appear in a table at the 
end of the FRL which both parties have and I do not duplicate here. The loan table I have 
added at the beginning of the decision does give some of the financial  details provided to 
Lending Stream for the applications. 
Considering there was a difference in the financial information then I have proceeded by 
recognising that both sets provided by Mr A  that given by Mr A for the loan applications 
and that given to us to support his complaint  show he had money left over each month. So, 
it does look as though Mr A was able to afford the loans.
Lending Stream verified Mr As income and looked at its own searches to see Mr As credit 
commitments. Ive been given a summary of the results from Lending Streams credit 
searches and it shows that there was nothing about which it needed to have any concern. 
According to the summary of results then these showed that Mr A had no defaults or 
delinquencies, there was nothing to show Mr A was in any insolvency arrangement and so 
overall the combination of the declared income and expenditure, the loan values and the 
credit search results then Lending Stream considered Mr A was able to afford the loans. 
I have considered the repayment history. For most of the loans Mr A repaid them early and 
that would have been factored into the creditworthiness assessment Lending Stream was 
required to do. And I say this because a good repayment history is a valid element when 
considering applications going forward.. 
Our adjudicator did think that at loan 4 Lending Stream ought to have carried out some 
additional checks. The reason was due to the proximity of the loan applications and I agree. 
Mr A was asking Lending Stream for a lot of credit in a short space of time.
One way to have done that may have been to ask Mr A for details of his expenditure using 
rental agreements and utility bills and other such documents. Another and often more 
convenient method  but not the only way  was to look at Mr As bank statements.
Mr As representative has sent to us the bank statements for Mr A covering January 2019 
and I have reviewed them up to the date when loan 4 credited his account. Apart from 
paying off credit cards and paying some bills, spending money on travel and food, and 
repaying Lending Stream for the earlier loans I do not see that Mr A had any other loans he 
was paying off. The bank transactions do not indicate to me that Mr A was in any sort of 
financial difficulties. Mr A was using his overdraft but I have not been able to see any 
unauthorised overdraft charges and so he appeared to be keeping within his limit. 
So those statements, if viewed by Lending Stream at the time, likely would not have led to it 
refusing loan 4. 
In the second loan chain  from loan 5 - I have noted that Mr A took loans 5, 6 and 7 in quick 
succession and they overlapped to an extent but I also note that loans 6 and 7 were for 
smaller sums and for shorter loan periods. So, I do not consider that Lending Stream needed to do more for these loans especially as the conclusions I have come to relating to 
affordability apply here too. 
Loans 8 to 10 
As Lending Stream has already agreed to uphold loans 8 to 10 then I have no need to 
review them.
I endorse the uphold for loans 8 to 10. But in relation to the other loans, I am not persuaded 
that Lending Stream was irresponsible when it approved loans 1 to 7 for Mr A. 
As the outcome for loans 8 to 10 was given in the FRL issued by Lending Stream then I am 
concluding that this is a non-uphold of the complaint. But Lending Stream needs to do as it 
said it would in relation to loans 8 to 10.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold the complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 September 2023.
