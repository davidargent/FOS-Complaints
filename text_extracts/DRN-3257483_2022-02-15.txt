The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly closed his accounts.
What happened
Mr S says NatWest unfairly closed his accounts in July 2020. He says he has been unwell 
for many years and NatWests decision had a detrimental impact on his health. Mr S says he 
wasnt given any real reasons and was made to feel like a criminal. Mr S says he has a good 
credit history and would like NatWest to restore the accounts.
NatWest says it wrote to Mr S in July 2020 to tell him it was closing his accounts in line with 
account terms and conditions. It says it provided the type of reasons behind that sort of 
decision but says it will not provide the exact reason and isnt obliged to do so.
Mr S brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought NatWest was entitled to close Mr Ss accounts in line with account terms and 
conditions and wasnt obliged to provide a reason. The investigator thought having reviewed 
NatWests records that a mistake hadnt been made.
Mr S doesnt accept that view and says its unfair he is unaware of the reasons for the 
closure.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr S will be disappointed by my decision.
I have looked carefully at Mr Ss account terms and conditions which I think he would have 
agreed to when his accounts were opened. Those terms and conditions make clear that 
NatWest can close an account without providing reasons and without notice if certain 
conditions are present. I can see that NatWest has provided Mr S a list of the reasons why it 
makes such a decision, but I dont think its obliged to provide Mr S with the exact reason. 
So, I dont think NatWest made a mistake or acted unfairly by closing Mr Ss accounts which 
I find was in line with agreed account terms and conditions. Having reviewed NatWests 
records, Im satisfied that a mistake hasnt been made by NatWest and that it was entitled to 
reach the decision it did.
I appreciate Mr S may have unanswered questions that this service cant hep him with. I 
accept the accounts being closed may have caused some inconvenience to Mr S, but for the 
reasons I have explained I cant fairly hold NatWest responsible for that. 
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest has acted in line with agreed account terms and 
conditions and hasnt made a mistake or acted unfairly.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2022.
