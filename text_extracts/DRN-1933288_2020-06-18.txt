DRN-1933288Mr D had 17 loans from Lending Stream between February 2012 and September 2019 - the 
repayment column includes payments on overlapping loans.
Mr D says he initially borrowed to pay an overdue bill, but because of the high interest 
rate he had to borrow again. He said he could not afford the repayments and his credit file 
would have shown significant other debts. Mr D says Lending Stream was irresponsible to 
continue to lend to him as it should have realised his debt problems were getting worse.
Lending Stream says it asked Mr D about his income and expenditure and, for the later 
loans, validated this information using his credit file and bank statements. It says it 
was satisfied its checks were proportionate and that all the loans were affordable based 
upon Mr Ds calculated disposable income.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld. She considered Lending 
Stream should have realised Mr D was becoming persistently reliant on short-term loans 
by the time he applied for loan 10. She recommended interest and charges (plus 8% 
statutory interest) should be refunded on loans 10 to 17 and that those loans should be 
removed from his credit file.
Lending Stream accepted the adjudicators view.
Mr D responded to say, in summary, that he had now provided bank statements and his 
credit file to support his complaint that Lending Stream should never have lent to him. He 
says his expenditure exceeded his income throughout the period of the lending and the 
Lending Stream repayments caused him to miss payments on other loans.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mr D and to Lending Stream on 13 May 2020. I summarise 
my findings here:
I was satisfied Lending Stream carried out enough checks before it approved loans 1 
to 4 and those checks showed the repayments were affordable to Mr D;
I considered Lending Stream should have carried out better checks before approving 
loan 5, but I couldnt see any evidence Mr D had other short-term loans at the time 
and Lending Streams other checks showed the repayments were affordable;
For loans 6 to 9, I considered Lending Stream should have carried out a full financial 
review. Had it done so it would have found Mr Ds disposable income was insufficient 
to be able to afford the repayments on these loans;
By loan 10, I considered Mr Ds borrowing pattern should have indicated to Lending 
Stream that further lending was unsustainable.
 
So my provisional decision was to uphold Mr Hs complaint about loans 6 to 17.
Mr D responded to say he had no further information to add. 
Sunny did not respond to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive re-considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.As neither party provided any additional information I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ds complaint. Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) 
should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr D paid on loans 6 to 17;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date
of settlement*;
Remove any negative information about loans 6 to 9 from Mr Ds credit file.
The number of loans taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 10 to 17 should be removed from
Mr Ds credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest.
Lending Stream must give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks
for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 July 2020.
