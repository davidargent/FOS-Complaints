DRN-1891530
 
The complaint
Mr S complains that Capital One (Europe) plc mis-sold them a payment protection insurance 
(PPI) policy.
What happened
I issued my provisional decision on 2 April 2020. A copy of my provisional decision 
is attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional decision set out the background to this complaint. It explained why I 
didnt think that Mr S complaint should be upheld.
Capital One had nothing further to add and Mr S didnt respond to my provisional decision 
with any further comments or information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr S case.
As neither Capital One nor Mr S have provided me with any further comments or information 
following my provisional decision, I see no reason to change the conclusion I reached in it.
So I still dont think the complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
For the reasons given above and in my provisional decision, I dont uphold this 
complaint against Capital One (Europe) plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 7July 2020.
