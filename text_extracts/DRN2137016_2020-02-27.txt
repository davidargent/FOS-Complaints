Mr E says Uncle Buck Finance LLP irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about a number of loans Uncle Buck provided to Mr E between May 2015 
and November 2015. Mr Es borrowing history  is as follows:
Loan Date  Taken Date  Repaid Instalments Amount Monthly Repayment
1 05/05/2015 29/05/2015 1 £100.00 £120.00
2 04/06/2015 28/08/2015 3 £100.00 £49.15
3 02/09/2015 12/12/2015 3 £200.00 £99.82
4 19/10/2015 29/10/2015 3 £100.00 £144.32
5 23/11/2015 27/07/2017 3 £200.00 £103.40
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Es complaint  and thought  loan five shouldnt have been 
given. 
Uncle Buck  disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr E 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN21370162There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required to establish 
whether Mr E could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Es complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, by the time Mr E applied for loan five he was showing signs 
that he was having financial difficulty.  
Mr E was now applying  for his fifth loan in six months  and this loan was for double the 
amount of loan four, with a significant increase in his required repayments. I think that at this 
point Uncle  Buck shouldve realised that Mr E was at risk of not being  able to make his 
repayments in a sustainable way and should  not have continued the lending  relationship. I 
can also see that Mr E entered in to a repayment plan just four weeks  after taking out loan 
five, which  subsequently failed, which supports that this loan was not sustainable.  
Ive considered everything that Uncle Buck has said in response  to our adjudicators view, 
but nothing it has said has changed  my mind.  So, Im also upholding the complaint about  
loan five and Uncle Buck should put things right.
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr E paid on loan five;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan five from Mr Es credit file; if the loan 
was sold, it should ask the debt purchaser  to do the same.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Uncle  Buck  to take off tax from this interest.  Uncle Buck  must 
give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Es complaint. Uncle Buck  Finance 
LLP should put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN21370163Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 March  2020.
