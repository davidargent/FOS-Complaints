The complaint
Ms W complains that Morse Club PLC irresponsibly lent to her.
What happened
The details of this complaint are set out in the provisional decision I issued on 20 June 2022 
where I explained I was inclined to reach different conclusions to the adjudicator. I gave both 
parties an opportunity to provide comments and further evidence before I made a final 
decision.

What happened
This complaint is about five home credit loans Morses provided to Ms W between June 2018
and December 2020. Ms Ws borrowing history is as follows:
Our adjudicator partly upheld Ms Ws complaint and thought that loan five shouldnt have
been lent. Morses disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms W
could repay the loans without suffering adverse financial consequence. These checks could
take into account a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the
early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and
proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have
done more to establish that it lent responsibly to the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was harmful.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Morses was required to establish
whether Ms W could repay her loans without suffering adverse financial consequences  not
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The adjudicator didnt recommend that loans 1  4 should be upheld and Ms W hasnt
disagreed and so there isnt a continuing discount about those loans. My decision is focused
on loan 5.
By the time of loan 5, Ms W had been borrowing from Morses for over two years, I can see
that during the lending period there was a gap of around four months between when she
repaid loan 3 and when she took out loan 4. As shed been indebted for over two years to
Morses by this stage, I dont think it could reasonably believe that her circumstances had
improved during this four-month break. I dont think that gap was sufficient to break the
lending chain.
Looking at the overall circumstances of the lending relationship here, it doesnt suggest that
loan 5 was harmful to Ms W. Her previous loans had all been the same amount and this loan
was less that previous loans, she had a break in the lending and while I dont think the break
was long enough, it doesnt in my view meet the threshold to show Ms W was dependent on
credit. However, the circumstances of her lending relationship should have prompted Morses
to take its checks further before agreeing this loan, especially as it was overlapping with loan
4 and would have been increasing her repayment amount. Morses could have taken its
checks further by verifying some of the information Ms W provided either through bank
statements, payslips or some other form of verification of her financial circumstances and as
it hasnt done that, I dont think it did enough before lending.
Weve asked Ms W to provide copies of her bank statements from the time of the lending but
as she hadnt provided that information, I dont know what Morses would have seen had it
taken its checks further and so I cant say it lent when it shouldnt have.
The deadline to respond has now passed and neither party has provided further evidence or 
comments.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reconsidered my decision, I see no reason to depart from my provisional findings.
For the reasons given here and in my provisional decision, I wont be asking Morses to do 
anything further.
My final decision
I do not uphold Ms Ws complaint or make any award against Morse Club PLC.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2022.
