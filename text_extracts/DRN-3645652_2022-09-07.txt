The complaint
Ms U complains about her mortgage with National Westminster Bank Plc. She says it has 
refused to give her information needed for her divorce proceedings, and has kept the 
mortgage on a high interest rate she cant afford.
What happened
Ms U and her former husband have a joint mortgage with NatWest. During 2020, Ms U took 
a six month payment deferral as part of the support announced by the regulator during the 
coronavirus pandemic. The payment deferral ended in October 2020.
The existing fixed rate on the mortgage was due to come to an end at the end of November 
2020, so Ms U applied for a new fixed rate. She complains that a new fixed rate wasnt 
applied to the mortgage until the end of May 2021. 
Ms U also complains that NatWest failed to respond to requests for information from her 
solicitors, needed as part of the divorce proceedings with her former husband.
In April 2021, when Ms Us former husband stopped making contributions to the mortgage 
payment, Ms U asked for the payment due date to be moved to the end of the month. She 
complains that NatWest didnt implement this request.
Ms U also asked NatWest to switch the mortgage to interest only. She complains this 
application was refused. And shes unhappy that NatWest wrote to her several times in 2021 
saying that she was in arrears  when Ms U doesnt believe that she was. 
NatWest accepted that it hadnt dealt with the request to move the payment due date to the 
end of the month in good time. It said it had now done this. And while Ms U hadnt made 
payment by the previous due date, as shes made payment by the end of the month it hadnt 
treated the late payment as arrears or reported it to her credit file. NatWest said that it 
couldnt switch the mortgage to interest only without the agreement of Ms Us former 
husband  and, in any case, they didnt meet its eligibility criteria for interest only mortgages. 
It said there wasnt a delay in switching to a new fixed rate. It took several months because 
Ms U and her former husband kept changing their minds about what they wanted, and 
because each of them made applications which the other didnt consent to. Once a final 
application was properly made, in May 2021, the rate switch was actioned straightaway. 
However, NatWest accepted that it hadnt replied to letters from Ms Us solicitor, and offered 
£250 compensation for the inconvenience caused.
Our investigator thought that was a fair outcome, so Ms U asked for an ombudsman to 
review her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In late 2020, Ms U came off a payment deferral and also was coming to the end of the fixed 
rate on her mortgage. At the time, she was going through divorce proceedings. As part of the 
proceedings, the court directed her solicitor, on behalf of both Ms U and her former husband, 
to write to NatWest to ask for information. 
Ive seen a copy of the solicitors letter and the court order. NatWest didnt reply. It now 
accepts that it should have done, and its offered £250 compensation for not doing so. Im 
satisfied thats a fair offer. Im sure it was frustrating that NatWest didnt reply. But Ive not 
seen any evidence from the divorce proceedings that its failure to do so impacted on those 
proceedings. And in any case the information asked for in the letter was about the impact of 
the payment deferral, and about any early repayment charge that might apply if Ms U and 
her former husband took a new rate before the expiry of the old one. 
NatWest had already given Ms U this information in other formats at other times. The 
mortgage offer sets out how the early repayment charge works. And NatWest explained the 
impact of the payment deferral at the time. So Im satisfied that NatWests failure to reply 
had no material impact beyond the frustration of having sent a letter and not received a 
reply.
NatWest should have dealt with Ms Us request to move the payment due date to the end of 
the month when she made it, in April 2021. It didnt do so. But it did move the payment due 
date the next month. And it told Ms U that it would make sure that, if she made the payment 
in full by the end of the month, it would ensure that there were no consequences of missing 
the due date  such as a record of arrears on her credit file.
Ms U says NatWest has impacted her credit file. Shes sent us a screenshot of her credit 
score over time, which has reduced, and says NatWest is to blame for that.
But theres no evidence that NatWest is responsible. In the first place, a credit score is not 
the same as a credit file. A credit file is the full record of the information about payments 
made and missed recorded by all creditors. Whereas a credit score is simply a number given 
by the credit reference agency as a rough guide to the overall health of a credit file 
compared to others. A credit score is not shared with lenders and has no wider function.
Our investigator and her manager have asked Ms U to give us her full credit file several 
times, and she has refused to do so. In the absence of her credit file I cant make any 
findings about what it shows  since I dont know what it shows. I dont know why her credit 
score has reduced  it could be because of something NatWest has done, or because of 
something else. Without seeing her credit file, I cant consider Ms Us complaint that her 
credit file doesnt accurately reflect the management of her mortgage.
I have however looked at the payment history to consider whether it was fair for NatWest to 
write to Ms U saying she was in arrears in the second half of 2021.

From this it can be seen that Ms U paid less than was due in April 2021, September 2021 
and January 2022. And while she paid more than was due in other months, overall the 
mortgage was in arrears between April 2021 and February 2022.
In those circumstances, I dont think NatWest was wrong to say that Ms Us mortgage was in 
arrears. And so it wasnt unfair, or harassment, that it wrote to her to say so and asked her to 
get in touch to discuss the arrears  thats what its supposed to do. 
Ms U hasnt given us her credit file, as I say. But if NatWest recorded that the mortgage was 
in arrears between April 2021 and January 2022, it would have been entitled to do so  
since, as set out above, thats an accurate reflection of the state of the account.
The above payment history also shows that the mortgage payment changed in June 2021, 
reflecting the new fixed rate that was taken in May 2021.
Ive considered what Ms U says about this. And Ive also taken account of NatWests records 
of the applications that were made. Having done so, I dont think NatWest has acted unfairly 
or unreasonably delayed implementing a new rate. 
The investigator set out the full history of the applications that were made between 
November 2020 and May 2021, so I wont repeat it here. But its clear that both Ms U and her former husband separately made applications for new rates  and neither consented to 
the others application. NatWest needs both borrowers to agree before it will make changes 
to a joint mortgage. Its also clear that Ms U changed her mind about what she wanted to 
apply for  in particular whether she wanted to pay the fee upfront or add it to the loan 
balance.
Im satisfied that once the final application was made, in May 2021, NatWest implemented it 
within a reasonable time. And its not responsible for the gap between the fixed rates, from 
November to May, while Ms U and her former husband finalised what they would apply for.
Finally, I turn to Ms Us complaint that NatWest refused to agree to convert the mortgage to 
interest only. She made this application around April 2021, after her former husband had 
stopped making payments to the mortgage. 
Ms U wanted a temporary switch while the court proceedings were concluded and a decision 
made about what was going to happen to the property and the mortgage. She made clear 
that she wanted to convert the mortgage to interest only on a temporary basis, and that her 
reasons for doing so were that the mortgage on repayment terms might be unaffordable and 
she didnt want her credit file impacted.
However, that wouldnt have been possible. Switching the mortgage to interest only on a 
permanent basis requires the mortgage to meet NatWests interest only lending criteria  
which include income thresholds, and  crucially  a viable repayment strategy for repaying 
the mortgage at the end of the term. But this wasnt what Ms U wanted. And, as she herself 
said, this wasnt something her former husband would agree to  though his agreement 
would be required before permanently changing the mortgage.
A temporary switch to interest only is not a change to the mortgage contract. The mortgage 
remains a repayment mortgage, but NatWest agrees that it will only collect the interest, not 
the capital, for a limited period of time. 
In other words, its a form of payment arrangement whereby NatWest agrees to collect less 
than the contractual monthly payment for a period of time by way of forbearance.
And because NatWest is collecting less than the contractual monthly payment, the mortgage 
will go into arrears  arrears by arrangement with the lender, but still arrears.
That means that a temporary switch to interest only would be recorded as arranged arrears 
on Ms Us credit file  but she was very clear that she didnt want any impact to her credit 
file.
In those circumstances, Im not persuaded NatWest did anything wrong here. Neither Ms U 
nor her former husband wanted to convert the mortgage to interest only on a permanent 
basis. And even if they passed NatWests income criteria, Ive seen no evidence of a viable 
repayment strategy for the capital.
While Ms U did want a temporary switch, she didnt understand that doing so would result in 
arrears being recorded to her credit file. I think that if NatWest had agreed a temporary 
interest only arrangement, and explained the consequences, its unlikely Ms U would have 
ended up taking it. And so shes not suffered any detriment through NatWests refusal.
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest has made a fair offer of compensation for not replying to 
Ms Us solicitors letter. And that apart, I dont think I can fairly uphold this complaint.My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms U to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 October 2022.
