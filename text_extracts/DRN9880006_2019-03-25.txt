K821x#15complaint
Miss H complains about the short term loans she took out with Gain  Credit LLC trading as 
Lending Stream. Miss H says that the loans contributed  to a spiral  of debt that forced  her 
into a debt management plan. She says that Lending Stream  shouldve found out about the 
financial problems she had at the time and not lent to her. 
background
Miss H took out 11 instalment loans between  January 2012  and February 2013. Some  of the

Lending Stream has looked at Miss Hs initial complaint and said that it shouldnt be upheld. 
It said that it did appropriate checks before approving all of the loans. And these  checks 
showed that the lending  was affordable and there was no indication that Miss H was in 
financial difficulty. So it thought it was reasonable to lend to her.
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Miss H and Lending Stream  said. He thought 
Miss Hs complaint should be partially  upheld. He thought that Lending  Stream had made  
proportionate checks for loans  1 to 3. So he thought that its decisions to approve these 
loans was reasonable. 
He didnt think that Lending  Stream had made  proportionate checks for loans 4 to 11. He 
thought if it had, then it wouldnt  have agreed  to lend Miss H money  for loans 6 to 11. This is 
because he didnt think that Miss H could afford the repayments. And that Lending Stream 
wouldve seen this had it completed better checks.  
Miss H didnt disagree with our adjudicator.  And Lending Stream  didnt respond.  
So as no agreements been reached, the complaints been passed  to me to me to issue a 
decision.
Ref: DRN98800062my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Having done so, Ive decided to partially  uphold Miss Hs complaint as I think  Lending  
Stream was wrong  to have given Miss H loans 6 to 11. Ill explain why.
Miss H didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion  about loans 1 to 5. Because of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. So I wont  be making a 
decision about them. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Miss H had with 
Lending Stream. So they are something I will take into account when considering the other  
loans she took.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what theyre borrowing in a sustainable manner. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. The lending  shouldnt adversely impact a consumers financial situation.  
The guidance and rules themselves didnt set out compulsory  checks.  But they are clear that 
any checks needed to be proportionate and could take into account a number of different 
things. This could include how much was being  lent, the size of the repayments  and what  the 
lender found out about the consumer. 
So Ive firstly looked at whether Lending Stream  performed proportionate checks. If I think 
that the checks were  proportionate then it usually wouldve been  reasonable for it to lend. 
But if Lending Stream  didnt do proportionate  checks Ive looked  at whether it wouldve been 
apparent to it that the loan repayments  were affordable had it done  better  checks. Lending 
Stream should put things right if its likely to have  then found that the loan repayments were 
unaffordable.  
Lending Stream says:   
it asked Miss H about her monthly income,  it recorded this as being £1,200 for all of 
the lending
it asked Miss H about her monthly expenditure, it recorded this as being between  
£600 and £900  across  all the loans
it obtained data from a credit reference  agency (albeit it hasnt  provided  any detail 
about this other than the credit score)
And based on what it saw from this, it thought  it reasonable to lend to Miss H.
Ref: DRN98800063why I dont  think Lending Streams  checks were  proportionate for loans 6 to 11
Ive carefully thought  about what Lending  Stream and Miss H have  provided  and what both 
sides have said. 
By the time Miss H applied for loan 6 shed  had a relationship with Lending Stream for just 
under a year. And shed already taken 5 loans. So I think Lending Stream  couldve realised 
at that time that Miss H may have some  longer  term financial problems and she wasnt just 
using the loans to help with a temporary cash  flow problem. Lending Stream shouldve  also 
become concerned about whether it knew enough  about Miss Hs true financial situation 
before agreeing to lend.
So I think that it wouldve  been proportionate  to make a full review of Miss Hs financial 
situation before approving loans 6 to 11. And I think that it needed to verify  this information it 
received, as far as it could, to get an accurate picture of Miss Hs finances.  This was so it 
could make sure she was in position to make the repayments sustainably.
I dont think Lending  Stream  did this. As I said above, it relied  on the information Miss H 
provided and the results  of its credit checks.  So I need to think  about  what Lending Stream  
wouldve seen if it had carried  out proportionate checks.
what I think proportionate checks would most  likely have  shown
Miss H has provided some information about  her financial  circumstances. This includes her 
bank statements and a recent credit  report. I accept that this isnt exactly  what  
Lending Stream wouldve seen at the time. But I think  it wouldve found out similar  
information if it had made  proportionate checks, so I think its reasonable to rely on it.
These show that over this period, Miss Hs monthly  income was around  £1,300.  Her normal  
living costs  look to be around £550 a month  and her regular monthly financial commitments 
look to be around £350.  This would give her a monthly disposable income  of around £400 a 
month. 
But Miss H was also using other  short term lenders as she says.  She was borrowing and 
repaying between  around  £300 to £500 each  month  to other  providers over this period. So 
its reasonable to say that her expenditure was either very close to, or above her monthly  
income before she took the loans  from Lending  Stream. So I dont  think she could afford the 
repayments to the loans.   
I think that Lending Stream wouldve found out this information if it had made proportionate 
checks. And I think Lending  Stream  wouldve seen  Miss H wouldnt have been able repay 
these loans in a sustainable  way. So I think that it shouldnt have given loans 6 to 11 to 
Miss H and I think shes lost out as a result of this.
So Im upholding  Miss Hs complaint about  loans 6 to 11. 
Ref: DRN98800064what Lending Stream should do to put things right
To put things right for Miss H, Lending Stream should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loans 6 to 11; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement; and
remove any adverse information recorded on Miss Hs credit  file about  these loans;
HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Miss H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Miss Hs complaint.
Gain Credit LLC should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 April 2019
