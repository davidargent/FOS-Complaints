The complaint
Mr and Mrs D complain about how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) dealt with the 
closure of their account and about obtaining their money from the account.
What happened
Mr and Mrs D say their NatWest account was closed without their knowledge. They live 
outside of the United Kingdom and say they didnt receive any letters from NatWest about 
the account and if they had, then could have moved the money before the account closed. 
Mr and Mrs D say they provided NatWest with identity documents, but it said it could only 
send the money to a trust account in their names which would mean trying to find a bank 
that offered such an account. They would like £9,000 compensation for what took place and 
for the delays in receiving their money as well as for how their complaint was dealt with.
NatWest says it wrote to Mr and Mrs D and told them the account was closing as it no longer 
offered this type of account. It said it is entitled to close an account in line with account terms 
and conditions and sent a number of reminders. NatWest accepts it ought to have 
communicated far better with Mr and Mrs D about the return of their money. It has 
apologised and offered £500 compensation.
Mr and Mrs D brought their complaint to us, and our investigator thought the compensation 
offer should be increased by £200. The investigator thought NatWest was entitled to close 
an account and wrote to Mr and Mrs D to tell them that on a number of occasions. The 
investigator accepted there were communication problems by NatWest and that the money 
hadnt be returned.
NatWest says it will pay the further £200.
Mr and Mrs D dont accept that view and say the letters were sent to their UK address but 
addressed to the trustees not their names and so thought the letters were junk mail. They 
say they have incurred significant costs as a result of not having access to their money and 
have had to borrow money at an interest rate of 5%.
I asked both sides for further information and asked NatWest to consider sending Mr and 
Mrs Ds money by an alternative method which it has now done.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I uphold this complaint in part but think 
the total compensation offer of £700 is appropriate. I appreciate Mr and Mrs D will be 
disappointed by my decision and appreciate their frustration about the delay in them 
receiving their money.
I hope it assists Mr and Mrs D in understanding our role, that we are not NatWests 
regulator. So, its not our role to punish it or direct it about the way in which it runs its 
business. I make that clear as I think its up to NatWest to decide, if as here, it insists on 
sending money from a trust account to another trust account. But I make clear that I 
appreciate that if Mr and Mrs D were unable to open a similar account then on the face of it, 
they could not receive their money. I dont need to say anything more about that as NatWest 
has now sent Mr and Mrs D their money.
Im satisfied that NatWest is entitled to close an account in line with account terms and 
conditions by providing notice and make a commercial decision as here to longer offer a 
certain type of account. I can see Mr and Mrs D accept that. Im also satisfied that NatWest 
wrote to Mr and Mrs D about the account closure and I am unclear why it was thought the 
letters were junk mail when sent to the correct address. I cant fairly hold NatWest 
responsible for what Mr and Mrs D thought about the letters and find it was their 
responsibility to provide NatWest with their correct address. I also cant fairly hold NatWest 
responsible for all of the delay in Mr and Mrs D receiving the money as it provided at least 
six months notice of closing the account and the access/receiving the money problems were 
largely caused by the account closure itself.
There is no dispute here that NatWest didnt deal appropriately with Mr and Mrs D after the 
account had been closed and could have provided far clearer information about the steps 
needed to access the money. But I can see NatWest accepts that and has apologised. So, 
the only real issue for me to decide is the compensation level.
I appreciate Mr and Mrs D say they have incurred massive costs and have been forced to 
borrow an equivalent amount to that in the NatWest account. I have not seen any evidence 
of such agreements or details of any such borrowings. I have also not seen any evidence of 
any financial cost caused by the delay in sending the money. I have also made clear that I 
think some delay was inevitable due to the account closing and the nature of it.
I accept that NatWest ought to have been far clearer in its requirements to Mr and Mrs D and 
I accept that caused fairly significant inconvenience which went on for some months. But I 
think NatWests total compensation offer of £700 is fair and reasonable and in line with the 
type and amount of awards we make. I dont think Mr and Mrs Ds request for £9,000 
compensation is reasonable or in line with our awards. I have made clear that I have not 
seen evidence of any financial loss and I dont think it reasonable for NatWest to have 
checked with Mr and Mrs D if they received the letters or could have known they didnt.
Overall, I appreciate Mr and Mrs D are likely to remain disappointed with what took place, 
but Im satisfied that £700 compensation is appropriate.
Putting things right
NatWest should pay Mr and Mrs D a total of £700 compensation and their acceptance of that 
offer would be in full and final settlement of this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and order National Westminster Bank 
Plc to pay Mr and Mrs D a total of £700 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D and Mr D to 
accept or reject my decision before 22 April 2023.
