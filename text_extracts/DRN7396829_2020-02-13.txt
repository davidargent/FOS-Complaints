K821x#15complaint
Miss B says Elevate Credit International  Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly 
lent to her. 
background
This complaint is about 18 short-term loans Sunny provided to Miss B between January 
2016 to July 2017. Miss Bs borrowing history  is listed on the appendix to this decision. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Bs complaint and initially thought the loans from loan 
six shouldnt have been given. But the complaint  was further reviewed, and the outcome was 
changed so that loans  nine onwards  shouldnt  have been given. The change in outcome was 
because of the pattern of Miss Bs lending. 
Sunny responded by offering to uphold the complaint from loan 15 onwards  but later 
amended this from loan 12 onwards. 
Our adjudicator said that if Miss B had anything further we should  take into account then she 
should reply to the amended opinion.  But we havent heard back from Miss B and Sunny 
disagrees with what  we said in our second adjudication  to uphold the complaint from loan 
nine onwards. 
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN73968292the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss B, with a view to seeing  
if there was a point  at which  Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Bs case, like the adjudicator I think that this point 
was reached by loan nine.  I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss B was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss B had taken out eight  loans within  five months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Miss B was having  to borrow  
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loans was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Bs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Loan nine was taken out the same  day as loan seven was repaid early.  And loans 
ten and 11 were also repaid early on 29 September 2016 - only days before the 
largest loan for £350 was taken on 3 October.  And this happened again  when loans 
13 and 14 were  repaid  the same day as loan 15 was taken. So Miss B was provided 
with new loans either the same day or within days of settling previous loans which  
indicates that the loans  were  unsustainable.  
Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Miss B had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Miss B lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan nine 
onwards because:
Ref: DRN73968293these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans which Miss B borrowed was likely to have had negative  
implications on Miss Bs ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans nine to 18 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
If there are any outstanding balances on Miss Bs loans, and these have been transferred to 
a third party, Sunny should buy the loans  back if it can. If Sunny cant  buy back the loans, it 
needs to work with the third party to make sure the following is achieved: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Miss B towards interest,  fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Miss B which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss B originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges  from the balance on any upheld  outstanding 
loans, and treat any repayments made  by Miss B as though  they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results  in Miss B having  made overpayments then you should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date the complaint is settled. 
Sunny should  then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step 
E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should  be paid to Miss B. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan 
with Miss B. 
Ref: DRN73968294E) The number of loans taken from loan nine onwards  means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loan nine onwards should  be removed 
from Miss Bs credit  file. Sunny does  not have  to remove loans nine onwards from 
Miss Bs credit file until these have been  repaid, but any adverse information 
recorded about these loans should  still be removed.
                                                                                                                               
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Miss B 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Bs complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 March 2020.
