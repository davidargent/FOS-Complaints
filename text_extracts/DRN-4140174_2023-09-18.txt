The complaint
Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly closed his accounts without 
providing an explanation or warning. Mr G says this caused him unnecessary inconvenience 
and worry for which he should be compensated.
What happened
Mr G had three accounts with NatWest. 
In February 2022, following a review, NatWest decided to close all of Mr Gs accounts. 
NatWest wrote to Mr G giving him 60 days notice that he needed to make alternative 
banking arrangements. 
Mr G complained to the bank and asked for an explanation behind his accounts being 
closed. NatWest wouldnt give him much information. It said it had closed his accounts in line 
with the account terms and conditions and regulatory obligations. NatWest also said it wasnt 
obliged to provide Mr G with an explanation behind the closure. So, it didnt uphold Mr Gs 
complaint.
Unhappy with this response, Mr G brought his complaint to our service where one of our 
investigators looked into what had happened. Mr G told us that hed been a good customer 
of the bank for 30 years. He said the accounts were his main accounts and NatWests 
actions had caused him a great deal of stress and worry. He said at the time he was dealing 
with a bereavement, so the banks actions made an already difficult situation much worse for 
him and his children. Mr G also said that NatWest didnt release the funds in his accounts, 
so he had to borrow money from friends to get by, which was upsetting. 
The investigator asked NatWest to provide more information about why it had closed Mr Gs 
accounts. But NatWest said it couldnt provide anything more than it had already provided to 
us. And it maintained that it hadnt treated Mr G unfairly when it had closed his accounts. It 
also pointed out that during the notice period Mr G had full access to his accounts, so he 
could have withdrawn his funds during this time.
The investigator said based on the limited information the bank had provided, she couldnt 
say the bank had treated Mr G fairly when it had closed his accounts. So, she said NatWest 
should pay Mr G £100 compensation for any trouble and upset the closure of his accounts 
had caused Mr G. NatWest accepted what the investigator said. Mr G didnt. He said that the 
amount of compensation doesnt adequately reflect the amount of trouble and upset he has 
suffered. He wants more compensation and wants to know why NatWest closed his 
accounts. 
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, Id like to offer my sympathies to Mr G for his bereavement. Mr G has said that at the 
time NatWest closed his accounts he was dealing with the loss of his wife. So, I can 
understand why he found this whole experience with NatWest frustrating and upsetting  
especially as his attempts to get information from NatWest about why the bank had decided 
to close his accounts didnt give him any answers.
Banks are entitled to decide for themselves whether to do business or continue doing 
business with a customer. Each financial institution has its own criteria and risk assessment 
for deciding whether to continue providing accounts and providing an account to a customer 
is a commercial decision that a financial institution is entitled to take. Thats because it has 
the commercial freedom to decide who it wants as a customer. And unless theres a good 
reason to do so, this service wont usually say that a bank must keep a customer. But they 
shouldnt decline to open an account without proper reason, for instance of unfair bias or 
unlawful discrimination. And they must treat new and existing customers fairly.
Mr G wants NatWest to explain why it no longer wanted him as a customer. But NatWest is 
under no obligation to tell Mr G the reasons behind the account review and closure, as much 
as hed like to know. So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not giving Mr G this 
information. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it do so. 
NatWest can only close accounts in certain circumstances and if its in the terms and 
conditions of the account. NatWest have relied on the terms and conditions when closing 
Mr Gs account. The terms explain that the bank can close the account with notice. However, 
NatWest still needs to provide information to this service so we can fairly decide a complaint. 
Despite being asked by the investigator, NatWest has failed to provide information about 
why it no longer wanted Mr G as a customer. 
Ive considered what NatWest has said about why it wont provide further information to our 
service about the reasons it closed Mr Gs accounts. This service has the power to request 
evidence of this nature under the dispute resolution rules (DISP) and Im not persuaded the 
reasons given by NatWest exclude it from complying with these rules. So, in this particular 
case, because of the lack of information I cant be satisfied that NatWest has treated Mr G 
fairly when it closed his accounts. Taking this into account, I agree NatWest should pay Mr G 
compensation for the trouble and upset caused by closing his accounts.
NatWest agreed to pay £100 as recommended by the investigator. Having considered what 
Mr G has told us about how the closure of his accounts impacted him, Ive no doubt this was 
a worrying and upsetting time for him. He also had to go to the trouble of finding and opening 
new bank accounts. But having looked at all the evidence and circumstances of this 
complaint, I havent found grounds to increase the level of compensation. Im satisfied that 
£100 compensation is a fair amount of compensation and proportionate to the trouble and 
upset Mr G was caused. So, while Mr G may disagree with me, I wont be asking NatWest to 
do anything else to resolve this complaint. 
Finally, Mr G says NatWest didnt allow him access to the money in his account. But from 
looking at Mr Gs account statements I can see that Mr G appears to have been carrying out 
transactions, including cash withdrawals during the notice period. I note too that NatWest 
sent Mr G a cheque for his closing balances. So, I dont agree that NatWest stopped Mr G 
from accessing the money in his accounts.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I uphold this complaint. To put things right National 
Westminster Bank Plc should: 
Pay Mr G £100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused by the bank closing 
his accounts
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 October 2023.
