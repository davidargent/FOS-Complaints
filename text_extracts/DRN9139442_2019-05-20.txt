K821x#15complaint
Ms K, represented by a claims management  company (CMC),  has complained about short 
term loans granted  to her by CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) .
background
Ms K entered into 31 loans with QuickQuid between November 2009 and April 2016. Ms K 
agreed to drop her complaint in regard to the first 16 loans so my decision  focusses  on the 
remaining loans entered into from March 2012  to April 2016.
Loan Date Repaid Amount
17 March 2012 May 2012 £1,350
18 September 2012 January 2013 £1,350
19 January 2013 April 2013 £1,350
20 April 2013 July 2013 £1,350
21 July 2013 September 2013 £400
22 September 2013 November 2013 £1,350
23 November 2013 February 2014 £600
24 February 2014 March 2014 £600
25 November 2014 November 2014 £250
26 January 2015 February 2015 £300
27 February 2015 May 2015 £400
28 July 2015 September 2015 £250
29 October 2015 November 2015 £300
30 December 2015 March 2016 £250
31 April 2016 June 2016 £600
Ms K says that at the time of the loans she was in a debt spiral and that the loans  werent 
affordable. She says that QuickQuid didnt  carry out sufficient affordability checks or 
adequately assess  her indebtedness.
QuickQuid says that it carried out checks  before the loans were  provided that were in line 
with its internal process. It says that as part of its assessment it conducted  its standard  credit 
assessment. It says that Ms K didnt inform it at any time that she was in financial hardship.  
It didnt accept the lending to Ms K was irresponsible.
Our adjudicator upheld  this complaint. She didnt  think that the loans should have been  
provided and recommended that Ms K be refunded all interest  and charges that she paid on 
the loans from 29 March 2012 until 5 April 2016 (along with interest) and that all entries 
about these loans should be removed  from Ms Ks credit file.
QuickQuid didnt accept  our adjudicators view. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Ms K accepts my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my provisional conclusions
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. I concluded in summary:
Ref: DRN91394422Ms Ks history  of borrowing  showed that before  the March 2012 loan was provided  she 
had taken out a number  of similar sized loans. Her loan amount wasnt reducing and she 
was taking out new loans within a short time frame  of repaying her previous loans. I 
thought this should have raised concerns that Ms K was reliant on short term borrowing 
and that she was funding her repayments  by further borrowing;
the amounts  Ms K was borrowing at the time often resulted in a repayment amount  of 
over 60% of her income. I noted  QuickQuids comments about needing to assess each 
loan, but given the number of loans, the size of the repayments  and Ms Ks pattern of 
borrowing I thought  that the loans provided  by QuickQuid  from March 2012 up to 
February 2014 were  not sustainably affordable;
there was a break in the lending  chain between the repayment of the February 2014 loan 
and when the next loan was taken out. This was a gap of around  eight  months and I 
thought it reasonable to accept that the following loans  formed a new lending chain;
the checks carried out before the first two loans in the new lending chain were  provided 
were reasonable and didnt suggest  the loans were unaffordable;
the third loan in this new lending chain was for £400. The amount Ms K was borrowing 
was smaller than in the previous lending chain but given  Ms Ks previous lending history 
I thought QuickQuid should have  been concerned  that she had become persistently 
reliant on short-term loans again. Ms K had taken three  loans in eight months, and the 
amounts she was borrowing increased  over this period and didnt significantly decrease 
for the rest of the borrowing  relationship  with QuickQuid;
although there were  some short gaps between Ms K repaying a loan and asking to 
borrow again, I didnt  think it would have been reasonable for QuickQuid to conclude 
these were any indication that Ms Ks finances had moved on from whatever situation  
had required her previous  loans.  
Overall, I thought that Ms K lost out because  QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from 
loan 17 to 24 (inclusive) and loan 28 onwards. These loans had the effect of unfairly 
prolonging Ms Ks indebtedness  by allowing her to take expensive  credit intended for short-
term use over an extended period of time.  The sheer number of loans was likely to have had 
negative implications on Ms Ks ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans. Because of this I upheld the complaint about loans 17 to 24 
and loans 28 to 31.  
Ms K accepted my provisional  decision. 
QuickQuid said that it believed its checks were proportionate. It said Ms K had a good  
repayment history and that based  on its checks the loans were affordable.
QuickQuid confirmed that it had nothing further  (beyond the points referred to above)  to add 
and so I have  now come to my final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
Ref: DRN91394423complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
As I set out in my provisional  decision, QuickQuid needed to take reasonable steps  to 
ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In practice  this means that it should have carried  out 
proportionate checks to make sure that Ms K could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate (depending on other  relevant  factors).  In this case Ms K had a 
long established  lending history with QuickQuid.  QuickQuid  was required to establish  
whether Ms K could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
While I note the response provided by QuickQuid this does not change  my decision on this 
complaint. Ms K had a long history of borrowing from QuickQuid and she was taking out new 
loans shortly after repaying her previous loans. Aside from the loans taken out immediately 
after the break in the lending chain, I find that Ms Ks pattern of borrowing showed the loans 
were unsustainable.
my final decision
My final is that I uphold this complaint in regard  to loans 17 to 24 (March 2012 to February  
2014) and loans  28 to 31 (July 2015  to April 2016).  For each of these  loans CashEuroNet 
UK LLC trading  as Quick Quid should;
refund  any interest and charges  paid by Ms K on the loans;
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken means  any information recorded about  them  is adverse. So all 
entries about loans  17 to 24 and loans 28 to 31 should be removed from Ms Ks credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Ms K a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 June  2019.
