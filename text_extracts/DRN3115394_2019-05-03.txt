K821x#15complaint
Mr Q complains that Uncle  Buck  Finance LLP was irresponsible to lend to him.
background
Mr Q had seven loans  from Uncle Buck between December 2014 and September 2015  as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 4 Dec 2014 £300 28d £404.85 31 Dec 2014 On time
2 31 Dec 2014 £550 31d £742.22 30 Jan 2015 On time
3 2 Feb 2015 £525 26d £634.20 27 Feb 2015 On time
4 3 Mar 2015 £525 30d £651.00 31 Mar 2015 On time
5 2 Apr 2015 £500 29d £616.00 30 Apr 2015 On time
6 1 May 2015 £560 91d 3 x £281.59 31 Jul 2015 On time
7 29 Sep 2015 £560 93d 3 x £285.97 31 Dec 2015 Outstanding
Mr Q says he was in serious financial difficulty at the time of these loans and was using one 
short-term loan to repay another. He says the pattern of his borrowing should have triggered  
further checks and other  lenders turned him down for loans in the same  period.
Uncle Buck  says it reviewed Mr Qs credit file and carried out affordability checks. But it 
acknowledged that it should  have  become  aware from his borrowing pattern that Mr Q was 
becoming reliant on such lending and it says it should have asked for further information 
after loan 3. Therefore Uncle Buck offered to refund interest and charges on loans 4 and 5.
Mr Q did not accept Uncle Bucks  offer and says he could not understand why it did not 
uphold subsequent loans.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He was satisfied that Uncle  
Buck did enough  checks  before approving loan 1, but considered it should have done better 
checks for the other loans. He found  that, had it done  so, Uncle  Buck is likely to have found  
the remaining  loans  were unaffordable to Mr Q and that, by loan 7, his pattern of borrowing 
should have indicated financial difficulties. He recommended that Uncle Buck  should  refund 
interest and charges on loans 2 to 7 (plus 8% statutory interest),  remove  negative 
information from Mr Qs credit  file about loans  2 to 6 and remove  loan 7 from his credit file 
entirely.
Uncle Buck  responded to say, in summary,  that it consistently offered a lower loan amount 
than the amounts for which Mr Q applied. But it now agreed that the repayment on loan 2 left 
Mr Q with very little for unexpected expenses based  on his declared  disposable  income. 
Uncle Buck  says this should have caused it to carry out further checks, so it therefore 
revised its offer to include  loan 2, as well as loans  4 and 5. But it explained that the same did 
not apply to loan 3 as Mr Q was left with over £120 after the repayment was taken into 
account. It said that, as loans 6 and 7 were  instalment loans, the repayments  did not appear 
unaffordable and his credit report showed  no additional short-term loans. It added  that loan 6 
was repaid on time and there  was a gap in lending  between  loans  6 and 7. Uncle Buck  also 
pointed out that Mr Q told it in November 2015  that he had not included  all his creditors in 
the figures he provided. It says it cannot take responsibility for inaccuracies in Mr Qs loan 
applications.
Ref: DRN31153942Mr Q did not accept this revised offer.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Uncle Buck  was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks to make sure Mr 
Q could afford to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr Q was borrowing, and his lending  history.  But 
there was no set list of checks Uncle Buck had to do.
As Uncle Buck has now agreed to uphold the complaint with regard to loans 2, 4 and 5, I 
wont consider those further here.
Loan 3
Mr Q told Uncle Buck that his disposable income was £760 at the time of his third loan 
application. I accept  Uncle  Buck offered  Mr Q less than the £800  for which  hed applied,  but 
given the large  scheduled  repayment  in relation to Mr Qs income, I consider it should also 
have asked him specifically about any other  short-term loans.
I can see from Mr Qs credit file that he took out a short-term loan in December 2014 for 
which he was repaying £172 per month. As his declared disposable income  was £760, Im 
satisfied Mr Q could not also afford  the £634  repayment that was scheduled on loan 3.
Loan 6
By the time Mr Q applied  for loan 6, I consider a proportionate check should have included a 
full review of Mr Qs financial circumstances. I accept  Uncle Buck says Mr Q provided 
incorrect information, but such a review is intended  to verify the information provided.
Had it done so, Uncle Buck  would have found  Mr Qs income was roughly what  hed 
declared at £3,000. He spent £1,100 on rent, at least £600 on travel and around £300  on 
bills, including credit  cards, television and phone costs. Mr Q says he spent about £300 each 
month on food, so that left him with roughly £700  before any other expenses are taken into 
account. But Mr Q also needed  to pay three  other short-term loan companies over £600 in 
May 2015 and he was spending several  hundred  pounds on gambling each month.
So Im satisfied that, if Uncle Buck had carried out a proportionate check,  it would not have 
approved loan 6.
Loan 7
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Uncle Bucks lending  history with Mr Q, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Uncle Buck should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Uncle  Buck should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Qs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
Mr Q was consistently provided  with a new loan within weeks of settling a previous 
one. So Uncle Buck ought to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr Q was 
Ref: DRN31153943having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances and that Mr Qs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Q wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Uncle Buck.  Loan  7 was 
taken out almost ten months after Mr Qs first. And it was for almost twice the 
amount. Mr Q had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Uncle  
Buck over an extended period.
I think that Mr Q lost out because Uncle Buck continued to provide borrowing because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Qs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Qs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loan 7 and Uncle Buck  should put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Uncle Buck Finance LLP should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr Q paid on loans 2 to 7;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  on loan 7, apply  the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr Q; 
Remove any negative  information about loans 2 to 6 from Mr Qs credit file.
the number  of loans taken by the time Mr Q took out loan 7 means any information 
recorded about loan 7 is adverse. So all entries  about loan 7 should be removed  from 
Mr Qs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr Q a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If Uncle  
Buck intends  to apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding capital balance, it must do so 
after deducting the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr Q to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 Jun 2019.
