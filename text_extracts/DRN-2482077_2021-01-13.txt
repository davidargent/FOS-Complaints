The complaint
Mr. O complains that NewDay limited trading as Aqua shouldnt have agreed his application
for a credit card due to his financial situation. He has asked for a refund of charges and
interest applied to his account
What happened
Mr. O says he successfully applied for a credit card in 2018 with NewDay with a £300 limit.
He says at this point he had numerous payday loans, several credit card accounts as well as
a poor credit score. He feels NewDay shouldnt have approved his application based on his
financial situation.
NewDay said it carried out appropriate checks. It also explained that the credit card was one
that was designed to assist customers to build or improve their credit scores, so it wasnt
unusual for those with poor credit scores to be given the card.
My provisional decision 
I issued a provisional decision in which I found:-
Mr O told us  he had multiple financial commitments when he took out his NewDAy 
credit card in April 2018.
NewDay carried out a credit check but the CRA it used to provide different financial 
information to that Mr. O  gave us. NewDay said it didnt use more than one CRA as 
Mr. Os application wasnt declined. And it felt it had enough information from the 
CRA it did check with.
It was for  NewDay to decide which CRAs to use. I saw that in  its search  no 
accounts were shown in arrears, there were no debt management plan or active 
repayment plans. And the defaults recorded were over three years  old.
The information also showed a balance of £352 on payday loans with no such loans 
in arrears for the last six months and no defaults in the 12 months prior to his 
application.
NewDay  explained that its credit card is aimed at customers who wish to improve or 
build on their credit scores so a poor credit score wouldnt mean an application 
wouldnt be accepted. 
So even if NewDay had had the benefit of information from other CRAs, given the 
nature of its card, it may have still decided to accept Mr. Os application.
Based on all the information I had and on Mr Os declared income of £22,000 for 
which I thought Mr. O had to take responsibility for giving that information, I didnt feel 
it was unreasonable for NewDay to feel it had sufficient information to agree the 
credit application particularly as it set the credit limit at a relatively low £300 limit. And 
I understood Mr. O did initially make the regular payments required which didnt 
indicate he couldnt afford the card when he initially got it.
NewDay  acted as we would expect in this case in helping Mr. O to manage his 
account. In 2018 it blocked Mr. Os card as had gone over his credit limit by £12.45. It 
wrote to advise Mr. O of this and to explain what he needed to do. It didnt just allow 
Mr. O to continue to build up debt on his card over and above the set credit limit.
In January 2019 Mr. O contacted NewDay to advise he had unexpected costs due to 
a bereavement. As a result, NewDay set up a £5 a month payment plan to help Mr. 
O. It reviewed and extended this plan in July 2019 and in October 2019 reduced the 
payment plan to £1per month. In April 2020 it agreed to a further six-month extension 
but advised Mr. O that he was at risk of the debt being sold on. These payment plans 
were at zero interest. It also refunded a £12 late payment fee.
Mr O had now  paid off his outstanding debt in full. Had he not done so I might have 
asked NewDAy to agree a suitable repayment plan to allow him to do so.
With regard to the adverse data  on Mr. Os credit file. As I didnt find NewDAy to be 
at fault I couldnt reasonably ask it to amend the credit file as Mr. O would like. Its 
important that credit files are an accurate reflection of a consumers financial 
situation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay accepted my provisional decision and made no further comments for me to 
consider.
Mr O responded to say his main issue was that he didnt feel the information on his credit file 
was either fair or accurate. He said he wasnt asking for  late payments to be taken off his 
credit file, but he did want the default removed.
He said he had kept up to date with repayment plans so didnt understand why the default 
was registered. And that it only showed up on his May 2020 credit file but in June 2020 he 
settled his account. He says the default is under the name of the company that NewDay sold 
the debt onto.
I have checked back on the information NewDay has given us. From the customer contact 
notes Mr O was advised in April 2020 that he risked a default on his credit file. That would 
accord with Mr Os comment that NewDay didnt register a default against him prior to this. 
NewDay then sold Mr Os account on in May 2020. 
I dont know why NewDay didnt register a default whilst it had Mr Os account. I believe it 
would have been entitled to do so as Mr Os account was in arrears.
The default showing on Mr Os credit file is under the name of the company NewDay sold 
the debt onto. As Mr O then settled the account the following month I can understand he 
might find the default harsh. But the account was in arrears when NewDay sold it on .
However, this complaint is against NewDay so  I can only  consider its actions not that of any 
other companies. If Mr O feels the default is unfair, he might want to consider formally 
complaining to that company . I dont feel Mr O has given me sufficient new information for me to feel I should change my 
provisional decision with regard to his complaint with NewDay.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint .
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 February 2021.
