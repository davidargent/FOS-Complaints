DRN-2745188
The complaint
Mr and Mrs R complain that they were not notified that a travel insurance benefit was 
removed from their Joint Flex Account (JFA) in 2018 by Nationwide Building Society 
(Nationwide) and they lost out as a result.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. 
The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This case hinges on whether Nationwide notified Mr and Mrs R of a change in the travel 
insurance requirement.
Ive looked at Nationwides evidence, which is its records of correspondence sent. Based on 
this I think its more likely than not that Nationwide did send Mr and Mrs R three letters which 
clearly told them that they needed to send in a health declaration to retain the insurance 
prior to removing it in 2018.
Mr and Mrs R say they didnt receive the letters, and I dont doubt their honest recollections. 
But even taking into account any postal problems that occasionally occur, Im not able to say 
that I think its more likely than not that they didnt receive any of the three letters as I would 
need to if I were to uphold their complaint.
And, in my view, Nationwide contacting Mr and Mrs R in this way reasonably fulfils the 
requirement on the business to notify any customer of changes to a product.
So, although I know Mr and Mrs R will be disappointed, I dont think Nationwide did anything 
wrong in this matter. 
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold Mr and Mrs Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R and Mrs R to 
accept or reject my decision before 12 October 2021.
