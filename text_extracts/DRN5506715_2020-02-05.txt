Ms H has said Mr Lender did not lend to her responsibly and should have realised that she 
had become reliant on short-term loans. Mr Lender  has said it completed  the appropriate 
affordability checks and credit checks before providing the loans.  
Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Hs complaint in part and thought loans  1 to 6 shouldnt have 
been given. Mr Lender disagreed so the complaint  has been  passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN55067152the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Ms H could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Hs complaint.
Ms H hasnt disagreed  with our adjudicators opinion on loan 7 (chain 2) and loan 8 (chain 3) 
so I wont be looking at these any further as there is no ongoing disagreement about them. 
But I will bear them in mind when  Im looking at Ms Hs other lending. 
When Ms H asked to borrow loan 1, I can see the monthly repayment that Mr Lender  
required took up a significant proportion of Ms Hs declared monthly  income over an 
extended period  of time. In the circumstances and despite the checks  that Mr Lender carried 
out, there  was a significant risk that Ms H wouldnt have been able to repay the loan without  
undue difficulty or borrowing further. I dont consider it was reasonable for Mr Lender to 
agree to lend based on what it knew about  Ms H. 
It follows that I uphold  Ms Hs complaint about loan 1, and as a result I also uphold Ms Hs 
complaint about  loans  2 to 5.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders  lending history with Ms H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender  should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Mr Lender should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Ref: DRN55067153Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Hs case, I think that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because by loan 6, Ms Hs overall  pattern of borrowing suggested that she 
had become persistently reliant on short-term  loans. Ms H had borrowed on six occasions in 
15 months and although  the amounts fluctuated  didnt significantly decrease over this period 
and for the rest of the borrowing relationship  with Mr Lender.  So Mr Lender  ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Ms H as having to borrow further  to cover the hole 
repaying her previous  loan was leaving in her finances and that Ms Hs indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
I think that Ms H lost out because Mr Lender  continued to provide borrowing at loan 6 
because this loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Hs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time. The 
number of loans  and the length of time over which Ms H borrowed was likely to have had 
negative implications on Ms Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 1 to 6 and Mr Lender should put things right.
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms H paid on 1 to 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about 1 to 5 from Ms Hs credit file;
loan 6 being taken means any information recorded about it is adverse.  So all entries 
about loan 6 should be removed from Ms Hs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender  
must give Ms H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Hs complaint. PDL Finance Limited  
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 March 2020
