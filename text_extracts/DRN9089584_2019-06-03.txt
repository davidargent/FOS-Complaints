K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that Volkswagen Financial  Services (UK) Limited (VFS) made  errors in 
handling his agreement when his car was written off.
background
Mr C has a car which had been  funded by a hire purchase agreement  with VFS. He was 
about to voluntarily terminate the agreement when the car was in an accident and was 
written off. VFS gave  the insurer a settlement figure of £9.041.67.  The insurer agreed to pay 
out £12,410 and after paying VFS,  the balance of £2,718.33 was sent to Mr C. 
However, VFS had made an error and the actual  value  of the car was £11,856.28  and so it 
sought £2,814.61 from Mr C. Subsequently  the insurer  said it had made a mistake in 
calculating the excess and it agreed it owed  a further £650 which it was due to pay to VFS. 
This reduced  the sum owed by Mr C. He complained and VFS offered to reduce the shortfall 
liability to £579.17.  In doing  so it noted that Mr C had exceeded his agreed  mileage  by over 
20,000 miles. 
It explained that the guide price taking  into account  the high mileage was actually £10,850 
inclusive of VAT and the figure  of £9,041.67  was the net price. It agreed  to honour this price 
and calculated the revised sum as follows:
the current shortfall liability  of £2,814.61  is reduced to £1,808.33
On receipt of £650.00 from your insurer the shortfall  will reduce to £1.158.33
VWFS will offer a 50:50 contribution of £1,158.33  equating to £579.17
Once you pay the new shortfall  balance of £579.17 and assuming your insurer make 
the additional payment promised of £650.00,  your credit file will be updated and any 
adverse information  recorded resulting from this matter will be removed
Mr C brought his complaint to this service  where  it was considered  by one of our 
adjudicators who thought  the offer made by VFS was fair. Mr C agreed  subject to 
confirmation he wouldnt be pursued  for the £650 owed  by the insurer. The adjudicator  
contacted the insurer  which explained that there hadnt been a £650 overpayment.  
She asked  VFS if it would write  off the £650, but it didnt think it should.  It said that it had 
reduced the sum he owed substantially and if Mr C had voluntarily terminated the agreement  
he would  have had to pay a substantial sum due to the excess  mileage. The adjudicator 
agreed and told Mr C that he had had use of the funds which  the insurer had paid him when  
the money was due to VFS. Mr C didnt agree  and said he was willing to pay £579.17  in 
three instalments.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It is unfortunate that several errors have been  made  and there was confusion  as to what was 
due to VFS.  The reality  is that all the proceeds from the insurer should  have been paid to 
VFS to cover  the money owed by Mr C. Looking at the legal positon Mr C owes  the full 
amount claimed  by VFS since he wasnt entitled to the money paid to him by the insurer.  
Normally in resolving complaints this service  endeavours to put consumers back  in the

sum.
However, I agree that would be an unreasonable outcome given the role of VFS in the 
situation. It contributed  to the confusion due to a mistake being  made  as to the value of the 
car. Mr C benefitted from that error and has had a larger sum paid to him than he was 
entitled to and I gather he has spent it. I believe VFS should reduce the sum he owes,  but I 
dont think the error  is such that it should write off the whole sum. 
The situation  has been compounded by additional confusion over the £650  it was thought 
was owed by the insurer. This was never available to reduce the sum owed and should be 
discounted in any calculations of the balance Mr C should  pay. In essence VFS has agreed 
to write off £1,584.70 for its error.  This leaves Mr C owing £1,229.91. I am satisfied that if the 
car hadnt been written off than Mr C would have  been much worse  off financially as he 
would have owed  a significant  sum for the excess mileage. 
I suggested that the shortfall of £ 1,808.33  after discounting the £650  should be split equally 
between the parties  with each paying  £904.16. Both agreed,  but Mr C asked that he be 
allowed to pay this sum in instalments. 
I can see that having been  paid the incorrect larger sum Mr C feels  aggrieved having to pay 
some of it back, but I think a 50:50  split is fair. However I am aware  that this might cause 
Mr C some financial difficulty and I would remind VFS of its duty to treat customers positively 
and sympathetically. To this end it should work with Mr C to arrange  payment within  a 
reasonable timeframe. Assuming some arrangement  can be made I would expect VFS to 
remove any adverse information  it has put on his credit file.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I direct Volkswagen Financial Services 
(UK) Limited to accept  £904.16 in settlement of the debt. Under the rules  of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or reject  my decision 
before 3 July 2019.
