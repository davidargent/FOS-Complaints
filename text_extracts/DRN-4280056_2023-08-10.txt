DRN-4280056
Complaint
Miss A has complained about a loan Everyday Lending Limited (trading as Everyday 
Loans) provided to her. 
She says the loan was unaffordable.
Background
Everyday Loans provided Miss A with a loan for £1,200.00 in September 2021. This loan 
had a term of 18 months and an APR of 249.5%. This meant that the total amount to be 
repaid of £2,744.64, including interest, fees and charges of £1,544.64, was due to be repaid 
in 18 monthly instalments of £152.48. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Miss As complaint and she thought Everyday Loans 
shouldnt have provided Miss A with her loan. So she thought that Miss As complaint should 
be upheld. 
Everyday Loans disagreed so the case was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Miss As complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything Ive decided to uphold Miss As complaint. Ill explain 
why in a little more detail.
Everyday Loans needed to make sure it acted fairly and reasonably when lending to Miss A. 
In practice, what this means is Everyday Loans needed to find out enough about Miss A 
such that it could have a reasonable understanding of whether Miss A could afford to repay 
any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
The information Everyday Loans has provided suggested that it carried out a credit check 
and requested copies of bank statements from Miss A before this loan was provided. The 
results of which showed that Miss A was already paying a significant proportion of her 
monthly income towards credit repayments and was in a cycle of high-cost lending, which 
she was in arrears on. 
I also have concerns that Miss A was supposedly going to consolidate, at least some, debts 
that had much lower rates of interest than this one. So its unclear to me how this loan, which 
was on such disadvantageous terms, was going to improve Miss As outgoings going 
forward. I dont think the note about educating Miss A about the impact of doorstep lending 
changes this.
Indeed Ive also noted that Everyday Loans own notes state it was concerned about 
indebtedness and recency. And that a significant proportion of what I consider to have been 
Miss As low monthly income was being taken up by repayments to credit.
Overall and having considered everything, Im persuaded by what Miss A has said about 
already being in a difficult financial position at the time she took out this loan. And while its 
possible Miss As difficulties reflected her choices rather than financial difficulty, Id add that 
my experience of these types of cases suggest this is unlikely, in the absence of any 
reasonable or plausible arguments from Everyday Loans, Ive been persuaded to accept   
Miss As version of events. 
As this is the case, I do think that Miss As existing financial position meant that she was 
unlikely to be able to afford the payments to this loan, without undue difficulty or borrowing 
further. And Im satisfied that reasonable enquiries into Miss As circumstances would more 
like than not have shown Everyday Loans that it shouldnt have provided this loan to her. As 
Everyday Loans provided Miss A with this loan, notwithstanding this, Im satisfied it failed to 
act fairly and reasonably towards her. 
Miss A ended up paying interest, fees and charges on a loan she shouldnt have been 
provided with. So Im satisfied that Miss A lost out because of what Everyday Loans did 
wrong and that it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what Everyday Loans needs to do to put things right for Miss A
Having thought about everything, Everyday Loans should put things right for Miss A by:
refunding all interest, fees and charges Miss A paid on her loan;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Miss A to the date of settlement
removing any and all adverse information it recorded about this loan from Miss As 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Everyday Loans to take off tax from this interest. 
Everyday Loans must give Miss A a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she 
asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Miss As complaint. Everyday Lending Limited 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept or reject my decision before 7 September 2023.
