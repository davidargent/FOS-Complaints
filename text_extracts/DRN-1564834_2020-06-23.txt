The complaint
Mr R complains that Contis Financial Services Limited (Contis) withdrew the Faster Payment 
service after he was told it had been permanently added to his account. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The Faster Payment service has never formed part of the terms that set out the 
services offered by Contis or the original owner of Mr Rs account. The account terms 
say Contis will charge £10 for making a CHAPS transfer. 
Contis has explained the free Faster Payment service was temporarily offered from 1 
November 2019 for five weeks. 
Ive listened to Mr Rs call with Contis on 2 December 2019 but didnt hear any 
advice that the Faster Payment service would remain in place permanently. 
On 13 December 2019 Contis completed a CHAPS transfer for Mr R but refunded 
the £10 fee. I think that was fair as Mr R had expected to make a free Faster 
Payment. But Contis told Mr R the service had been withdrawn and that he would 
need to make other arrangements in the future. 
I haven't found that Contis made a mistake and I'm satisfied it has dealt with Mr R's 
complaint fairly. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
