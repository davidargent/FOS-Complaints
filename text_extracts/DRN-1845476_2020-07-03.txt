The complaint
summary of complaint
Mr H complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) closed his personal accounts, froze 
his funds and gave him poor customer service.
background to complaint
In October 2018, Barclays closed Mr Hs personal accounts. Mr H has also complained 
about the accounts for his limited company, and his joint personal accounts. But I will deal 
with those complaints in separate decisions. This decision will only deal with Mr Hs sole 
personal account with Barclays.
Mr H complained to Barclays, saying he wanted them to reopen his accounts, and release 
the money held in his accounts. Barclays declined to do so until it had completed its review, 
which it did on 21 December 2018.
I have dealt with Barclays handling of Mr Hs request to withdraw his funds in my decision 
relating to his limited company account. So, I wont address those matters again in this 
decision.
Although Barclays told Mr H it would be closing his accounts, they actually remained open 
(but blocked) until 10 January 2019. Barclays issued its final response to Mr Hs complaint 
shortly after (18 January 2019).
It explained it had acted in accordance with the terms and conditions of Mr Hs accounts but 
declined to explain the reasons for its decision.
Our investigator said that Barclays was entitled to close Mr Hs accounts, and that it had 
made him aware it was doing so. She did say Barclays shouldve sent a letter confirming, but 
that the failure to issue a letter hadnt made much difference, as Mr H was aware the 
account was closing.
She acknowledged Barclays failings in delaying the closure of his accounts and failing to 
issue a written notice but didnt think it was necessary to make a separate award for 
compensation, as she had already done so in connection with Mr Hs limited company 
account.
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having reviewed Mr Hs complaint, I have 
decided not to uphold it, for the following reasons.
A bank is entitled to close an account with a customer, so long it does so in a way that 
complies with the terms and conditions of the customers account. The terms and conditions of Mr Hs accounts  with which both Barclays and Mr H had to 
comply  say that Barclays could close the accounts by giving two months notice, or 
immediately and without notice, under certain circumstances. 
Having looked at the evidence Barclays has provided me, Im satisfied it didnt breach its 
terms of business when it closed Mr Hs accounts. And that it wasnt obliged to share the 
reasons for its decision with Mr H.
As with Mr Hs limited company account, Barclays didnt follow its usual process of 
confirming the account closure in writing. And it didnt actually close Mr Hs account until 
two-and-a-half months after it told Mr H it would do so.
But I can see Mr H was aware Barclays had blocked his accounts, and that it intended to 
close them. So, while Barclays didnt follow its usual process, Im not persuaded the 
mistakes it made had a significant impact on Mr H, such that they would justify a separate 
award of compensation, over and above that offered in connection with Mr Hs limited 
company accounts.
my final decision
For reasons set out above, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 August 2020.
