The complaint
Mr K complains about the quality of a car he acquired under a hire purchase agreement 
(agreement) with Black Horse Limited trading as Land Rover Financial Services (LRFS).
What happened
In June 2018 Mr K purchased a new car under an agreement with LRFS costing £57,016. 
Under the terms of the agreement, everything else being equal, a deposit of £5,231 was 
payable immediately (£3,000 from Mr K and £2,231 from the supplying dealership) followed 
by 47 monthly payments of £654.63 and 1 monthly payment of £30,553  making a total 
repayable of £66,551.61 at an APR of 5.9%. The permitted maximum mileage under the 
agreement was 40,000.
Between January 2019 and March 2020 the car, on at least three occasions, was repaired 
under warranty. These repairs included repairs (or attempted repairs) to the cars alarm 
system and Bluetooth. In January 2019 the car had travelled approximately 9,000 miles.
In March 2020 Mr K complained to LRFS about the quality of the car.
Between March 2000 and August 2000 the car, on at least two occasions, was repaired 
under warranty. These repairs included repairs (or attempted repairs) to the cars alarm 
system. In August 2020 the car had travelled approximately 27,000 miles.
In August 2020 LRFS issued a final response letter (FRL). Under cover of this FRL LRFS 
said it was prepared to:
collect the car at no cost to Mr K
cancel the agreement with nothing further for Mr K to pay
refund to Mr K the £3,000 deposit he paid
refund to Mr K £8,255.76 of the monthly agreement payments he had made, broken 
down as follows:
o22 x £654.63 monthly agreement payments made £14,401.86
o13,658 miles travelled to June 2019 @ 45p a mile (£6,146.10)
ototal £8,255.76
pay to Mr K £1,513.88 interest on the sums of £3,000 and £8,255.76, broken down 
as follows:
ogross interest at 8% simple a year £1,892.35
obasic rate income tax at 20% (£378.47)
onet interest at 8% simple a year £1,513.88
pay Mr K £300 for any trouble and upset caused
Mr K didnt accept LRFS offer and decided to keep the car.
In July 2021 the car passed its first MOT test with no advisories. In July 2021 the car had 
travelled approximately 37,000 miles.
In August 2022 the car passed its second MOT test with no advisories. In August 2022 the 
car had travelled approximately 55,000 miles.
In November 2022 Mr K complained to LRFS about the quality of the car.
In December 2022 Mr K confirmed to LRFS that all the faults with the car had been repaired 
except the fault with the alarm system and Bluetooth.
In January 2023, and after an inspection of the car had taken place with a recorded mileage 
of approximately 62,000 miles, LRFS issued a second FRL. Under cover of this FRL LRFS 
said it was prepared to cover the cost of an alarm system repair  on evidence of the same 
being provided  and to pay £50 for any trouble and upset caused. However, it wasnt 
prepared to cover the cost of a Bluetooth repair as this was a new aspect that was not 
raised until November 2022 and therefore no evidence it was present or developing at sale.  
In January 2023 Mr K complained to LRFS about the quality of the car.
In February 2023 LRFS issued a third FRL. Under cover of this FRL LRFS said it wasnt 
upholding Mr Ks complaint.
In March 2023 Mr K complained to our service.
In April 2023 the car was sold. In April 2023 the car had travelled approximately 
62,000 miles.
For reasons not material to this complaint LRFS treated the car as having been voluntary 
surrendered by Mr K, rather than returned by Mr K at the end of the agreement. 
Mr Ks complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
LRFS, to the extent it hadnt done so already, should pay Mr K £350 and meet the cost  on 
evidence being provided  of any alarm system repair undertaken by him.
Mr K didnt agree with the investigators view and so his complaint has been passed to me 
for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im very aware that Ive summarised this complaint above in far less detail than it may merit. 
No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on what I think are the key issues 
here. Our rules allow me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as 
a free alternative to the courts. If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive 
ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual argument to be 
able to reach what I think is the right outcome. I will, however, refer to those crucial aspects 
which impact my decision.
Secondly, I would add that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.As the agreement entered into by Mr K is a regulated one this service is able to consider 
complaints relating to it. LRFS is also the supplier of the goods under this type of agreement 
and so are responsible for a complaint about their quality. 
The Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) covers agreements like the one Mr K entered into 
and says that goods should be of satisfactory quality when supplied. Cars are of satisfactory 
quality if they are of a standard that a reasonable person would find acceptable, taking into 
account factors such as the age, the mileage and the price paid.
Given the car in this case was new, cost nearly £70,000, the number of repairs undertaken 
on it and when, I can confirm that Im of the view that the car was of unsatisfactory quality 
when supplied to Mr K. But to be fair, I dont think that LRFS dispute this fact.
Given that Im of the view that the car was of unsatisfactory quality when supplied, what I 
now need to decide is what, if anything, LRFS should have to do to fairly and reasonably 
compensate Mr K for this fact.
The CRA allows for a number of remedies in a case like this, rejection, repair or replace. But 
none of these are viable options because the car has been sold on. So the only thing I can 
do is direct LRFS, where appropriate, to pay Mr K a financial sum in compensation. And 
having considered everything the parties have said and submitted, I can confirm that I agree 
with the investigator that what LRFS should have to do, to fairly and reasonably compensate 
Mr K, is to pay him £350 and refund him the cost of any repair undertaken on the alarm 
system, on evidence being provided. I say this because:
In August 2020 LRFS offered Mr K the chance to reject the car, but he decided to 
keep it and to continue using it.
Im not persuaded Mr K was prevented from rejecting the car in August 2020, or that 
rejection would have caused him the level of inconvenience he says it would have 
done.
After deciding to keep the car and to continue using it Mr K didnt complain to LRFS 
again for over two years and after he had added approximately 30,000 further miles 
to cars odometer.
In February 2023 Mr K confirmed that the only outstanding issues with the car was 
with the alarm system and Bluetooth.
The car passed MOT tests in July 2021 and August 2022 with no advisories.
Mr K was able to travel in the region of 65,000 miles between June 2018 and 
April 2023 compared to the permitted maximum mileage (under the agreement) of 
40,000 (over 48 months) or 48,333 (over 58 months).
Im not persuaded that any fault with the Bluetooth made the car, in itself, of 
unsatisfactory quality.
Mr K didnt complain to LRFS about the problem with the Bluetooth until some three 
years after it appears it might have been subject to a repair and after he had added 
approximately 35,000 miles to the cars odometer. 
My final decision
My final decision is that Black Horse Limited trading as Land Rover Financial Services must 
pay Mr K £350 and refund to him, on evidence being provided, any cost incurred by him in 
having the alarm system repaired, but it need do nothing further.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2023.
