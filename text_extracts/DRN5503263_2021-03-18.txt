K822xComplaint
Mr W is represented by a court appointed deputy,  a solicitor who Ill refer to as Mr M. Mr M 
complains about  the actions  of Barclays Bank  UK PLC (Barclays) when he applied  for 
statements on behalf of Mr W. 
Background
Mr M was appointed interim deputy  for property and affairs by the Court of Protection on 14 
June 2017 because of serious  concerns about financial abuse in respect  of Mr W. The order  
allowed the deputy to make  financial  decisions for Mr W as he lacked capacity. The Interim  
Order was registered with Barclays in branch the following day. Barclays  wrote  to Mr M on 1 
July 2017 acknowledging receipt  of it and saying a copy of the order  had been sent to the 
Barclays Direct Business  Team with which Mr W held other products.
Mr M made a number of calls to Barclays. On 12 July 2017 he contacted  the business team 
and was told to contact the mandate team  when it opened. No action was taken for a year 
until 6 July 2018 when Mr M called the mandate team and was told to sign a mandate  form 
and letter of explanation to replace Mr W as signatory, which he sent on 16 July 2018.  At this 
stage Mr M said that once the changes to the account had been made, hed be grateful for 
copy statements for the account  (a business account for an organisation Ill call S for which 
Mr W was a joint signatory) from its inception. Mr M chased Barclays on 20 August and 
called Barclays on 6 September 2018 saying hed not received the statements or heard from 
Barclays. At this stage Mr M was told Barclays  couldnt provide the statements as the 
account was dormant and Mr M wasnt registered  on the account.
A formal complaint  letter was sent to Barclays on 16 September 2018. This letter wasnt 
issued by Mr M and asked Barclays to contact  a solicitor at the same firm who had day to 
day conduct of the matter.  The letter also explained  what the Deputy Order means, Mr Ws 
vulnerability and the fact that as a court appointed  deputy Mr M was under  a duty to 
investigate potential fraud. 
Barclays sent a final response in early October 2018. Barclays noted Mr M had asked it to 
contact a particular  fee earner but said this wasnt possible because she wasnt listed on 
Mr Ws business account. No reference  was made to any of Mr Ms complaint points. Mr M 
responded to Barclays final response  on 11 October and chased Barclays on 19 November 
2018. As he didnt  receive any form of response  Mr M brought  a complaint to this service in 
February 2019.
Mr M would like Barclays to meet his firms legal costs in obtaining  statements from Barclays 
and bringing Mr Ms complaint to this service.  He has explained  that in the interests of saving 
costs some work has been  completed by other  fee earners  at his firm with lower  hourly  rates 
 as he is a partner.
Our investigation so far
During the investigation the requested statements were sent in August 2020. The 
investigator set out his thoughts soon  after and asked  Barclays  to pay Mr W £400 
compensation. He said it was unclear  why Barclays had been unable  to add Mr M to Mr Ws 
account for such a long time when it had acknowledged the court order appointing him as 
deputy. He also noted that Barclays hadnt explained why it had been unable  to provide the 
statements requested  for so long. Even  during his investigation Barclays  had told Mr M to 
Ref: DRN55032632attend a branch with various forms of identification so that the statements could be provided, 
but when he did so no statements were given. 
I reviewed the complaint  and informally asked Barclays  to reconsider its position. I noted that 
Barclays hadnt provided an explanation for the significant delay in providing statements and 
as a result  Mr M had incurred unnecessary legal costs which would be claimed back from 
Mr W. But I didnt  think Mr Ms full legal costs should  be met by Barclays. This was because 
the order appointing Mr M allows for fixed costs for the management of Mr Ws affairs.  These 
costs are not Barclays responsibility. I felt that some  of the costs on the breakdown provided 
by Mr M would have been incurred in any event and the breakdown included other costs that 
werent related  to this complaint. I also referred to the fact this service is free and informal 
and only awards  costs in exceptional circumstances. Barclays reconsidered and offered to 
pay Mr W £750.
Mr M didnt  accept my informal review and made the following points:
-Reference to fixed  costs and assessed costs  arent relevant to this case. The key 
point is that the costs  of the deputyship,  as determined and ordered  by the court,  are 
paid by Mr W out of his funds. In this case Mr W has incurred these costs directly as 
a result of failures by Barclays.  As a result,  Mr M says costs should be based on his 
firms time in resolving the issue with Barclays and £750 doesnt  cover this.
-Mr M provided  a revised schedule from which he removed costs that he felt would 
have been incurred anyway and unrelated costs. The revised schedule showed  costs 
of £3,290.70 up to 17 September 2020.
-In relation to my point that our service is free Mr M said I havent  addressed  the fact 
that as deputy  he had to be the one to request the statements. And even if a friend or 
family member were  to bring the complaint  to this service, Mr W would still have had 
to brief them and consider  any offer that was made. His time to do so would  be 
chargeable and would ultimately  be Mr Ws responsibility.
-Barclays should be accepting Mr W as he is  a vulnerable client who the Court of 
Protection has determined needs  a Professional  Panel Deputy to act on his behalf to 
protect his best interests. 
After reviewing Mr Ms additional points, I issued  my provisional decision on 5 February 2021 
and said,
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its important to remember that this case involves a vulnerable person and the reason Mr M 
requested statements related  to this vulnerability  and the potential  that Mr W was the victim 
of fraud. 
Mr M first requested  Mr Ws statements from Barclays in July 2018  and received them  
following this services  involvement in August 2020.  Barclays has never  provided  an 
explanation for this lengthy delay, for its failure to respond to legal correspondence or its 
failure to clearly set out what it required for statements to be sent. The result  is that the 
legally appointed deputy has incurred unnecessary  costs in trying to obtain the statements. 
These costs are claimed  back from Mr W, who is being protected because hes vulnerable. 
The table below  sets out the costs Mr M believes Barclays  should meet  as a result of its poor 
service. In my mediation I noted that Mr Ms original schedule of costs included  costs Mr W 
Ref: DRN55032633would have incurred  even if Barclays had acted appropriately and costs unrelated to the 
request for statements. Mr M revised  his schedule  by showing no cost to the client for costs  
he felt were unrelated  or would have been incurred in any event, but Ive removed them  
completely. Ive also anonymised all references to individuals and businesses in the 
Activity section.  
In respect of the costs incurred prior to the complaint being referred to this service  Ive 
separated out the costs I believe would have been  incurred in any event in registering the 
order and initially requesting and chasing  the statements and costs  I dont believe relate  to 
Barclays actions. The costs I dont  consider  Barclays should be responsible  for are shown in 
italics in the table  above.

Mr M has provided attendance notes  for the meetings and calls that can be provided, 
although Barclays should have its own records of what  was discussed. 
It may be that Barclays has its reasons for the delay registering Mr M as deputy and in the 
provision of statements  in this case, but to date it hasnt  shared them  with Mr M or this 
service. If Barclays doesnt accept my provisional findings, Id ask it to provide full details of 
the reasons for the delay  and an explanation as to why Mr M wasnt at least kept informed. 
In the absence of any reasonable explanation for the lengthy  delay and failure to 
communicate with Mr M I consider Barclays should meet the reasonable additional costs 
incurred in trying to get relevant statements and in bringing a complaint to this service.
I consider items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the above  table  would have been incurred in any event 
and dont relate to failings  by Barclays. I also dont consider Barclays should be responsible 
for items 6,7 and 8  which relate  to contact  with the joint signatory on the account. Im 
uncertain what item 9 relates to, as Mr M and Barclays  havent referred to a letter dated 30 
April 2018, so I have  excluded it. I have also excluded items 10 and 11 as, again,  I consider 
the deputy needed to have these conversations and initially request the statements. Im 
uncertain whether  item 14 would have been necessary in any event. Ive included  it for now 
but am open  to discussion about it. Im persuaded that the remaining pre ombudsman  
complaint costs totalling £562.60 would not have been incurred and should be met by 
Barclays. 
This service only awards legal costs in respect of complaints brought  to us in exceptional 
circumstances, as we are a free and informal service. Having considered  this case  carefully I 
believe that it is exceptional for a number of reasons.  Mr W is clearly vulnerable and 
because of this Mr M has been  appointed by the Court of Protection  as deputy. This means 
that family  members and friends arent helping Mr W with his financial affairs and are not in a 
position to bring  a complaint to this service on his behalf. Mr M, as Mr Ws court appointed 
deputy, is the only person with sufficient knowledge  of Mr Ws affairs to bring a complaint on 
his behalf. In the circumstances  I consider Barclays should also meet the costs  incurred in 
bringing Mr Ws complaint to this service,  as set out in the table above. If Barclays had 
provided a better service, it wouldnt have been necessary to bring this complaint.
Mr M has pointed  out his costs schedule  isnt up to date. There  hasnt been significant input 
from Mr M since September 2020,  but if Mr M believes further costs are due, he should 
submit a schedule showing these recent costs that Ill share with Barclays  and consider 
before issuing a final decision. 
Ref: DRN55032638Id ask both parties  to take a pragmatic  approach  when considering costs in this case. I am 
not a costs draftsman  but am seeking  to reach a fair and reasonable resolution in all the 
circumstances of the case.
Mr M responded to my provisional decision, broadly accepting  it but asking me to take in to 
account the following:
-He agreed with my reasoning in respect  of items 1 and 2 in the table of costs as 
these actions were necessary in any event to register the order and request 
statements. 
-Mr M asked me to re-consider items  3 and 4. This was because  the follow up was 
necessary because Barclays hadnt  responded to previous  requests.
-Item 5 was included  in error  and Mr M was happy for me not to consider this cost.
-Mr M asked me to re-consider items  6,7 and 8 on the basis that these calls were  
necessary because Barclays failed to act on instructions in an efficient and timely 
way. 
-Mr M also asked  me to consider including item 14 as he said it was necessary to 
complete the form because Barclays requested  it having  not correctly  identified the 
account or provided statements.
-In my provisional decision I invited Mr M to provide an update  on his costs  as the 
schedule he provided went  to 17 September 2020. Mr M set out a schedule  of his 
costs to date amounting to £1,515.30. 
Barclays confirmed it agreed  with my provisional decision (to pay Mr W £2,293.70). I 
provided Barclays with Mr Ms response to my provisional decision and asked it to consider 
the points raised  by him in respect of items 3,4,6,7,8 and 14 as well as the updated legal 
costs. Other  than raising a query Barclays has not provided any further comments. So I 
wrote to Barclays and said I planned  to add items  4 and 14 to my award  as well as the legal 
costs that had been incurred from September 2020 onwards amounting to £1,515.30. 
My findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Barclays has accepted  the award I made  in my provisional decision and Mr M agrees that 
the costs I set out in it should be met. In addition, he has asked me to consider some 
additional costs.  So, I am awarding the costs  I set out in my provisional  decision for the 
reasons I discussed  in it and which I have re-produced above. But I need  to go on and 
consider Mr Ms points to decide whether I will also award items 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 14 in the 
table I set out in my provisional decision,  together with the fees Mr W has incurred from 
September 2020. 
I cant be certain that Mr M first requested  statements  in branch in July 2017, as I havent 
seen anything to confirm this. But in any event  sometimes mistakes  happen  and its 
necessary to chase  something up. So Im not awarding item 3. But I now consider it would 
be fair and reasonable for Barclays  to pay item 4 as by this stage Barclays  should have 
responded to the request  either by providing  statements or explaining why this wasnt 
possible or there would  be a delay.
Ref: DRN55032639I still dont consider Barclays should meet the costs incurred in contacting  the joint signatory 
(items 6,7 and 8). I think this contact was partly  to gain information  about the account and 
that in any event Barclays should  only be responsible for the cost of communication with it. 
But I now believe that item 14 should be awarded  to Mr W as Im persuaded on balance it 
was necessary to complete this form because  Barclays hadnt identified  the account and 
provided statements.
In my provisional decision I awarded  legal costs from when Mr Ws complaint was brought to 
this service to September 2020. I did so because Mr W is vulnerable and as a result has a 
court appointed deputy to handle  his financial affairs.  This means Mr Ws family or friends 
arent in a position to bring a complaint  to us and the only person with the relevant 
knowledge to do so is the deputy, Mr M. I also noted that had Barclays provided  a better 
service it wouldnt have  been necessary to bring  a complaint to this service. For the same 
reasons I consider Barclays  should also meet Mr Ws legal costs  from September  2020 to 
date, amounting to £1,515.30.
My final decision
My final decision is that require Barclays Bank UK PLC should pay Mr W £3,916.80.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 April 2021.
