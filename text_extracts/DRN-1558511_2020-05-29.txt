The complaint
Mr H complains about the way The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) handled his loan 
application after he called to cancel it. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
RBS accepts that Mr Hs call to cancel the loan application should have been 
handled better and says it has taken steps to provide coaching to the advisor he 
spoke with. 
RBS also accepts that it contacted Mr H about his loan application after his decision 
not to proceed. Its clear the correspondence Mr H received was frustrating given 
hed already told RBS he didnt want to go ahead. 
I can see RBS actions did cause Mr H some upset and that receiving the 
correspondence about his application was troubling. But our service cant tell a 
business to change the way it operates, we arent the regulator. Our role is to look at 
whether a business has dealt with a complaint fairly. 
RBS has apologised for the service Mr H received and paid him £50 to reflect the 
distress caused. RBS has also taken steps to provide coaching to the advisor Mr H 
spoke to. Im satisfied that £50 fairly reflects the impact of the issues Mr H has 
raised, so Im not telling RBS to increase its offer or take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 June 2020.
