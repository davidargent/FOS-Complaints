The complaint
Mr K complains that PayrNet Limited (PayrNet) have failed to assist him in accessing his 
account after he had forgotten his PIN.  
What happened
Mr K holds a Pockit account (an electronic money agent of PayrNet), but he found he had 
trouble accessing his account. He informed PayrNet that he had lost his PIN and required it 
being sent again, but the business said they were unable to assist as he was corresponding 
from an email address they did not recognise.
Mr K told PayrNet that he had told it numerous times that he had a new email address (as he 
was unable to use his old one) and had submitted supporting information it had requested in 
order to identify him and send him his PIN. He asked PayrNet to either send his PIN to his 
new email address, or to his residential address. However, PayrNet declined to do so as it 
said it would constitute a breach of data protection regulations. 
Our investigator upheld the complaint and said that PayrNet should process Mr Ks request 
and pay £300 compensation. PayrNet disagreed and offered £100 instead, which Mr K 
accepted. However, he recently got back in touch with our service to explain that the 
complaint had not been settled as agreed. Our investigator attempted to reach out to 
PayrNet to gain an update on the progress of the agreed settlement and granting Mr K 
access to his account, but it failed to respond. As a result, the matter has been escalated to 
me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for the reasons set 
out below:
When Mr K contacted PayrNet to request his PIN from a new email address, it asked 
Mr K to submit documents to prove his identity, including a photo of him holding a 
form of ID, a recent utility bill and the 9 digits on the back of his card. Mr K has 
provided an email to show that he provided this information to PayrNet, and Ive seen 
nothing from the business in response that would suggest any of these documents 
were non-compliant, and PayrNet has not provided a reason as to why they would 
not have been acceptable. 
Mr K submitted the requested information in May 2021, but it took PayrNet around 
four months to respond to this and re-request information from him. It is not clear why 
it was requested again, or what was wrong with the evidence Mr K provided in May 
2021. But this delay further extended the period he has been unable to access his 
account and worsened his financial hardship. 
Our investigator recommended an amount of £300 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience caused by PayrNets handling of the matter. Following the 
investigators view, PayrNet offered £100, which Mr K accepted. However, Mr K has 
said that it hasnt settled the complaint as agreed, and neither has PayrNet 
responded to our recent enquiries on this matter. So, given that matters still do not 
appear to have been resolved and Mr K still does not have access to his account, I 
consider the original recommendation of £300 made by the investigator to be fair 
compensation in the circumstances in light of the upset and financial hardship 
caused to Mr K as a result. PayrNet will need to ensure this amount is paid to Mr K 
within 28 days, after which point interest will accrue on the sum at 8% (simple 
interest) per year until it is paid.
In terms of Mr Ks account access, PayrNet said that he provided everything they 
needed in September 2021, which it said was being processed by its relevant 
department at that time. However, Mr K says he still hasnt been sent his PIN and 
given access to his account. Given that Mr K has seemingly provided everything 
PayrNet has asked for, it should now process his request without delay and use its 
best endeavors to allow him access to his account. I understand it was hesitant to 
send his PIN to a new email address, but there is no reason why it wouldnt be able 
to send it through other channels (such as by post to his registered address, for 
example) following the submission of his identity documents. So, it will now need to 
assist Mr K in allowing him access to his account as soon as possible.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct PayrNet Limited to:
Use its best endeavors to process Mr Ks identity documents as soon as possible (if it 
has not yet done so) and take all reasonable steps to allow him access to the funds 
in his account.
Pay £300 compensation (if it has not done so already) to a nominated account of 
Mr Ks choosing within 28 days of receiving Mr Ks acceptance of this final decision. If 
it has not been paid within 28 days, PayrNet will also need to add 8% simple interest 
per year on the sum from the date of this decision until the date it is paid. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2022.
