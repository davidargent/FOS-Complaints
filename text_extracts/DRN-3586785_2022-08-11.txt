The complaint
Mr C complains PrePay Technologies Limited trading as PrePay Solutions (PrePay) 
declined his application for an account. Hes also unhappy with the problems he experienced 
trying to contact them.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well-known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts arent in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered everything, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for 
these reasons:
Its for businesses, like PrePay, to decide who theyre willing to offer accounts to, and 
the information they require to do this. This is a commercial decision for them to 
make, and something our Service doesnt have the power to change. So, for me to 
say PrePay treated Mr C unfairly, Id have to be persuaded they treated him 
differently to other customers with similar circumstances. 
Ive seen the application Mr C initially made in mid-2021 wasnt successful because 
he wasnt 18 years old at the time. Having reviewed the terms and conditions of the 
account applied for, Im satisfied PrePay doesnt offer accounts to people under 
18 years old. So, I cant say they were unreasonable for declining that application.
Mr C attempted another application in late 2021, after hed turned 18 years old. 
However, this was flagged as a duplicate on PrePays system. This triggered them to 
require proof of Mr Cs identification. When Mr C provided the information required, 
PrePay considered it alongside the rest of his application. PrePay were unable to 
offer Mr C an account, however this wasnt made clear to Mr C at the time. So, I can 
understand why he had multiple questions for them  and eventually raised a 
complaint after his calls were unanswered/disconnected, and PrePays webchat 
didnt provide the information he needed.
Its for PrePay to determine their own appetite for risk, and when theyre willing to 
open an account. And having considered Mr Cs application, alongside what B has 
told us about their application criteria, I cant agree they acted unreasonably when 
they declined Mr Cs application.
I agree Mr C had some difficulties getting in touch with PrePay. And it was 
disappointing to see the unhelpful response he received from PrePays webchat 
service. However, this took place over a relatively short period of time before Mr C 
raised his complaint. And when he did so, this was acknowledged, and a final 
response was issued. This contained the level of detail Id expect and was issued 
within the relevant timeframes. So, while Mr C didnt get a response as quickly as 
hed like, I dont consider any compensation is warranted for the level of customer 
service he received.
Ive noted what Mr C has said about not being told the specific reasons for his 
application being declined. However, this isnt information Id expect a business to 
ordinarily share with customers. Thats because multiple factors can play a part in the 
outcome of an application. Secondly, its also not always appropriate for a business 
to share this information as it could put the interest of their customers - and 
themselves at risk.
I know this isnt the outcome Mr C hoped for. But for the reasons above, Im not asking 
PrePay to do anything to put things right.
My final decision
My final decision is I do not uphold Mr Cs complaint about PrePay Technologies Limited 
trading as PrePay Solutions.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 September 2022.
