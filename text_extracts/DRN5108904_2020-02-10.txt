K821x#15complaint
Mr and Mrs T say that, because of incorrect advice  given by a representative of First 
Complete Ltd, they incurred an early repayment  charge (ERC)  when they remortgaged their 
home.
background
In November 2015 Mr and Mrs T consulted First Complete for mortgage advice. They  had an 
existing mortgage  with a high street lender with an outstanding  balance  of about  £107,000 
which was on a repayment basis at a rate of 3.69%.  At the time they consulted  First 
Complete the mortgage had about 19 years left to run. Mr and Mrs T wanted  to borrow  an 
additional £25,000, largely  for home improvements
As part of the advisory process, Mr and Mrs T provided First Complete with their last annual  
mortgage statement  for 2014 which showed  that the mortgage had an ERC which  applied  
until 3 February 2018.
First Complete advised Mr and Mrs T to take out a new mortgage with another high street  
lender, borrowing £132,000 on a repayment  basis over a 20 year term, with the first five 
years fixed  at an interest rate of 2.54%.
When the new mortgage completed  on 16 December 2015 the existing mortgage was repaid 
and the balance sent to Mr and Mrs T. But it was about £5,000 less than they were 
expecting. This is because of the ERC of £5,315.77, which it transpired had not been  
factored into the calculations when advising on the mortgage.
Mr and Mrs T complained to First Complete. They say that, if theyd been made aware of the 
ERC, they would never have remortgaged. First Complete accepted  that it had failed to take 
account of the ERC. It offered £150 compensation. Dissatisfied with this, Mr and Mrs T 
complained to us.
An investigator looked at the complaint and thought  it should be upheld. She was satisfied 
that Mr and Mrs T would  not have  remortgaged  if theyd been advised of the cost of the 
ERC. To put things right, the investigator  thought First Complete should refund the ERC, but 
should offset against that the interest  savings made by Mr and Mrs T by remortgaging onto a 
lower rate of interest. 
Mr and Mrs T agreed with this. But First Complete didnt. It said that Mr and Mrs T had 
decided to proceed, even though  they knew theyd incur the ERC. Although it increased its 
offer of compensation to £500, it immediately retracted this and said it thought £150 was 
adequate. So it now falls to me to issue a decision on this complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Im satisfied the 
complaint should  be upheld.
Ref: DRN51089042Mr and Mrs T are not financial experts,  and so when they consulted First Complete they 
were entitled  to rely on the advice they were given as being correct, accurate and in their 
best interests. Mr and Mrs T provided  First Complete with all the information about their 
existing mortgage  to enable First Complete to advise them  of their best course of action.
Im satisfied that First Complete failed to provide Mr and Mrs T with suitable advice. Thats 
because the adviser  failed  to take into account  the ERC Mr and Mrs T would have to pay on 
redemption of their existing mortgage.
Mr and Mrs T are quite  clear that they would never have remortgaged if they had been made 
aware of the ERC. Im also satisfied  that, if First Complete had taken  account  of the ERC, it 
would not have advised them to remortgage but would  instead have advised them to apply 
for a further advance  from their existing lender, as this would have been cheaper than 
paying the ERC, even though they were on a higher  interest  rate.
First Complete has relied on a note it made  on 18 December 2015   two days after the 
mortgage completed. This shows that Mrs T spoke to First complete  saying  that the 
completion statement  showed a £5,000 ERC.  The note says [Mrs T] thought  ERCs  had 
expired fixed rate does end for another 12 months. [Mrs T] thought it was a 2-year fixed  but 
was a 3-year fixed. Explained that they do not have  to complete and can pull out. Maybe 
consider a further advance instead but they wanted  to proceed with their planned home  imp. 
so accepted ERC and agreed  to pay it. 
First Complete says it didnt know  at the time of that call that the mortgage  had already 
completed. The next (and final) note is purportedly dated 31 December and says 
Completed Dec 2015.
Mr and Mrs Ts recollection of the call of 18 December 2015 is somewhat  different. They  
have explained  that as soon as they realised  the amount  paid to them  after completion was 
less than anticipated, they immediately  contacted  First Complete. They say they were not 
given any further  advice on how to deal with the situation other  than being  told that it was too 
late to do anything now as the mortgage  had completed.
Where there is a discrepancy  in the evidence, I have to decide  what  I think is likely to have 
happened, based on the available evidence. 
Having looked  at everything Mr and Mrs T and First Complete have said, I prefer the 
evidence of Mr and Mrs T about the call on 18 December 2015. I think  it was during that call 
that the adviser probably realised shed  made  a mistake  by failing to take account of the 
ERC. On balance, I think the note was written to reflect this..
In conclusion, I agree with the redress proposed by the investigator. I have expanded  on this 
to clarify the way in which it must be calculated.
The ERC was due to expire on 3 February  2018. My (rough)  calculations  show  that, if theyd 
stayed on their existing mortgage, Mr and Mrs T would have paid approximately  £8,400 in 
interest between 16 December 2015 and February  2018 on their mortgage  balance of about 
£107,000. 
If Mr and Mrs T had borrowed the £25,000  as a further advance on their existing mortgage, 
on the same  rate of interest of 3.69%, theyd have paid interest of about  £1,850  over the 
Ref: DRN51089043period 16December 2015 to 3 February 2018  (when the ERC expired). So in total, their 
interest payments  would have been about £10,250.
By remortgaging onto a lower rate of 2.54%, theyve  paid approximately £5,800  in interest  on 
the £107,000 over the same period, and about  £1,270.00 interest  on the £25,000,  a total of 
approximately £7,070.
So, overall, by remortgaging, Mr and Mrs T have paid about £3,180 less in interest  than if 
theyd stayed on their existing mortgage and borrowed the £25,000 as a further advance.  
But theyve had to pay the ERC of £5,315.77, which means they are out of pocket by about  
£2,200, as a direct result of First Completes failure  to factor  in the cost of the ERC into the 
cost of remortgaging. 
As I said above, these  are not exact  calculations, but Im satisfied  that Mr and Mrs T are 
substantially out of pocket as a direct result of relying on the advice given by First Complete. 
This means  that First Complete will need  to compensate Mr and Mrs T for their losses  by 
carryout out an exact calculation of loss and paying that amount to Mr and Mrs T. 
First Complete must also pay compensation for trouble and upset. I see that First Complete 
initially offered compensation of £150, then increased that to £500  but later retracted that 
and reinstated  the £150. I think its offer of £500 is an appropriate amount here for trouble 
and upset. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement I require First 
Complete Ltd to do the following:
calculate the exact amount of interest paid on the previous mortgage balance  
outstanding at 16 December 2015 plus £25,000  (as if taken as a further advance from 
the previous lender)  at the rate of 3.69%  from the date of completion of the remortgage 
to 3 February 2018 (the date of expiry of the ERC); (Figure A);
calculate the exact amount of interest paid on the new mortgage of £132,000 at the rate 
of 2.54% from 16 December 2015 to 3 February  2018 (the date of expiry of the ERC on 
the previous mortgage); (Figure  B);
subtract Figure B from Figure A to give the difference in interest  paid (Figure C);
subtract Figure C from the ERC amount of £5,315.77 (Figure D);
pay Figure D to Mr and Mrs T;
pay interest at 8% per annum  simple  on Figure D from 3 February 2018 to the date of 
payment;*
refund  any fees paid by Mr and Mrs T to First Complete for its services, together  with 
interest on those fees at 8% per annum simple from the date Mr and Mrs T paid the fees 
until the date of refund;*;
pay compensation of £500 for trouble and upset.
Ref: DRN51089044Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs T to 
accept or reject my decision  before  10 March  2020.

*If First Complete considers that it's required by HM Revenue & Customs to take off income tax from this 8% 
interest, it should tell Mr and Mrs T how much it's taken off. It should also give Mr and Mrs T a certificate  showing 
the amount of income  tax deducted if they ask, so they can reclaim  the tax from HMRC,  if appropriate
