The complaint
Mr R complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr R and his wife had entered into an agreement for a trial membership of a holiday club in 
August 2006. They traded in that membership and agreed to pay £14,099 for 14,000 holiday 
club membership points in December 2006. Mr R entered into a fixed sum loan agreement 
with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of £14,099 and he agreed to make 120 monthly 
repayments of £172.14 to Barclays Partner Finance. 
Mr R and his wife also entered into a premiere membership agreement in December 2006 
for which the total fee was £238.99 but that fee wasnt included in Mr Rs loan agreement 
with Barclays Partner Finance. They bought more membership points in 2008 and their 
points were then transferred to a different holiday club membership collection. Mr R repaid 
the loan to Barclays Partner Finance in December 2014. 
Mr Rs representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in February 2018 under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that Mr R had a claim for 
misrepresentation and that the misrepresentations and practices used in the sales 
presentation made the loan agreement unfair. It also said that no proper assessment of the 
affordability of the loan for Mr R had been made. 
Barclays Partner Finance issued a detailed respond to those claims in which it set out the 
reasons that it didnt consider that they should be upheld, including that the claims were 
made out of time. Mr R wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this 
service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Rs complaint should be upheld. She didnt think 
that Barclays Partner Finances decision to turn down Mr Rs claims was unfair or 
unreasonable. She thought that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing 
of Mr Rs misrepresentation claim to turn it down. She said that she hadnt seen enough to 
suggest that the relationship between Mr R and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and 
she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was 
unfair. She also said that lending money under a regulated credit agreement of the kind in 
question wasnt an activity covered by this services jurisdiction at the time of sale.
Mr Rs representative says that it doesnt accept our investigators recommendations and it 
had instructed counsel to prepare detailed submissions in response. This service has 
received a generic submission from counsel about the holiday company and the unfair terms 
that it uses.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Rs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr R entered into a loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay £14,099 
towards the cost of the 14,000 membership points that he and his wife were 
purchasing in December 2006  Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr R used credit 
provided by Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the other holiday products that he 
and his wife have purchased so in this decision Im only considering Barclays Partner 
Finances liability relating to the December 2006 purchase agreement;
Mr Rs complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that hed 
made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to 
his claims;
Mr Rs claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Rs claim under section 75 is that the membership was misrepresented to him and 
his wife and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to 
them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr R could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the membership in December 2008 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made to them and any loss would have been 
incurred as that was when he also entered into the loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made 
to Barclays Partner Finance until February 2018, which was more than six years later so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance had and has a defence to that claim and 
it wasnt unreasonable for it to reject it;
Mr Rs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr R and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that Mr Rs loan was repaid 
in December 2014, less than six years before his claim about an unfair relationship 
was made to it, so I dont consider that a court would conclude that Mr Rs claim 
under section 140A was made too late;
Mr Rs representative described in its February 2018 letter to Barclays Partner 
Finance the way that the holiday products had been sold to Mr R and his wife and the 
misrepresentations that it says were made to them, including that they were told that 
they could use their points to pay for their maintenance fees and that people would 
buy their points from them as they were very sought after;
that letter also said that the sales process involved misleading 
omissions/misrepresentations as Mr R and his wife werent told that there was no 
viable secondary market for their membership, that their maintenance fees would 
increase or that there was no market for rental;
Ive not been provided with all of the documents that Mr R and his wife would have 
signed in December 2006 but Ive carefully considered the documents that have 
been provided, including the evidence thats been provided by Mr R and his 
representative  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
Mr R and his wife were told that they could use their points to pay for their 
maintenance fees or that people would buy their points  Ive also seen no evidence 
to show that Mr R and his wife tried to use their points to pay for their maintenance 
fees or to sell their membership points;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr R and his wife 
were told that there was a secondary market for their membership, that their 
maintenance fees wouldnt increase or that there was a market for rental;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented the holiday club membership to Mr R and his wife before they 
entered into the purchase agreement in December 2006 or that they were induced 
into entering into that agreement by any such misrepresentations;
Mr Rs representatives February 2018 letter to Barclays Partner Finance says that 
Mr R and his wife felt pressurised because of fatigue, that it was an aggressive sales 
practice and that they could not leave the premises until the paperwork had been 
signed;
the purchase agreement that Mr R and his wife signed in December 2006 said that 
they had the right to cancel the agreement within fourteen days so if they had been 
unreasonably pressurised into signing the agreement I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have cancelled the agreement during that period  but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that they contacted either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance during any applicable withdrawal period to cancel the 
purchase agreement or the loan agreement;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr R and his wife were 
unduly pressurised into buying the membership in December 2006, that Mr R was 
unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them  Ive seen no evidence to show that 
Mr R complained to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until February 2018 
(more than eleven years after the loan had been made to him and more than three 
years after hed repaid the loan) and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
him to have complained to Barclays Partner Finance about any such issues before 
then;
Mr Rs representative says that Barclays Partner Finance didnt make a proper 
assessment of the affordability of the loan for Mr R but lending money under a 
regulated credit agreement such as the loan agreement wasnt an activity that was in 
the jurisdiction of this service in December 2006 so I have no jurisdiction to consider 
a complaint about the affordability of the loan for Mr R - but I can consider whether or 
not the affordability of the loan caused his relationship with Barclays Partner Finance 
to be unfair as part of my consideration of its response to his section 140A claim;
Barclays Partner Finance hasnt provided any evidence about its assessment of the 
affordability for Mr R of the loan that was made to him in December 2006 but Mr R 
made the loan repayments of £172.14 each month from February 2007 to November 
2014 and he then made a debit card payment of £4,152.99 to repay the loan in 
December 2014 and Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable 
for him when it was made to him;
the loan was made to Mr R in December 2006 but Ive seen no evidence to show that 
he asked Barclays Partner Finance for any information about the affordability 
assessment that it conducted before his representatives February 2018 letter to 
Barclays Partner Finance - I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to 
have raised any concerns about its affordability assessment before then and I dont 
consider it to be likely that a court would now conclude that any issues with its 
assessment of the affordability of the loan caused Mr Rs relationship with Barclays 
Partner Finance to be unfair;
Mr Rs representative hasnt provided a submission from counsel in response to our 
investigators recommendations but it has provided a generic submission from 
counsel about the holiday company and the unfairness of the contractual 
arrangements that it uses - but it would be for a court to determine whether or not 
any of the terms in the purchase agreement and other contractual documents were 
unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr R and his wife and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr R and Barclays 
Partner Finance;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Rs relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr R and Barclays 
Partner Finance in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr R for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership and the other difficulties that theyve described but I consider that 
Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims that were made to it was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays Partner Finance 
to refund to Mr R any of the money that hes paid under the loan agreement, to pay 
him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 June 2023.
