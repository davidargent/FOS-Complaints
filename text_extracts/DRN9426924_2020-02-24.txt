Mr W complained  that Uncle Buck didnt carry out all the checks  it shouldve done before 
agreeing to lend to him  and loans were increased or extended without taking into account  
his financial circumstances. 
When Uncle Buck looked at Mr Ws complaint, it first of all said that it had carried out full 
affordability checks on all the loans and it didnt uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Mr W was unhappy with this response  and he brought his complaint to us.
Our adjudicator felt that he hadnt  seen enough  to say it was unfair for Uncle Buck  to provide 
loans 1 and 2 to Mr W - but loans 3 to 8 shouldnt have been lent.
Following further correspondence, Uncle Buck said that whilst it didn't accept our 
adjudicators view 100%, it did agree that Mr Ws financial situation  deteriorated over time 
and that it would be fair to offer a refund of loans 5 - 8.
Uncle Buck  sent us details showing how it had worked out what it owed Mr W and we 
forwarded this information to him. 
Mr W doesnt feel Uncle Bucks offer goes far enough to resolve  his complaint  he thinks  
Uncle Buck  should  settle his complaint in line with what our adjudicator  has recommended.
So the complaint comes  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Ref: DRN94269242Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck  should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Uncle Buck  was required to establish whether Mr W could sustainably  repay  his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the  relevant regulations define sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting  other reasonable  commitments, as well as without having to borrow  to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
I agree  with our adjudicator that there  isnt enough to say Uncle  Buck shouldnt have 
provided loans  1 and 2 to Mr W. And as Mr W is happy to accept what  our adjudicator has 
said about not upholding loans 1 and 2, then I dont  think I need say more about these loans.
And as Uncle  Buck  has agreed to refund  all interest and charges in relation to loans 5  8 
and to amend  Mr Ws credit file in line with what our adjudicator recommended, then 
I havent considered  these loans further  save to include them in the redress and when 
thinking about Mr Ws overall borrowing pattern. 
Ref: DRN94269243This just leaves in dispute loans 3 and 4.
I think that by loan 3, Uncle Buck shouldve realised  that the information it had gathered  was 
at odds with what  Mr W was saying  about his financial situation.  I say this because  Uncle  
Buck could see that:
Mr W was in a debt management plan for an amount of £1,686
he had active short term loans amounting to £600 with other lenders, and
two defaults  - the most recent having  occurred  just three  months earlier
by now, Mr Ws total monthly repayment on active fixed  term accounts  was around 
£867  a very significant financial commitment for Mr W given the figures Uncle  Buck 
had recorded  for his take home pay and expenses.
I think that this information paints a picture of someone struggling  with debt and shows  that 
Mr W was having serious  problems managing his money and that loan 3  and any further 
lending, wasnt likely  to be sustainably affordable for Mr W. 
So I think it was wrong for Uncle Buck to give loan 3, and all the loans that followed after, to 
Mr W.  
For these reasons, Im upholding  the complaint about loans 3 and 4 (as well as loans 5  8 
in respect of which Uncle Buck has already agreed to provide redress).  
putting things right  what Uncle Buck  needs  to do 
A.Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr W towards interest,  fees and 
charges on loans 3 - 8, not including  anything it has already refunded.
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr W which  were  
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr W originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C.Pay Mr W the amounts calculated in "A" and "B".
D.Remove any adverse  information for loans  3 - 6 from Mr Ws credit  file. The overall  
pattern of Mr Ws borrowing  from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about loans 7 and 8 is adverse  so Uncle Buck should remove  these loans entirely 
from Mr Ws credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN94269244my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ws complaint about loans 3 - 8. Uncle  Buck 
Finance LLP should take the steps  Ive set out above to put things right.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 March  2020.
