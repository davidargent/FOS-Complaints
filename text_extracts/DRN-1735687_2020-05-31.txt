Mrs M said that at the time of the loans she was struggling financially. She said she had to 
take out new loans to repay existing debt. She also said that when she called Sunny was 
told not to include all her payments to other loan companies and to halve her rent even 
though she was a single parent.
Sunny said that before all loans are provided it carried out eligibility, affordability and 
creditworthiness checks. It said that based on its checks it was reasonable to provide the 
loans to Mrs M.
Our adjudicator noted the gap in lending between loans 11 and 12 and thought it sufficient to 
say a new lending chain had started with loan 12. He thought that loans 4 to 11 should be 
upheld.
Sunny didnt accept our adjudicators view. It provided a counter offer, upholding loans 9 to 
11. Mrs M didnt accept this offer.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We've set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mrs M 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumer's income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs M could sustainably repay her loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ms complaint.
Our adjudicator thought that the gap between loan 11 being repaid and loan 12 being taken 
out was sufficient to say that a new lending chain had started with loan 12. I agree with this. 
Therefore I have considered the first 11 loans as part of the first lending chain and loan 12 
as a second lending chain.
Before the loans were provided, Sunny gathered information about Mrs Ms income and 
expenses. Mrs M has said that she was asked not to include all her payments to other loan 
companies and to halve her rent. This would not be acceptable but as I have no further evidence of this and Mrs M has agreed for her complaint to be in regard to her claim of 
irresponsible lending I havent looked into this issue any further.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold loans 1 to 3 or loan 12. As neither party has disputed this, I 
havent considered these loans any further, other than to include then m in my overall 
assessment of Mrs Ms borrowing from Sunny.
Loan 4 was for £150 and was taken out while loans 2 and 3 were still outstanding. Mrs Ms 
monthly income at the time was recorded as £1,700 and her disposable income was noted 
as just under £700. I understand that up to four loans can be taken out with Sunny 
concurrently. However, by this time I think it would have been reasonable to carry out further 
checks to ensure that Mrs M could sustainably afford to repay the loan including gathering 
information about any other short term loans she had outstanding at the time. I have looked 
through Mrs Ms bank statements from the time and can see that she had other short term 
loans outstanding. I think this should have raised concerns that Mrs M wasnt managing her 
money and that she was unlikely to be able to sustainably make her repayments. Therefore I 
do not think that this loan should have been provided. 
Loan 5 was taken out two months after loan 4 was repaid but I do not find that this gap in 
borrowing is enough to suggest that her situation had changed. The loan was for a much 
larger amount and although she repaid this shortly after taking it out she then took out 
another loan a month later. Based on the information provided, I dont think that Mrs M s 
situation had changed since loan 4 and I dont think these subsequent loans should have 
been considered sustainably affordable for Mrs M.
Mrs M took out loan 7 before repaying loan 6. I think at this point, Mrs Ms pattern of 
borrowing suggested that she was persistently reliant on short term loans. She had taken out 
seven loans in 12 months and was taking out new loans before repaying previous loans. 
Where she had repaid previous loans she was then borrowing again shortly after. Therefore 
I think by loan 7, Sunny should have realised that lending to Mrs M was sustainable. 
Sunny continued to lend to Mrs M and while the amounts varied they werent suggesting that 
Mrs Ms reliance on the loans was reducing in any sustainable way. There was a break 
between when loan 9 was repaid and loan 10 taken out but as this was for less than three 
months I do not find it would be reasonable to conclude this was any indication that Mrs Ms 
finances had moved on from whatever situation had required her previous loans. 
Based on the above, I find that Sunny shouldnt have provided Mrs M with loans 4 to 11. 
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mrs M paid on loans 4 to 11;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
of payment to the date of settlement*;
 
remove any negative information about loans 4 to 6 from Mrs Ms credit file;
 
the overall pattern of Mrs M's borrowing from loan 7 to 11 means any information 
recorded about these loans is adverse, so these loans should be removed entirely 
from Mrs Ms credit file. 
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mrs Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mrs M compensation as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 June 2020.
