The complaint
Ms K complains that National Westminster Bank Plc sent her correspondence that explained 
it wouldnt tolerate her recent behaviour in branch and that it would end its relationship with 
her if there was a further incident.
What happened
On 27 October 2020 Ms K attended her local NatWest branch in order to make a payment. 
NatWest said that, as the branch was busy, Ms K had to wait before she was served. But Ms 
K felt staff could have assisted her more quickly.
Subsequent to Ms Ks branch visit, NatWest wrote to her to explain that it considered her 
behaviour in branch on 27 October 2020 to be unacceptable. It said she had been impolite to 
staff and her manner had been intimidating to a recently bereaved customer. The letter went 
on to say that NatWest would consider closing her accounts if her behaviour persisted.
Ms K was distressed by the letter she received from NatWest. She felt it was upsetting, 
threatening and intimating. And she thought the content wasnt specific enought. So, she 
wasnt sure what incident NatWest was referring to or why her behaviour was being 
regarded as unacceptable. She therefore referred her complaint to our service.
Our investigator assessed the evidence Ms K and NatWest had provided. But they didnt 
recommend upholding Ms Ks complaint. They werent persuaded that NatWest had done 
anything wrong or treated Ms K unfairly. So, they didnt think it needed to do anything 
further. But Ms K requested an ombudsman decision. The matters therefore been passed to 
me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware that Ive summarised the events of the complaint. I dont intend any discourtesy by 
this - it just reflects the informal nature of our service. I want to assure Ms K and NatWest 
that Ive read everything theyve sent us. I hope theyll understand if I dont address every 
comment theyve made in this decision. I intend to concentrate on what I consider to be key 
to this complaint.
Im sorry to hear about how Ms K feels about the letter she received from NatWest following 
her branch attendant in October. I appreciate that receiving a letter of that nature is bound to 
have caused upset and been unpleasant. And I understand she feels strongly about the 
issues raised in this complaint. 
My role is to assess whether I think NatWest made a mistake, or treated Ms K unfairly, such 
that it needs to now put things right. And, having thought carefully about everything she and 
NatWest have said, Im afraid to say that I dont think it did. Ill explain why.
I can see that Ms K has raised concerns about the lack of detail contained in NatWests 
letter about the incident that took place in October. I realise that this letter might now have 
gone into the level of detail Ms K wanted, or expected. But impartially, I think NatWest 
provided all the information its able to give Ms K. It isnt able to elaborate any further and I 
dont think itd be fair for me to ask it to do anymore here.
Ms K has given our investigator an account of what happened during her branch visit at the 
end of October. She accepts she may have used inappropriate language and shes spoken 
of her frustration at having to wait for staff to assist her. She hasnt disputed NatWests 
version of events other than taking issue with the length of time it said she was waiting to be 
served. So, Im persuaded that NatWests account here is credible and reliable.
NatWest has told our service that there are no set rules written down as to what behaviour is 
classed as unacceptable. Instead, its up to branch staff to decide whether they feel a 
customers behaviour is so unacceptable that it will no longer be tolerated. 
Its not unreasonable for NatWest not to define unacceptable behaviour. I say this because it 
can cover a range of actions and behaviours. And what is considered unacceptable and 
intimidating is very subjective. So, it can be interpreted differently by people.
Its clear that Ms K feels shes been treated unfairly by NatWest. But I dont think it acted 
unfairly in considering her behaviour in branch to be inappropriate. And I dont think it was 
unreasonable for NatWest to send her a letter warning about the potential consequences if 
she behaved in that manner again.
It appears that Ms K feels its unfair for NatWest to say it might consider ending its business 
relationship with her should there be a further incident. But, in circumstances where NatWest 
believes a customer has behaved in an unacceptable way, its entitled to take a decision to 
end its business relationship with that customer. This is clearly outlined in the terms and 
conditions that apply to Ms Ks account.
In view of the above, I cant say NatWest isnt entitled to say it might revisit its relationship 
with Ms K. Its permitted to make commercial decisions that are compatible with an accounts 
terms and conditions  in this case a decision about whether it wants to continue to offer 
banking facilities to Ms K. And its not a decision our service would interfere with. 
While Im not persuaded to uphold Ms Ks complaint, Im not seeking to downplay the 
difficulties or frustrations she had here  far from it.  Ive taken on board how she was 
impacted by what happened. And I can see that our investigator said theyd make NatWest 
aware of how she was affected. I think this is a positive step as I can see Ms K has a 
number of health concerns and is uncomfortable about going into her branch in the future. I 
think the action our investigator has said theyll take here will assist NatWest in 
accommodating any specific needs that Ms K might have in attending her branch.
I realise Ms K will be disappointed with this decision. But for the reasons set out above Im 
satisfied NatWest acted fairly and reasonably and Im not going to be asking it to do anything 
more. This now brings to an end what we, in trying to resolve Ms Ks dispute with NatWest 
informally, can do for her. Im sorry we cant help Ms K any further with this.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 January 2021.
