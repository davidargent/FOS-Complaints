The complaint
Mr K complains National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly closed his current account and 
refused to tell him why.
What happened
Mr K held an account with NatWest. In late 2022 NatWest gave him 60 days notice that the 
account would close. They also took the same action in relation to another account he holds 
jointly with another person, which is subject to another complaint with our service. This 
decision concerns only the closure of Mr Ks sole account.
An investigator at our service upheld the complaint. They found:
NatWest can review accounts and can generally close accounts in line with their 
terms and conditions. They dont need to provide their reasons to Mr K.
NatWest failed to disclose their reasons for closing Mr Ks account to our service, 
which they needed to do. As a result, they hadnt shown they closed Mr Ks account 
fairly.
NatWest should pay Mr K £100 for the distress and inconvenience he experienced 
because his account was closed.
NatWest agreed to pay £100 redress, but Mr K asked for a final decision from an 
ombudsman, so his complaint has been given to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ks complaint. Ill explain why:
Banks have the discretion to review customer relationships and the services they provide. 
Generally, they can close accounts when they have a genuine commercial reason, and they 
act within their terms and conditions. They also arent currently obliged to provide their 
reasons to customers. So, while I understand Mr Ks frustration at not knowing why NatWest 
closed his account, I dont require NatWest to tell him.
But NatWest do have to provide their reasons to our service in order for us to be able to 
decide whether they acted fairly. Without providing their reasons, its not possible to say the 
closure wasnt an error of fact, plainly irrational or potentially unlawful. 
Here, NatWest refused to provide their reasons to our service despite being asked for them 
several times. And, where a party fails to provide information, I can take account of their 
refusal when reaching my decision. This is an evidential power afforded to me under DISP 
3.5.9R (3). I have exercised this power in reaching my decision.
So, based on the limited information NatWest has provided, I cannot reasonably conclude 
NatWest closed Mr Ks account fairly  I find that they didnt.
Mr K said he was caused a lot of stress and worry when his account was closed, and he was 
further inconvenienced  by having to set up manual payments on another account. Without 
evidence to show NatWest acted fairly, Im left to conclude the upset and inconvenience 
caused to him was avoidable. So, I find he should be compensated.
Putting things right
Subject to Mr K accepting this final decision, NatWest need to pay him £100 for the distress 
and inconvenience caused by closing his account. I understand he may want more than this, 
but I havent seen evidence to show awarding him a larger sum would be reasonable.
My final decision
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ks complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc need to pay him 
redress according to my above direction.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 November 2023.
