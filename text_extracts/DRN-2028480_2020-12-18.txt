The complaint
Mr H complains about the service received from his insurer (esure Insurance Limited) for his 
motor insurance policy. He is unhappy at esure not pursuing a legal case against a water 
company for damage to Mr Hs car when it hit a loose manhole cover it maintained. He is 
also unhappy at the impact of the claim on his new premium when he changed insurer.
What happened
Mr Hs car hit a loose manhole cover in August 2018 while driving in poor weather 
conditions, resulting in damage to the vehicles underside and suspension. He took 
photographs of the manhole cover and reported the incident to esure to make a claim. The 
insurer instructed repairers to begin the repair process. Mr H then advised that he did not 
want the repairs to be carried out through a claim on his policy and he wanted to arrange for 
the repairs himself and reclaim the cost from the water company.
esure contacted the water company in September 2018, who denied responsibility for the 
incident, saying that extreme weather on the date of the incident could have caused the 
manhole cover to become loose. esure considered the response and sought advice from its 
legal team. Their advice was that the circumstances of the incident meant that esure would 
be unlikely to win any case against the water company.
Mr H subsequently complained to the water company and it paid him compensation. Mr H 
then complained to esure in August 2019 about the decision not to pursue a case against 
the water company. Mr H also complained about an increase in his insurance premium when 
he changed insurer and at esure notifying the incident on the Claims and Underwriting 
Exchange (CUE) database even though Mr H had not made a claim.
esure considered Mr Hs complaint and upheld it in part. They considered that they had 
acted reasonably in assessing the chances of winning a claim against the water company 
and taken appropriate legal advice in not pursuing a claim. But they did acknowledge that 
they had not fully followed the complaints procedure and refunded the £35 policy 
cancellation fee they had charged when Mr H cancelled his policy.

What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. My role here is the decide whether the 
insurer has acted fairly towards Mr H.
  
In considering whether to pursue a claim against the water company I think esure acted in 
accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the policy. I agree with the investigators 
conclusion that by contacting the water company and then considering the advice from its 
legal team esure acted reasonably.
  
While the water company subsequently paid compensation to Mr H, I do not think that this 
makes esures decision not to pursue the case wrong. I would expect them to consider the 
chances of success at the time, given the circumstances of the incident and their experience 
of similar incidents of potential third party liability.
 
It was also Mr Hs decision not to pursue a claim for the repairs through his own policy. This 
also limited esures ability to pursue a case against the water company.
In respect of esures notification of the incident to the CUE, and its impact on Mr Hs 
premium, I think esure has acted fairly and reasonably. The purpose of the CUE is to record 
incidents, whether or not they result in a claim, and insurers are obliged to provide accurate 
information about their customers to the CUE. The terms and conditions contained in the 
policy document state that the insurer may share data with the operators of claims related 
databases. esure has acted in accordance with industry practice in notifying the incident to 
the CUE, and I dont think they can be held responsible for the decisions that other insurers 
may have made when providing policy quotations to Mr H, which are likely to reflect a 
number of factors.
I note that esure accepted that it did not follow its complaints procedure and refunded the 
cancellation fee charged when Mr H cancelled his policy. I think this is fair in the 
circumstances.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I do not uphold Mr Hs complaint. I consider that esure 
Insurance Limited has acted fairly and reasonably towards Mr H.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 January 2021.
