K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that Ashcourt Rowan Financial Planning Limited failed to advise him to 
apply for protection against the lifetime allowance (LTA).  As a result he will have to pay a 
LTA charge if the value of his fund grows above  a certain amount. 
background
Ashcourt Rowan had a long-standing relationship  with Mr W. It advised  him over a period of 
several years. It had a number of meetings with Mr W during  2012 where his pension 
arrangements were discussed. Mr W had two personal pensions with different providers, and 
a SSAS (Small Self-Administered Scheme).  
A note from a meeting held in January 2012 recorded that Mr Ws SSAS had a value of 
£704,760. It said his normal retirement  date was in 2015. And the adviser  noted  that it 
wouldnt be caught  by the £1.5MLA.
The note also recorded, amongst other things:
Objective: to spend taxable assets  and retain IHT free assets. 
Family trust = £830k. Nil IHT but liable to CGT if gains remitted to UK.
Current income need is £120k pa net. This may reduce  as previously spent significant sums 
on {the children}. 
{Mr W} spends capital  to supplement his income.  
{Mr W} has raised £100k from ISAs to spend  in 2012 + 2013.  
The bonds  £180k will mature  2013/16.
By 2020 {Mr W} calculates  that all the cash, ISAs, insurance bonds etc will have been spent 
leaving the house/SSAS/trust fund. May downsize to release  more  capital at 70.
Guardian GAR becomes payable {at age 65}.
Mr W was sent a Pension Report  dated 28 March 2012. This said,  amongst other things:
Scope of Advice  within this Letter
At your specific request this report focuses solely on the issue  of pension planning and no 
details regarding your other circumstances  were provided.
It recorded that Mr W received an annuity of approximately £21,500 from Provider  1 and 
would receive approximately £14,500  pension income from Provider  2 from the age of 
65. 
It went on to say:
Income in Retirement
Ref: DRN61492642You indicated that you need £100/120,000 of income per annum that you wish to achieve in 
retirement. You are aware that the level of income  available to you from investments will 
depend on a number of factors  including:
Any actions you take in respect of this report
The growth on the various investments  within your plans
Your age at retirement.
Under its recommendations  it said:
Once {Mr W} reaches the age of 65 take 25% Tax Free Cash (£183,000)  from his SSAS  
and draw an income from the remaining fund of £551,000.
It was recorded  that Mr and Mrs Ws proposed joint income when Mr W reached aged  65 
was £95,500.  And this didnt include any benefits from Mr Ws SSAS. It was also recorded 
that, as well as Mr and Mrs Ws main  home,  they had approximately £3 million in a mix of 
other assets/savings  and investments.
My understanding is that the pension  with Provider  1 had been crystallised in 2010. It had 
crystallised 12.22% of Mr Ws LTA;  so effectively valued at about £183,000 in the context  of 
the lower standard LTA of £1.5 million that was being introduced  from April 2012. 
The pension with Provider 2 was a deferred  annuity.  Its value was about £162,000 for LTA 
purposes at the time of the January 2012 meeting (ultimately  it represented  11.75%  of Mr 
Ws LTA). 
So with the SSAS valued at approximately £704,000, the total value of Mr Ws pension 
provision was around £1,050,000 for comparative  purposes at the time of the January 2012 
meeting, when the adviser noted  Mr W wouldnt be caught by the £1.5MLA.
Mr W has said that he started taking benefits  from the SSAS in the 2014/15 tax year. He 
crystallised further benefits  in the tax years 2015/16  and 2017/18. In total he has crystallised 
approximately £959,000 from the SSAS to date. This represented 68.83%  of Mr Ws LTA 
(hed obtained Individual Protection 2014  at £1,393,171). 
I issued my provisional decision on this complaint on 23 April 2019 setting out the reasons I 
was minded to uphold  it. I have copied  my provisional findings  below. 
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   
The firm has said it wasnt unreasonable for the adviser not to have recommended that Mr W 
apply for fixed protection given his circumstances  at the time. The value of the SSAS in 
isolation was about £704,000 in January  2012.  And Mr W had told the adviser  his intention 
was to take his benefits in 2015,  just over 3 years  after the meetings in January 2012. So 
even given the lowering of the LTA in April 2012  to £1.5 million, Mr W had plenty of scope for 
growth before reaching the LTA limit. The firm has acknowledged that if Mr W had said his 
intention was to keep his SSAS until he reached  aged 75 it may well have  advised  him to 
seek protection. But that wasnt the case and in the actual circumstances the advisers  
Ref: DRN61492643comment in January 2012 that the SSAS  wouldnt be caught by the LTA seemed 
reasonable.
I appreciate that these  matters should be considered in the context of the circumstances as 
seen at the time, and not with the benefit of hindsight. But whilst  I accept  there were  
references to Mr W taking  benefits at age 65, as Mr W has said, peoples circumstances and 
plans can change over time  particularly as they get older. Mr W had other significant 
savings and investments  that he could use to provide income in retirement. The adviser 
recorded Mr Ws intention to spend  his taxable assets and retain IHT free assets and spend  
his capital to supplement  his income  at the time. So I dont think it was set in stone that he 
was always going  to take the SSAS  benefits in 2015. And I think it was always  likely Mr W 
would go into some form of income  drawdown  arrangement and crystallise benefits  over a 
period of time. And so there was always the possibility of a further  test against the LTA at 
age 75. 
In the event, my understanding  is that Mr W did crystallise part of the SSAS  in 2014/15. He 
crystallised £656,076 (47.08% for LTA purposes). He crystallised £271,900 in 2015/16  
(19.6%). And £31,137 in 2017/18  (2.22%). I dont think  this is inconsistent with what  was 
likely to have happened when Mr W had his meetings in early 2012. 
The position  at that time was that the value of Mr Ws pensions  (for LTA purposes) was 
around £1,050,000, with the LTA reducing  to £1.5 million in April 2012. His SSAS was 
invested in a spread of assets consistent  with his medium attitude to risk. And his 
circumstances were  such that I dont think it was unreasonable  to expect that he either might 
not take his SSAS benefits immediately at age 65, or that it would only be partially  
crystallised and Mr W would  take an income  through a drawdown arrangement. 
In my view, given Mr Ws circumstances,  the firm ought reasonably to have alerted him to 
the implications of the reduction in the LTA and how he could protect himself against  it. It 
wasnt clear exactly when  or how Mr W would ultimately access  the SSAS. 
Only moderate  growth  was required  on the investments (a level that was within  reasonable 
expectations for a medium risk investor) for Mr W to have a problem with the LTA sometime  
up to and including at age 75. Mr W wasnt contributing to his pensions  at the time. And 
there doesnt appear to have been  any downside to Mr W applying  for Fixed Protection 
2012. 
So in my view, in the context that there was a risk that Mr W might be affected by the 
reduction in the LTA,  and it was a credible  risk, I think  if the firm had alerted him to those 
risks hed more likely than not have applied  for fixed protection.
my provisional decision
Accordingly, my provisional  decision is to uphold Mr Ws complaint. 
I went on to set out the basis  on which  I intended  to order Ashcourt Rowan to compensate  
Mr W. 
Ashcourt Rowan responded to say that it thought  my decision was being made with the 
benefit of hindsight. 
Ref: DRN61492644Mr W responded to say that he had been  a basic rate taxpayer for several years and 
provided supporting  evidence  from his accountant. He said he expected to be a basic rate 
taxpayer going  forward as he managed  his money  to stay within the basic rate band.  He also 
said that the methodology used to calculate  compensation didnt seem  to take into account  
the tax he would have to pay on any growth on the sum awarded.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive seen no reason to 
depart from the conclusions I reached  in my provisional decision. 
The firm is concerned that Ive used hindsight  in my decision. However,  I did explain that the 
matter shouldnt be considered with the benefit  of hindsight in my provisional decision,  and I 
was careful to take this into account.  In my view the risk was foreseeable, and a real 
possibility in Mr Ws particular circumstances. I dont  agree its only seen with the benefit of 
hindsight.
Mr W is concerned  that the compensation proposed doesnt take tax on any growth into 
account. However an allowance is made for the taxation in the slightly lower  rate used to 
discount the compensation back to a present  value  (assumed to be held outside of a 
pension). And Mr W may be able to mitigate any tax payable with careful planning. In all the 
circumstances, I think  the methodology used provides for a fair and reasonable settlement in 
the particular circumstances  of this case. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ws complaint. 
I order Ashcourt Rowan  Financial Planning  Limited  to calculate whether Mr W will likely 
suffer a loss and if so pay compensation to Mr W in the following manner. 
A         Calculate what the value of Mr Ws pension fund could be at the date that he reaches 
age 75. The starting value should be taken as that at the date of this final decision. 
And the growth rate used  should be 5% per annum. This is the mid-rate of growth  
firms are required to use by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
when providing Illustrations  of possible future  values  for pensions.  I think  its 
reasonable to use for a medium risk investor.
B         Calculate what amount of A would be subject to a LTA charge given that Mr W has 
Individual Protection of £1,393,171 (but limited to £1.8million as per the Fixed  
Protection 2012 that he would  have had).  
C         Calculate  the net amount of B that will likely be payable  to Mr W after tax is deducted 
assuming he doesnt have Fixed  Protection  2012. The amount calculated  in B would 
likely be subject to tax charges  of 40%.  Given Mr W is taking an income  at a level 
that is subject to basic rate tax, its reasonable to assume  he would have acted 
similarly if hed had Fixed Protection. So the excess would be subject to an initial tax 
charge of 25%. And then the remaining 75%, taken as income, taxed at the basic  
rate  20%.  Overall, this results in a 40% tax charge. 
Ref: DRN61492645D         Calculate  the net amount of B likely payable to Mr W after tax is deducted assuming 
he does have  Fixed Protection 2012. As above, I think its likely he would have taken  
the funds as income. Therefore the amount calculated in B would  likely  have  been  
subject to income tax at the rate of 20%. So it should use a total assumed  tax rate of 
15% (this assumes  25% of the fund would  have been taken as tax free cash, and the 
remaining 75% taxed  at 20%). 
E         The  potential loss at age 75 to Mr W is D  C.
F         The amount calculated in E should be discounted back at the rate of 4.5%  per annum 
to the date of decision. This is the mid-rate of growth used by the FCA for 
investments held outside of a pension. Mr W can use any compensation calculated  
and paid to him as of now, and invest this outside of the pension to pay the potential 
LTA charge at age 75. 
If there is a loss, Ashcourt  Rowan  Financial Planning Limited  should  pay the amount 
calculated in F directly to Mr W. 
Ashcourt Rowan Financial  Planning  Limited should also pay Mr W £500 for the distress and 
inconvenience Im satisfied the matter  has caused him. 
Additional interest  at the rate of 8% simple per year should be added  to the compensation 
calculated from the date of this final decision to the date of settlement (but only if 
compensation is not paid within 28 days of the business being notified of acceptance of this 
final decision).
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 July 2019.
