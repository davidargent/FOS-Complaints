The complaint
Mr N complains that Provident Personal Credit Limited (trading as Satsuma Loans) was 
irresponsible to lend to him.

Mr N says he could not afford the repayments. He says hed been dependent on short-term 
loans to pay everyday expenses since 2012 and was in severe financial difficulty. Mr N says 
if Satsuma had checked his credit file it would have seen the other loans and also four credit 
cards at their limit. He adds that he was charged £990.02 interest on loan 4, even though he 
repaid it within 21 days and that Satsuma should also have realised something was wrong 
due to the number of loan agreements from which he withdrew. Mr N says he ended up 
seeking help from a debt charity.
Satsuma says it conducted a credit check and asked Mr N about his income and 
expenditure. It says it used a wide range of data sources to ensure it had the most up-to-
date information about Mr Ns circumstances. It says its checks caused it to reduce Mr Ns 
declared disposable income by between £500 and £1,200 but it still showed each loan was 
affordable.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. She found that by 
loan 7, Mr Ns pattern of borrowing suggested hed become persistently reliant on short-term 
loans. She recommended that all interest and charges on loans 7 to 10 should be refunded 
to Mr N (plus 8% simple interest) and that the loans should be removed from Mr Ns credit 
file.
Mr N responded to say, in summary, that loans 4 to 6 should be upheld, as well as loans 7 to 
10. He says loan 4 was the fourth application in one month and better checks would have 
shown he was using one loan to pay another. Mr N added that an ombudsman has already 
confirmed he was dependent on short-term loans when reviewing other cases he had with 
this service.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Satsuma needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr N 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Satsuma should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Satsuma was required to establish 
whether Mr N could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to 
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint.
Loan 1
When Mr N applied for his first loan, I can see Satsuma asked him about his income and 
expenditure and applied its own safeguards based on electronic information gathered from 
credit agencies and internal models. Mr N had declared his disposable income to be £2,580, 
but Satsuma adjusted that figure down to less than £1,600. Despite the adjustment, Im 
satisfied Satsuma would have found the repayments on loan 1 to be affordable and I cant 
conclude it needed to carry out any further checks based on the information it had.
Loans 2 and 3
As Mr N withdrew from these loans on the same day he was approved, he didnt incur any 
interest or charges, so I wont consider these further.
Loan 4
Loan 4 was taken out eight days after Mr N had withdrawn from loan 3. Satsuma carried out 
the same checks it did for the first loan and this resulted in Mr Ns declared disposable 
income being adjusted down from £2,580 to £1,551.83. I consider the checks were 
proportionate to the circumstances of the lending. I say that because:
The scheduled repayment was less than 9% of Mr Ns declared income;
The repayments were lower than any of the three previous loans;
There was nothing in Mr Ns borrowing history with Satsuma to suggest he was 
struggling financially;
Satsumas calculations indicated the repayments were comfortably affordable to 
Mr N.
I acknowledge Mr N says he was charged £990.02 interest on this loan, even though hed 
repaid it within 21 days. However, this was not the case. Although £990.02 was the 
contracted interest on the loan, Mr N actually paid £302.56 interest as the remaining £687.46 
was a rebate for early repayment.
So, I dont consider Satsuma was irresponsible to have approved loan 4 and I find the 
interest charged took into account the early repayment.
Loans 5 and 6
By the time Mr N applied for his 5th loan in quick succession, Id have expected Satsuma to 
have a more complete picture of his financial circumstances. I consider a proportionate 
check should have included verifying the information Mr N had provided. Mr N hasnt been able to provide his bank statements from the time, but he has sent in the analysis carried out 
by the debt charity in October 2016 and Ive seen a recent copy of his credit file. So Ive 
used those as a reasonable proxy for what a proportionate check may have shown Satsuma:
Mr Ns declared income of £2,900 corresponds to the figure Ive seen on the debt 
charitys analysis of Mr Ns circumstances;
Based on the breakdown Mr N shared with the debt charity, I think its likely Satsuma 
would have found Mr Ns regular expenditure (excluding credit) was around £1,400;
I can see from Mr Ns credit file that he had five active credit cards and a mail order 
account in July 2016. The combined minimum payments on those were around £700;
Mr Ns payment record on all his accounts was good in July 2016;
There are no outstanding short-term loans on Mr Ns credit file in July 2016;
Mr N was overdrawn by about £3,000 in his current account, although that was within 
his £4,000 limit;
So, I think its likely that Satsuma would have found Mr N had a disposable income of around 
£800 - lower than the £1,300 to £1,400 it calculated for loans 5 and 6. I cant see there are 
any indications that Mr N was struggling to manage his money though and I find that its 
likely Satsuma would still have considered the repayments to be affordable even at this 
lower level of disposable income.
In summary, Im satisfied Satsuma would not have made a different lending decision, even 
after proportionate checks, so I cant conclude it was wrong to have approved loans 5 and 6.
Loans 7 to 10
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Satsumas lending history with Mr N, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Satsuma should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Satsuma should have realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ns case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
This was Mr Ns seventh loan in fewer than five months;
Shortly before loan 7, Mr N opened three more credit accounts and quickly increased 
his debt levels:
oHe took out a loan for over £20,000 in July 2016;
oHe took out two new credit cards in July and August 2016 and the combined 
balance on them was over £7,000 by October 2016;
Mr N could not afford this new level of repayments from his disposable income.
I think that Mr N lost out because Satsuma continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans would have had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ns indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended 
period of time;the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ns 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
I acknowledge that Mr N says this service has already confirmed he was dependent on 
short-term loans, in its response to other cases, but I must consider each case based on its 
own merits and the circumstances at the time of the lending. In this case, I havent seen any 
evidence that Mr N was in a cycle of short-term lending at the time, but I do find that, by loan 
7, his pattern of borrowing should have indicated to Satsuma that further lending may have 
been unsustainable.
So I am upholding Mr Ns complaint about loans 7 to 10 and Satsuma should put things 
right.
  
My final decision
 My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part.
In deciding what redress Satsuma should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it not lent to Mr N, as Im satisfied should have been the case for 
the later loans.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mr N may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere. If this wasnt a viable option, he may have 
looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, Mr N may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing, over a different time period). 
But even if they had done that, the information that would have been available to such a 
lender and how they would (or ought to have) treated an application which may or may not 
have been the same is impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this 
case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that 
a new lender would have been able to lend to Mr N in a compliant way from October 2016 
onwards.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mr N would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Satsumas liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
So, Provident Personal Credit Limited (trading as Satsuma Loans) should:
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr N towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 7 to 10;B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr N which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr N originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled;
C. Pay Mr N the total of A plus B;
D. The overall pattern of Mr Ns borrowing for loans 7 to 10 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Satsuma should remove these loans entirely 
from Mr Ns credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Satsuma to take off tax from this interest. Satsuma must 
give Mr N a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 March 2021.
