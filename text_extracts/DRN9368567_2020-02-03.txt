Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Gs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given as they thought the pattern of borrowing indicated    Mr G was 
reliant on short-term loans. Sunny disagreed but agreed to uphold  from loan 8 onwards 
instead. Mr G declined  Sunnys offer so, the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN93685672the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint. Having done  so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to more when it approved  loans 1 to 5. Mr G 
didnt respond  to the view. As there is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about  these 
loans, I won be making  further  findings  on them.
For loans 6 to 12, Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  history with Mr G, with 
a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr G was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr G had taken out six loans within eight months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr G was having  to borrow  further to cover 
the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Gs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Gs first loan was for £300 and loan 6 was for the same amount.  At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that Mr G was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr G was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of taking out 
the previous one. 
Ref: DRN93685673Mr G wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  12 was 
taken out 11 months after Mr Gs first. Mr G had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
The outstanding balance  due on Mr Gs loan has been transferred to a third party.  Sunny  
should buy the loan back if it can. If Sunny cant buy the loan back than it needs to work  
with the third party to make sure the following  is achieved: 
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 4 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 to 12 should be removed from  
Mr Gs credit file. 
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr G a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 March 2020.
