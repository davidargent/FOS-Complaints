K820x#14complaint
Mr Y complains about how PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA has managed his account.  
background
Mr Y said that PayPal had first said that it wanted him to provide tracking  information  on his 
orders, but it was already  being provided with that. Then it said that it had limited his account 
and it was going to close it. He said hed been  given conflicting  reasons for his account  
being closed.  He also said that PayPal  had taken too long to return  money to his customers  
who had asked for a refund.
Mr Y said that since then he had noticed a lot of strange activity  on the account, with 
amounts being  deducted  and added that didnt correspond to the transactions  on the 
account. And at some  times the balance was changing without any transactions  on the 
account. He sent us a large number  of screenshots which he said showed these 
discrepancies. He said that he had made  a formal complaint to PayPal  at the end of October  
2017, but when he complained to us in February 2018 he said he still hadnt received any 
response to that complaint. 
PayPal said that it had written to Mr Y to ask for some more information on the items he was 
selling. It had asked  for tracking information and original  receipts  or invoices for the 
purchase of the items he was selling. It seems  to have asked him for this information  a 
number of times. Then it told him it was going  to close his account. 
Our investigator didnt  uphold this complaint. He said that PayPal had made  a commercial 
decision to end its business with Mr Y. He said that although he appreciated that Mr Y was 
frustrated, because he hadnt been  given  a reason for this, our investigator said that financial 
businesses dont have  to disclose detailed reasons for taking this action. 
PayPal had told Mr Y that it was ending its relationship with Mr Y to protect  it from potential  
financial losses. And, in line with that concern, it had held on to Mr Ys money  for some time, 
to mitigate the risk of loss from chargebacks. PayPal has now released Mr Ys balance. 
Our investigator also said that hed checked  the position with Mr Ys fluctuating  balance.  He 
said that he thought that what PayPal had said, that this was caused  by exchange rate 
fluctuations, was plausible. Part of Mr Ys total balance was in pounds,  part of it was euros,  
but the total balance  was shown in pounds.
Our investigator said that PayPal had acted in line with the terms and conditions  of Mr Ys 
account, so our investigator didnt think PayPal had to do any more. 
Mr Y didnt agree with that. He said there were differences of £100 to £200  in some of the 
screenshots he had sent us. And he mentioned  a specific refund, where  hed told PayPal the 
customer had already been given  their money  back,  but PayPal took the funds  again.
Our investigator asked  PayPal for more  information, particularly about the sort of evidence  it 
would require to show that someone  had already received a refund, outside of PayPal. 
PayPal sent our service  a list of refunds made,  and Mr Ys transaction history for late 
October 2017 to the end of November.  PayPal said that it had thoroughly reviewed Mr Ys 
PayPal history and it was confident that it hadnt made any mistakes.  It said that it could 
Ref: DRN42019502check individual transactions if Mr Y would like, but he would have to identify where  he 
thought the problems were. 
Our investigator forwarded  that to Mr Y, and said hed found no evidence of a business error. 
He passed on PayPals offer to review any individual transactions, and said that Mr Y might 
like to take that offer up for the customer he said had been  refunded  outside  of PayPal, 
because PayPal hadnt had a chance to consider that before the case came to us. 
Mr Y still didnt  agree. He said that there were payment discrepancies that he had 
highlighted, some of those correlated with the transaction  history that PayPal had sent but 
there were still missing amounts. He said that there  were still missing amounts  through the 
documents hed sent us. And he said that each screenshot he had sent us had the time and 
date in the bottom corner, so it should be easy for this to be checked.  
Mr Ys case  was then passed to me for a final decision.
my provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I didnt  propose  to 
uphold it. This is what I said then: 
-Mr Y told us that he set up a business  in 2017, which was accepting payments through 
PayPal. His PayPal  activity changed markedly at this time. PayPal investigated Mr Ys 
increased activity, and asked him to send it further  information about his trading.  Mr Y 
says he did what PayPal wanted, but PayPal  still decided  to close  his account.  
-Mr Y said hed sent PayPal the tracking  information it wanted. But it also asked for 
original receipts or invoices showing the purchase of the items he was selling. And it 
doesnt seem that Mr Y sent those  invoices to PayPal. I thought  it was reasonable for 
PayPal to request  that, and for it to decide  that it wouldnt do business with Mr Y any 
more if he wouldnt supply that information. 
-Mr Y received a considerable  number of refund requests for the items he was selling. It 
took PayPal a little while to process those requests. I didnt think  it was unreasonable, 
given the number of requests for returns, for this to take a little time to work through.   
-Mr Y queried what he said were fluctuations in his balance,  while  he was waiting for his 
account to be fully reconciled by PayPal. He sent us a large number  of screenshots.
-Many  of Mr Ys screenshots were noted  with queries about relatively small fluctuations in 
his balance. That balance  was made  up of two separate amounts. The larger was in 
pounds and the smaller was in euros. Those  sub-totals  remained the same. But the total 
balance, which was given in pounds, kept changing. Mr Y said he didnt  know  why. 
-I thought it was likely that this was simply as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate 
for euros  to pounds. Mr Ys euro and pound  subtotals remain  the same. But to give an 
overall total in pounds, PayPal has to convert that euros  sum into pounds. And Mr Ys 
euros will be worth more  or less in pounds,  depending on the exchange rate at the time. 
That means that Mr Ys overall  account total,  which is given in pounds, should be 
expected to fluctuate, even without any transactions on the account. I didnt think  this 
was a mistake by PayPal.  
Ref: DRN42019503-Mr Y said that hed looked at the exchange rate, and that didnt explain the differences. 
But I still thought  that was the most likely  explanation for the minor  fluctuations  in Mr Ys 
balance that hed drawn our attention to. There isnt just one exchange rate. PayPal  sets 
its own exchange rate, and I hadnt been able to see that PayPal publishes that online. 
But it does make clear that the rate it uses is a retail rate, not a bank rate. 
-Mr Y also asked  us to look at larger fluctuations in his account balance. He said what 
hed sent us showed changes of £100  to £200. I found what Mr Y sent us quite  difficult to 
follow. The screenshots he sent didnt  seem to include  all of the relevant transactions. 
-Mr Y said that it should  be easy to check all of this, because his screenshots include a 
date and time on each  one. It seemed  as if Mr Y was asking us to audit his PayPal 
account. I said I was sorry to have to tell Mr Y that our service isnt able to do that. We 
would look at issues that he had previously raised with PayPal, to see if a complaint  has 
been properly  handled. But its not the role of our service to check each and every 
transaction on his account, to see if there are grounds for any complaint. 
-Our service sought to broker  and support discussions between PayPal and Mr Y, to try to 
identify what,  if anything, may have gone  wrong  in this case. We sent him a breakdown 
of his transaction history on a spreadsheet, in case he might find that easier to review.  
-Mr Y replied  to say what wed sent didnt make sense, because  there  were  transactions  
on this history which didnt show up on his online transaction  history.  He pointed to three  
specific transactions, which he said were titled with buyer dispute raised through  a 
popular online auction site. He wanted  us to check all of those transactions.  
-We asked PayPal  to explain this, with a particular focus on these three transactions.  
PayPal said that the screenshots  provided  by Mr Y only showed  the transactions  
received and subsequently refunded, but the spreadsheet that PayPal had sent us, 
which wed shared  with Mr Y, showed  all his account activity.  PayPals internal system 
shows additional layers  of transactions. PayPal said that it was still confident that it 
hadnt made an error and that the overall balances were  correct.  
-PayPal also said that some of the confusion might be because  Mr Y wasnt sending us 
full screenshots  of his PayPal account  transactions. He was sending us partial  
screenshots of his PayPal account,  which didnt show how he filtered them, his total 
balance at the end of that day etc. PayPal  said that the best way for Mr Y to review his 
transaction history  was to click Activity at the top of the page  and either use the date 
range Advanced search options  or the keyword search box to target specific 
timeframes, transaction types  or parties.  
-PayPal also said that when a buyer files a dispute with the online auction site, then the 
funds from that disputed transaction are held by the auction site. It explained that two of 
the three transactions that Mr Y was concerned about were temporary holds placed on 
money for online auction site transactions by that auction site. Those  were  listed as 
temporary hold for a buyer dispute.  (The third wasnt a valid transaction number.)
-It seemed possible that the larger balance fluctuations that Mr Y saw on his account 
were a result of temporary holds being  placed  on his funds when buyers registered a 
dispute on the auction site. But I didnt think I had enough information to be certain that 
this was the cause of each fluctuation  that Mr Y commented on. I didnt think I could get 
to the point of certainty on this without fully auditing Mr Ys PayPal account.  And Id 
Ref: DRN42019504explained that isnt a service that we provide.  So, instead, I said I would leave open the 
question of whether  individual  transactions  have been reconciled, so Mr Y could review  
his own account,  in the light of this additional  information, and discuss with PayPal any 
particular concerns he had. 
-I also noted Mr Y raised  with our service the issue  of whether PayPal had refunded  a 
transaction he said he had already proved had been refunded outside of PayPal. Our 
investigator suggested Mr Y should raise that as a complaint with PayPal itself,  because 
it hadnt had a chance to comment on this. So I said I wouldnt decide that point here. 
-I explained that I didnt think that PayPal did anything wrong when it reviewed, then 
closed, Mr Ys account. And I thought  that the minor fluctuations in his balance  that Mr Y 
pointed to were a result of changes in the exchange  rate. I left open  the question  of 
whether Mr Ys account had been  fully and properly  reconciled,  as I wasnt  able to audit 
his account. 
-In the issues I had considered, I hadnt  been  able to identify any errors by PayPal. So I 
didnt think I should uphold this complaint. 
I invited the parties  to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
PayPal replied to say it has nothing to add. Mr Y didnt reply.
my findings
Even though  neither side has offered any further evidence or arguments,  Ive still 
reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and reasonable 
in the circumstances of this complaint.  I havent changed my mind.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 April 2019.
