The complaint
Mrs M has complained about loans granted to her by Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny (Sunny or the lender).  Mrs M says she couldnt afford the loans and 
had to borrow again which led her into such financial difficulty she had to go without 
essentials at times.
What happened
Sunny agreed 24 loans for Mrs M from December 2016 to February 2019. The loans were all 
instalment loans to be repaid over six months and ranged in value from £50 to £600. The 
below table sets out some information Sunny has provided about these loans (with numbers 
rounded to the nearest pound). As the table shows many of the loans ran concurrently and I 
understand that all were repaid.

Our adjudicator upheld Mrs Ms complaint in part and recommended that Sunny refund the 
interest and charges she paid on loans 5 to 24 because they found that Mrs M was likely to 
be having problems managing her money by loan 5. They also found that Mrs Ms pattern of 
borrowing by loan 10 showed that her borrowing was likely to be unsustainable. 
Sunny disagreed with this recommendation but offered to refund interest and charges on 
loans 15 to 24 because, it said that when looking at Mrs [M]s overall usage, we recognise 
that by loan 15, it would have been prudent to have investigated this loan further before 
granting this loan. This is due to the fact that the customers usage had exceeded 18 
months; in other words the customer had been charged interest for 18 months or more. 
Further, as the customers declared expenditure increased; we feel that this should have 
prompted us to have questioned her financial circumstances in greater detail. Therefore, it 
can then be said that the manner in which the customer used our product from this point 
onwards may have also indicated they were perhaps not, using the product appropriately 
and/or for short-term borrowing need. Following our further review, we consider it 
appropriate to partially uphold the customers complaint from instalment loan 17 to 24.
Mrs M didnt accept this offer and so the complaint has come to me, as an ombudsman, for 
review and final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending  including the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Ive followed that 
approach here. 
The Financial Conduct Authority was the regulator when Mrs M took out her loans. The 
relevant rules and guidance set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook said that for all loans 
Sunny needed to check that Mrs M could afford to meet her repayments in a sustainable 
manner. This meant Mrs M being able to meet her repayments out of her normal income 
without having to go without or borrow further. 
The regulations werent prescriptive about what checks Sunny needed to carry out in order 
to reasonably assess whether Mrs M would be able to meet her repayments sustainably. But 
the regulations said that such checks needed to be proportionate. This suggests that the 
same checks might not be the appropriate thing to do for all consumers, or for the same 
consumer in all circumstances.In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed checks
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. 
Sunny says it asked Mrs M for information about her income and expenses each time she 
applied for a loan. The lender recorded Mrs Ms monthly income as £1,250 and her 
expenses, which included credit commitments, as ranging from just over £300 to about 
£675. Sunny estimated that Mrs M had a minimum amount of around £500 a month left over 
to meet her loan repayments throughout the time she borrowed from it.
Sunny also said that it used information from third party credit reference agencies to ensure 
the loans were affordable for Mrs M and to check her credit history. It hasnt provided the 
results of these checks but it has provided a summary which states that Mrs M didnt have 
more than four outstanding loans from other short term providers when she made her 
applications. The summary also states that there were no bankruptcies, debt management 
plans or recent county court judgements recorded on her credit file. The summary doesnt 
show the amount of any existing debt or how much Mrs M might have been paying towards 
this. 
Mrs M repaid her first loan within two weeks and took out her second a few weeks later. She 
then took out a third loan the day she repaid her second and supplemented this a month or 
so later.  The loan repayments for these first four loans didnt take up such a significant 
proportion of Mrs Ms monthly income that Id consider this alone might render the lending 
irresponsible, even considering the combined repayments. And it seems from the 
information Mrs M gave Sunny about her expenses that she had enough disposable income 
to meet the loan repayments each month, while meeting her existing commitments. 
Sunny said that it didnt find anything in its checks to suggest that it ought to have looked 
further into Mrs Ms financial situation before agreeing to lend to her and, from what Ive 
seen, that seems to be the case. Altogether, I dont think it was unreasonable of Sunny to 
agree Mrs Ms first four loans. 
I think Sunnys checks were proportionate for Mrs Ms earlier loans. However, when Mrs M 
had repaid and borrowed again a few times and the overall amount she was indebted for 
continued to increase, I think Sunny ought to have become concerned. I think the lender 
should have looked into her finances in more detail and verified the information she was 
providing to it, specifically when Mrs M applied for her fifth loan having just repaid her fourth. 
I dont think it did this, so I find Sunnys checks werent proportionate from here onwards. 
Mrs M has provided her bank statements and a copy of her credit file and I can see from 
these that she was having problems managing her existing debt. In early 2017, around the 
time of loan 5, Mrs M had arrangements to pay in place on at least three payday loans from the previous year, two credit cards and a telephone network provider. She was also making 
token payments to eight separate debt collectors. I think Sunny would have learnt that it was 
unlikely shed be able to sustainably repay further debt, had it carried out proportionate 
checks here, and would have declined this and subsequent loans.
Sunny offered to refund the interest and charges Mrs M paid on loans 15 onward because it 
said that the manner in which Mrs M borrowed  may have indicated she was not using its 
loans for short term borrowing needs. I agree that it was irresponsible to have agreed these 
loans but I also think Sunny should have stopped lending to Mrs M before then, specifically 
when she asked for her tenth loan. 
As with her earlier loans, had Sunny carried out a proportionate check here it was likely to 
decline this loan. I also think Sunny ought to have realised at this point that Mrs M was not 
managing to meet her repayments sustainably. This loan was for £200  shed first borrowed 
£150 some ten months earlier and it seems to me she hadnt managed to make any inroads 
into her debt in this time. Mrs Ms pattern of taking out further loans when she repaid 
previous loans and taking out loans concurrently had been clearly demonstrated by that 
point. This pattern suggests to me that she couldnt repay her debt without needing to 
borrow again, that she wasnt managing to meet her repayments sustainably and had an on-
going need for additional income.
In thinking about the pattern of lending, I have considered that there was a gap of almost 
three months before Mrs M took out loan 16. However, given shed been indebted to Sunny 
for over a year and a half before this gap, I am still of the view that it wasnt responsible of 
Sunny to have continued to lend to her beyond this. 
I think Mrs M lost out when Sunny agreed loan 10 and went on to agree more loans for her 
because these loans unfairly prolonged her indebtedness and allowed her to take expensive 
credit intended for short term use over an extended period of time. The number of loans and 
length of time she borrowed over was likely to be seen negatively by other lenders, 
potentially keeping her in the market for high cost loans. 
Putting things right
As Ive explained above, I find that Sunny was irresponsible to have agreed further credit for 
Mrs M from and including her fifth loan taken out on the 24 March 2017. In order to put 
things right for her, Sunny should:
a. refund all interest and charges Mrs M paid on loans 5 to 24; and
b. pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the dates of settlement; and
c. remove any adverse information about loan 5 to 9, and all information about loans 10 
to 24 from Mrs Ms credit file because any information recorded about them is 
adverse.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I am upholding Mrs Ms complaint about Elevate Credit 
International Limited trading as Sunny in part and it should put things right for her as Ive 
outlined. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2020.
