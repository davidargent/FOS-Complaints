The complaint
Mr T complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his account without 
notice and later registered a default on his credit file.
What happened
Mr T says NatWest closed his account in 2017 without providing him with a reason and 
didnt find out until he tried to use his account card. He says he tried to repay the outstanding 
debt, but NatWest didnt allow him to do so. Mr T says he found out in 2020 that NatWest 
had registered a default on his credit file. He accepts that he moved address but didnt 
update NatWest until 2020. Mr T would like the default removed and says he didnt receive 
any letters from NatWest.
NatWest says it made a decision to close Mr Ts account which its entitled to do in line with 
the account terms and conditions. It says it wrote to Mr T to tell him it was closing the 
account and sent him other letters about the account closure. NatWest says its Mr Ts 
responsibility to update it with a new address and says he called it during 2017 and was told 
the account would close. It says it registered a default on Mr Ts credit file in February 2018.
Mr T brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought NatWest was entitled in line with agreed terms and conditions to close an account 
by giving notice. And thought it had sent Mr T letters about the account closure. The 
investigator thought Mr T used the account regularly and it was his responsibility to update 
NatWest with the new address and his responsibility to repay the balance. The investigator 
didnt think there was any evidence that Mr T had tried to repay the balance,
Mr T doesnt accept that view and in summary says he doesnt accept that letters were sent 
to him and would like evidence of them. He says he has now repaid the debt.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr T will be disappointed by my decision.
I have looked at the account terms and conditions which I think Mr T would have agreed to 
when the account was first opened. Those terms and conditions make clear that NatWest 
can close a customers account by giving appropriate notice. So, I dont think NatWest made 
a mistake by making the decision to close Mr Ts account and Im satisfied it doesnt need to 
provide reasons for doing so. Im also satisfied that having looked at NatWests records that 
letters were sent. I appreciate that NatWest hasnt been able to provide the actual letters, but 
I dont think that matters for the reasons I will explain.
NatWest isnt responsible for the safe delivery of the mail and so I cant fairly hold it 
responsible for Mr T not receiving any of the letters. I also make clear that its Mr Ts 
responsibility to update NatWest with his correct address and if letters were sent to a 
previous address, then that is not something I can fairly hold NatWest responsible for.
Im satisfied that Mr T ought to have known that his account was overdrawn, and I can see 
that the account was used regularly. So, I think Mr T ought reasonably to have known that 
his account access was restricted and that he owed NatWest the overdrawn account 
balance. I can see that Mr T did make contact with NatWest during the later part of 2017 and 
Im satisfied it told Mr T that his account was restricted and that a payment needed to be 
made. I can also see from NatWests records that a default was registered on Mr Ts credit 
file in February 2018. So, I think Mr T ought to have known he needed to make a payment 
and that he had sufficient time to do so before February 2018 which would have avoided the 
default.
I appreciate Mr T says he tried to make a payment. I think on balance it unlikely that 
NatWest would not have allowed such a payment as it was clearly in its interest to receive 
the money it was owed by Mr T. I can see Mr T has now repaid the money but that was over 
three years after the date he ought to have done so. Im satisfied that in these circumstances 
NatWest was reasonably entitled to conclude by February 2018 that the relationship 
between it and Mr T had broken down and that he had a reasonable time period to repay the 
money owed. It follows that I think NatWest was entitled to register a default on Mr Ts credit 
file.
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest hasnt made a mistake or acted unfairly and so I cant 
fairly order it to remove the default from Mr Ts credit file.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2021.
