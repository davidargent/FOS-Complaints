DRN-4364015
The complaint
Mr H complains about the service he received from Zurich Insurance PLC.
What happened
Mr H called Zurich to enquire about the publication of a report. He wasnt satisfied with the 
answers he received, so he complained. Zurich issued a final response letter a few days 
later in which it attempted to answer Mr Hs queries. Mr H remained dissatisfied, so he asked 
our service for an independent review.
 
The Investigator concluded Zurichs agent had tried their best to answer Mr Hs queries and 
the final response letter reasonably addressed them. While he recognised Mr Hs frustration, 
he didnt recommend Zurich do anything more to resolve the complaint. Mr H asked for the 
complaint to be referred to an Ombudsman, so this matter has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I agree with the outcome reached by the Investigator, for the same reasons. While I also 
accept Mr H was frustrated Zurich couldnt answer his queries when he called, the queries 
were specific, and I find the final response letter clearly set out the position. I dont find there 
is a fair and reasonable basis for me to require Zurich to do more to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2023.
