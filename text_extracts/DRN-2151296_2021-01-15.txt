The complaint
Ms A complains that Secure Trust Bank plc, trading as Moneyway, has terminated the hire 
purchase agreement under which a car was supplied to her.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Ms A under a hire purchase agreement with Moneyway 
that she signed in November 2016;
she agreed to make 59 monthly payments of £266.60 and a final payment of £276.60 
for the car to be supplied to her  there had been issues with the payments but in 
August 2019 her account was up to date;
she contacted Moneyway that month because she wasnt going to be able to make 
the payment due in September 2019 on time and it agreed that she could make the 
payment after shed received her pay for that month  but she didnt do so and she 
didnt make the payment that was due in October 2019;
Moneyway sent her arrears notices and agreed a repayment arrangement with her 
for her to clear the arrears  but she didnt make the agreed payments so it sent her 
a default notice;
she contacted Moneyway and made a payment to her account and another 
repayment arrangement was agreed  she made the first payment due under that 
arrangement but not the payment that was due in January 2020 so Moneyway sent 
her a notice of termination and then terminated her agreement;
it also instructed a third party to repossess the car but that hasnt happened and 
Ms A still has the car  she made a payment of £679.80 later in January 2020 and a 
payment of £266.60 in April 2020  and there was then a payment holiday from April 
to July 2020 and she made another payment of £266.60 in August 2020;
at the end of that month the outstanding amount that Ms A owed to Moneyway was 
£5,608.60 but as the agreement had been terminated that amount was payable to it;
she complained to Moneyway and it said that it might be prepared to agree a 
forbearance arrangement with her which would allow her to keep the car - but she 
complained to this service;
our investigator thought that Moneyway had acted fairly and reasonably in supporting 
Ms A and in line with the agreement when it terminated the agreement but it had 
continued to try and engage with her and offer further options;
Ms A says that the investigator has made his decision based on the information that 
Moneyway has sent and not taken account of her version of events;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances  and Im satisfied that I have enough evidence 
from Ms A and Moneyway for me to able to make a decision on Ms As complaint;
Moneyway has supplied documents to support what it says happened  but Ive also 
considered the information that Ms A has provided about her circumstances;
I sympathise with Ms A for the difficulties that shes described, but I consider that 
Moneyway has responded to her missed payments fairly and reasonably  it has 
twice agreed to payment arrangements but shes not made the agreed payments and 
I consider that its acted correctly in sending her notices of arrears, default and its 
intention to terminate the agreement before it did so;
it has also allowed Ms A to keep the car even though the agreement has been 
terminated and it had said that it might be prepared to agree a forbearance 
arrangement; 
Ms A still has the car and I find that its fair and reasonable for Moneyway to require 
her to pay the amounts for it that were agreed when she signed the hire purchase 
agreement; and
Im not persuaded that it would now be fair or reasonable for me to require 
Moneyway to reinstate Ms As agreement, to reduce or waive the outstanding 
balance of her account or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
I suggest that Ms A contacts Moneyway to try to agree a forbearance arrangement under 
which she keeps the car or, if she doesnt keep the car, an affordable repayment 
arrangement for the amount that she owes to it. Moneyway is required to respond to any 
financial difficulties that Ms A is experiencing positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms As complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 February 2021.
