K821x#15complaint
Mrs R says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny irresponsibly lent to her. 
She says the loans  were unaffordable and they placed her in a worse  financial position by 
significantly reducing her available income to meet essential living  costs.

Sunny said it had carried out a creditworthiness and affordability check before providing 
Mrs R with each of her loans. And following its review  of the information the repayments 
were deemed to be affordable.
Initially our adjudicator upheld Mrs Rs complaint from loan 1 onwards. Sunny disagreed and 
another adjudicator reviewed the matter. This time she thought that loan 1 shouldnt have 
been provided for the same  reasons  as the first adjudicator. But she said as Mrs Rs 
expenses had significantly  reduced  since being  given loan 1, she couldnt fairly conclude  
that Sunny was wrong to give Mrs R loans 2,3 and 4. She also explained that by loan 5 
Sunny should  have  carried out further checks. But as she hadnt  received any information  
about what these  checks might have revealed,  she couldnt say that Sunny  had done  
anything wrong  when it provided loan 5 either. But she upheld  Mrs Rs complaint from loan 6 
onwards. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
Ref: DRN26165382different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs R could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Rs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, when Sunny provided loan 1 to Mrs R she had declared an 
income of £900.  She also told Sunny that her monthly expenditure was £858.  The 
repayment for loan 1 was £33.35. So, on the information Sunny gathered  about  Mrs R she 
would only have been left with £8.65  when she took out loan 1 with which to pay any 
unforeseen expenses. I think at this point  and based on the information it had obtained 
Sunny ought to have realised that it would have been difficult  for Mrs R to repay her loan 
sustainably.
When Mrs R took out loan 2, she again  likely  submitted her income and expenditure to 
Sunny before it decided whether to lend to her. This time her income was declared as 
£900.00 and she gave her expenditure as £449.00.  So, on this occasion on the figures she 
had provided to Sunny, once she had paid her loan repayment, she had an income of over 
£400. And as it was early in the relationship,  I dont think Sunny needed to ask for more 
information or take steps to verify what Mrs R had told it. For loans 3 and 4 Mrs R also 
declared her income as £900.00 and then she told Sunny that her expenditure was £564.00  
Ref: DRN26165383and £531.00 respectively  - so for these loans I also cant say Sunny did anything wrong. I 
can see how Sunny would reasonably conclude that these loan repayments were  affordable.
By the time Sunny gave Mrs R loan 5, she still had loans 3 and 4 outstanding and at this 
point I think Sunny should have carried out further  checks and taken steps to verify her 
income and expenditure. I cant say Sunny did carry out all the checks  it should have done.  
But I havent seen  any evidence to say what Sunny would have seen if it had carried  out a 
more detailed and through review of Mrs Rs finances. So, I cant  uphold Mrs Rs complaint 
about this loan either. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs R was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Mrs R had by this time taken out 6 loans in nearly 6 months and at 
that time she still hadnt repaid loans  3,4 and 5 when  she took out loan 6. Mrs R had 
been indebted to Sunny for all that time save for a short  period of around two months 
between her being given loan 1 and loan 2 when  she didnt take out a loan with 
Sunny. So overall, I think Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not 
Mrs R was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances and that Mrs Rs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mrs Rs first loan was for £100.00  and loan 6 was for £200.00. So, the amount Mrs R 
was borrowing had doubled in almost 6 months. And when  she borrowed loan 6 she 
also had to make a repayment  for loans 3,4 and 5 which  all overlapped. At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that Mrs R was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary 
shortfall in her income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
From  Loan 6 onwards Mrs R was provided with a new loan within  days of settling 
four other loans.  
Loan 10 was taken out around 8 months after Mrs Rs first. And although it was for 
the same  amount,  by the time she took out the last loan she still had loans 7,8 and 9 
outstanding. Mrs R had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mrs R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Rs indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mrs R borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mrs Rs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN26165384So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loan 1 and loans 6-10 and Sunny should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs R paid on loan1 and loans 6-10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 1 from Mrs Rs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6-10 should be removed from 
Mrs Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs R a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Rs complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  pay Mrs R compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 April 2020.
