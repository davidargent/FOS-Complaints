The complaint
Mr and Mrs F are unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) declined their 
cash withdrawal in branch.
What happened
Mr and Mrs F wanted to withdraw £3,500 in cash from a NatWest branch for a car purchase. 
Mr F called ahead of the branch visit to arrange the cash withdrawal. He wanted his visit to 
go smoothly because of his personal circumstances. NatWest declined the cash withdrawal 
request in the branch so Mr F was unhappy.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He said NatWest was entitled to ask questions 
and/or for evidence before agreeing the transaction, and this is also outlined in the terms of 
the account. He said NatWest accepted they could have provided better service and issued 
compensation of £500. Our investigator didnt think NatWest needed to do anything further.
Mr F didnt agree. He felt NatWest shouldnt interfere at the level it did and that NatWest 
failed to take his personal circumstances into account. As Mr F didnt agree, the complaint 
has been passed to me to decide.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Declined cash withdrawal request 
NatWest has a duty to protect Mr F and his money. This is also reflected in the terms and 
conditions of Mr and Mrs Fs account. I can see under section 2.2 there are circumstances 
when NatWest may choose not to act on a customers instruction. As such NatWest can 
refrain from making a payment if it has reasonable grounds to believe for example, that the 
instruction relates to a scam, fraud, or any other crime. Given NatWests obligations, I dont 
think it was unreasonable that they asked Mr F further questions and for evidence about his 
intended purchase, particularly as the activity was out of character for his account given it 
was a large cash withdrawal.
I think NatWest carefully considered Mr Fs request during the branch visit. He initially spoke 
to one branch staff member who asked whether Mr F could make the payment via a safer 
method such as faster payment but he didnt want to do this. The branch staff declined Mr 
Fs request and as he remained unhappy, this was escalated to a senior colleague. Based 
on the lack of evidence from Mr F regarding the transaction this staff member also declined 
Mr Fs request. 
Mr F has said he didnt have documentation about the car purchase because it was a private 
sale. Whilst I accept Mr Fs point of view, it seems he didnt provide any further persuasive 
information about the sale. In the absence of this and considering NatWests obligations, I 
dont think it was unreasonable they declined his request. 
Mr F has said he was told he could withdraw approximately £2,000 without any issue but 
when he requested this during his branch visit it was also declined. Having listened to phone 
calls between Mr F and NatWest, Mr F was told his maximum withdrawal limit was £1,900 
and that if he required more cash then the branch would need to be notified. However 
NatWest explained regardless of the amount being requested they may still ask questions. 
Given what had previously happened with the request for £3,500 and in the absence of any 
further information about the purchase, I dont think it was unreasonable NatWest declined 
this request also. 
Mr F has said he was told he wouldnt be allowed to take out £500 each day at a cash 
machine. I dont know what was said during the visit but it seems Mr F didnt attempt to take 
out cash each day in any event. And NatWest explored different payment methods with him, 
so I think NatWest did what it could to assist him.
I can see that Mr F made phone calls ahead of his branch visit to ensure that the visit went 
as smoothly as possible. This was important to him because of his personal circumstances. 
Having listened to these calls NatWest explains the information hed need to bring to branch 
(such as photo ID) and that they may ask questions about the transaction. I appreciate Mr F 
was frustrated because he provided information about the transaction over the phone prior to 
his visit. But I dont think it was unreasonable NatWest asked for that information at the point 
he wanted to make this transaction.
Mr F feels NatWest shouldnt interfere at the level they have and that he was treated as a 
criminal. Ive not seen anything to suggest NatWest meant to cause any offence or that this 
was the inference of them declining the request. I think NatWest were trying to protect Mr F 
and his money, which is what they are required and entitled to do.   
Mr F has, on a number of occasions, referred to a hypothetical situation for a cash 
withdrawal in relation to a particular service where he wouldnt have any paperwork. But this 
situation hadnt occurred so my decision has only focused on what did actually happen.
Customer service
NatWest paid Mr and Mrs F £500 because it said it could have provided a better customer 
service. Mr F feels that no consideration has been given to his disability status, that NatWest 
made his stress issue a lot worse and that they ignored his support options. Because of this, 
he requested for further compensation.
Having looked at the records held by NatWest in relation to Mr Fs condition I can see that 
this asks NatWest to be patient with him. Although I can appreciate the branch visit was a 
stressful experience, and more so given Mr Fs personal circumstances, I dont think 
NatWest ignored his request for them to be patient with him. I say this because it seems 
NatWest explored other avenues with Mr F to help him make the payment, and he was also 
escalated to another staff member for a second opinion. So I think NatWest did take his 
circumstances into account. It follows that I dont think any additional compensation should 
be paid. 
I realise my decision will be disappointing for Mr F as he feels strongly that NatWest 
shouldnt have denied him access to his money. But for the reasons Ive explained above, I 
dont think this was unreasonable.My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F and Mr F to 
accept or reject my decision before 16 June 2023.
