The complaint
Mr W has complained that Shawbrook Bank Limited (Shawbrook) rejected his claim 
against it under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Background
Mr W bought solar panels for his home in 2014. The purchase was funded by a loan from 
Shawbrook, and that business is therefore liable for the acts and omissions of the installer 
under the relevant legislation. In this case, that relates to the installer misleading Mr W into 
believing that the panels would be self-funding, which they werent.
Shawbrook made an offer to settle the complaint. But it didnt take into account that Mr W 
had settled his loan with Shawbrook early by taking out finance with a different provider. 
Mr W felt the offer did not fully compensate him for his losses.
Mr Ws complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators. She thought that the benefits 
of the panels were mis-represented to Mr W, and that fair redress would be for the loan to be 
restructured to effectively make the panels self-funding. This restructure should be based on 
evidence of the actual performance of the panels, and a number of assumptions on future 
performance. She explained Shawbrook should take into account the losses Mr W incurred 
with the refinance loan he took with an alternative provider in order to fully compensate him. 
Shawbrook didnt respond so the case was passed to an ombudsman. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Shawbrook is familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at complaints of this type, and indeed our well-established approach. So, I 
dont consider it necessary to set all of that out in this decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, for the same reasons as those explained 
by the adjudicator, I uphold this case. In brief, that is because the evidence supports the 
conclusion that a misrepresentation took place and Mr W was not given clear information to 
demonstrate that the solar panels would not be self-funding and would equate to an 
additional cost for him.
So, I think that Shawbrook didnt treat Mr W fairly and he lost out because of what 
Shawbrook did wrong. And this means that it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what Shawbrook needs to do to put things right for Mr W
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Mr Ws complaint for Shawbrook to put things right by recalculating the 
original loan based on the known and assumed savings and income to Mr W from the solar 
panels over the 15 year term of the loan so he pays no more than that, and he keeps the 
solar panel system, and any future benefits once the loan has ended. 
In the event the calculation shows that Mr W is paying (or has paid) more than he should 
have Shawbrook needs to reimburse Mr W accordingly. Should the calculation show that the 
misrepresentation has not caused a financial loss, then the calculation should be shared with 
Mr W by way of explanation.  
I understand Mr W has settled his loan early, so Shawbrook offered to pay Mr W the 
difference between what he paid in total and what the loan should have been under the 
restructure above, with 8% interest.
But Mr W has said he settled the loan by refinancing. As our adjudicator explained, because 
Mr W has settled the loan by refinancing, I think Mr W should supply evidence of the 
refinance to Shawbrook, and Shawbrook should: 
1. Refund the extra Mr W paid each month with the Shawbrook loan.
2. Add simple interest from the date of each payment until Mr W receives his refund.
3. Refund the extra Mr W paid with the refinanced loan.
4. Add simple interest from the date of each payment until Mr W receives his refund.
5. Pay Mr W the difference between the amount now owed and the amount he wouldve 
owed if the system had been self-funding
Im satisfied that there was sufficient information available at the time that Mr W first 
contacted Shawbrook that means the claim should have been upheld and redress offered in 
line with our well-established approach (as described above). I direct that Shawbrook should 
pay Â£100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Ws complaint. Shawbrook Bank Limited 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2021.
