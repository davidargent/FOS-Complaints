The complaint
Mr and Mrs P complain that The Co-operative Bank Plc (trading as Platform) sent them 
confidential information about a third party. 
What happened
In May 2019 Platform sent a letter to Mr and Mrs P that included a letter intended for another 
customer. That letter included personal information about the other customers.
Mr and Mrs P say that this was a serious data breach and that Platform should increase its 
offer to reflect that. They want us to investigate this further.
The investigator said that it wasn't Mr and Mrs P's data that had been compromised. And in 
view of this Platform's offer of £50 was fair. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
I accept that Platform made a mistake here. It should have taken a great deal more care to 
make sure that it protected its customers' private information. But it's not my role to punish 
financial businesses for making mistakes - I'm only here to look at individual complaints. 
Platform has accepted its error. To put that right I need to consider the impact on Mr and Mrs 
P of receiving a letter intended for someone else. I can see that as customers of Platform it 
would have caused them worry that Platform has made mistakes like this. And there was 
some inconvenience in letting Platform know what had happened. But I have to take into 
account that there hasn't been any breach of Mr and Mrs P's confidentiality. In all of the 
circumstances, I consider that Platform's offer of £50 is fair and reasonable. 
My final decision
My final decision is that The Co-operative Bank Plc should pay Mr and Mrs P £50 in full and 
final settlement of this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs P to 
accept or reject my decision before 18 November 2019.
