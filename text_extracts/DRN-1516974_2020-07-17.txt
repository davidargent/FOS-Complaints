The complaint
Mr C complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement with 
Close Brothers Limited, trading as Close Brothers Motor Finance, wasnt of satisfactory 
quality. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Close Brothers, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr C - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr C was eight years old, had been driven for more than 
52,000 miles and had a price of £7,995;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
there have clearly been some issues with the car and Mr C has complained about 
issues with the diesel particulate filter, a knocking noise; clutch issues, the 
windscreen letting in water and an electrical failure;
the dealer dealt with an issue with the diesel particulate filter a few weeks after the 
car was supplied to Mr C under the cars warranty, Mr C says that the knocking noise 
was caused by a loose wheel -which has been resolved - and he paid for the clutch 
to be repaired by another garage in September 2018 because the warranty had 
expired;
he says that the issues with the diesel particulate filter have continued and he 
complained to Close Brothers about the issues with the car in July 2019 - he told it 
that the cars mileage at that time was about 73,000 so hed driven more than 20,000 
miles in the car in about seventeen months;
it asked him to arrange an independent inspection of the car so he paid £216 for the 
car to be inspected in August 2019 and the inspection report concluded:  the 
vehicle has a severe water ingress issue, which is compromising the vehicles 
electrics, which prevented us from starting the vehicle to conduct our inspection of 
the reported issues, on the grounds of safety issues and possible further damage;
theres clearly an issue with water ingress into the car but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that that issue was present or developing when the car was supplied to Mr C 
and he was able to use the car for seventeen months and to drive more than 20,000 
miles in it before the electrics failed  so Im not persuaded that those issues were 
present or developing when the car was supplied to him;
nor do I consider that the other issues that Mr C has had with the car cause a car that 
was eight years old when it was supplied to him and which had been driven for more 
than 52,000 miles to not have been of satisfactory quality at that time  and I dont 
consider that he would have been able to use the car to drive more than 20,000 miles 
in seventeen months if it hadnt been of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to 
him;
I sympathise with Mr C for the issues that hes had with the car and for the repairs 
that it now needs  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to him; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Close Brothers to allow Mr C to reject the car, to pay for any repairs to it, to pay any 
compensation to him or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 August 2020.
