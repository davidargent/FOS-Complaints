The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his account without 
notice and has recorded adverse information on his credit file.
What happened
Mr B says NatWest closed his account in July 2019 without telling him, the day before he 
was due to be paid. He says those actions were unfair and NatWest has recorded adverse 
information on his credit file. Mr B would like his overdraft facility reinstated so he can pay it 
off, the debt recalled from a third-party company and any adverse information removed from 
his credit file.
NatWest says it closed Mr Bs account in line with agreed account terms and conditions and 
says it doesnt need to provide reasons. It says it wrote to Mr B on 17 July 2019 to tell him 
what it was doing and sent him text messages and a further letter about the account 
defaulting. NatWest says its entitled to pass the debt to a third-party business and was 
entitled to register a default on Mr Bs credit file when the debt wasnt paid.
Mr B brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought NatWest was entitled to close the account and fairly told Mr B about the default, but 
the money hadnt been repaid. The investigator thought it was for Mr B to either pay the 
money back or agree a repayment plan with NatWest.
Mr B doesnt accept that view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I realise 
Mr B will be disappointed by my decision.
I have looked at the account terms and conditions which I think Mr B would have agreed to 
when the account was first opened. Im satisfied that NatWest is entitled in certain 
circumstances as in this case to close an account without notice and without providing 
reasons. So, I dont think NatWest acted unfairly or made a mistake by closing Mr Bs 
account in these circumstances and, whilst Im sure Mr B would like a reason for that, I find 
that its not obliged to provide one.
I have looked carefully at NatWests records and can see that it told Mr B the account was 
closing and sent him letters about the outstanding balance as well as sending him text 
messages. I think it was Mr Bs responsibility to repay the money he owed NatWest and as 
he didnt, then Im satisfied that in November 2019, NatWest was entitled to register a default 
on Mr Bs credit file. I think NatWest is under an obligation to accurately report the position of 
Mr Bs account to the Credit Reference Agencies which is what took place here. I also think 
NatWest told Mr B he could speak to it about a repayment plan, but I cant see any evidence 
that such a plan was agreed.
Im satisfied its up to NatWest when exercising its commercial judgement to decide if it 
passes a debt to a third-party business, and that is not something I can fairly interfere in.
Overall, I dont think NatWest acted unfairly or made a mistake and so I cant order it to re-
instate Mr Bs account or remove any adverse information from his credit file.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 April 2021.
