The complaint
Miss B complains about the way that Prestige Finance Limited had dealt with her loan 
account.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that Miss B had a loan with a third party that 
was transferred to Prestige Finance; 
Miss B didnt make all of the agreed loan repayments so there were arrears on her 
account and she was making additional payments to clear the arrears;
Prestige Finance has provided evidence to show that the loan was for £5,000 and 
was originally due to be repaid by April 2018  but due to the missed payments the 
loan continued after that date;
its evidence also shows that the arrears on the account had been reduced to £1.96 in 
March 2018 and that the outstanding balance of the loan was £3,215.78 in 
September 2018;
Miss B stopped making payments to the account in April 2018 because she says that 
shed been told by the original lender that the loan would be cleared by then;
Prestige Finance started legal proceedings to recover the outstanding debt  but the 
proceedings were dismissed in May 2019;
Miss B says that she would like Prestige Finance to erase the debt, remove it from 
her credit file and compensate her for the losses that shes incurred;
I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Prestige Finance 
to waive Miss Bs debt  it was originally intended that the loan would be repaid by 
April 2018 but Miss B didnt make the required monthly payments for that to happen 
which led to the arrears on the account and additional interest being charged which 
has caused there to an outstanding balance on the loan account;
Prestige Finance says that its not prepared to write-off the remaining debt but would 
be willing to reduce the balance and work with Miss B to come to a mutual 
agreement for her to repay the remaining debt  I consider that to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
Prestige Finance is required to ensure that the information that it records on Miss Bs 
credit file is a true and accurate record of her account - Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the information that its recorded on her credit file isnt 
a true and accurate record of her account so I dont consider that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require it to remove any of that information;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that its acted incorrectly in 
its dealings with Miss B about the loan  so I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable 
for me to require it to waive or reduce the outstanding balance of the loan, to pay her 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint; and
I suggest that Miss B contacts Prestige Finance to try to agree a reduction of the 
amount that she owes it and an affordable repayment arrangement for her to repay 
that amount  if shes experiencing financial difficulties its required to respond to 
those financial difficulties positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 October 2020.
