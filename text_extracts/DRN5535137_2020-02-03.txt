K821x#15complaint
Mr H has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr H says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mr H took out some  21 instalment loans from Sunny between 
October 2016 and April 2018.  Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Hs borrowing with Sunny, 
based on the information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this 
decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  5 onwards. Sunny  initially said it hadnt  done anything wrong. 
But later it made an offer to settle  the complaint from the point of loan 19 onwards. Mr H 
didnt reply to us about this so the complaint  has been passed to me for an ombudsmans 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Hs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr H could 
repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These  checks  ought to have  taken 
into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total repayment  
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN55351372refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr H could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr H. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending history with 
a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, 3 and 4 ought not to 
be upheld as they appeared affordable. Ive looked carefully at these and taken note of 
Mr Hs declared  income at around the time. Ive also looked at what he said about his 
monthly expenditure. 
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which Sunny most likely carried  out appear to have  
been proportionate for loans 1  4. And I think these  levels  of checks,  together  with the 
income and expenditure details provided  by Mr H, would  have  made those particular loans 
appear affordable.  
However, I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of loan 5 onwards 
in this case would have looked  different and therefore required a more thorough and 
responsible approach. Upon asking for loan 5 for example, Mr H already had 3 other  Sunny 
loans outstanding and so his total monthly repayments on them  were  mounting up 
significantly. I think this provided evidence that he was getting  into financial trouble and 
probably borrowing  to help service the debts he already had. 
Theres no evidence Sunny did anything different at this stage to check that its lending was 
responsible and sustainable  for Mr H and that he wasnt  becoming vulnerable to continually 
using high-interest credit  just to get by. I think providing loan 5 was therefore irresponsible.
In addition to the above,  from the point of loan 6 onwards,  there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident  in my view. Loan  6 directly followed loan 5 by just 4 
weeks, but again, it was granted whilst some of Mr Hs other loans remained outstanding.  So 
there was an obvious dependency on high-interest short-term lending  evidenced by this, his 
sixth loan in less than 8 months. It was also apparent  from this point onwards that he wasnt 
making any in-roads into his debt,  evidenced  by the 21 loans he was eventually provided.
Ref: DRN55351373So Sunny ought to have  realised that Mr H wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term 
cash-flow problems; he was borrowing very regularly,  to address shortfalls in his income  and 
to meet  an ongoing  need. Mr H was having to consistently take out high interest,  short-term  
lending over a sustained period and the indebtedness  caused by this type of borrowing was 
harmful, in my view. Sunny should  have seen  this and realised Mr H was at risk of not 
managing to repay the loans sustainably  or getting into financial difficulties. 
So in addition to loan 5, Im also upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 6 - 21. For 
these, Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr H in an unsustainable manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 5 - 21;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 19, 20 and 21 and treat 
any payments Mr H made towards  these loans as payments towards the capital;
if reworking Mr Hs loans 19, 20 and 21 accounts  as Ive directed results in him 
effectively having made payments above the original capital borrowed, then Sunny 
should refund these  overpayments  with 8% simple  interest  calculated  on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of 
settlement. 
If reworking Mr Hs loans 19, 20 and 21 accounts leaves an amount of capital still to 
be paid, then Sunny can use the total refund for the other upheld loans to offset this. 
And if there is still an outstanding capital balance then I would remind  Sunny that it 
should take a sympathetic view when seeking to agree an affordable  repayment  plan 
with Mr H for the remaining capital.
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Hs credit file in relation to loan 5. 
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 -21 should be completely 
removed from Mr Hs credit file.
If Sunny has sold any of the outstanding  debt it should buy it back  and then take the 
above steps. If it is not able to buy the debt back, then it should liaise with the new 
debt owner to achieve the results outlined  above.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr H a certificate  
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
Ref: DRN55351374For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit  International Limited  
should put things right for Mr H as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 March 2020.
