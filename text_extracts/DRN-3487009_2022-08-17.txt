The complaint
Mrs A complains NewDay Ltd recorded missed payments on her credit file despite agreeing 
a payment holiday on her credit card account. 
What happened
Mrs A is assisted in bringing her complaint by a third party. For simplicity, Ive referred to all 
comments as having been made by Mrs A.
Mrs A holds a credit card account with NewDay. 
On 7 October 2021, Mrs A arranged a payment holiday with NewDay. They said she 
wouldnt need to pay anything until the payment holiday ended on 14 January 2022. 
NewDay wrote to Mrs A confirming the agreement. No repayments were made during the 
payment holiday. NewDay wrote to Mrs A on 4 January 2022 to remind her the payment 
holiday was coming to an end. 
Mrs A contacted NewDay again on 18 January 2022 and arranged a further repayment 
holiday. But in February 2022, Mrs A discovered NewDay had reported a missed payment 
on her credit file. She didnt think this was right. So, she contacted NewDay to complain.
NewDay didnt agree theyd made a mistake. They said the minimum payment requested on 
Mrs As statement in September 2021 had been due on 14 October 2021. But as a payment 
holiday was agreed on 7 October 2021, that payment didnt need to be made until the 
payment holiday ended on 14 January 2022. But they didnt receive that payment. 
Mrs A didnt think this had made been clear to her during her call on 7 October 2021. 
NewDay were unable to retrieve a recording of that call. So, they apologised to Mrs A for this 
and paid £25 to compensate her for the trouble and upset caused. But they werent prepared 
to remove the missed payment reported on her credit file. They said it had been made clear 
in their letters to Mrs A that any payments previously due would need to be paid as soon as 
the payment holiday expired (i.e. by 14 January 2022). 
Mrs A wasnt happy with NewDays response to her complaint. So, she decided to refer 
matters to this service. Having completed a full review is Mrs As complaint, our investigator 
didnt think NewDay had done anything wrong when they recorded a late/missed payment 
on Mrs As credit file. 
Mrs A didnt agree with our investigators findings. She said the payment wasnt made 
because she was on holiday. She also thought NewDay hadnt provided sufficient proof that 
she was told she had to make a payment by 14 January 2022.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Mrs As complaint has been passed to me to 
consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen copies of Mrs As credit card statements from September onwards. The statement 
dated 14 September 2021 shows a payment due of £153.23 by 11 October 2021. This 
consisted of a contractual minimum payment of £75.88 and arrears of £77.35. The statement 
shows that no payment had been received by NewDay since her previous statement. A later 
statement shows Mrs A made a payment of £77.35 on 21 September 2021. This meant that 
she needed to pay £75.88 by 11 October 2021. 
The repayment holiday was agreed by NewDay during a call on 7 October 2021. Mrs A says 
that during that call, NewDay didnt make it clear she needed to make a payment on 14 
January 2022  when the repayment holiday ended. NewDay paid Mrs A £25 because they 
couldnt recover a recording of that call. There is no regulatory or legal requirement for 
NewDay to record and retain calls. But here, theyve recognised that by the call not being 
available, they were unable to clarify exactly what Mrs A had been told. So, in these 
circumstances, I think the compensation paid by NewDay feels fair.
Ive considered the letters NewDay sent to Mrs A. A letter dated 7 October 2021 says, 
your repayment holiday has started Until 14th January 2022you do not need to make 
any monthly paymentsIf there were any amounts already overdue at the time the payment 
holiday started, you will have to pay these immediately when the payment holiday ends.
NewDay also wrote to Mrs A again on 4 January 2022. They said, your payment holiday 
will end on 14th January 2022Any payments that were already due before your payment 
holiday began will become immediately payable on 14th January 2022. I think this makes it 
very clear that Mrs A needed to pay something by 14 January 2022. 
Im satisfied Mrs A was sent both of these letters. Im also satisfied Mrs A had the 
opportunity to contact NewDay and clarify anything she wasnt clear about or thought 
contradicted what shed been told during her call on 7 October 2021. So, I cant reasonably 
say that NewDay hadnt made their requirements clear.
The statement issued to Mrs A in September 2021 showed what needed to be paid. And as 
this statement predated the payment holiday agreement, it was apparent this needed to be 
paid as soon as the payment holiday ended. So, while theres no evidence to show that 
NewDay told Mrs A this during her call on 7 October 2021, I think NewDays letters made 
this clear.
I accept that Mrs A contacted NewDay again on 18 January 2022, when a further payment 
holiday was agreed. But as the previous one had already expired; this was a new payment 
holiday rather than an extension or continuation of the previous one. So, I think Mrs A still 
needed to have made the required payment by 14 January 2022. And as she didnt, I dont 
think NewDay did anything wrong when they reported that to the credit reference agencies.
The Principles for the Reporting of Arrears, Arrangements and Defaults at Credit Reference 
Agencies (PRAAD) are published by the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). These 
place an obligation on NewDay to report accurately and factually where payments are late or 
missed. Thats what they did here. Mrs As payment from her September 2021 statement 
was due to be paid by 14 January 2022. It wasnt received so was reported correctly and 
factually. And until the full amount was received by NewDay, this would continue to be 
reported each month until it was paid.
Mrs A mentioned to our investigator that she didnt make a payment on 14 January 2022 as 
she was on holiday. I appreciate this might have made things difficult practically. But I cant 
reasonably hold NewDay responsible for that  It wasnt within their control and theyd 
previously provided adequate notice.
I do realise Mrs A will be disappointed. But I cant reasonably find that NewDay have done 
anything wrong or treated her unfairly.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mrs As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or reject my decision before 14 September 2022.
