The complaint
Miss R complains National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) refused to uphold her 
complaint about a disputed transaction and she is unhappy with the customer service she 
received throughout her complaint. 
What happened
Miss R says she wasnt responsible for a transaction made on her account on 13 May 2023 
for £58.86. She wants NatWest to refund her this money.
Miss R also says she called NatWest to discuss the fraudulent transaction on her account. 
During the call, she was called by the wrong name and she says they also hung up on her. 
Miss R is not happy with the way she was treated during this call. 
NatWest say they have refunded the transaction as a gesture of goodwill and theyre sorry 
for using the wrong name on the phone. NatWest agree that the service she received 
couldve been better, so they paid her £50 in compensation for this. Miss R was still not 
happy, so she brought the complaint to us. 
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. Miss R wanted this looked into again, so the 
complaint has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss R complained that NatWest had refused to refund her for a transaction on her account 
that wasnt made by her. Ive seen evidence that this has now been refunded to Miss R. So, I 
am satisfied she has been put back in the position she wouldve been had the transaction 
not happened, and so I wont be asking NatWest to do anything further. 
Ive listened to the calls made between Miss R and NatWest when she called to discuss her 
fraud complaint. And I heard the NatWest representative refer to her by another name. I can 
understand this may have been confusing for Miss R. Ive also heard that the call ended 
abruptly after this. I dont know why the call ended suddenly but I can appreciate that this 
would have felt rude to someone on the receiving end. NatWest have agreed that they didnt 
provide Miss R with the best service. Ive seen that NatWest have apologised for this and 
have also credit her account with £50 compensation. Under the circumstances, I think that is 
fair. I say this because while this may have come across as rude, its unlikely this wouldve 
caused any ongoing stress or inconvenience - so £50 feels like a fair amount.
NatWest have refunded Miss R for the disputed transactions and have also paid her £50 
compensation for any trouble and upset caused during the complaints process. And for the 
reasons outlined above I think thats fair so I wont be asking NatWest to do anything further.  
My final decision
I am not upholding this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 January 2024.
