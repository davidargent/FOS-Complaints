DRN-2226808
The complaint
Mrs S complains that a car she acquired through a Hire Purchase Agreement (HPA )with 
ALD Automotive Limited (ALD) wasnt the new car as she expected. She would like it 
replaced.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again here 
instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusion reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons: -
The HPA Mrs S signed in September 2019 clearly states on the first page that the car 
is a used one with ten miles on the clock. And was registered on 30 April 2019. I 
cant be certain what Mrs S was told at the point of sale but the agreement she 
signed is clear. So, I dont feel I have any evidence to show the car was mis 
represented to her. Nor do I feel I have any grounds to say the car should be 
replaced as Mrs S has requested.
Its unfortunate that vehicle warranty and Manufacturer Breakdown Assist cover 
began from the vehicle registration date. This did affect Mrs S. When her car broke 
down  she wasnt eligible for a hire car as the breakdown happened more than 12 
months from vehicle registration  the date the policy commenced.
I have no evidence as to what Mrs S was told of the warranty. So, I cant reasonably 
conclude she was misled. However, ALD has made a gesture of goodwill payment 
crediting Mrs Ss account with one months rental payment (Â£176.54) which I think 
reasonable in the circumstances
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 April 2021.
