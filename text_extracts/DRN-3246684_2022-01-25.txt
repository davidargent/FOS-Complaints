The complaint
Mr T complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCAs actions regarding the operation of 
his account with them.
What happened
PayPal took a higher fee than they should have from Mr Ts account. This fee was refunded, 
but it was refunded in United States Dollar (USD) currency, rather than the Great British 
Pounds (GBP) currency his account operated in. 
Mr T says he raised this back in 2018 but had to chase it many times to get a reply. 
Eventually, PayPal offered Mr T £100, and then £125 to resolve his complaint. He says he 
wanted to accept this, but PayPal then linked further issues to it so he couldnt do so.
In March 2019 Mr T says he spoke to PayPal about phones needing to give permission for 
their location to be seen by PayPal, but customers not being asked for consent about this.
In April 2019, Mr T tried to transfer money from his bank account to his PayPal account, but 
couldnt as PayPal had updated their codes. He says he discussed this with his bank, who 
told him this was PayPal not telling them theyd changed things making the transfer 
impossible.
After some phone discussions with Mr T on 25 April 2019 PayPal issued a final response 
letter covering the above complaint points. In it, they said theyd submitted feedback to their 
customer service team about issues Mr T had about getting responses and a resolution to 
his queries. Regarding the phones they provided a link to their website which explained 
about cookie technology and its relation to tracking technology. And, for the bank transfer 
issue, theyd raised it with their technical team to look into. At this time, they said they were 
prepared to pay Mr T £125 compensation  and asked him to get in touch by 1 May 2019 if 
he wished to accept it. This letter also gave six months to get in touch with us.
In November 2019, with a number of personal issues he was dealing with, Mr T decided to 
leave the phone and bank transfer issues and just ask for the payment of £125. He said 
PayPal refused to do this, even though theyd offered to do so in their letter of the 
25 April 2019. He said the last time he contacted PayPal was in May 2019, and didnt 
receive a response, so the delay in accepting the payment was due to a failure at their end.
In February 2020 as Mr T wanted to accept the £125, but PayPal hadnt provided it, he 
asked us to look into things. Mr T explained he suffers from stress and post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD).
PayPal said they thought we couldnt look into the complaint as Mr T had referred it too late.
Another Ombudsman ultimately decided we couldnt review Mr Ts concerns about the 
phone / cookie technology related issues  but could consider the remaining issues.
So, one of our Investigators reviewed the remaining issues. She felt for the way PayPal 
handled Mr Ts complaints, and for the bank transfer issue communication, they should pay 
Mr T £200 compensation in total. She said this was made up of the original £125 
compensation PayPal had offered, plus a further £75 for additional inconvenience.
PayPal replied to our Investigator, and said they accepted the outcome. Mr T then got in 
contact, telling us PayPal had already paid the money to him. But, as itd been paid in error 
and without his consent, hed donated the £200 payment to charity. Mr T said he just didnt 
have the time to enter into correspondence with us about this error  and he just needed this 
off his plate. At this point, Mr T hadnt said whether he did or didnt accept our Investigators 
outcome.
On 11 August 2021 Mr T got back in contact asking for a response from our service on the 
£200 payment hed since donated to charity. He asked if he replied, and accepted the offer, 
would PayPal pay £200 payment into his account with them.
Our Investigator explained on the same day as PayPal had paid the money, albeit prior to 
Mr T confirming his acceptance of her outcome, she didnt think she could ask them to pay a 
further £200 payment.
The following day, Mr T replied and said PayPal had credited the money to his account 
without his consent and havent followed the correct procedure. He said this has impacted 
on his levels of stress. As a solution, he suggested two options. Either: 
PayPal recall the payment from the charity, and then hed be able to consider 
whether our Investigators outcome was fair without distraction. 
PayPal pay Mr T £125 into his account directly and hed consider this matter closed.
Our Investigator put this to PayPal. They replied and said they cant recall any money Mr T 
had donated to charity and werent inclined to offer any further payments.
On 9 September 2021, our Investigator got back in contact with Mr T setting out her view 
that PayPal couldnt recall the money  and that she didnt consider it was fair to ask PayPal 
to pay anything further. She said she appreciated PayPal should have waited for Mr Ts 
confirmation of whether he was happy with the outcome shed recommended or not  but it 
was his choice to donate the money to charity. She explained we could have asked PayPal 
to have removed the £200 payment  if Mr T had asked us to. So, because of that, she didnt 
think PayPal needed to do anything further.
Im aware since then, theres been a lot of conversations between our service and Mr T 
regarding the scope of what can and cant be considered. In summary, Im satisfied its 
appropriate for me to consider PayPals actions of crediting the £200 payment to Mr Ts 
account as part of this complaint. The reason for that is because its an extension of the 
issues raised, and because I consider our Investigators contact with Mr T on 
9 September 2021 her outcome to Mr T on this point.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its important to explain Ive read and taken into account all of the information provided by 
both parties, in reaching my decision. I say this as Im aware Ive not reflected every point 
Mr T has raised. If Ive not reflected something thats been said in this decision its not 
because I didnt see it, its because I didnt deem it relevant to the crux of the complaint. This isnt intended as a discourtesy to either party, but merely to reflect my informal role in 
deciding what a fair and reasonable outcome is. This also means I dont consider its 
necessary to get an answer, or provide my own answer, to every question raised unless its 
relevant to the crux of the complaint.
There are three distinct issues for me to address, these are:
PayPals actions in taking a higher fee than they should have, and then not refunding 
it in the correct currency
Bank transfer issues
PayPal crediting the £200 payment to Mr Ts account before they should have
Ill address each complaint point under a separate heading below. Ill then, in another 
separate summary heading, provide my overall thoughts on what I consider is a fair way for 
this matter to be resolved.
PayPals actions in taking a higher fee than they should have, and then not refunding it in the 
correct currency
Mr T was charged too high a fee from his account, and when it was refunded, it was done 
using USD rather than GBP as it should have been.
Its not clear to me why this happened, but from the information I have PayPal have 
accepted they made an error in doing this, and took steps to put matters right  by crediting 
the correct amount back to Mr Ts account.
The way they resolved the financial loss aspect of Mr Ts complaint is fair, but I agree with 
his comments that hes been caused distress and inconvenience as a result of PayPals 
actions in how theyve then handled matters afterwards. Hes said hes had to repeatedly 
chase up to get a reply from PayPal  which does appear to be the case as I can see the 
first mention of it in December 2018, and a final outcome wasnt sent until April 2019. 
Ill come back to this in the summary section.
Bank transfer issues
Mr T was trying to arrange a set up between his bank and PayPal  so he could credit his 
PayPal account with funds. When he encountered problems, he spoke to his bank about it. 
Hes said he spoke to them on the phone, and they told him PayPal had changed 
information leading to these issues.
In PayPals April 2019 response, they said theyd submitted a request to our technical team 
to look into this. Sometimes these issues take some time to get investigated so I cannot give 
you a definite timeframe as to when any changes would be made. 
PayPal have since confirmed they didnt follow this matter up with Mr T. Theyve said they 
didnt find theyd done anything wrong, but importantly didnt tell Mr T the outcome of their 
investigations into this point. This left Mr T believing, based on what his bank had told him, 
that PayPal were at fault for whatd happened  even though PayPal had subsequently 
decided they werent.
I dont agree thats fair. Initially PayPals response to say theyll look into things was a fair 
one, but to then not report the outcome of that investigation when its directly impacting Mr T 
wasnt.
Again, Ill come back to this in the summary section.PayPal crediting the £200 payment to Mr Ts account before they should have
Mr T has said PayPal shouldnt have credited the £200 payment to his account following our 
Investigators recommendation without him having agreed to it.
As far as Im aware, there arent any rules stopping financial businesses such as PayPal 
taking proactive action once a case is with our service. So, I cant say they were 
categorically wrong in doing so. 
But I do agree with Mr T this wasnt in line with our services usual process. Ordinarily, I 
wouldnt expect a financial business to have credited money following a recommendation 
made by one of our Investigators until the consumer involved has accepted it. So, in that 
sense PayPal havent done what Id usually expect.
That said, Ive not seen anything to suggest they did so in an effort to upset or otherwise 
cause harm to Mr T. Our Investigator thought PayPal may have done so in an effort to 
provide good customer service  which doesnt sound completely unreasonable to me. So, I 
cant fairly say PayPal meant to cause distress to Mr T.
Despite that, it did clearly have a significant impact on him. Hes explained he wasnt able to 
deal with it at the time, so decided to remove the money from his PayPal account by paying 
it to charity. Once hed been able to process things a few days later, he wanted either the 
money returned from the charity to PayPal  so he could consider our Investigators 
recommendations  or the original £125 PayPal offered to be paid.
In finding PayPal didnt do this with any intention to upset Mr T, I also then dont consider itd 
be fair to hold them responsible for his actions. PayPal have explained they cant get the 
money back from the charity. Thats reasonable, as Mr T is the one who made the payment 
to the charity  not PayPal. Hes used PayPal as the method of making this payment, but he 
was the one who gave the instruction, and it was a legitimate payment hes made to the 
charity. If Mr T wanted to, he could speak to the charity and discuss matters with them  but 
I dont find PayPal are required to do anything further on this point.
And in respect of the £125 this is factored into the £200 compensation payment our 
Investigator recommended. So, Ill cover that in the next section.
Summary
Its clear from what Ive seen at times Mr T has been extremely frustrated by PayPals 
actions and their approach to concerns he raises. I cant change PayPals processes, I can 
only put right financial loss if they are considered responsible for it  and award 
compensation I deem is fair as a result of the impact of PayPals actions on Mr T.
With that in mind, its for me to decide if I consider a total compensation payment of £200 is 
fair  and having done so, I consider it is. PayPal have at times added to Mr Ts frustrations, 
but Ive not seen anything to suggest they did so intentionally. So, a £200 compensation 
payment to him is fair in all the circumstances.
The follow-on question, is whether PayPal should now be required to make that payment to 
Mr T again, given events Ive set out above.
Ive thought about this carefully. Mr Ts point here is PayPal didnt follow the correct process, 
and its this that directly led him to pay the £200 payment hed received to charity. As Ive 
acknowledged above, PayPal didnt do things in the way Id expect. Despite that, I dont consider Mr Ts only option to solve the problem he felt PayPal had created was to donate 
the money. He could have asked us to speak to PayPal to get the money removed.
Taking everything into account, I consider the £200 compensation is fair, and as PayPal did 
pay this to Mr T (even though he then chose to donate it) I dont require them to do anything 
further.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA  but as theyve already paid Mr T £200 compensation theyre not required to 
make this payment again.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 February 2022.
