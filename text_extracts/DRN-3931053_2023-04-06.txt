The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly closed his account. He says this 
caused him financial problems and upset. 
What happened
In July 2021, NatWest decided to review Mr Ss account. Whilst it completed its review the 
bank restricted his access to his account. This meant Mr S wasnt able to access funds in his 
account or use online banking. Following its review, NatWest decided to close Mr Ss 
account and wrote to him giving him 14 days notice that he needed to make other banking 
arrangements. 
Mr S complained to NatWest. He said he hadnt done anything which wouldve caused the 
bank to block and then close his account. He said due to the banks actions he was left 
without access to any money, and said he struggled to open another bank account, which 
has impacted his ability to work and study. Overall, he said he was caused a great deal of 
stress and inconvenience by the banks actions.
In response, NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong when it blocked and closed Mr Ss 
account. The bank also said it had closed Mr Ss account in line with the terms and 
conditions. And it said it hadnt done anything that would make it difficult for Mr S to open 
another bank account. Unhappy with this response Mr S brought his complaint to our 
service. 
One of our adjudicators looked into Mr Ss complaint. She said NatWest hadnt done 
anything wrong when it had blocked and closed Mr Ss account. Mr S disagreed. He said 
NatWest treated him unfairly and had made a mistake when it closed his account.
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill deal first with NatWests decision to block Mr Ss account. NatWest have important legal 
and regulatory obligations they must meet when providing accounts to customers. Those 
obligations are ongoing and dont only apply to when an account is opened. They can 
broadly be summarised as a responsibility to protect persons from financial harm, and to 
prevent and detect financial crime.
To comply with their obligations, NatWest will monitor accounts for activity which appears 
unusual or out of place. And may ask its customers to provide information about certain 
transactions. Its common industry practice for firms to restrict access to an account to 
conduct a review on a customer and/or the activity on an account. And, considering the 
information Ive been provided, I understand why NatWest carried out a review and I dont 
find their initial decision to restrict Mr Ss account was unreasonable. So, whilst I appreciate 
the restriction caused Mr S inconvenience and was upsetting, I cant say the bank treated 
him unfairly when it blocked and reviewed his account.
I then turn to NatWests decision to close Mr Ss account. Banks are entitled to end their 
business relationship with a customer, as long as its done fairly and is in line with 
regulations and the terms and conditions of the account. I understand it cant be pleasant 
being told youre no longer wanted as a customer. However, unless theres a very good 
reason to do so, this service wont usually say that they must keep a customer or 
compensate a customer who has had their account closed. 
Banks should, however, give reasonable notice before closing an account. Usually, that 
means 60 days notice, but it can be less  depending on the circumstances. Mr Ss account 
was blocked from early July 2021; he was unable to gain access to  the funds in it until the 
account was closed. Whilst it was formally closed in August 2021 (with 14 days notice), I 
believe that it was effectively closed immediately on 9 July 2021  since after that time Mr S 
couldnt use it. Having looked at all the evidence, I find this to be reasonable and in line with 
the terms of the account. So, I cant say NatWest treated Mr S unfairly when it closed his 
account and Ive not seen any evidence that suggests, as Mr S has submitted, that NatWest 
made an error when it did so.
I note that Mr S has said that he believes NatWests actions have led to him being unable to 
open another bank account. I want to reassure Mr S that Ive looked at all the information 
provided by him and NatWest, and there is nothing that would lead me to conclude NatWest 
have done anything that would prevent Mr S from opening another bank account. I can see 
that the adjudicator has already advised Mr S to check with the UKs fraud prevention 
database, CIFAS to see what if anything is recorded against his name. Im afraid I cant add 
anything further to this advice. 
Finally, Mr S has said NatWest didnt notify him it had closed his account. But Ive seen a 
copy of a text message NatWest sent to Mr Ss mobile phone and a screen shot provided by 
NatWest showing letter that NatWest sent a letter to Mr S on 10 August 2021 to let him know 
it had decided to close his account. So, I think its likely Mr S was aware NatWest intended 
to close his bank account. 
In summary, its clearly caused Mr S inconvenience when NatWest blocked and closed his 
account. So, I realise he will be disappointed by my decision. But having looked at all the 
evidence and circumstances of this complaint, for the reasons Ive set out, I dont think 
NatWest treated Mr S unfairly in taking the actions it did. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 May 2023.
