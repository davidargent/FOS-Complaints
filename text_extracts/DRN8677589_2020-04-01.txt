K821x#15Complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain  about how National Westminster Bank Plc set up payments on their
mortgage.
Background
Mr and Mrs S held a mortgage with NatWest. They wanted to borrow  more  money  and
applied through a broker. NatWest agreed  to lend them a further  £100,000.
This £100,000 was being borrowed on a lower interest rate than Mr and Mrs Ss existing
mortgage with NatWest. So it was also agreed  with NatWest that once Mr and Mrs Ss
interest rate on their existing mortgage  expired,  the outstanding balance  would be moved to
the same  interest  rate as the new borrowing.
Mr and Mrs S complained in December  2015,  as their new borrowing of £100,000 wasnt
showing on their account. NatWest corrected this, but Mr and Mrs S made a further
complaint to it in May 2016  as their original mortgage had moved on to the higher standard
variable rate (SVR), not the rate of their additional borrowing as agreed.
NatWest looked  into their complaint and saw there was an error  with how the two mortgages
were set up. It said this meant Mr and Mrs S hadnt  been paying anything  toward  the new
additional borrowing. But NatWest said it couldnt  fix the issue.  It said it was a technical error
that was being looked at.
It said that while it couldnt fix the error, it couldnt be sure what  the correct  monthly  payment
Mr and Mrs S needed to make was. But it told them  to keep paying the payment they were
making at the time. NatWest said it would make  sure some  of this payment  went toward the
new additional borrowing.  It also gave Mr and Mrs S £300 compensation.
NatWest said once  it fixed the issue on its system, if Mr and Mrs S had overpaid,  it would
refund them.  But it said it was more likely theyd not have paid enough, leaving the accounts
underfunded. NatWest  said if this was the case,  it would cover  the underfunding in full.
NatWest also went on to say it would keep Mr and Mrs S informed of its progress.
Mr and Mrs S didnt  hear about the issue again.  But they received several letters  from
NatWest about the SVR rate and changes to it. Each time Mr and Mrs S received one of
these letters, they sent it on to their broker to ask if NatWest had resolved the issue.
In September  2018 Mr and Mrs S made a further complaint to NatWest. They wanted to
know when the issue would be resolved and why they hadnt been  contacted  as promised.
NatWest said the complaint in May 2016  had been  incorrectly shut down, which  meant it still
hadnt fixed the issue with Mr and Mrs Ss mortgage account. But it said Mr and Mrs S
should have known they werent paying enough  toward their borrowing and done more to
chase it. So it wasnt willing to cover  all the underfunding.
Ref: DRN86775892To resolve  the complaint,  in February 2019 NatWest correctly  set up the two mortgage
accounts. It said it would cover the underfunding until May 2016 and it reworked the
accounts to reflect this. It paid Mr and Mrs S a further £500 in compensation too.
Mr and Mrs S remained unhappy so brought their complaint  to us.
Our Investigator  looked  into their complaint  and recommended it be upheld. She said
NatWest should  have set up the mortgage  accounts  correctly in the first place and given Mr
and Mrs S accurate  information about  what they needed to pay. She said NatWest should do
what it said it would do in May 2016  and cover the underfunding in full.
NatWest didnt agree and asked for an Ombudsmans decision. It said it was human error
the complaint  in May 2016  was shut down.  It says if it covers all the underfunding Mr and
Mrs S will have had the benefit  of borrowing  money  without needing to pay it back.
I issued a provisional decision which was:
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I also think it should  be 
upheld, but for slightly different reasons than our Investigator.
Im consciously not going to detail what happened or why this happened when looking into 
this complaint. The reason being  it isnt in dispute.  NatWest acknowledge it was its mistake 
in firstly not setting up the mortgages  correctly,  then shutting the complaint down in 2016. 
What is in dispute is what needs to be done to put things right.  And Ive thought  about this 
carefully. As it stands,  Mr and Mrs Ss mortgage  is underfunded by over £21,000.  On top of 
that, theres  unpaid interest of over £6,000.
NatWest has said if it were  to cover this, Mr and Mrs S would have had the benefit  of this 
money for free. Its said it would essentially be paying £21,000  toward their mortgage.  Its 
said Mr and Mrs S should have done  more  to contact it. Its said they should have known 
they werent paying enough toward their mortgage and Mr S given his former occupation 
should have known something  wasnt right here and kept money aside.
I can see why NatWest  think  this, and our approach on cases where customers  know they 
are underfunding is that we think steps should  often be taken to mitigate the underpayments 
 such as keeping  money to one side. But this case is slightly  different.
Ref: DRN86775893Mr and Mrs S were  aware  they were underfunding the mortgage, but they didnt know  by
how much.  NatWest also knew the account  was being underfunded, but it too didnt know by
how much.
Its NatWests  responsibility to let Mr and Mrs S know how much they should be paying, and
this didnt happen. And whats  more,  the reason the account was underfunded was due to
NatWests error, not Mr and Mrs Ss. The only party able to fix the error was NatWest too.
But as NatWest couldnt fix the error at the time the complaint was made it agreed to cover
the underfunding in full until the error  was fixed.
I understand NatWests  point that Mr and Mrs S should  have  known something  wasnt  right
when they didnt get updates as promised,  but I dont think its fair to say Mr and Mrs S
should have done more.  Ultimately it was Mr and Mr Ss complaint in September 2018 that
brought this back  to NatWests attention.
I understand the original complaint was incorrectly shut down by NatWest, so Ive
considered what  would have happened had it not been. Ive asked NatWest  when it would
have been able to fix the issue,  but its not been  able to tell me this. So even though I dont
think Mr and Mrs S should have done  more, had they done  so, Im not persuaded NatWest
would have been able to set up the mortgages correctly  any sooner than it did.
But in any case I think its reasonable that Mr and Mrs S relied on what  NatWest  said in its
response in 2016   that it would cover  the underfunding  in full until it could resolve  the issue
and let Mr and Mrs S know the correct  payments.
I understand that asking NatWest to cover  the underfunding in full will mean that Mr and
Mrs S will have had a significant portion of their mortgage paid for by NatWest.  But I think  its
the right thing to do here. I have to recommend what I think NatWest need to do to put Mr
and Mrs S back in the position they would  have been in, had no errors been  made  by
NatWest. And Mr and Mrs S certainly shouldnt be left in a worse position.
Ive considered a number  of ways to put things right, such as requiring NatWest  to waive all
the interest on the underfunding and set up a separate interest  free account for Mr and
Mrs S to pay of the capital. But all of these will likely have consequences  on Mr and Mrs Ss
future borrowing, putting them in a worse  position than where  they should  be.
So I require NatWest  to cover the underfunding in full, as it said it would in its response in
2016. If this results in a further refund to Mr and Mrs S after the account  is reworked, then
this should be paid to them.
I dont require NatWest  to pay any further  compensation to Mr and Mrs S as Im satisfied
what it has paid so far is sufficient in the circumstances.
My provisional decision
My provisional decision is that I intend to uphold Mr and Mrs Ss complaint. To put things
right for Mr and Ms S, I require National Westminster Bank PLC to:
Cover all underfunding (both capital and interest) on Mr and Mrs Ss mortgage
accounts (the original  mortgage and the additional  borrowing  of £100,000)
Ref: DRN86775894Recalculate the contractual  monthly  payments to reflect  that the underfunding  has 
been paid.
Refund any overpayment Mr and Mrs S have made (if any) to the mortgage  between 
the date of this recalculation of the account,  and the recalculation done in 
February 2019.
Mr and Mrs S accepted my provisional decision.  NatWest made  no further comment.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive been provided no 
further argument or evidence to change my from provisional decision.
My final decision
For the reasons  set out above, my final decision is that I uphold  Mr and Mrs Ss complaint. 
To put things right I require National Westminster bank Plc to:
Cover all underfunding (both capital and interest) on Mr and Mrs Ss mortgage
accounts (the original  mortgage and the additional  borrowing  of £100,000)
Recalculate the contractual  monthly  payments to reflect  that the underfunding  has 
been paid.
Refund any overpayment Mr and Mrs S have made (if any) to the mortgage  between 
the date of this recalculation of the account,  and the recalculation done in 
February 2019.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision  before  1 May 2020.
