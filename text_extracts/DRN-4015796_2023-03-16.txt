Complaint
Mr H has complained about a loan Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) 
provided to him. He says that the loan was irresponsibly provided to him.
Background
118 118 Money provided Mr H with a loan for £3,000.00 in September 2021. This loan was 
due to be repaid in 36 monthly instalments of just under £142. One of our adjudicators 
reviewed what Mr H and 118 118 Money had told us. And he thought that 118 118 Money 
hadnt done anything wrong or treated Mr H unfairly. So he didnt recommend that Mr Hs 
complaint be upheld. 
Mr H disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to look at his complaint.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Hs complaint.
Having carefully considered everything, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Hs complaint. Id like 
to explain why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this 
means is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mr H could afford to repay before providing this loan. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
118 118 Money says it agreed to Mr Hs application after he provided details of his monthly 
income and some information on his expenditure. It says it cross-checked this against 
information on a credit search it carried out and all of this information showed Mr H could 
afford to make the repayments he was committing to. On the other hand, Mr H has said he 
shouldnt have been lent to.
Ive carefully thought about what Mr H and 118 118 Money have said. 
118 118 Money has provided an output of the income and expenditure information recorded 
at the time of Mr Hs application as well as a record of the results of its credit searches.           
118 118 Money calculations appear to show that the monthly payments were affordable for 
Mr H and its credit searches appear to show that Mr H had relatively small amounts of 
existing unsecured debt. But while this was the case the credit searches also showed that 
Mr H had previous difficulties with credit.
So, in these circumstances, I would have expected 118 118 Money to find out a bit more 
about Mr Hs living expenses before agreeing to provide him with this loan. Mr H has 
provided us with further information on his circumstances at the time. But having considered 
this information there isnt anything within it which clearly demonstrates that the inclusion of 
his living expenses would have shown that the loan was unaffordable. 
In these circumstances, I dont think that 118 118 Money carrying out further checks on       
Mr Hs financial position would have led to it declining his application for this loan. As this is 
the case, I dont think that 118 118 Money did anything wrong when deciding to lend to Mr H 
 the available information and evidence provided doesnt demonstrate that proportionate 
checks would have shown this loan to be unaffordable. 
So overall I dont think that 118 118 Money treated Mr H unfairly or unreasonably when 
providing him with his loan. And Im not upholding Mr Hs complaint. I appreciate this will be 
very disappointing for Mr H. But I hope hell understand the reasons for the decision Ive 
reached in this particular case and that hell at least feel his concerns have been listened to.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 April 2023.
