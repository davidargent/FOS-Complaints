DRN-3633599
The complaint
Mr G complains about problems using  National Savings and Investments (NS&I) website. 
He would like the website fixed or to receive messages by hard copy.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here, instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
I do appreciate Mr Gs frustration, he can log onto the NS&I website to access secure 
messages NS&I has sent him but before he can access the messages he gets an 
error message  saying he had clicked the back button and then  gets logged out of 
the system. From the information NS&I have supplied us its clear it referred this 
issue to its technical team who were unable to find any fault with Mr Gs account. It 
made various suggestions such as using other browsers and clearing ookies I 
appreciate these suggestions didnt resolve the problem but I am not sure what else 
NS&I could do since it didnt find a problem with its system or Mr Gs account.
I understand that Mr G has now managed to set himself up to get paper-based 
messages which is what he asked for as part of his redress.
I appreciate Mr G also wanted NS&I to fix its website as he remains convinced its 
defective. Its not for us to tell businesses to change their systems, although from 
what I understand NS&I hasnt found an issue with its system.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2022.
