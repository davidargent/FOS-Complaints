The complaint
Ms H complains that a car that was supplied to her under a conditional sale agreement with 
Close Brothers Limited, trading as Close Brothers Motor Finance, wasnt of satisfactory 
quality and that Close Brothers wont accept her termination of the agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Close Brothers, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Ms H - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Ms H was nearly 13 years old, had been driven for 
48,331 miles and had a price of £3,995;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car was supplied to Ms H in April 2018 and it broke-down in September 2019 
when the gearbox and transmission failed;
Ms H says that the cost of the repairs will be £2,100 to £2,800 and that the value of 
the car is only £1,795 so she contacted Close Brothers and said that she wanted to 
terminate the agreement but it didnt accept her termination because of the condition 
of the car;
Ms H had been able to use the car for about 17 months before it broke-down and Ive 
not seen evidence to show that there had been previous issues with the gearbox or 
transmission;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that those issues were 
present or developing when the car was supplied to Ms H or that it wasnt of 
satisfactory quality at that time  so I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable 
for me to require Close Brothers to allow Ms H to reject the car or to pay for it to be 
repaired; 
Ms H had the right to terminate the agreement if shed paid half of the total amount 
payable under the agreement and shed:  taken reasonable care of the goods  
 but the agreement said that: You must maintain the Goods in good and 
reasonable order and condition at your expense. You are responsible for all loss of or 
damage to, the Goods, except for any due to fair wear and tear;
the car is not in good and reasonable order and condition because of the repairs 
that are needed so I dont consider that Close Brothers has acted unfairly or 
unreasonably in not accepting her termination of the agreement; and
I sympathise with Ms H for the difficulties that shes experienced and for the issues 
that she has with the car  but Im not persuaded that Close Brothers has responded 
to her complaint incorrectly and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Close Brothers to allow Ms H to terminate the 
agreement, to pay for the car to be repaired, to pay her any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 September 2020.
