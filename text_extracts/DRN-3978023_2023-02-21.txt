The complaint
Mrs M has complained that Bank of Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) wont refund a 
withdrawal where she says the cash did not dispense.
What happened
In July 2022, Mrs M tried to withdraw £100 at a cash machine. She explained that it sounded 
like the machine was processing this, and the hatch opened, but no cash came out. She 
stayed at the same machine and checked her balance, finding that the £100 had debited her 
account and there was only £40 left. Mrs M withdrew the £40 at the same machine.
Mrs M reported the first withdrawal to Halifax that same day. Halifax gave Mrs M a 
temporary refund and looked into things. Based on what they got from the ATMs owner, 
they thought the withdrawal had been successful, so they took back the temporary refund.
Mrs M wasnt happy with this. She also said shed spent a long time on hold, she hadnt got 
Halifaxs letters, theyd told her they wouldnt take back the refund, and theyd closed her 
complaint without resolving it. Halifax paid Mrs M £55 as compensation for any customer 
service issues. 
Our investigator looked into things independently and didnt think Halifax needed to do 
anything more. Mrs M asked for her case to be looked at afresh, so the complaints been 
passed to me to decide.
I sent Mrs M and Halifax a provisional decision on 23 January 2023, to explain why I didnt 
think the complaint should be upheld. In that decision, I said:
According to the ATMs electronic records, Mrs M put in her card and PIN and asked to 
withdraw £100. The withdrawal was approved, Mrs Ms card was returned, the £100 was 
dispensed in exactly correct notes, and the money was taken straight after. According to the 
records, the machine did not experience any errors or shut down. All of the notes were 
dispensed, and none were rejected or returned  the counter for returned notes stayed the 
same and did not go up. Our investigator sent Mrs M a copy of the records, and on those 
she will see that the codes and processes for the £100 withdrawal match up with her 
successful withdrawal of £40 right after.
The customers before and after Mrs M were also able to use the machine without any 
issues, and the next customer was only about a minute afterwards. The cash machine 
appears to have been working correctly at the time.
I have considered whether a device might have been fitted, which stopped Mrs Ms money 
from coming out. But if that were the case, then her second withdrawal wouldve been 
blocked, too. Given that Mrs M stayed at the same machine and made a successful 
withdrawal straight after, and given that other customers used it successfully right after that, 
I can be reasonably satisfied that a device was not blocking money from coming out.
If the ATM had not actually dispensed the £100, then Id expect it to have had £100 or so of 
extra cash in it afterwards. But when the cash machine was checked for balancing, the 
analyst confirmed that it balanced exactly. After I went back to Lloyds, the ATM owner has 
now also provided the raw balancing data to back this up. I am satisfied that this machine 
balanced correctly. This also strongly suggests that Mrs Ms cash was dispensed properly.
I understand that Mrs M had a separate problem with a taxi app about a week later, and that 
she felt it was related. But one cannot use an ATM to make payments on a taxi app, nor use 
a taxi app to tamper with an ATM. The taxi company and the ATM owner are two very 
different companies doing very different things. I hope I can reassure Mrs M that those two 
incidents are not related in any reasonable sense.
So the evidence I have strongly supports that Mrs M asked for £100 and that the cash 
machine gave it out. And Ive not seen anything which shows or substantiates that the cash 
did not get dispensed. So I dont have a fair basis on which to tell Halifax to refund the 
withdrawal. This is a difficult message for me to give, and I know its a difficult message for 
Mrs M to receive. But given the evidence I have and the balance of probabilities, Im 
currently unable to reasonably reach any other conclusion.
Lastly, I understand that Mrs M is unhappy with how Halifax handled the issue. I appreciate 
this was a stressful time for her. Strictly speaking, complaint handling is not an issue we can 
consider in and of itself, as its not a regulated activity like processing payments is. But as 
I understand Mrs M feels strongly about this, I have looked into this for her so that shes not 
left without any comments on the matter.
Mrs M said she doesnt get any of Halifaxs letters. But I can see they are sent with the 
correct address, so this would appear to be a postal issue rather than a fault on Halifaxs 
end. I also understand Mrs M could view letters on the app, and while I appreciate she was 
unaware of this at the time, the fact is that Halifax did make letters appropriately available to 
her. Mrs M asked for copies of the relevant letters, of which there are three, so Ill send her a 
copy along with her copy of this decision.
Mrs M also said she was misinformed about what would happen with the refund, so I looked 
into this for her. I listened to the call where Mrs M reported the withdrawal, and found that 
the staff member did explain that the refund was conditional. Once the claim was declined, 
Mrs M was sent a text explaining that the conditional refund would soon be taken back, and 
she confirmed she received this. This was also explained by letter, and while I understand 
Mrs M didnt get that letter, per the above I dont think that was due to any error by Halifax. 
I read Mrs Ms chat log with Halifax, and I cant see that they said the refund would not be 
taken back. They only said that it had not been taken back yet. Mrs M said she wanted 
confirmation the money would not be taken back in order to resolve her complaint, and the 
staff member said they were reassessing things and would close the chat for now. Again, 
they did not actually tell Mrs M that the refund would not be taken back. Im afraid this looks 
like it was simply a misunderstanding, rather than mis-advice on Halifaxs part.I can see that Halifax didnt initially register Mrs Ms complaint properly, and that they tried to 
close it early during a later chat before she felt it was resolved. I also understand that Mrs M 
spent some time on hold, and that she ultimately wasnt sure when her refund would be 
taken back exactly. So I appreciate why Mrs M may feel frustrated with the experience. In 
terms of compensation, its worth bearing in mind that were not here to issue fines or to 
punish businesses, and that using financial services wont always be completely hassle free.   
We have guidelines about what levels of compensation to award, and I need to be consistent 
with those. Taking everything into account, I think the £55 Halifax have paid Mrs M is fair to 
put right the way they handled things.
I said Id consider anything else anyone wanted to give me  so long as I received it by 
20 February 2023. Halifax didnt add anything further. Mrs M replied, which Ill talk about 
below.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs M explained that she didnt think the chat involved a misunderstanding. But I think it did. 
The staff member did not say the refund would not be taken back, nor confirm that the text 
theyd sent was a mistake as Mrs M had asked. I can see how the staff member closing the 
chat might have given the wrong impression, but again: they did not say the refund would 
not be taken back, as was previously claimed. That was a misunderstanding. I can also see 
that the staff member misunderstood whether they should raise a complaint or not, and as 
I said in the provisional decision they got things wrong by not initially registering one.
After assessing things again, Halifax still found that the evidence showed the money had 
properly dispensed. I cant see they ever said theyd not take the temporary refund back. As 
before, I think they explained clearly that it was temporary, and said that theyd take it back, 
and Mrs M has confirmed that she understood it was temporary.
Mrs M clarified that one letter was only available online, and I appreciate the clarification. But 
Im afraid it was still made available to her by an appropriate channel, and the others were 
also properly sent to the correct address. And I already accepted that she may not have got 
her letters in time when considering compensation.
Mrs M reiterated that Halifax had got things wrong in the service theyd provided, and I do 
agree. As before, I can see that they didnt register her complaint properly, tried to close it 
early, that she spent some time on hold, and that following some miscommunication she was 
left with some uncertainty about her temporary refund being taken back. I do appreciate her 
frustration, and I have taken it into account. As before, its worth keeping in mind that were 
not here to punish businesses or issue fines, and that using financial services wont always 
be hassle free. Looking at our guidelines, I think the compensation Halifax paid was fair to 
put right the things they got wrong with their service here.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive set out, I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 March 2023.
