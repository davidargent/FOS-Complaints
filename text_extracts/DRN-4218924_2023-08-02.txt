The complaint
Mr B is unhappy with the service he received from NewDay Ltd after it gave him notice that it 
planned to discontinue the brand of credit card he had. He says NewDay made it difficult for 
him to opt in for the Pulse card before the deadline. 
What happened
Mr B had an Amazon branded credit card account with NewDay. In August 2022 NewDay 
wrote to Mr B to say that card was being discontinued  but he could opt to switch over to its 
new Pulse branded card instead. The letter explained that Mr B had to call an automated 
line to opt in, but not doing so by 6 November 2022 would mean his account was closed.
NewDay says Mr B called in once prior to the deadline, on 5 November 2022, but didnt use 
the automated system to opt in for the Pulse card. Mr Bs call logs also show he made a 
short call to NewDay that day. Around a week after the deadline NewDay closed Mr Bs 
credit card account. The August 2022 notice said he would still need to maintain minimum 
payments to the debt, but would no longer have use of the credit facility. Both NewDays and 
Mr Bs records show he called after the account was closed, on 22 and 23 November 2022  
with each call lasting between 10 and 20 minutes.  
Subsequently Mr B raised a complaint about not getting a new Pulse card. He said NewDay 
hadnt sent any correspondence saying he needed to opt in, and felt it had told him the 
changes would be automatic. Mr B also said he had tried to call to opt in but couldnt get 
through to anyone due to the long wait times.  
NewDays response said it had sent Mr B a letter in August 2022 explaining what he needed 
to do to opt in and the deadline for doing so. It also explained he didnt need to wait to speak 
to anyone, as the opt in service was automated. But NewDay did agree that after the 
deadline Mr B had experienced long wait times when calling, and to apologise for the 
inconvenience caused it paid £45 into the account. 
Unhappy with the response, Mr B contacted our service. He told us NewDay had made it 
hard for him to opt in, and in resolution he wanted either the account re-opened with a Pulse 
card or the outstanding balance to be wiped. One of our investigators reviewed everything 
and thought the instructions provided in NewDays letter were clear, and the automated 
system for opting in wasnt affected by any wait times to speak to an agent. As the evidence 
suggested Mr B hadnt opted for the Pulse card in time, the investigator thought NewDay 
had acted fairly by closing the account.
Mr B didnt accept the investigators view and replied to say he had called NewDay once 
before the deadline to try and opt in, but no one picked up. He later added that he had opted 
in and was shocked when the new card didnt arrive, but also that he read online he would 
be sent one automatically. Mr Bs reply to the view included screenshots of negative online 
reviews about NewDay from other customers. 
The investigator considered the responses but maintained his position that NewDay had 
acted fairly. As no agreement could be reached, the matter was passed to me for a final 
decision on the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding Mr Bs complaint  and for much the same reasons the 
investigator gave. I know thatll come as a disappointment to Mr B, who feels strongly that 
NewDay should give him a Pulse card. But I havent found that NewDay acted unfairly in 
relation to the account closure, so Ive decided it doesnt need to do anything further to 
resolve the complaint. Ive explained my reasoning below.
The instructions provided in NewDays letter were clear on what Mr B needed to do to switch 
to the Pulse card, and ensure his account stayed open. Im also satisfied the letter was likely 
sent, based on the system evidence Ive seen. Mr Bs call log evidence agrees with 
NewDays records that he phoned once prior to the deadline, on 5 November 2022. But the 
system evidence Ive reviewed shows that he didnt opt in via the automated service during 
that call. The terms of the account allow NewDay to vary them or end the agreement with 60 
days notice  and here it gave Mr B 90 days to make his choice. So Ive found that was 
sufficient time in the circumstances. 
Mr Bs testimony around what happened is quite confused. He initially told us he called once 
before the deadline and tried to opt in but couldnt because no one picked up. Later he said 
he did opt in and was surprised when the card didnt arrive. At other points Mr B has 
mentioned calling multiple times before the deadline, but then also said he thought the new 
card would be sent to him automatically (implying he didnt think he needed to call and opt 
in). Ultimately, Ive found the evidence only supports there having been one short call prior to 
the deadline  and he didnt opt in during it. Mr B also didnt need to wait to speak to an 
agent in order to select the Pulse card, as that was done through the automated system. So, 
even if he did phone on multiple occasions before the deadline, NewDays call wait times 
wouldnt have prevented him from making a selection.
I can see Mr B called NewDay after the deadline, and experienced longer wait times  but by 
then it was too late to opt in. So I dont think those later service issues had any bearing on 
whether his account was closed. But I acknowledge it would have been frustrating for Mr B 
to have waited to speak to an agent, only to be told he couldnt have the new card (as the 
deadline had passed). NewDay has paid £45 for the delays in getting through during those 
calls, which lasted in total less than half an hour. Bearing in mind the length of time Mr B was 
waiting, and the associated inconvenience involved, I think NewDays offer fairly 
compensates that impact. So Im not directing it to do anything further to resolve things.
Overall, Ive concluded NewDay provided clear instructions but Mr B didnt likely opt in for 
the new card in time. I dont consider any wait times prevented him making a selection 
either. Therefore NewDay acted reasonably by closing the account in line with the notice 
given in the August 2022 letter. My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint about NewDay Ltd. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 August 2023.
