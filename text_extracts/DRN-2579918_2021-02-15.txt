DRN-2579918
The complaint
Mr K complains that Aviva UK Digital Limited trading as Quotemehappy.com (Aviva) has 
unfairly increased his premium and charged him fees to amend his motor insurance policy. 
The total increase is £19.99.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well-known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute so instead, Ill focus on the reasons for my decision
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
And having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these 
reasons:
An insurer can decide what premium it charges for a policy and this isnt something 
wed normally interfere with. We will though look to see that the insurer has treated 
the customer fairly.
Aviva has shown evidence that the insurance risk group a car falls into is only one of 
the factors it considers when deciding on the premium it charges for a policy.
Its confirmed the premium Mr K has been charged has been calculated automatically 
on the criteria and is correct.
Im satisfied Mr K hasnt been treated any differently from a consumer in similar 
circumstances.
The £19.99 Mr K has been charged is the increased premium charged on a pro-rata 
basis - and Aviva has shared the calculation to demonstrate this - not an 
administration fee.
Im therefore satisfied Aviva hasnt acted unfairly.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2021.
