K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains about the way in which  National Westminster Bank Plc provides text alerts  
about the balance on his account.
background
Mr H said that hed signed up for high balance text alerts with NatWest. And he said that 
NatWests website says that he could expect  to receive those texts early in the morning, a 
little after 8am during  the week and 10am on weekends. But he said that they were arriving  
at all times of the day, and that was making it difficult for him to manage  his finances. 
Mr H showed us replies to his complaints  about this, from NatWest.  He said that NatWest  
had told him the texts  were being  despatched early in the morning, and if they werent 
arriving promptly he should take that up with his network provider. He said hed wasted time 
doing that, but that wasnt the problem.
NatWest said that the text alerts service it provides is an additional service, it isnt covered  
by the terms and conditions of the account. Its not a contractual service.  NatWest said that it 
specifically states  that it cant guarantee the service, and customers  shouldnt  rely on that 
alone. NatWest  told us that Mr H is registered for telephone  banking  and for mobile banking, 
and it said that was a better way for Mr H to keep on top of his finances. 
NatWest knew Mr H would like the alerts  service to work differently, but it said it didnt think  it 
had given assurances to him that this would happen. It did think itd given him enough 
information to manage  his expectations. It didnt think  it should  have to pay him 
compensation.
Our investigator didnt  uphold this complaint. She said that some of the delays  may be 
outside of NatWests control.  And the wording on the website didnt guarantee that Mr H 
would receive the alerts  at any particular time. In fact, NatWest  says that it cant guarantee 
the text alerts will be received at all. Our investigator said that NatWest  had passed  Mr H's 
feedback to the relevant  team. Our service wouldnt tell NatWest  to change its website. 
Our investigator said that she appreciated Mr H had said he found it more difficult to manage 
his finances because he couldnt rely on the alerts, but she said that the website says that he 
shouldnt rely on the alerts to do this. She said that he could use the mobile app or online 
banking to help him. She also said that Mr H hadnt suggested hed suffered financially 
because of late text alerts.  
Our investigator didnt  think she could  reasonably  ask NatWest  to do anything  further.
Mr H didnt agree with that. He said that he knows that NatWest sometimes doesnt sent 
texts out until 9pm.  He thought the website should be corrected,  as its clearly wrong. Mr H 
wanted an ombudsman  to consider his complaint, so it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive reached the same overall conclusion  
as our investigator, and for broadly  the same reasons.
Ref: DRN66770972I know that Mr H feels  very strongly  that NatWest shouldnt be allowed to suggest that hes 
going to receive  his text alerts early  in the morning, when  he sometimes doesnt receive 
them until very late in the day. But I think that the key issue here is that getting  text 
messages early in the morning isnt something that NatWest has promised him is going to 
happen. Its said thats what should happen.  But it actually doesnt promise that Mr H will 
receive these alerts  at all. So I dont think that NatWest has broken a promise to Mr H if its 
sending text messages  later than its website suggests.
Ive thought about whether NatWests  website is misleading, and overall,  I dont think it is. It 
sets out what its going  to try to do. It doesnt  give a commitment that it will always  be able to 
issue texts early, or at all. So, even if the content  of NatWests website was an issue for our 
service, I still dont  think Id be able to tell NatWest to change it. 
Our investigator has suggested  other  ways that Mr H might want  to manage  his finances. I 
realise that Mr H prefers to use the text alerts, but that does  remain an additional service  
from NatWest.  So I dont  think  I can reasonably require NatWest  to change this service for 
Mr H, to amend its website, or to compensate Mr H for the disappointment he feels that this 
service doesnt function more reliably.
I know that Mr H will be disappointed, but I dont think  his complaint should be upheld.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 August 2019.
