Complaint
Mr D complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called Elevate 
Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr D says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep things simple Ill refer mainly to Sunny.
Background
We now know that Mr D took out 8 instalment loans from Sunny between February 2018 and 
November 2018. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Ds borrowing with Sunny, based on the 
information it provided to us:

One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought it should be upheld 
from the point of loan 4 onwards. Sunny doesnt agree with this and so the complaint has 
come to me for an ombudsmans final decision. 
My findingsIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking about Mr Ds 
complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr D could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
Sunny should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr D could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr D. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending history with 
a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the lending relationship, I think the 
initial checks which Sunny most likely carried out would have been quite basic ones. But I 
think they would have been proportionate for loans 1  3 and I think these levels of checks, 
together with the income and expenditure details provided by Mr D, would have made those 
particular loans appear affordable for him. I therefore dont uphold the complaint in respect of 
these loans.
However, I think from the point of loan number 4 onwards in this case, things would have 
looked different and therefore required a more thorough and responsible approach. For loan 4, for example, Sunny ought to have been aware this was Mr Ds fourth such loan in 4 
months and the amount he was asking for was steadily increasing, so he didnt seem to be 
making any inroads into his indebtedness.
Theres no evidence Sunny altered its approach at the point of loan 4 to look more 
thoroughly at Mr Ds financial situation. I think if it had done this, it would have also shown he 
was having trouble managing his money and was probably borrowing to meet normal 
ongoing commitments and those of other borrowing; we know that he was indebted, for 
example, to other short-term lenders at the same time. This information would have been 
easily traceable if more comprehensive financial checks had been carried out by Sunny. 
Given his situation, I think it was irresponsible to lend to Mr D at the point of loan 4 onwards.
In addition to the above, from the point of loan 7 onwards, there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident in my view. Loan 7 immediately followed loan 6 and the 
amount he asked for increased again. So there was an obvious dependency on high-
interest, short-term lending evidenced by this, his seventh loan in around 6 months. 
So Im also upholding Mr Ds complaint in respect of loans 7 and 8 as well. Sunny repeatedly 
lent to Mr D in an unsustainable manner because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr D borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 4 - 8;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges on these from 
the date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4, 5 and 6 from Mr Ds credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 7 and 8 should be completely 
removed from Mr Ds credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given, I partly uphold Mr Ds complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited 
should put things right for Mr D as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision by 9 June 2020.
