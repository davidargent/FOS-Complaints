The complaint
Mr K complains about a decision taken by Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide) to
decline a refund request he made to it.
What happened
On 21 November 2021 Mr K booked airline tickets for himself and two other passengers
(Miss K1 and Miss K2) through a travel company that I will call E. The cost of the booking
was £290.44, and the flights were to be provided by an airline that I will call B.
The outbound flight was scheduled to leave on 18 February 2022 at 16:45 and the return
flight was scheduled to leave on 20 February 2022 at 20:50.
On 22 November 2021 the sum of £290.44 was debited to Mr Ks current account with
Nationwide.
On 25 November 2021 (@17:27) B contacted Miss K1 to say that the return flight scheduled
to depart on 20 February 2022 at 20:50 had been cancelled and that she, Mr K and Miss K2
had been rebooked on a flight departing on 20 February 2022 at 18:30.
On 3 December 2021 E wrote to Mr K to confirm, independently of B, that the return flight
scheduled to depart on 20 February 2022 at 20:50 had been cancelled.
Mr K says following the above he contacted E for a refund, then Nationwide.
On 19 January 2022 Nationwide credited Mr Ks account with £290.44 and raised a first
chargeback with Es bank.
On 1 February 2022 Es bank (on behalf of E) defended Nationwides (first) chargeback.
On 10 February 2022 Nationwide raised a second chargeback with Es bank.
On 17 February 2022 Es bank (on behalf of E) defended Nationwides (second) chargeback.
On 18 February 2022 (@ 10:55) E contacted Mr K to say that it had been advised by B (the
same day @10:53) that the outbound flight scheduled to leave on 18 February 2022 at 16:45
had been cancelled.
On 20 February 2022 (@ 13:03) B contacted Miss K1 say that the return flight scheduled to
depart on 20 February 2022 had been cancelled.
On 21 February 2022 Nationwide wrote to Mr K to say it had been unsuccessful in securing
a refund from E under the Visa chargeback scheme and because of this the £290.44 it had
credited to his account on 19 January 2022 would be (re)debited within 22 days.
Mr K was unhappy with Nationwides decision not to refund him £290.44 so he raised a
complaint with it.
On 8 March 2022 Nationwide wrote to Mr K to say that it wasnt upholding his complaint
about how it had handled his request for a refund of £290.44. It said that it was sorry that he
had been upset by its decision not to refund him the sum of £290.44 but both chargeback
requests it had submitted had been defended by E.
On 15 March 2022 Nationwide (re)debited Mr Ks account with £290.44.
On 15 March 2022 Mr K complained to our service.
On 23 March 2022 Nationwide wrote to Mr K to reiterate what it had said on 8 March 2022.
Mr Ks complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that Nationwide
had done nothing wrong. However, Mr K disagreed and asked that his complaint be
reconsidered, as he is entitled to do, by an ombudsman.
In April 2023 I issued a provisional decision. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that Mr K has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their
entirety. However, I trust that Mr K will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The purpose
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear, or
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
Ive thought very carefully about whether Nationwide dealt with Mr Ks request for a refund
fairly.
Chargeback is a way in which payment settlement disputes are resolved between card
issuers and merchants. They are dealt with under the relevant card scheme rules, in this
case thats Visa. In certain circumstances the process provides a way for Nationwide to ask
for a payment Mr K made to be refunded.
A chargeback doesnt guarantee a refund. The company Mr K paid (E) can put forward a
defence to any chargeback claim. If a chargeback is defended, Nationwide can make a
second presentment for the chargeback, which it has done here (pre-arbitration). If the
chargeback is defended for a second time (as happened here), Nationwide can ask Visa to
intervene and decide the outcome of the payment dispute. This final part is called arbitration.
There is no obligation for Nationwide to raise a chargeback in the first instance if a consumer
asks for one. But I would consider it good practice for a chargeback to be attempted where
the right exists and there is some prospect of success. As Nationwide did attempt the
chargeback initially and made a second presentment through pre-arbitration it seems likely it
thought there was a reasonable prospect of success. For this reason, I think it dealt with
Mr Ks claim fairly up to that point. The issue for me to decide is whether it acted fairly in
choosing not to take the dispute to arbitration.Just like with the initial chargeback, there is no obligation on Nationwide to pursue arbitration
through the chargeback process. Generally, most card issuers dont take a chargeback to
arbitration. Nationwide didnt do so here because it didnt think it had any reasonable
prospect of success. And having considered all the available evidence, I dont think that was
an unreasonable or unfair decision.
But even if I wasnt of this view, I dont think it would be fair or reasonable for me to direct
Nationwide to compensate Mr K. I say this for two reasons.
First its my understanding that since raising his dispute with Nationwide Mr K has been able
to secure a refund of £290.44, so he is no longer standing a financial loss.
Secondly, Im satisfied that Nationwide handled the chargeback fairly, reasonably and in a
timely manner meaning that it wouldnt be appropriate for me to make an award (in favour of
Mr K) for distress and inconvenience (non-financial loss).
Finally, and for the sake of completeness, I would add that Ive seen insufficient evidence to
be able to conclude that Nationwide caused Mr K any financial difficulties or caused his
credit rating to be affected in its handling of his payment dispute.
Nationwide responded to my provisional decision to say it accepted it. Mr K didnt respond to 
my provisional decision by the date I gave.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Nationwide responded to my provisional decision to say it accepted it and Mr K didnt 
respond to it at all I can confirm I see no reason to depart from my provisional findings and I 
now confirm them as final.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 May 2023.
