Our adjudicator upheld Mr Rs complaint and thought the loans from loan 7 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Lending Stream disagreed and so the complaint was passed to 
me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it 
didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate 
checks to make sure Mr R could repay their loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, 
there may come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
Ive considered the pattern of lending up to loan 7 and I think the lending history and pattern 
of lending itself clearly demonstrates that further lending would likely be unsustainable. So I 
think Lending Stream was irresponsible to continue lending after this point.
Ive considered the points Lending Stream made in response to the adjudicators view. It 
said that it did make proper affordability checks, particularly over loans 12 to 15. And it said 
that these should override any problems shown in the pattern of lending. 
These arent new points  theyre factors already taken into account in the adjudicators 
assessments. And they dont demonstrate to me that the lending from September 2018 was 
sustainable.  
And the Financial Ombudsman Service has considered in detail why a lending pattern could 
show that the lending was likely to be unsustainable in the decisions we have published on 
our website. Lending Stream should be aware of these. 
So the points raised by Lending Stream havent changed my decision and Im upholding this 
complaint.
Putting things right
Lending Stream shouldnt have given Mr R loans 7 to 15.
A) Lending Stream should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr R towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything Lending Stream has already refunded.
B) Lending Stream should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Mr R which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr R originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Lending Stream should pay Mr R the total of A plus B.
D) The overall pattern of Mr Rs borrowing for loans 7 to 15 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so Lending Stream should remove these loans entirely from Mr Rs 
credit file. If Lending Stream has sold any of the loans Lending Stream should ask the debt 
purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to deduct tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream should give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax Lending Stream has deducted, 
if they ask for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Rs complaint. 
Gain Credit LLC should put things right as set out above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2020.
