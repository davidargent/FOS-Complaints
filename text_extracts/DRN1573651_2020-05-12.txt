K821x#15Complaint
Mr K says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny)  irresponsibly lent to him.
Background
This complaint is about 1 running credit facility (RCF) and 33 instalment loans Sunny 
provided Mr K between November 2014  and July 2018. A summary  of Mr Ks borrowing, 
based on the information provided to us by Sunny, can be found in the appendix,  at the end 
of this decision.
Our adjudicator noticed there  was a gap in lending  of around 11 months between loans 22 
and 23. So she considered that Mr K had two chains of lending.  For the first chain of lending 
she didnt think that loan 5 shouldve been  given because a proportionate check wouldve 
likely shown  Sunny  that Mr K was gambling  and had a number of outstanding short  term 
loans. She also thought,  by the time of loan 6, the pattern  of lending suggested these loans 
were no longer sustainable.  So she thought shouldnt have given Mr K loans 5  22. 
For the second chain, the adjudicator again  thought proportionate checks  wouldve likely 
shown Sunny that Mr K was still gambling a significant portion of his income  as well as 
having a significant number of outstanding  short term loans. So overall, the adjudicator  
upheld loans  5  34. 
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicator, and made a number of points including;
Based  on the checks Sunny carried out, Mr K had sufficient disposable income  to be 
able to repay these  loans;
Mr K didnt  contact Sunny to inform it of any financial difficulties and
Mr K was never in arrears with any of this lending.  
But Sunny did make an offer to settle  the complaint  it agreed to upheld  loans 14  21. And 
this offer was in line with the adjudicators recommendation for these loans. This offer was 
put to Mr K but he didnt accept it. 
As no agreement could be reached, the case has been passed to me for a final decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr K could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN15736512the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr K could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint.
To start with, it seems that Mr K has accepted our adjudicators findings  so I think this 
means I no longer  need to make  a decision about loans 1  4. But I have kept these loans in 
mind when thinking about Mr Ks lending relationship with Sunny. 
Equally, Ive kept in mind that Sunny has accepted  that something may have gone wrong 
when loans 14  21 was granted.  
By loan 5 I think Sunnys checks needed  to go further and it could no longer rely on the 
information Mr K was providing.  By then,  it needed  to gain a full and complete picture of
Mr Ks financial position.  So like our adjudicator  explained, by loan 5, proportionate checks 
would most  likely have  shown that;
Mr K was already indebted  to five short term lenders; in addition to this Mr K was a 
regular user of gambling and betting websites. In these circumstances, there was a 
significant risk that Mr K wouldnt have been able to repay this loan without undue 
difficulty or without  borrowing  further.  
I dont think that Sunny  could reasonably have believed that Mr K would  be able to 
make the payments for this loan, over the term bearing in mind  what  a proportionate  
check wouldve likely shown. So it was likely that Mr K would have to return  to Sunny 
to borrow again.  So I dont think this loan shouldve been provided. 
Ref: DRN15736513Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr K, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans,  in this chain of lending. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ks case, I think, like the adjudicator,  that this point 
was reached by loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr K was not managing  to repay  their 
loans sustainably. Mr K had taken out six loans within eight months and Mr K had 
been indebted to Sunny for the entire time.  Loan  6 was also taken out the day after 
loan 5 was repaid,  and around a week after loan 4 had been  repaid. So Sunny ought  
to have realised it was more likely than not Mr K was having to borrow  further to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ks 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ks first instalment  loan was for £150  and loan 6 was for £200. At this point Sunny 
ought to have known that Mr K was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall 
in his income but to meet an ongoing  need.  
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr K was normally provided with a new loan within days  of 
settling a previous  one. 
Mr K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 22 was 
taken out 25 months after Mr Ks first. And it was his largest instalment loan to date. 
Mr K had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect; service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr K lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ks indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr K borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ks ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him/her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Ks complaint about  loans 5  22. 
As Ive explained above, after loan 22 there  was a gap of almost  a year before loan 23 was 
provided. So like our adjudicator, I agree that the borrowing  from loan 23 this was a new 
chain of lending.  And, like the adjudicator  I think Sunny  needed to take due regard of the fact 
that Mr Ks previous  lending relationship had lasted nearly two years.   
So a proportionate  check, when  Mr K applied for loan 23 wouldve likely shown that Mr Ks 
financial position hadnt significantly changed  since loan 5. Mr K was using a number of 
other short term lenders.  In addition to this Mr K was still using gambling and betting 
websites. In these  circumstances, there was a significant risk that Mr K wouldnt have been 
able to repay this loan or any future loans without undue difficulty or without borrowing 
further.
Ref: DRN15736514So overall, based on what proportionate  checks wouldve likely shown Sunny, I dont think it 
should have approved loans 5  34. And Ive set out below what Sunny needs to do to put 
things right. 
Putting things  right  what  Sunny needs to do
In addition to what Sunny has agreed  to do, it should;
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans 5 - 34;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 and loans 23 - 34 from Mr Ks credit 
file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 22 should be removed from 
Mr Ks credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr K a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Ks complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  pay Mr K compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 June  2020.
