The complaint
Mr W says Gain Credit LLC trading as Drafty lent to him irresponsibly. He says his financial 
situation was poor at the time of sale and a reasonable credit check wouldve shown this. He 
says if Drafty had made better checks then it wouldnt have lent to him.  
What happened
This complaint is about one running credit account Drafty provided to Mr W in May 2017. 
Mr W made 11 withdrawals when this account was running. Ive detailed these in the table 
below.

On 24 October 2017 Mr W informed Drafty that he was having problems making the loan 
repayments and he had been in contact with a debt management provider.
According to Draftys records Mr W was charged interest in October 2017 and 
November 2017. Its not clear when (or if) the debt was fully repaid
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She didnt think Drafty was wrong to approve 
the arrangement and any of the subsequent withdrawals. But she thought that it shouldnt 
have continued to charge interest after the time Mr W told it that he was entering into a debt 
management plan. 
Drafty didnt respond or provide any further comment about the adjudicators opinion. And 
Mr W didnt disagree with it. But as no agreement has been reached the complaint has been 
passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Drafty needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W could 
repay what he borrowed in a reasonable period of time. And it had a responsibility to treat Mr 
W fairly and reasonably throughout the term of the agreement. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Ws 
complaint in part and Ive explained why below.
Mr W didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion that Drafty was right to approve the 
lending and the drawdowns. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement 
about this aspect of Mr Ws complaint. And I agree that Drafty wasnt wrong to approve any 
of the lending. I wont consider this aspect of Mr Ws complaint further.  
But as our adjudicator noted, Mr W did inform Drafty that he was in financial difficulty. He 
said he was seeking advice about his debt problems and he requested that Drafty stop 
charging interest on his loans. Drafty didnt do this. 
Drafty had a responsibility to treat Mr W fairly and with forbearance when it became aware of 
his financial problems. And part of this shouldve been, in this case, ceasing to charge 
interest on his outstanding debts while he sought debt management advice. So I agree that 
Drafty shouldve stopped charging Mr W interest after 24 October 2017 and Im upholding 
his complaint on this basis. 
Putting things right
Drafty shouldnt have charged interest on Mr Ws account after 24 October 2017.
If Drafty has sold the outstanding debts Drafty should buy these back if it is able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If Drafty is not able to buy the debts back then it should liaise 
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the account after 24 October 2017.
B) Treat all payments Mr W has made towards his account after 24 October 2017 as though 
they had been repayments of outstanding balance.
C) If at any point Mr W would have been in credit on his account after considering the above, 
Drafty will need to refund any overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on these 
payments, from the date they would have arisen, to the date the refund is made.
D) If there is an outstanding principal balance, then Drafty can use any refunds calculated as 
part of C to repay this. If a balance still remains after this then Drafty should try to agree an 
affordable repayment plan with Mr W. If Drafty has previously written-off any principal, then 
Drafty shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up only of principal Drafty has already 
written-off.
E) Drafty should remove any adverse payment information recorded on Mr Ws credit file  
after 24 October 2017.*HM Revenue & Customs requires Drafty to deduct tax from this interest. Drafty should give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax Draftyve deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Gain Credit LLC should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 August 2020.
