Loan one was a running credit facility (RCF) and this is different to the instalment loans that 
Mr T took afterwards. The RCF allows a consumer  to either  request funds up to their agreed  
credit limit in one go or take multiple  drawdowns up to their limit. Each drawdown could be 
repaid via five monthly instalments. 
Sunny initially said that it hadnt made  an error by providing Mr T with his loans, unhappy 
with this response, he brought his complaint to us. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mr Ts complaint and he thought  Sunny shouldve  been 
monitoring Mr Ts RCF and had it done  so, it wouldve seen that in the first two months  of 
having the facility he made 11 drawdowns.  The adjudicator concluded  that this was a clear 
sign that Mr T wasnt using the facility  as planned  and was showing problems managing  his 
money, so he upheld the complaint about the RCF from 28 May 2014.  The adjudicator also 
thought all the other loans shouldnt have been  given  either  and that from loan six a pattern 
of lending had developed  which shouldve stopped Sunny providing  any further loans.  
Mr T appears to have agreed with the adjudicators  recommendation.
Sunny disagreed with our adjudicators opinion. It said that although  Mr T took a number of 
drawdowns, he wasnt close to his limit and had borrowed fairly small amounts. 
Ref: DRN23465612However, Sunny accepted that something  may have gone  wrong  when it provided  loans  2  
18, so it agreed  to refund these with 8% simple  interest. It also agreed to update the credit 
file in line with the adjudicators recommendation.  But, Mr T appears to have  rejected this 
offer. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
I would start by saying  that because Sunny has accepted that loans 2  18 shouldnt have 
been given, and has agreed with the adjudicators recommendation regarding  how things 
should be put right these  loans are no longer in dispute. So instead, this decision will focus 
on whether Sunny did anything wrong  when  it granted the RCF. 
I think it would be helpful for me to start by explaining that Sunny gave Mr T this facility when 
it was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). And the relevant regulatory 
rules in place at the time were  set out in the Consumer Credit  Sourcebook  (CONC)  section 
of the FCA Handbook of rules and guidance.
Section 5.2.1(2) of CONC set out what a lender needed to do before agreeing to give a 
consumer a loan of this type.  And it says a firm had to consider the potential for the 
commitments under  the regulated credit agreement to adversely impact the customers 
financial situation  as well as the ability of the customer  to make repayments  as they fall due 
over the life of the regulated credit agreement.
CONC 5.2 also includes some guidance  on the sorts  of things a lender  needs to bear in 
mind when considering  its obligations  under CONC 5.2.1.  Section 5.2.4(2) says a firm 
should consider  what  is appropriate in any particular circumstances dependent on, for 
example, the type and amount of credit  being  sought and the potential  risks to the customer.  
The risk of credit not being sustainable directly  relates to the amount of credit  granted and 
the total charge for credit relative to the customers financial  situation.
And CONC 5.3 contains further guidance on what  a lender should bear in mind when 
thinking about affordability. CONC 5.3.1(1) says In making the creditworthiness assessment 
or the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R (1), a firm should  take into account more than 
assessing the customers ability to repay the credit..
CONC 5.3.1(2) then says The creditworthiness assessment and the assessment required 
by CONC 5.2.2R (1) should include the firm taking reasonable steps to assess  the 
customers ability to meet repayments under  a regulated credit  agreement in a sustainable 
manner without the customer incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant 
adverse consequences..
But to be clear, Mr T wasnt  given a payday loan where he had to repay  all of what he 
borrowed plus the interest due when he next got paid. He was given a facility where there  
was an expectation  that hed repay what he borrowed plus the interest due within  a period of 
five months. So overall, I think that this means  the checks Sunny carried  out had to provide  
Ref: DRN23465613enough information for it to be able to understand whether  Mr T would likely be able to 
service and then repay this facility within a reasonable  period  of time.
As Ive said,  Mr T was granted  a running credit  facility  with a £150  limit. According  to the 
credit agreement, had he drawn down the full amount on the first day of having the facility, 
his largest contractual repayment would  be £13.81  per week.
Before granting the facility  Sunny  asked  Mr T about his monthly income, and it also 
completed a credit check. Having considered all the information Sunny gathered about 
Mr Ts circumstances,  it could see that Mr T would likely be able to afford  the repayments he 
was committed to making. I also think, given this was the start of the lending relationship, it 
was not unreasonable for Sunny to have relied on the information it was provided. 
However, that doesnt mean that Sunny hasnt done  anything wrong.  There  was also an 
expectation that Sunny would review and monitor how Mr T used the facility. CONC 6.7.2 
says A firm must monitor a customers repayment record  and take appropriate action where  
there are signs of actual  or possible repayment  difficulties. So it wasnt enough for Sunny to 
just carry out an assessment before  the facility was approved, it needed to continue to 
monitor how Mr T used  the facility and then step in and provide help when or if it could see 
Mr T was or was likely having financial difficulties.   
Our adjudicator thought Sunny shouldve seen this by the time Mr T took his drawdown on 
28 May 2014, as his borrowing history  showed  he was potentially  reliant  on the facility.
I can see Mr T initially requested one drawdown  of £150  so taking him to his limit. And 
Mr T appears to have repaid this drawdown  in full (with interest)  nine days later. Then two 
days after the repayment Mr T again returned and borrowed another  £150.
 
At the end of April 2014 Mr B made a payment of £43.25 (this included £36 of principal and 
£7.25 of interest).  Mr T then requested, three  days later to drawdown another  £36  so 
taking him back up to his credit limit. Given,  the small amount  Mr T was requesting this may 
have suggested  that he was borrowing all available credit because  the payment of £36 had 
left a hole in his finances. I think this is something  which should  have  put Sunny on notice, 
but I dont think  this should have  warranted further  action  at this stage because  Mr M had 
only had the account for a matter of weeks. 
What followed from the end of April was a familiar pattern. A payment would be made by 
Mr T he would then return to borrow a similar amount  of principal that had just been repaid. 
The gap between  the payment and the new drawn  down was anything from a couple of days  
to a matter of hours. 
When Mr T requested further  funds  on 28 May 2014  after making his repayments  on
27 May 2014, I think Sunny should have  halted any further lending.  At this point Mr T had 
taken 11 drawdowns  in a little over six weeks. But more  importantly,  the pattern that I think 
had been clearly established  by this point, is that Mr T was having  to return fairly quickly for 
new lending.  The reason he was likely having to do this was because the repayment was 
leaving a hole in his finances  and he was only borrowing what  he had available to him, which  
is why we see drawdowns for sums  like £34.64. And in my view, Mr T was not using the 
facility as Sunny had expected and this form or lending was no longer sustainable.
Ref: DRN23465614So Im upholding  Mr Ts complaint about the RCF from 28 May 2014  and Sunny  should put 
things right as detailed below.
putting things right  what I currently  think Sunny  needs to do
As Ive mentioned  above, Sunny has already accepted that something  went wrong when it 
provided Mr T with his instalment loans. And Ive kept that in mind  when thinking about 
Sunny needs  to do to put things right.  
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on drawdowns on the running credit  facility 
from 28 May 2014 and it should also refund the interest fees and charges on loans 2 
- 18;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  recording  about the running credit facility  after 28 
May 2014 as well as removing  negative information about loans 2 - 5 from Mr Ts 
credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 - 18 should be removed from 
Mr Ts credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ts complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr T as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 April 2020.
