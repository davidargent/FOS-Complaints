The complaint
Ms C complains that Bank of Scotland plc, trading as Halifax, wont refund to her the money 
that shes claimed for some drain services. 
What happened
Ms C contacted a supplier for it to provide some drain services and it gave her information 
about its charges. It went to her home in February 2020 to provide the drain services and 
she was charged £806.04 which she paid using her Halifax credit card.
She says that she thought that the charge was too high so she contacted other providers 
which quoted lower amounts. She complained to the supplier that shed been misled into 
paying for unnecessary services, incorrectly quoted a half hourly rate, the work took longer 
than necessary and she was overcharged by about £600 as it should have cost £214.80. 
She claimed a refund from Halifax under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 but it 
said that the other providers hadnt made a full assessment before the works were 
completed so it was unable to determine an accurate quote from them. It said that it was 
unable to refund to Ms C the difference between the price that she believed she should have 
paid and the price she did pay.
Ms C wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service but our investigator 
didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He said that he was unable to say 
that a breach of contract or misrepresentation had occurred. He said that without an 
independent opinion prior to the work being carried out, he couldnt conclude that the 
supplier took an unreasonable amount of time or that it unfairly used equipment and it 
appeared that Ms C had agreed to all of the work that took place.
Ms C has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that the 
other providers all said that the use of a cutter wasnt necessary for a blocked drain (only if 
large tree roots were in the way) and that they wouldnt make an additional charge for fixing 
the nozzle on the end of the jet hose. Shes says that shes complained to her local trading 
standards office about the supplier and has provided a letter from it saying that it has 
advised the supplier about its business practices and given it a formal warning. Shes also 
provided evidence showing the low customer satisfaction rates for the supplier.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Ms Cs complaint about Halifax, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that Halifaxs 
response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of Ms Cs claim under section 75 as only a court would be 
able to do that;
Ms C contacted the supplier about the services that she required and discussed the 
rates that shed be charged  she clearly understood from that discussion that the 
rates quoted included VAT but VAT was added to those rates on the invoice that she 
paid  Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show Ms C was given 
incorrect information about the suppliers rates when she contacted the supplier or 
that it incorrectly added VAT on the invoice;
Ms C has contacted other providers about the work but none of them inspected 
Ms Cs drains or quoted for the actual work that would be required and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it wasnt necessary or 
appropriate for the supplier to use a cutter or that the supplier has charged her for 
unnecessary or inappropriate services, equipment and materials;
Ms C has provided a letter from her local trading standards office about the supplier 
and evidence showing the low customer satisfaction rates for the supplier  but I 
dont consider that to be enough to show that the supplier breached its contract with 
Ms C or that it made a misrepresentation to her which induced her to enter into the 
contract for the drain services;
My C clearly feels very strongly that shes paid the supplier more than she should 
have been charged for the drain services but the invoice showed the suppliers 
charge for the services and she paid it at that time using her Halifax credit card  if 
she didnt agree with the amount that she was being charged I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect her to have done more to challenge the amount of the 
invoice at that time;
I sympathise with Ms C for the upset and frustration that she feels but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and I consider that Halifaxs response 
to her claim has been fair and reasonable in the circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Halifax to refund to Ms C 
the difference between the amount that she paid for the drain services and the 
amount that she says that she should have been charged, to pay her any other 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Cs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 March 2021.
