The complaint
Ms T complains that PSA Finance UK Limited didnt make her aware of a parking fine and 
then collected an increased amount from her account.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Ms T under a hire agreement with PSA Finance that she 
signed in May 2017;
PSA Finance received a penalty charge notice in May 2019 for a £60 parking fine for 
an offence that happened in April 2019 and it says that it sent Ms T a letter about the 
notice two days later  but it hasnt been able to provide a copy of the letter that it 
sent to her;
PSA was contacted about the notice which remained unpaid in September 2019 so 
had increased to £140 and it collected that amount and a £25 administration charge 
from Ms Ts account in October 2019;
Ms T says that she didnt receive the notice of the fine that PSA Finance says was 
sent to her in May 2019 and that she wouldve paid the £60 fine if shed received 
notice of it  she received notice of another parking fine in July 2019 and promptly 
paid that fine;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that Ms T was liable to pay the parking fine but 
I consider that it was reasonable to expect that PSA Finance would promptly notify 
her of the fine so that she should could deal with it as she saw appropriate;
Im not persuaded that PSA Finance has provided enough evidence to show that it 
properly notified Ms T of the penalty charge notice in May 2019 and I consider it to be 
more likely than not that Ms T wouldve paid the fine if shed received the notice at 
that time;
PSA Finance then paid the increased fine of £140 and collected that amount and an 
administration charge of £25 from Ms Ts account without prior notice to her  I 
consider that it would be fair and reasonable to expect Ms T to have been given 
notice before those amounts were collected from her account; and
I consider that PSA Finances failure to properly notify Ms T about the penalty charge 
notice has prevented her from paying the £60 parking fine so I find that it would be 
fair and reasonable in these circumstances for it to refund to Ms T the additional £80 
that was collected from her account and the £25 administration charge.
Putting things right
I find that PSA Finance should refund a total of £105 to Ms Ts account to reimburse her for 
the additional £80 that was collected from her and the £25 administration charge  but Im 
not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to take any other action 
in respsosne to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Ms T s complaint and I order PSA Finance UK Limited to refund 
a total of £105 to Ms Ts account.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms T to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2020.
