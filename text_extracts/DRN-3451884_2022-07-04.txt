The complaint
Mr T complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr T and his wife had a timeshare and they entered into a purchase agreement with a 
timeshare company in September 2010 to increase their timeshare. Mr T also entered into a 
credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for credit with a six month buy now  
pay later offer which he used to make the payment due under the purchase agreement. 
Mr Ts representative made a claim to Barclays Partner Finance under sections 75 and 140A 
of the Consumer Credit Act in October 2019 that the timeshare that Mr T and his wife had 
bought in September 2010 had been misrepresented to them and that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr T and Barclays Partner Finance.
Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to that claim by January 
2020 so a complaint was made to this service. Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ts 
complaint should be upheld. He said that Mr Ts claim was more than likely time-barred 
under the Limitation Act 1980 so he thought that Barclays Partner Finances decision not to 
look into his claim under sections 75 and 140A was fair.
Mr Ts representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It said that a full substantive response would follow when it had received 
instructions from Mr T but four months have passed since then and no further information 
has been received.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that this complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ts complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance hasnt considered his Consumer 
Credit Act claims and, as those claims were made in October 2019 and a complaint 
was made to this service in January 2020, I consider that Mr Ts complaint was 
referred to this service within six years of the event that hes complained about  but I 
need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to his claims;
Mr Ts claims are under sections 75 and 140A but in this decision Im not determining 
the outcome of those claims as only a court would be able to do that - Im considering 
whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ts claim under section 75 is that the timeshare that he and his wife bought in 
September 2010 was misrepresented to them and that they wouldnt have bought it 
in if it hadnt been misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr T could have made a claim to the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the timeshare soon after they entered into the purchase agreement in 
September 2010 as that was when they entered into an agreement based on the 
alleged misrepresentations of the timeshare company and suffered a loss as Mr T 
entered into the credit agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for credit that he 
used to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that Mr Ts cause of action accrued at about that time, so he would have 
had six years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or 
Barclays Partner Finance  but he didnt make a claim against Barclays Partner 
Finance until October 2019, more than nine years later, which was outside of the 
time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that any such claim is time-
barred under the Limitation Act;
Mr Ts representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr T and 
Barclays Partner Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Mr T entered into the credit card agreement in September 2010 and Barclays Partner 
Finance says that the credit was settled in March 2011 so I consider that Mr T would 
have needed to make a claim against Barclays Partner Finance within six years of 
March 2011  but he didnt make a claim to it until October 2019, more than eight 
years later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I 
consider that any such claim is also time-barred under the Limitation Act;
Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to Mr Ts claims by 
January 2020 so a complaint was made to this service  I consider that it should 
have assessed Mr Ts claims under sections 75 and 140A but it didnt do that so I cant say that it acted fairly and reasonably in response to his claims  but I consider 
that it wouldnt have upheld the claims if it had properly considered them as it would 
have said that the claims werent made within the periods set out in the Limitation 
Act; and 
I sympathise with Mr T for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
timeshare but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for 
me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr T any of the credit that he 
used to pay for the timeshare, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 August 2022.
