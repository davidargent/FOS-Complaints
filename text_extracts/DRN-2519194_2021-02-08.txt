The complaint
Mr A complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, trading as PayPal (PayPal) charged 
him for a return and wouldnt pay for repairs.
What happened
In December 2019, Mr A sold a laptop and got payment through PayPal. The seller said 
there was a fault with it and Mr A agreed to accept its return. On 24 January 2020, PayPal 
refunded the money to Mr A. A case was opened. On 21 February 2020, they said they 
found in his favour. On 24 February 2020, they said it has been decided in the buyers 
favour. His PayPal account was debited with £326. Debt collectors were instructed. When it 
was received back, Mr A found out that it was locked with the buyers username and 
password. The seller wouldnt give these to Mr A. He got a quote of £300 to put this right. Mr 
A appealed the decision. PayPal wouldnt change its decision.
Mr A complained. He said that PayPal told him they changed their decision because they 
said he hadnt replied to emails requesting information from him  he says he didnt get 
these. They then changed their reasons to say the information provided was insufficient. 
Their emails in February 2020 didnt deal with his requests or reply to his questions. He 
asked that PayPal refund to him the money for the laptop and pay the repair cost of £300. 
He was getting hassle from debt collectors, including calls when he was on holiday.
PayPal replied. They said that the password could be reset by Mr A and gave him 
instructions what to do. Mr A said the instructions didnt work. PayPal said their terms of use 
make it clear that sellers accept the risk of reversals of funds.
Mr A brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator looked at what had happened.  
He said that PayPals terms and conditions said that sellers were at risk of being charged for 
returns. Mr A shouldve been aware of this. And therefore, PayPal couldnt be responsible for 
the repair either. The instruction of debt collectors was reasonable  as Mr A owed PayPal 
the money and no payments had been received. He couldnt say it was their intention to 
contact Mr A on holiday. The service provided by PayPal couldve been better  they told Mr 
A that the dispute was found in his favour, then told him differently three days later. PayPals 
response to Mr As appeal and emails in February 2020 didnt answer his questions. He 
recommended that compensation of £75 be paid for the poor service given.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see where Mr A is coming from. He sold a laptop to a buyer and took payment through 
PayPal. It was said to be faulty, so he agreed that it was returned. PayPal refunded him but 
when they looked at the case they found against him and debited his PayPal account with 
the selling price of £326  after telling him the case was closed in his favour. To add to this, 
the laptop had had its password and username changed by the buyer who wouldnt give 
them to him. So, the laptop couldnt be used. The cost of putting this right was £300. PayPal 
passed the debt of £326 to debt collectors who hassled him for payment. Mr As tried to 
argue his case with PayPal, who didnt reply to his points.
The issue here comes down to PayPals terms and conditions. Mr A has said that they are 
weighted in favour of the buyer. But I cant tell PayPal what their terms and conditions should 
be - my role is to decide whether they applied them fairly. They do say that PayPal can claim 
back money if the buyer makes a claim against Mr A  they say: A reversal (of a payment) 
can happen when:
We reimburse the payer in respect of a PayPal Buyer Protection claim the payer 
made against you.
We compensate the payer or the payer's funding source provider (or both) 
because we receive a claim from the payer or their funding source provider for the 
payment amount under the reversal process used by that funding source provider.
So  PayPal could debit Mr As account because there had been a successful claim.
PayPals buyer protection says: When you buy something from a seller who accepts 
PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection. When 
applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase 
price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any. PayPal determines, in 
its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection. PayPal's 
original determination is considered final PayPal Buyer Protection may apply when 
you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:
You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an Item Not Received 
claim), or
You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a 
Significantly Not as Described claim).
So  PayPal could decide the case and refund the buyer if it wanted to. And refund the 
money to them.
Also, sellers (like Mr A) are advised to read our provisions on Buyer Protection 
Policy and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries 
other than your own.  And, If you lose a claim under PayPal Buyer Protection in any 
country:
You must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost. 
In some cases you may not receive the item back. 
So  unfortunately for Mr A, PayPal could decide to refund the buyer of the laptop and debit 
his account with the money hed received for it. The terms and conditions dont mention cost 
of repairs. I can see that Mr A hasnt provided evidence of the cost of the repairs  but this 
isnt relevant anyway as they decided that the refund for the laptop should be made. 
It was unfortunate that Mr A was hassled by debt collectors  but he did owe PayPal the 
money and they were entitled to ask for it back. I appreciate they called him on holiday  but 
they werent to know that.
The service from PayPal was poor. They changed their decision on the return  having told 
Mr A that theyd decided in his favour. And when Mr A emailed them several times about his 
case - they didnt reply to his points and questions  and sent him standard email replies 
which just referred to its user agreement. So, Mr A was left feeling frustrated and not listened to  I can see how difficult this was for Mr A. But to be fair, PayPal have admitted this and 
offered Mr A compensation of £75. This is in line with the sort of award wed expect to see 
for what happened.
I can see how frustrating and annoying this has been for Mr A. But, PayPal have acted in 
line with their terms and conditions and so could return the money to the buyer. Therefore, it 
didnt need to pay for the repairs either. So, while I can appreciate that Mr A will find this 
disappointing, I wont be asking them to do anymore here. 
Putting things right
 I cant see that the compensation of £75 has been paid to Mr A, so it he wishes to accept 
this, he should contact PayPal to arrange this.
My final decision
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, trading as PayPal must pay Mr A compensation of £75.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2021.
