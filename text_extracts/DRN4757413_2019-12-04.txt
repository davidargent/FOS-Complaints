Miss K complains  that Provident Personal Credit Limited (trading as Satsuma) did not 
complete enough  checks  before deciding to lend to her.
background
Satsuma said Miss K had 9 loans between October  2014 and March 2018 as follows:

* Maximum  monthly  repayment for all overlapping loans
Miss K says she was using one short-term loan to repay another. She says that if Satsuma  
had asked for further information it would have found that she was in financial difficulties.
Satsuma says it asked  Miss K for information  about her income and expenses at the time of 
each loan application and found  she declared  sufficient disposable income to afford the 
repayments. It adds  that it also checked  Miss Ks credit file and increased her declared 
expenditure each  time, based  upon  what it saw on her credit  record.  But, it says, this still left 
Miss K with enough  money to make the repayments.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld in part. She said Miss Ks 
pattern of borrowing itself should have indicated the repayments may not be sustainable by 
loan 6. She recommended Satsuma should  refund  interest  and charges on loans 6 to 9 (plus 
8% statutory interest) and that it should  remove those loans from Miss Ks credit file.
Satsuma responded  to say, in summary, that it performed individual checks  on every  loan 
application made and did not agree that the number of loans alone  was sufficient grounds to 
uphold Miss Ks complaint.
Ref: DRN47574132my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Miss K and to Satsuma on 30 October 2019. I summarise 
my findings  here:
As a result  of further investigation, I found Miss K had two additional loans from 
Satsuma, prior to loan 1, that hadnt  previously been considered:
Loan Date Amount Term Due*Monthly 
RepaymentRepaid
A 6 Apr 2014 £150 13w 11 Jul 2014 £69.988 Jul 2014
1 late payment
B 8 Jul 2014 £250 13w 10 Oct 2014 £116.6515 Oct 2014
3 late payments
I considered Satsumas checks went far enough  for loans A and B and there  was 
nothing in the available information that suggested  the loans were  unaffordable;
By the time Miss K applied for loan 1, she was already showing signs that she was 
struggling to manage her money so I thought  Satsuma should have done better 
checks before agreeing to lend to her again.  Had it done so, it was likely to have 
found that she had outstanding balances with at least three other short-term lenders, 
so I didnt consider  it was responsible for Satsuma to have approve loans 1 or 2;
I considered that by the time Miss K applied for loan 3, Satsuma should  reasonably  
have seen that further lending was unsustainable:
oShed  been  borrowing from Satsuma almost  continuously for over 19 months 
and the issues  with the other  outstanding short-term loans had still not been 
resolved;
oFrom  loan 3 onwards  Miss K was provided with a new loan within  days/weeks  
of settling a previous  one. So Satsuma ought  to have  realised  it was more 
likely than not Miss K was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  
her previous loan was leaving  in her finances  and that Miss Ks indebtedness  
was increasing unsustainably;
oMiss K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Satsuma. 
Loan 9 was taken out almost four years after Miss Ks first. And it was for a 
significantly higher  amount.
The loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Miss Ks indebtedness  by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time;
The sheer  number of loans was likely  to have had negative  implications on Miss Ks 
ability to access  mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market for such high-cost 
loans.
So my provisional decision was to uphold the complaint about loans 1 to 9.
Both Satsuma and Miss K accepted my provisional decision.
Ref: DRN47574133my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both parties accepted my provisional  decision,  I see no reason to depart from it.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold Miss Ks complaint. Provident Personal  Credit Limited (trading 
as Satsuma) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Miss K paid on loans 1 to 9;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write off any unpaid interest and charges on loan 9, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Miss K;
Remove any negative information  about  loans 1 and 2 from Miss Ks credit file;
The number  of loans taken from loan 3 onwards  means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries  about loans  3 to 9 should be removed from Miss Ks 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Satsuma  to take off tax from this interest. Satsuma  must  
give Miss K a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. If Satsuma 
intends to apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding  capital balance,  it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 January 2020.
