The complaint
S complains about TransferWise Ltds decision to close their account and the time it took for 
them to receive their money. S says they had to instruct a law firm due to the disruption 
caused and would like TransferWise to pay the legal costs.
What happened
S held an account with TransferWise.
In April 2020, TransferWise carried out a review on S account and decided to end the 
relationship. TransferWise held around â‚¬345,000.00 of S money while they finalised their 
review.
S complained. TransferWise responded and let S know that they closed the account 
because of concerns with payment activities within the account. So, they didnt uphold S 
complaint. The directors of S personal accounts were also affected. 
Later in April 2020, TransferWise attempted to refund S with the money but couldnt because 
of an issue with the account details. S gave TransferWise new account details and the 
money was refunded successfully in May 2020.
The investigator who reviewed the complaint didnt think TransferWise did anything wrong in 
closing S account. He said the terms and conditions of the account allowed TransferWise to 
take the action they did. And therefore, he didnt think TransferWise should pay S legal fees 
or do anything differently.
S disagreed. In summary they said this situation was extremely disruptive and harming for a 
small company, so they had to appoint a law firm to deal with it on their behalf which is why 
the fees should be repaid. And they said that S wasnt involved with any wrongdoings and 
that every movement of funds can be supported by regular invoices. 
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint. I know this will come as a disappointment 
to S and I appreciate how difficult this situation must have been for them, but Ive explained 
my reasons below. Its worth noting my decision focuses only on S account  and not the 
personal accounts of the directors.
TransferWise are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal 
and regulatory obligations. Based on what Ive seen, Im satisfied TransferWise were acting 
in line with these obligations when reviewing, blocking and subsequently closing S account.
TransferWise are required to regularly review the relationships they hold with their 
customers and its often appropriate for certain transactions to be reviewed. In S case, 
TransferWise have explained that they had concerns with regards to payment activities 
within the accounts. And therefore, it would have been necessary for TransferWise to review 
the transactions further. So, Im pleased to see they decided to carry out a review on S 
account. 
I appreciate S doesnt consider they did anything wrong  and theyve explained that they 
can evidence every movement in the account. But that doesnt mean TransferWise werent 
entitled to review it. The Terms of the account, which the investigator helpfully shared with S, 
state that TransferWise can review accounts. And upon finalising that review, TransferWise 
decided to end the banking relationship with S. 
Ive thought carefully about the time it took TransferWise to refund the money to S. S has 
explained the impact this had on them  and I dont doubt it would have been really difficult 
to be without access to their funds. However, there isnt a specific timeframe which wed 
state a business has to carry out their review. Instead, we often review the activity to ensure 
there were no unnecessary delays. Ive considered the actions of TransferWise and I can 
see they inhibited the account on 9 April 2020 and completed the review and attempted to 
refund the money back to S on 20 April 2020. I appreciate S didnt receive the money until 
8 May 2020, but I cant fairly say that was the fault of TransferWise. TransferWise attempted 
to refund on 20 April 2020 and couldnt due to issues with the external bank account of S. 
Once TransferWise received the new account information, and carried out the necessary 
review for that, they processed the refund.
I appreciate S says they had to instruct a law firm due to the disruption TransferWises 
actions had on the company. I recognise how difficult this must have been. But I can only 
uphold the complaint on this part if I think TransferWise acted unfairly. I dont consider they 
did. Ultimately, TransferWise had concerns which they had to investigate as part of their 
legal and regulatory obligations. While they carried out their review, they suspended the 
account, and the money in it, as they are entitled to do. Once theyd completed their review, 
they decided to end the relationship and refunded the money without any undue delays.
So overall, while I recognise the impact the overall situation had on S, Ive found 
TransferWise were entitled to carry out the review, and there werent any unnecessary 
delays. So, I cant say theyve done anything wrong and I wont be asking them to do 
anything to put things right.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask S to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 May 2021.
