The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) acted unfairly and 
unreasonably in how its dealt with the removal of a charge over his property. He wants 
matters put right.
What happened
Mr C had a property subject to a charge in favour of NatWest. He said that it shouldve been 
removed in 2011 when the loan the charge was securing was paid in full. Mr C contacted 
NatWest and said that he was told that there was no record of the charge. Mr C and his 
family found the documents which showed the loan had been paid in full, but said it took 
NatWest over three months to acknowledge the situation and act. Mr C felt that NatWest had 
been unco-operative and had caused him financial loss as hed borrowed money and said 
hed have to pay early repayment charges due to NatWests actions.
Mr C complained to NatWest. It said it couldnt deal with anyone except Mr C until it received 
written signed authority to do so, but it shouldve told Mr C this earlier. It accepted that it had 
failed to remove the charge when the loan was repaid, and it had put Mr C and his family to 
trouble and upset. NatWest paid a total of £500 compensation for the trouble and upset 
caused by its failings and said it would consider additional costs incurred if evidence was 
sent. It confirmed that it had acted to remove the charge on two occasions, but the first 
application had been lost in the post.
Mr C complained to us. The investigators view was that NatWest wasnt at fault. Given the 
number of years that had passed since the loan was repaid, it was fair and reasonable for 
NatWest to not hold the records as lenders were only required to hold them for up to six 
years. But the investigator noted Mr C supplied the evidence that the loan was repaid, and 
NatWest accepted that the charge shouldnt still be in place, and had applied to the Land 
Registry for its removal twice (as the first application appeared to have been lost). He 
pointed out that NatWest wasnt responsible for the time taken by the Land Registry and had 
checked progress. 
The investigator thought NatWest had done enough to resolve the complaint fairly and 
reasonably, particularly as it had offered a total of £500 compensation. He said Mr C said 
hed borrowed money and suffered a financial loss due to NatWests failings, but no 
evidence had been provided, despite NatWest asking, so it couldnt be awarded.
Mr C disagreed. He didnt say why but did confirm he had no more information to provide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres no dispute that the charge over Mr Cs property shouldve been removed when the 
loan was repaid in 2011. No-one knows why it wasnt and Mr C hasnt explained why he 
didnt know until 2020 that the charge was in still in place.
But given the loan was repaid more than six years ago, I cant say that it was unfair or 
unreasonable for NatWest to no longer hold the records and to need Mr C to show that the 
charge should be removed before it acted. Having looked at the evidence available to me, I 
can see once NatWest received confirmation the loan had been repaid, it acted fairly and 
reasonably in acting to get the charge removed. 
I can see that Mr C and his family explained that they were looking to borrow money, and 
days later NatWest made the application to the Land Registry to remove the charge. It 
wasnt NatWests fault that the postal service failed to deliver, and it couldnt use the online 
service as it wouldve needed to instruct a solicitor to do (causing more delay). NatWest re-
sent the application as soon as it was aware of the problem and I can see from the 
contemporaneous notes that it kept contacting the Land Registry to progress matters. But 
NatWest isnt responsible for the actions of the Land Registry. Overall, I cant say that 
NatWest caused unnecessary delay in removing the charge once evidence of the repayment 
of the loan was provided.
Regarding the financial loss and travel costs Mr C says he suffered, he hasnt provided any 
evidence, despite being requested. I cant award any compensation on that basis.
But I agree Mr C suffered trouble and upset. Again, no evidence of the extra travel costs has 
been provided, but its clear from the contact notes Mr C and his family were upset and 
trying to get matters resolved. NatWest was at fault in the first place by not removing the 
charge in 2011, which led to the upset suffered by Mr C and the efforts made to get it 
removed. Money never truly compensates for trouble and upset, but in the circumstances, I 
think £500 compensation is fair and reasonable for the upset caused by the failure to remove 
the charge in 2011 and not telling Mr C promptly enough about the need to sign 
authorisation for family members to deal with NatWest.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or reject my decision before 
9 March 2021.
