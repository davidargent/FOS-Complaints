One of our adjudicators assessed  Mr Rs complaint. She said that QuidQuid shouldnt  have 
lent to Mr R from and including the fourth deferral of loan one. The adjudicator  set out what  
QuickQuid should  do to put matters  right. 
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator but it offered  to refund interest Mr R paid in 
relation to loan three, with interest. It said that it would deduct the refund from the balance 
owed by Mr R. QuickQuid  also said that it would remove entries about loan three from 
Mr Rs credit file.
Mr R didnt accept QuickQuids offer. As the complaint hasnt been resolved informally,  it has 
been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN17681602QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice, this means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading Irresponsible Lending guidance  defined  
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular, the customer  should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.  QuickQuid has agreed that it should 
have done more before loan three and its offered to refund interest,  with interest,  in relation 
to loan three and remove credit file entries in relation to that loan. So, in this decision,  Im 
focussing on loans  one and two. 
I dont think that QuickQuid was wrong to give Mr R loan one at the outset. Thats because 
given the loan amount, what was apparent about  Mr Rs circumstances at the time and his 
history with the lender at that point, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid  
to ask Mr R for the amount of information needed to show  the lending  was unsustainable. 
There wasnt anything in the information Mr R provided or the information QuickQuid 
shouldve been  aware of at that stage,  which  meant  it wouldve been proportionate to carry 
out further checks.  
Ref: DRN17681603As our adjudicator explained, at the relevant time,  developing good industry practice was 
that lenders should give a maximum of three deferrals. That was because there was a 
recognised link between  deferring repayment  and financial difficulties. 
I dont think that QuickQuid was wrong to give Mr R the first three deferrals. But by the fourth 
deferral, in July 2013, Mr R had shown signs that he was struggling  to repay loan one. In 
those circumstances  I think  there was significant  risk that Mr R wouldnt be able to meet  the 
repayment for loan one and any subsequent  loans.  I dont think  that QuickQuid should have 
given Mr R the fourth and fifth deferral on loan one or loan two. 
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
As Ive said,  QuickQuid has already offered to refund interest, with interest, in relation to loan 
three and to remove all entries  about  loan three from Mr Rs credit file. Im upholding Mr Rs 
complaint about  the fourth and fifth deferral on loan one onwards. QuickQuid should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on the fourth and fifth deferrals  on loan one 
and in relation  to loans two and three;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
write off any unpaid interest and charges on loan three.
Use the refund to reduce the capital owing  on the outstanding  loan three and pay any 
balance to Mr R 
remove any negative information  about the fourth and fifth deferrals of loan one and 
loan two from Mr Rs credit  file;
remove all entries about  loan three  from Mr Rs credit file, as its already offered to 
do.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off, if he asks for one. 
Ref: DRN17681604my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Rs complaint  in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC,  
trading as QuickQuid,  should take the steps Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 August 2019.
