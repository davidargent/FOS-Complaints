K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains about Elevate Credit International  Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly 
lending to him.
background
I issued a provisional decision on 18 September 2019 where I set out a detailed  background 
to this complaint.  I gave  both parties  the opportunity to provide further comments  and 
evidence before I issued a final decision.  Ive attached the background and extracts  of my 
provisional decision and it forms part of this final decision.
The deadline  for response has now passed and neither party has provided anything  further  
for me to consider.
my findings
Ive again reconsidered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As theres  been  no further information  or arguments put forward  by either  Mr W or Sunny, 
I see no reason to depart from my provisional  findings.
I think Sunny  needs to put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
 refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 1 to 19;
 pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 remove any negative information  about loans 1 to 5 from Mr Ws credit file;
 the number  of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about loans 6 to 19 should be 
removed from Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must 
give Mr W a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN88520932my final decision
For the reasons  given  here and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr Ws complaint and 
require Elevate Credit  International  Limited to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 November  2019.

background
This complaint is about  19 short term loans Sunny provided to Mr W between  August  2014 and 
February 2017. Some information about Mr Ws borrowing is attached  as an appendix at the end of 
this decision.
When Mr W complained  to Sunny it said it thought it shouldnt have lent him loan 1 and offered 
redress for that loan alone. Mr W brought his complaint to this service where it was looked into by 
one of our adjudicators. Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ws complaint in part and thought the loans from 
loan 9 onwards shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general  approach to complaints about  short-
term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  - on our 
website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice  this 
means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W could repay the loans 
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could  be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  
a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans  (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become,  or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr W could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether 
the loan payments  were affordable on a strict  pounds  and pence calculation.  The loan payments 
being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could sustainably  make their 
repayments. But it doesnt  automatically follow  this is the case. This is because the relevant  
regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue difficulties and in particular the customer 
should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well 
as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or 
it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments 
sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to repay without borrowing further.
Ref: DRN88520934Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. Sunny has admitted that it shouldnt have lent Mr W 
loan 1, it says there were  indicators that the loan was unsuitable for Mr W. Sunny also agrees with 
the adjudicator  that it shouldnt have  lent Mr W loans  12 to 19, I believe those loans are no longer 
in dispute and so Ive focused my decision on the loans that remain  in dispute, loans  2 to 11.
Sunny by its own admission  accepts that loan 1 shouldnt  have been lent to Mr W and from what  I 
can see, Mr Ws circumstances in relation  to his monthly income and expenditure  remained broadly 
the same throughout  the lending. Sunny also carried out a credit check  and while there were no 
defaults or bankruptcies  recorded  on Mr Ws file at the time, Sunny saw that Mr W had been 
regularly borrowing short  term loans. And this might have suggested that Mr W had wider financial 
problems.
I can also see that many of Mr Ws loans overlapped and he hadnt fully repaid loan 1 when he was 
lent loan 2. In my view if Sunny admits that there were indicators that Mr W shouldnt have been lent 
loan 1, the following loans also shouldnt have been lent. As I stated earlier, Mr Ws circumstances 
remained broadly similar and if loan 1 wasnt  sustainably lent, I cant see how subsequent loans 
wouldve been  sustainable for Mr W. Particularly as Sunny was aware of hed been regularly 
borrowing short term loans.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history  with Mr W, with a view to seeing  if 
there was a point at which  Sunny should reasonably  have  seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt  have 
provided any further  loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ws case, I think that this point  was reached by loan 6. 
I say this because:
Mr W had been indebted to Sunny for about 11 months  by loan 6. So Sunny ought  to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr W was having  to borrow  further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances,  particularly given the results of its 
search of Mr Ws credit file. Sunny shouldve  realised  that Mr Ws indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably and that it was unlikely Mr W was borrowing  to meet a temporary  
shortfall in their income but to meet  an ongoing need.
From loan 6 onwards  Mr W was provided with a new loan within days  of settling a previous 
one. As already  mentioned, many of Mr Ws loans  were overlapping which meant that he 
held more than one short term loan at a time and there were  no breaks in lending.
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed  Sunny. Loan  19 was taken  
out around 29 months after Mr Ws first. Mr W had been indebted  to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr W lost out because  Sunny  continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans  and the length of time over which  Mr W borrowed was likely  to have 
had negative implications  on Mr Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in 
the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding Mr Ws complaint about loans 2 to 11 and. Sunny should  put things right in relation  
to these loans as well.
