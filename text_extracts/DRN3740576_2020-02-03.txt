K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny, lent to him in an
irresponsible manner.
background 
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision of 14 January 2020,  
an extract  of which is attached and forms part of this final decision.  So I wont repeat that 
information here. 
my provisional decision
In my provisional decision,  I explained  why I thought that Sunny shouldnt  have given  Mr C 
loans five to 23 and what I thought it should  do to put matters right.  
responses to my provisional  decision
Mr C accepted my provisional  decision.  Sunny didnt.  It said,  in summary:
It remained of the view that Mr Cs complaint should be upheld in relation to loans
16-23.
It allows customers to have up to four concurrent Sunny loans, so the fact that Mr C 
applied for three loans  over a one month period wouldnt automatically alert it to the 
possibility that he was having problems  managing his money.  
It didnt rely solely on the information Mr C provided.
The mere presence of other borrowing  doesnt  preclude further borrowing.  
It took Mr Cs other credit commitments  into account when considering his application 
for loan five. 
Mr C could afford to repay  loan five.
The borrowing pattern  alone, without any other evidence, doesnt  conclusively show 
that the loans  were  unsustainable. 
Mr C was never in arrears, repaid all the loans and had sufficient disposable income.
Loan eight  didnt refinance  loans  three,  five and six. The amount Mr C borrowed for 
loan eight wasnt the same amount as he repaid the day before in relation to loans  
three, five and six. 
By loan 15, Mr C had been borrowing from it for less than 12 months   thats  not 
inconsistent with the FCAs definition of high-cost, short-term  credit.
Its not necessarily the case that the number  of loans it gave to Mr C impaired his 
ability to access mainstream credit.  
Ref: DRN37405762my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Whilst I said that Sunnys  checks werent  proportionate for loan four, I didnt uphold  that loan. 
So, I dont need  to address Sunnys comments in relation to loan four. 
The loans that remain in dispute  are loans five to 15, as Sunny accepts that Mr Cs 
complaint should  be upheld  in relation  to loans 16-23.
Ive noted what  Sunny says about its checks but I remain  of the view that Mr Cs other 
borrowing at the time of loan five should have led Sunny to conclude that it was unlikely that 
Mr C wouldve been able to repay  further  borrowing in a sustainable way. 
I dont think that the fact that Mr C was never in arrears, repaid all the loans and appeared to 
have disposable  income shows that he could afford  to repay further borrowing in a 
sustainable way. For the reasons I set out in my provisional decision,  I think that from loan 
eight, the pattern of lending, in itself,  suggested that further borrowing was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful. 
I dont think that the amount Mr C paid to repay loans 3,5 and 6 has to match the amount he 
borrowed at loan eight  to conclude that the later loan effectively refinanced  the repayment of 
the earlier loans.  
The FCAs definition of short-term lending includes a reference to loans due to be repaid or 
substantially repaid within 12 months. I dont think that means that we can only decide that 
lending is unsustainable  after 12 months  of borrowing. I dont think that those two things are 
related. In deciding this case, I looked at the pattern of borrowing and I remain  of the view 
that loan eight is the point  at which Sunny shouldve realised from the pattern of lending that 
the lending was unsustainable. 
Ive considered all thats  been said but I see no reason  to depart from the conclusions I 
reached in my provisional decision. So, for the reasons  Ive explained, I dont think that 
Sunny should  have  given  Mr C loans  five to 23. Sunny should put things right in the way I 
indicated in my provisional decision.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr Cs complaint in 
part. I now require Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny  to:
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans five to 23;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan five, six and seven from Mr Cs 
credit file;
Ref: DRN37405763the number  of loans  taken from loan eight onwards  means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans eight  to 23 should be removed 
from Mr Cs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires  Sunny  to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 March 2020.

complaint
Mr C complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny, lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr C took out 23 instalment loans with Sunny between June 2017  and August  2018. The 
loans ranged from £50 to £950 and were  repayable  at the outset by six, monthly
repayments. Mr C repaid all the loans. A summary  of Mr Cs borrowing from Sunny is shown 
as an appendix  to this decision.
Mr C says that he couldnt afford  to repay the loans. He wants to be put back into the 
position he would have been in if he hadnt taken out the loans.
One of our adjudicators  assessed Mr Cs complaint.  She said that Sunny shouldnt  have 
given Mr C loans four to 23. The adjudicator set out what Sunny should do to put matters 
right.
Sunny didnt agree with the adjudicators  view.  It said, in summary:
It asked Mr C about his income and expenditure and the loans were affordable.
It allows  customers to take out up to four loans  with it at any one time and it took into 
account outstanding loans  when  it looked  at affordability.
When Mr C had been borrowing over 12 months, it seemed that he wasnt  using 
these loans for short-term borrowing needs and may be reliant on the loans, so 
it offered to pay Mr C compensation  in relation  to loan 16 onwards.
It uses information  provided by the customer and from credit reference agencies.
Mr C didnt accept Sunnys offer. As there was no agreement between  the parties,  
the complaint  was passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant  rules, guidance and 
good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable  steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice, this means that it should  have carried  out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
Ref: DRN37405765But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These  factors  
include:
    the lower  a customers  income  (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to 
make any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of 
income);
    the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher  repayment from a particular  level of income);
    the greater  the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period 
of time during  which a customer has been given  loans  (reflecting the risk that 
repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending  itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. Of 
course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis might be an indication a consumer 
could sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the 
case. This is because  the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable  as 
being without  undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments . And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence and information  provided in 
this context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
I dont think that Sunny  was wrong  to give Mr C loans one to three.  Given the repayment  
amounts, what was apparent about Mr Cs circumstances at the time and his history with the 
lender at that point, I dont  think it wouldve  been  proportionate for Sunny to ask Mr C for the 
amount of information needed  to show the lending was unsustainable. There  wasnt  
anything in the information Mr C provided  or the information Sunny shouldve been  aware  
of, which meant  it wouldve been  proportionate for it to start verifying what  Mr C said at that 
stage.
But by loan four, I think that proportionate  checks wouldve included  verifying  what Mr C 
said about his finances. Thats because Mr C had three loans  already  outstanding with 
Sunny, which  hed taken out over a very short space of time. I think that should have alerted 
Sunny to the possibility  that Mr C might have been having problems managing his money. 
But based  on what  Ive seen, I cant safely say that proportionate checks would have shown 
that Mr C couldnt  afford to repay loan four.
Ref: DRN37405766Proportionate checks before loan five would  likely  have shown that Mr C had two other 
short-term loans from other lenders that he hadnt repaid, in addition to the two 
outstanding loans with Sunny. In those circumstances,  I think Sunny ought  to have 
realised it was unlikely  that Mr C wouldve been  able to repay loan five in a sustainable 
way. So, I dont think Sunny should have given Mr C loan five or subsequent loans.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Mr Cs borrowing history with Sunny, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which the pattern of lending, in itself,  suggested that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case,  I think that this point was reached  by 
loan eight. I say this because by loan eight, Mr Cs overall pattern of borrowing suggested 
that he had become  persistently reliant  on short-term loans. Ive looked at the initial  
borrowing in three  batches; loans one to four, loans five and six and loan seven. Mr C took 
out loan one and then loans two to four without  repaying what hed already borrowed. When  
Mr C took out loans five and six, hed only recently  repaid  loans one and two. And when he 
took out loan seven  hed only recently  repaid loan four; loans  three, five and six remained 
outstanding. When  Mr C asked to borrow again for loan eight, he asked for a considerably 
larger amount. It seems  to me that loan eight effectively refinanced  loans three, five and six, 
which Mr C had repaid  the previous day. Whilst amounts Mr C borrowed fluctuated, in my 
view, the pattern of lending  itself shows that the loans  from loan eight were  unsustainable.
Mr C wasnt making  any real inroads  to the amount  he owed Sunny. Loan  23 was taken 
out around 14 months after Mr Cs first loan with Sunny. And it was for a much  larger  
amount. Mr C had paid large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over 
an extended period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan eight 
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period 
of time. The sheer number of loans was likely  to have had negative  implications on Mr Cs 
ability to access mainstream credit  and so likely kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So, I dont think Sunny should have given  Mr C loans five onwards and the pattern of 
lending itself indicated  unsustainability from loan eight onwards.
putting things right   what Sunny needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans five to 23;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan five, six and seven from Mr Cs 
credit file;
the number  of loans  taken from loan eight onwards  means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans eight  to 23 should be removed 
from Mr Cs credit  file.
Ref: DRN37405767*HM Revenue & Customs  requires  Sunny  to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
my provisional decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my provisional decision is that I intend to uphold  Mr Cs 
complaint in part. I intend to direct Elevate  Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny, 
to take the steps Ive set out above.
