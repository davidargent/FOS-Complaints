The complaint
Mr K complains that esure Insurance Limited mishandled his claim on his motor insurance 
policy.
Where I refer to esure, I refer to the insurance company of that name and I include claims-
handlers and others insofar as I hold esure responsible for their acts or omissions.
What happened
The subject matter of the claim and the complaint is a luxury sports coupe first registered in 
about 2013. It had a very large and powerful V8 engine.
For the year from August 2021, Mr K had the car insured on a comprehensive policy with 
esure. Any claim for damage to the car was subject to an excess totalling £1,250.00.
Unfortunately, there was an incident in February 2022, after which esure said the car was a 
total loss. So esure assessed the pre-loss market value of the car. From the trade guides, it 
found retail valuations as follows:
Glasss £24,150.00
Parkers £26,380.00 
CAP £26,730.00 
Cazana £29,236.00 
esure disregarded the Cazana valuation as an outlier and used an average of the other three 
 that is £25,753.00. After deducting the excess of £1,250.00, esure sent Mr K a cheque for 
£24,503.00.
Mr K told esure that he disagreed with its valuation. By a final response dated 24 February 
2022, esure turned down the complaint. Mr K brought his complaint to us in March 2022.
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. She thought that a fair 
settlement offer wouldve been £26,555.00, the mid-point of the Parkers and CAP valuations 
of £26,380.00 and £26,730.00. 
The investigator recommended that esure should:
1. increase its valuation of Mr Ks vehicle to £26,555.00. The settlement of the claim 
should be this sum, less the £1,250.00 policy excess. So Mr Ks final settlement 
payment should be £25,305.00. In the event Mr K had not yet cashed the settlement 
cheque, esure should issue a new cheque in this sum. If Mr K had cashed the 
settlement cheque, esure should pay him the difference between the original 
settlement offer and £25,305.00; and 
2. in any event, esure should also pay Mr K interest at a rate of 8% (simple) per annum 
on the difference between the original offer and the revised figure, to compensate 
him for being out of pocket by that sum from the date of the original offer until the 
date of settlement.
Mr K agreed with the investigators opinion.
esure disagreed with the investigators opinion. It asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. It says, in summary, that:
From all four guides, the fair value range is £24,136.00 - £29,236.00.
Its value of £25,573.00 was fair as it fell within the fair value range.
It would agree to increase it to make it fairer in the eyes of the Financial Ombudsman 
Service  if we treat it as a negotiated outcome and do not record it as a change in 
outcome.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Ombudsman Service expects insurers to assess market value by reference to 
retail prices in the trade guides. Those guides are based on extensive research of likely 
selling prices. We regard them as more reliable evidence than advertisements as they 
contain asking prices that may be negotiated downwards. 
The esure policy terms included the following definition:
The market value is the amount you could reasonably have expected to sell your car 
for on the open market immediately before your accident or loss. Our assessment of 
the value is based on cars of the same make and model and of a similar age, 
condition and mileage at the time of accident or loss. This value is based on research 
from motor trade guides including: Glasss, Parkers and CAP
Im satisfied that esure had the correct details of Mr Ks car including its make, model, age 
and recorded mileage. 
Rather than sending a cheque in full and final settlement, I would expect an insurer to make 
a payment on account where the valuation was in question. By its letter dated 24 February 
2022, esure said:
Accepting our cheque wont affect you if you want to progress your complaint 
further.
Mr K has shown us esures letter dated 25 February that enclosed the cheque in full 
settlement. But Im satisfied that Mr K couldve paid in the cheque without affecting his 
rights, including his right to bring his complaint to us.
Parkers contains live but not historic valuations. As esure used it in the same month as the 
loss, I dont find that esure acted unfairly by including the Parkers valuation.
The Glasss valuation was about £2,200.00 away from the nearest of the other valuations 
(Parkers £26,380.00). The Cazana valuation was about £2,500.00 away from the nearest of 
the other valuations (CAP £26,730.00) So I dont consider that esure acted fairly by saying 
that the Cazana valuation was out of line  without saying that the Glasss valuation was 
also out of line.Ive thought about whether theres an even spread between all of the guides, so that any 
valuation within the range between about £24,000.00 and about £29,000.00 would be 
reasonable.
However, in the context of a car that was older and rarer than most, I dont agree that  
£25,573.00 was fair. Keeping in mind the likely difficulty of securing a like-for-like 
replacement, I find that a fair valuation of the car wouldve been £26,555.00.
Putting things right
So I find it fair and reasonable to direct esure to pay Mr K  in addition to the £24,503.00 it 
sent him in February 2022  a further sum calculated as follows:
This new valuation £26,555.00
Less excess £  1,250.00
Less paid £24,503.00
Balance to pay £     802.00 
As Mr K has been kept out of that balance unfairly since February 2022, I find it fair and 
reasonable to direct esure to pay interest on it from the date of his claim to the date of 
payment of that balance.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I direct esure 
Insurance Limited to pay Mr K, in addition to the £24,503.00 it sent him in February 2022:
1. a further £802.00; and 
2. simple interest on that amount at the yearly rate of 8% from the date of his claim to 
the date of payment of that amount. If esure considers that its required by HM 
Revenue & Customs to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr K how 
much its taken off. It should also give Mr K a certificate showing this if he asks for 
one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 August 2022.
