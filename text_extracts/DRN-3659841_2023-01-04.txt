The complaint
 Ms K complains that Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax didnt investigate a missing  
international payment. She would like compensation
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again here 
instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
I appreciate Ms Ks concern that she didnt receive an international payment sent to 
her. From what I have seen it seems that incorrect information was given when the 
payment was made. The  remitting bank was able to make a payment, but this didnt 
go into Ms Ks account. I cant say that Halifax are at fault here given it didnt make 
the payment. Its the payees responsibility to ensure correct details are given.
I understand that the payment was made into a Halifax account albeit not Ms Ks. It 
seems the remitting bank did ask for the funds to be returned but no funds remained 
to be returned. It would be the remitting banks responsibility to try to retrieve funds 
but if not funds remained to be recovered then Halifax had no funds to return.
I appreciate Ms K doesnt feel Halifax investigated this issue properly, but I am not 
sure what else Halifax could have done. The payee made the error with the account 
details. The remitting bank correctly tried to retrieve funds but there were no funds to 
retrieve. As I cant see that Halifax has done anything wrong I cant reasonably ask it 
to compensate Ms K as she has requested.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 February 2023.
