DRN-1544251
The complaint
Mr D complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
FCE Bank plc, trading as Ford Credit, wasnt of satisfactory quality. His wife is also involved 
with his complaint.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
 Ford Credit, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr D - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
 the car that was supplied to Mr D was a new car and I consider that it was 
reasonable for him to expect that it would be free from even minor defects;
 satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
 the car was supplied to Mr D for his wife in April 2019 and she complained to the 
dealer in June 2019 because of issues with starting the car;
 the issue was witnessed by the dealer but no fault was found and the dealer said that 
it could be caused by fuel evaporating in the hot weather;
 the cars battery was replaced in August 2019 but Mr D says that the issues 
continued so he complained to Ford Credit;
 it said that the dealer had been unable to replicate the issue but it understood that 
Mr D had been without the car for approximately eight weeks but hed been provided 
with a courtesy car so it offered to reimburse 50% of eight weeks instalments and to 
pay him a further £100 for the inconvenience caused - which it calculated to total 
£276 86;
 Mr D didnt accept that offer and complained to this service;
 the investigator recommended to Ford Credit that it should arrange for the car to be 
inspected by an independent expert  so it arranged an inspection that took place in 
January 2020;
 the inspection report said: the engineer did not experience any engine starting 
difficulties on the day of inspection; and: As the fuel system is sealed the engineer 
believes the diagnosis of fuel evaporation to be unlikely and considers it more likely 
that for some reason a drop in fuel pressure has occurred possible by means of the 
fuel return line and/or the pressure regulator valve;
 the investigator didn't think that there was enough information to suggest that the 
issues were still present on the car and he thought that Ford Credit had dealt with 
Mr Ds complaint fairly by offering to compensate him for the inconvenience caused;
 Mr D says that his main points are: he was without the car for two periods, totalling 8 
weeks; the problem still persisted after the dealer had had two opportunities to rectify 
it; the dealer replicated the problem and has had the same fault with another car of 
the same model and said that it was a characteristic of the car  but that should have 
been pointed out at the point of sale and noted in the cars promotional literature and 
he wouldnt have purchased the car if hed been made aware that it would have 
difficulty starting in warm weather; hes been told that its his fault for not researching 
properly before purchase; and the derisory offer of £300 compensation is insulting as 
he made it clear that he was more interested in having a car with no issues rather 
than money;
 I sympathise with Mr D (and his wife) for the issues that hes had with the car and I 
understand the frustration that he feels because of the issues with the new car that 
was supplied to him for his wife;
 it seems to be clear that there was an issue with the car starting  but the dealer 
hasnt been able to find a fault and no fault was found when the car was inspected by 
an independent expert;
 the independent expert says that itss unlikely that the issue was caused by fuel 
evaporation and that a drop in fuel pressure is a more likely explanation for the issue 
with starting the car;
 Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres a fault with the 
car or that it wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr D  nor am I 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that this model of car has a 
characteristic that causes issues with starting in hot weather;
 Mr D was without the car for two periods totalling eight weeks  but he was provided 
with a courtesy car to use and I consider that Ford Credits offer to pay him 
compensation totalling £276.86 is fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
 I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Ford Credit to 
allow Mr D to reject the car, to pay him a higher amount of compensation than its 
already offered to him or to take any other action in response to his complaint.My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that FCE Bank plc, trading as Ford Credit, should pay to 
Mr D the £276.86 compensation that its offered him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 September 2020.
