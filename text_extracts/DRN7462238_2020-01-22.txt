Mr B complains that Evergreen  Finance London  Ltd (trading as MoneyBoat)  gave him loans 
irresponsibly.
background
This complaint is about four loans MoneyBoat provided to Mr B between October 2016 and 
May 2018. Heres  a table showing these loans - all have been repaid.

Mr B complained that MoneyBoat had failed to see that hed become dependent  on loans 
and got stuck in a cycle of borrowing to repay previous loans.
Our adjudicator felt that the complaint should be upheld. She said that MoneyBoats own 
credit checks showed that when  Mr B asked for loan 1 he already had a number of other 
outstanding short-term loans. And when he came back  to MoneyBoat  to ask for loan 2, that 
was still the case.  So our adjudicator felt that this shouldve alerted MoneyBoat to the 
possibility that Mr B might have  been having problems managing his money. And she felt 
that MoneyBoat  ought to have realised  it was unlikely Mr B wouldve been able to repay this 
borrowing, and any subsequent loans, in a sustainable way. 
So our adjudicator said MoneyBoat shouldnt have lent Mr B any of these loans. 
To put things right our adjudicator recommended that MoneyBoat should refund all interest  
and charges Mr B had paid on loans 1 through to 4, plus interest on the refunds, and amend 
his credit file to remove any adverse information about these loans.
MoneyBoat disagreed with our adjudicators view. It said (in summary) that the checks it did 
were proportionate given the amounts and the loan terms, bearing in mind  this was the start 
of its lending relationship with Mr B. MoneyBoat also said that based on the information  Mr B 
provided, his disposable  income was more than sufficient  to cover the repayments and his 
credit score met MoneyBoats requirements.  
The complaint came to me to decide. I issued a provisional decision. 
what I said in my provisional decision
Here are some of the main things I said. 
Ref: DRN74622382MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
MoneyBoat was required to establish  whether  Mr B could sustainably  repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
I dont disagree with MoneyBoat when it says that the checks it did before agreeing the first 
loan were proportionate. 
Its reasonable to expect  that MoneyBoat shouldve taken properly into account  the 
information it collected about Mr Bs financial situation. 
MoneyBoat could see that Mr Bs credit file showed  some outstanding short term loans  along  
with credit card defaults. And I can understand why our adjudicator felt this information  
mightve been enough to indicate  that Mr B was likely  having  problems managing  his money  
- and so led our adjudicator to conclude that MoneyBoat shouldve declined  his application 
for loan 1. 
Ref: DRN74622383But I think its important to take into account that this was Mr Bs first loan with MoneyBoat  
so I think MoneyBoat couldve reasonably taken a view that Mr B intended to use the credit  it 
provided to help restructure his finances with a view to improving his situation  overall.  
MoneyBoat says that it did review Mr Bs credit  report and it took into account  additional  
credit it could see that Mr B hadnt  mentioned in his application. MoneyBoat  used this 
information to adjust the amount of disposable  income it worked out that Mr B had left to pay 
for loan 1. Its adjusted  figures suggested  that Mr B had disposable income  of £1251.00 per 
month. Given that the monthly instalments he had to pay for loan 1 were  £168.90 I can see 
why MoneyBoat came to the view that these  repayments were  comfortably affordable  for 
Mr B. 
And I think its fair for MoneyBoat to point out that Mr B repaid all three loan 1 instalments on 
the due dates. And when hed settled the loan Mr B sent an email thanking MoneyBoat and 
saying how pleased hed been with the process. I dont think this wouldve suggested  that 
Mr B had any difficulty affording loan 1.
So, on balance, Im not persuaded that Ive seen enough to be able to say that MoneyBoat 
acted irresponsibly when  it provided loan 1 to Mr B. 
And after paying loan 1, Mr B didnt ask MoneyBoat for any more  loans  during  the period 
December 2016   August 2017. That gap in lending seems long enough to me for 
MoneyBoat reasonably to think that Mr B finances mightve moved  on during this period. 
This meant that when his borrowing started  again, and Mr B applied for loan 2, he was 
effectively starting over.  So it was fair for MoneyBoat to treat this as a new chain  of 
borrowing and assess his lending  requests accordingly. 
As before, I can see that MoneyBoat carried out credit checks  that showed  Mr Bs monthly  
expenditure came to £1088.00 per month, and this included  paying £235.00 towards  other 
credit commitments.  This left him with disposable income of £1312.00 per month  a little 
more than when  hed applied for loan 1.
Loan 2 was for the same amount Mr B had borrowed when he took out loan 1 and the 
monthly instalments  were  for a similar amount. From what  I can see from looking at his 
credit file, Mr Bs credit position generally  didnt  appear any worse than when hed taken loan 
1 - and hed shown  no affordability or repayment problems when hed been paying loan 1. 
Thinking about  what MoneyBoat knew about  his circumstances  at the time, I dont think  Mr B 
had shown any clear  indicators  at that stage  that shouldve made it realise  then that it was 
likely Mr B was having difficulty managing his finances or that it was likely Mr B wouldnt be 
able to repay loan 2 in a sustainable way. And I dont think  MoneyBoat had reason to probe 
any more deeply  into Mr Bs circumstances than it did, given that Mr B was starting  over 
again in terms  of his borrowing relationship with MoneyBoat. 
So I dont  think it was unreasonable for MoneyBoat to provide loan 2 to Mr B.
Ref: DRN74622384MoneyBoat told us that when Mr B asked for loan 3, due to the number of loans hed had it 
queried if there was any long term issue regarding his financial situation. Mr B responded 
saying that: I am not in any financial  difficulty I can confirm  I am not borrowing money  
to pay off any priority debts, not in any long term or indeed short  term financial difficulty, and 
the monthly repayments are very affordable.  Mr B also explained why he needed the extra 
finance. I dont  think MoneyBoat had reason to think it needed to look any further into Mr Bs 
financial circumstances  hed answered  the enquiries it made and what he said seemed 
plausible. His emails  suggested he was relaxed about taking out loan 3 and that he felt he 
was making progress towards  his stated goal of rebuilding his credit  file.   
Following checks and adjustments  to the figures  Mr B had provided, MoneyBoat worked out 
that he had disposable income  of £1628.00 per month. So the three monthly repayments of 
around £200 that Mr B agreed to make for loan 3 shouldve been comfortably affordable for 
him. 
Taking all this into account, I dont think it was unreasonable for MoneyBoat to provide  
loan 3 to Mr B.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MoneyBoats lending history  with Mr B, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which MoneyBoat should reasonably  have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think by loan 4 MoneyBoat should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was likely to be unsustainable and it shouldnt  have provided 
this loan. I say this because:
at this point MoneyBoat  shouldve reasonably  been alerted to the unsustainability of 
Mr Bs borrowing  when  he failed  to repay loan 3 according to the agreed schedule
plus, what hed said about  a short term need for extra cash  when he took out loan 3 
evidently hadnt worked out the way Mr B had led MoneyBoat to expect
and the checks  MoneyBoat did showed  that Mr B was now paying more  towards  
other credit commitments (£350.00 as opposed to £175.00  when hed applied for 
loan 3)  so its clear  his money situation  wasnt improving 
also, MoneyBoat  calculated that Mr B had a smaller amount of disposable income  
than when hed applied for loan 4. Although the difference  wasnt  a lot of money, as 
part of the general  picture  I think it reflected his worsening financial circumstances
Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MoneyBoat   the 
amount he was asking  to borrow  on loan 4 (when he still owed a final payment on 
loan 3) was more  than hed started  out borrowing with MoneyBoat 
given what MoneyBoat knew about his money situation, MoneyBoat ought to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr B was borrowing further  to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his finances each time and that Mr Bs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
So I dont  think it was reasonable  for MoneyBoat to conclude that it was likely Mr B would be 
able to repay loan 4 in a sustainable way.
Ref: DRN74622385And these  indications of unsustainability  that Ive mentioned are borne out by what Ive seen 
on Mr Bs bank statements.  Im not suggesting  that MoneyBoat shouldve necessarily asked 
to see this information  but they appear  to show that Mr B was actively spending on 
gambling and its apparent  that his underlying financial circumstances were  difficult for him to 
manage.  
I think that Mr B lost out when MoneyBoat provided loan 4 because:
this loan had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.  
And in the event,  loan 4, which Mr B shouldve  repaid in three instalments by 
July 2018 wasnt  settled until February  2019
the length of time over which Mr B borrowed  these loans was likely  to have negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for high-cost  loans.  By loan 4, (except  for a short time between loans 2 and 3) Mr B 
had been indebted  to MoneyBoat since early August 2017 around nine months 
earlier (when he took out loan 2). I think this shouldve  made  MoneyBoat realise that 
it was likely Mr B was having difficulty managing his finances. And any further 
borrowing was likely  to be detrimental  to his credit rating.
So, overall, Im planning to say I uphold the complaint about loan 4.
what the parties said in response to my provisional  decision 
Neither party has sent me anything further in response to my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Having done so, and as no further comments have been received in response to my 
provisional decision, I still think its fair to uphold this complaint for the reasons I explained in 
my provisional decision. 
putting things right  what the MoneyBoat should do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loan 4
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
by loan 4, the length  of time that hed been borrowing from MoneyBoat means  any 
information recorded about this loan is adverse. So all information about loan 4 
should be removed  from Mr Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN74622386my final decision
I uphold this complaint  and direct Evergreen  Finance  London Ltd (trading as MoneyBoat) to 
pay Mr B as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 February  2020.
