K820x#14complaint
Mrs K complains about National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) and a charge it holds 
against her property. 
background
Mrs K had a business loan with NatWest from 2003 until 2017. 
When taking out the loan,  Mrs K signed a document which gave NatWest a legal charge 
over her commercial property. This was in order to secure the business loan. 
Mrs K settled the business  loan in 2017, but still had an overdraft outstanding with NatWest. 
Mrs K was concerned that NatWest did not release the charge, and she contacted NatWest. 
NatWest told her that the charge would not be released while she had any outstanding debt 
with the bank and that she would need  to clear her overdraft before the charge could be 
released. 
Mrs K complained to NatWest. She said that she did not think  her personal and business 
accounts should be connected like this, and that she was not advised that the charge would 
apply to her personal  accounts at the time.  
NatWest responded  to the complaint in November 2018. It said that document  containing the 
legal charge made clear that it related  to all liabilities, present and future in Mrs Ks name, 
whether jointly  or solely held. 
It therefore rejected  her complaint.  
Mrs K as not happy and contacted us. 
One of our adjudicators has looked into this matter and has set out her view to the parties. 
This was that NatWest  was entitled  to rely on the legal charge document, which  set out that 
it related to all liabilities. 
Mrs K was not happy with this view and asked for an ombudsman decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have, in particular,  looked at the legal charge which was agreed  in 2003. This sets out 
clearly at the top of the document  that the mortgagor  should  take independent legal advice 
before signing,  and should sign only if they want to be legally bound.
The document then states  on the first page, under a heading Mortgagors Obligations that it 
covers all liabilities to the Bank of any kind, whether present or future, and whether  incurred  
alone or jointly with someone else. 
The document is signed by Mrs K, and witnessed  by a solicitor.  
Ref: DRN48217352I note that Mrs K says that she was not advised  by NatWest that the document would apply 
to all her accounts, and NatWest has not retained evidence of the information  that 
accompanied the agreement, after so long.  I do, however, think  that Mrs K was advised  to 
obtain independent advice on the document, and she appears to have  done  so. 
I do not, therefore, think that NatWest was obliged to further explain the document,  which 
was otherwise clear. 
I realise that this will be disappointing  for Mrs K, but on the evidence  I think  that NatWest has 
acted reasonably, and in line with its written agreement, in applying the charge to all 
outstanding debts. 
I understand that this charge is now causing difficulty  for Mrs K, but I do not think that 
NatWest has acted  unfairly in relying  on the charge. 
As a result I do not uphold Mrs Ks complaint and do not ask the business to do anything 
further.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I do not uphold Mrs Ks complaint and do not ask National 
Westminster Bank Plc to do anything further.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 March  2019.
