K821x#15complaint
Mr H says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
feels that Sunny didnt  carry out appropriate  checks  to see whether he could afford  the 
lending. He thinks that if Sunny had made better  checks it wouldve seen that he couldnt 
afford the loan repayments. 
background
This complaint is about 33 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr H between  April 2014 and 
December 2017.  Ive attached a table that shows some of the information Sunny has 
provided about this lending  to the end of this decision. 
Sunny looked  at this complaint before it came to this Service.  It said that it should pay 
compensation in respect of loan 1. Mr H didnt  accept this offer. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought Sunny had lent irresponsibly for 
loans 5 to 33. 
Sunny responded to our adjudicator and said that it shouldnt have approved  any lending 
after 12 months. So it offered to pay compensation from loan 16 onwards. Mr H didnt  
accept this offer. As no agreement has been  reached the complaint has been passed  to me, 
an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN40948242There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.  Ive decided to uphold Mr Hs 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Mr H didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 4. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr H had with Sunny. So 
they are something  I will take into account  when considering the other loans  he took.
By loan 5, even taking  into account that the first loan was a running credit, Mr H had been 
borrowing from Sunny  without a break for over a year. And he hadnt repaid some of his 
earlier loans  when he took loan 5. So, as our adjudicator explained,  by loan 5 it wouldve 
been proportionate for Sunny to fully review Mr Hs finances to see if he could sustainably 
repay the loans.  
If Sunny had done this it would most likely  have  seen  that Mr H was having  problems  
managing his money. This is because his outgoings  were already reasonably  high and he 
was making repayments  to other  short term lenders at the time. This was in addition  to still 
making repayments to more than one Sunny Loan. 
I think that Sunny wouldve found  out this information if it had made proportionate checks.  
And I think Sunny wouldve seen  Mr H wouldnt have been able repay the loans in a 
sustainable way. So I think that Sunny shouldnt have given loans 5 to 7 to Mr H and I think  
hes lost out as a result  of this. So Im upholding  Mr Hs complaint about  loans 5 to 7. 
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 8 to 33 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  
history with Mr H, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
8. I say this because:
up to loan 8 the amounts Mr H was borrowing had been generally increasing.  And 
going forward Mr H was provided with a new loan within days  or weeks of settling a 
previous one  
Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr H was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably
Ref: DRN40948243Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  33 was 
taken out over three years after Mr Hs first. And it was for a much larger  amount. 
Mr H had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period
I think that Mr H lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Hs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 8 to 33 and Sunny should put things right.
Sunny has agreed  that it was wrong  to lend after loan 16. This is because  it thought  it was 
likely that Mr H had become reliant on credit at this point and so it shouldnt have approved 
any further loans.  This is an agreement  of sorts  but, put simply, in this case I think this was 
evident at an earlier point as Ive detailed  above. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 5 to 33;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 and 7 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 8 to 33 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
If Mr H still owes  Sunny any of the principal  balance he borrowed on his final loan Sunny 
should remove all the interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. Sunny  should  
then re-work the account as if all payments made by Mr H went  to towards the principal. But 
importantly, Sunny needs to make sure that Mr H doesnt repay more than the principal  
amount borrowed.  
If after doing this Mr H hasnt repaid  the principal he borrowed Sunny can deduct this from 
the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr H has already paid enough to repay the principal 
then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple*  interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Mr H.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN40948244my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Hs complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 November  2019.
