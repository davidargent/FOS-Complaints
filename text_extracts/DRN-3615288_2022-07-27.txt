The complaint
Mr J complains that National Westminster Bank Plc restricted then closed his account with
little notice. He said NatWest referred to the wrong terms, and he said none of the reasons in
his terms and conditions that might allow NatWest to do this, applied in his case.
What happened
Mr J said NatWest added a letter to his online banking, giving him 14 days notice that it
would be closing his account. Mr J said he knew NatWest didnt have to keep an account
open for him. It could close his account if it gave him 60 days notice. And he understood
that there were specified reasons in the terms of his account which allowed NatWest to close
an account with less than 60 days notice. But he said that none of these applied to him.
Mr J was very concerned that, if NatWest had decided it could close his account right away,
then it must be holding incorrect personal data about him. He was worried about how this
could affect him in the future. He tried repeatedly to get NatWest to look again at what it had
done, or to discuss it with him, but he said it refused.
Mr J said having his account closed like this was highly stressful. And he had continued to
worry about this since, because he didnt know what information the bank had based its
decision on, and who it might have shared that incorrect information with.
Mr J wanted NatWest to apologise for what it had done, ensure the data it held was
accurate, and correct any mistaken information it had shared with third parties. And he
thought NatWest should also pay compensation to reflect the distress it has caused.
NatWest said it couldnt share the reasons behind the closure of Mr Js account, but it said it
hadnt changed its mind, and it didnt think it had done anything wrong.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. I wont set out his reasoning
here, as I havent adopted it.
Mr J didnt agree. He replied to say that NatWest had relied on the terms and conditions
relevant to immediate closure, but he said that this wasnt consistent with treatment hed
received from another bank in the same group. He still thought that NatWest had breached
the terms on the notice required to close an account.
Our investigator approached NatWest again, and it did then change its mind. It said it should
have given Mr J 60 days notice. It offered him £100 to make up for this.
Mr J didnt want to accept this, he wanted his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman,
so it was passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Mr J says he understands that NatWest can decide to close his account if it no longer 
wants to offer him banking services. This doesnt appear to have been his primary 
account. He has said to NatWest that he intended to close the account himself anyway, 
and what he actually did was to switch this account to another bank. So I dont think Mr 
J is complaining about the fact that his account was closed.
Mr J was, however, very concerned about how NatWest took this step. He is aware of 
the reasons set out in the terms of his account that allow NatWest to restrict all banking 
services immediately, and the terms which allow it to close an account with no notice. 
Mr J has been clear that these reasons could not apply in his case. So Mr Js concern 
wasnt primarily that his account was closing, it was about what NatWest must have 
believed about him, in order to reach the view that it could close his account without 
giving 60 days notice.
Ive looked at the internal notes NatWest made when it decided to close his account, 
and it looks as if NatWest didnt intend to proceed in this way. Although it would no 
longer offer Mr J an account or any borrowing, it had decided to issue a letter giving him 
60 days notice of this decision, and to allow his banking facilities to remain active until 
account closure.
But thats not what NatWest did. Instead, it issued a letter which referred to the wrong
account type. That letter told Mr J that NatWest had the right, under the terms of his 
account, to close his account straight away, but it would allow him 14 days before it 
closed the account. His banking facilities were restricted immediately.
Mr J tried repeatedly to get NatWest to reconsider. But, although there do appear to 
have been indications that this was a mistake (the reference to the wrong account type, 
the initial decision shown in its internal notes) NatWest persisted in this mistake. It wrote 
to Mr J twice to tell him it had done nothing wrong, and it continued to insist this for 
some time after this complaint came to us.
NatWest has now changed its mind. It says it should have given Mr J 60 days notice. 
NatWest wanted to pay Mr J £100 to apologise for this, but Mr J didnt want to accept 
that. And I dont think thats quite the right amount to make up for whats gone wrong 
here.
Mr J was given very little notice that this account was going to close, and no access to 
the account during that time. He had to act quickly, and I can see that he put in place an 
account switch within this time to avoid the involuntary closure of the account. And Mr J 
told us that the rapid account closure caused him considerable concern, because he 
couldnt tell why NatWest had taken this step. He said he knew none of the reasons for 
immediate account closure could apply to him, but he couldnt rule out that he had been 
confused with someone else. So he worried that this might affect his wider banking 
arrangements. Mr J only found out relatively recently that this was all a mistake.
For those reasons, I think that NatWest should pay Mr J a little more compensation than 
it has offered. I think NatWest should pay £250 to make up for the distress and 
inconvenience that it has caused to Mr J.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied to accept my provisional decision.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither side has offered any additional evidence or argument in response to my provisional 
decision, and I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the decision I originally proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must pay Mr J £250.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2022.
