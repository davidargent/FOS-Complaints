The complaint
Mr and Mrs P complain that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) sent their  statements to an 
old address. They would like an explanation and more compensation than the £250 Barclays 
has already agreed to pay.
.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
Barclays has explained that due to human error Mr and Mrs Ps change of address 
was updated on its main screen in 2016 but not on the statement address screen. 
And this didnt come to light until Mr and Mrs P complained as the paper statements 
sent werent returned by the postal service. And for some time statements were 
provided online not by post. Its unfortunate but mistakes do happen as seems the 
case here, but I understand the address is now correctly recorded.
Barclays has offered £250 compensation for the distress and inconvenience. I 
appreciate Mr and Mrs P feel the mistake is too serious for this to be sufficient 
compensation, but I am afraid I dont agree. I do appreciate the concern caused by 
Barclays mistake but Mr and Mrs P havent evidenced any loss as a result of this that 
I could take into account. I feel the amount agreed is appropriate in the 
circumstances.. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. 
In full and final settlement Barclays Bank UK PLC should pay a total of £250 compensation 
for the distress and inconvenience.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P and Mr P to 
accept or reject my decision before 11 May 2022.
