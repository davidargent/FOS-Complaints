K820x#14complaint
Miss S says Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) mis-sold her Select and Silver packaged  bank 
accounts. Shes used  a Claims Management Company (CMC) to make her complaint.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  into Miss S complaint and didnt think Lloyds had
mis-sold the accounts.  The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Miss S complaint. 
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Miss Ss complaint. Id like 
to explain the reasons  for my decision.  I think Miss S chose to take the accounts as she 
switched to and from a free account.  She appears to have  had identifiable needs for the 
main benefits and she couldve used them too. 
So overall I dont  think that clearer information wouldve changed Miss S decision to accept 
what looks to have  been a fair recommendations made by Lloyds. And, in these 
circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Miss S complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 April 2019.
