Mrs B complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as sunny.co.uk) was

Payment plan
Mrs B says she was in a cycle of short-term lending and the interest was astronomical. She 
says she was borrowing  higher amounts each time and it had a profound  effect on her 
health. Mrs B adds it was impossible to get out of the cycle and that eventually  she defaulted 
on the last loan and had to enter  into a payment  plan. She acknowledges that Sunny has 
upheld her complaint  about the first four loans, but says Sunny should  have  done  better  
affordability checks before approving her subsequent loan applications too.
Sunny says it conducted creditworthiness  checks and assessed Mrs Bs ability to afford the 
repayments and considered it responsible to approve the loans at the time. But it 
acknowledged there were  indications that at certain  points the product may not have been 
suitable for her needs. As a result, Sunny has refunded interest and charges (plus 8% 
statutory interest) on loans 1 to 4.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He found that, by loan 6, 
Mrs Bs pattern of borrowing suggested she had become persistently reliant  on short-term 
loans. He recommended  interest and charges should be refunded on loans 6 to 16 (plus 8% 
statutory interest) and that the loans  should be removed from Mrs Bs credit file.
Sunny responded to say, in summary,  that Mrs Bs declared income and expenditure 
showed the loans were  affordable. It said it could  not agree that she was reliant  on the loans 
as there  were gaps  between some of the applications.
 
Ref: DRN17379892my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs B could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer 
could sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. 
This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook  (CONC) defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Bs complaint. As Sunny has already upheld  Mrs Bs 
complaint about  loans  1 to 4, and issued a refund, I wont consider those loans further here.
Loan 5
When Mrs B applied  for loan 5, she had no other  outstanding Sunny loans. Sunny asked her 
about her income  and expenditure and the repayment was a small proportion of Mrs Bs 
disposable income. There was nothing else to indicate Mrs B might be struggling to manage 
her finances,  so I cant conclude Sunny was wrong to approve  loan 5.
Ref: DRN17379893But Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history  with Mrs B, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Bs case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
By loan 6, Mrs B had made  six loan applications  in as many  weeks  and loan 5 was 
still outstanding;
From  loan 6 onwards  Mrs B was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one and often  had multiple  loans  at the same time. So Sunny ought  to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mrs B was having to borrow further  to cover the 
hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Mrs Bs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
Mrs B wasnt making any inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan  16 was taken 
out 8 months  after Mrs Bs first. And it was for a larger amount. Mrs B had paid large  
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Mrs B lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mrs Bs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 16 and Sunny should  put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading  as 
sunny.co.uk) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mrs B paid on loans 6 to 16;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 16 should be removed from 
Mrs Bs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs B a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 November  2019.
