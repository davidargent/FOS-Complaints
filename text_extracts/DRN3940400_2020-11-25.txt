K820x#14complaint
Miss R has complained shes being  asked to repay a debt on a TSB Bank plc account in her 
name although she never authorised the original disputed transactions.
background
In 2017 Miss R was looking to apply for a mortgage and was turned down. Advised to check 
her credit record,  she discovered there were four defaults linked to current accounts in her 
name. One of these  accounts was with TSB.  She complained to TSB.
TSB confirmed this account  had been opened  in 2011. Then between 28 May and 3 June 
2014 numerous transactions were made using the genuine card and PIN at supermarkets. 
TSB had made demands for repayment  to the address they held for Miss R. They never  got 
a response nor was the debt, which stood at over £3,550, repaid. TSB defaulted Miss Rs 
account on 1 October  2014 and then sold this debt to a third party.
Miss R explained shed fled the family home on mid-2014. She felt shed been  under the 
control of family and wanted to move  away. Shed never known what had happened with the 
accounts  as shed only taken one debit card with her for an account that shes  not 
complained about  nor was she aware of the disputed transactions and debt. TSB wouldnt 
cancel the debt as they believed Miss R must have known about the transactions.
Miss R brought  her complaint to the ombudsman  service.  Our investigator reviewed all the 
evidence, including  what Miss R said had taken place. He believed there was a possibility 
Miss R had authorised  the transactions as theyd all taken place in the area shed moved to. 
He thought she could have allowed someone  else to use her account  or may have been 
coerced into doing  so. He also noted  credits  made  to Miss R around the same time. He 
didnt ask TSB to write off the debt or remove the default as Miss R wished.
Miss R has asked an ombudsman to consider her complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached roughly the same conclusion as our investigator.  Ill explain 
why. Ive also been in touch with Miss R, through her representative, to let her know what  I 
was thinking.
Where there is a dispute about what happened, I have based my decision on the balance  of 
probabilities. In other words, on what I consider is most likely to have happened in the light 
of the evidence.
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; regulators rules, guidance  and standards; codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time.
The Payment Services Regulations (PSRs) are the relevant law here. These  primarily 
require banks to refund customers  if they didnt make or authorise payments themselves. 
Certain other  circumstances do apply  but nothing thats had an impact on the decision Im 
Ref: DRN39404002making here.  So when  we look at whether a bank has acted fairly in rejecting  someones  
fraud complaint, one of the things  we consider is whether the customer made the 
transactions themselves or allowed  them to be made. If they did, then we generally  wouldnt 
ask the bank to refund  them.
In broad terms a bank  is expected to process  payments  and withdrawals that a customer  
authorises it to make,  in accordance with the Payment Services  Regulations  and the terms 
and conditions of the customers account. I have taken that into account when deciding  what 
is fair and reasonable in this case.
The key things I have  taken into account  include:
Miss R admits opening this TSB account  and she used this for quite  a long period.
According to Miss Rs evidence, she didnt move  out of the family  home  until June or 
July 2014 which  may well have been  after the disputed transactions took place.  She 
left the account  details, including the card, behind.  I find this latter aspect surprising 
as up to this point the statements show Miss R was continuing to use this account on 
a regular basis. 
Before the end of May 2014  Miss R had withdrawn practically all the money from this 
account. Theres no suggestion she didnt do this willingly  but I find it interesting her 
account was to all intents and purposes empty before any fraud took place.
After Miss R left home she used only one of the accounts in her name. The 
statements from this account  show numerous  credits between June and October 
2014. These total nearly £8,000. Miss R has told us these were payments  from her 
mother who was trying to keep her money secure from the person  in the family trying 
to control her.
Her statements  also show  Miss R went back to her family home on a few occasions 
after she moved south.  Shes told us she went back to see her mother, although  
shes also told us her mother was one of those trying to control her.
The disputed transactions and those  on two of her other  accounts  follow  a very 
similar pattern.  Im in no doubt that whoever used Miss Rs card  and overall I dont 
believe theres enough evidence to show she did  knew exactly what  they were 
doing. They  were  carrying out organised fraud of a nature  which  would limit their 
chance of being  caught. All the transactions were carried  out at different  branches of 
one supermarket in a specific geographical  area. None of these required 
authorisation by the card issuer,  TSB in this instance.
I dont dispute  Miss Rs evidence that she left her card and account details behind when she 
moved. Although  the transactions happened in the south where  Miss R moved to, Im not 
sure she was necessarily living there  whilst these took place. I also dont believe the 
organised nature of these suggest that Miss R would  have known  or authorised  these 
transactions.
However its not just enough to decide whether  Miss R authorised these transactions, I also 
need to consider whether  she may have benefitted from what  happened.  I can see nearly 
£8,000 was paid into one of Miss Rs bank accounts   the one that she used. Miss R has 
told us this cash came from her mother and she was keeping it safe for her. But theres no 
evidence to show Miss R paid this money back to her mother  which  Id have expected.  I 
cant ignore the possibility  that her mother paid her this money as proceeds  from the fraud 
which is what I believe may have  happened.
Ref: DRN39404003I should stress that I dont believe Miss R necessarily knew about  the fraud but overall  I think  
the evidence shows she could have unknowingly benefitted from it.
The debt on Miss Rs TSB account was £3,551. If I was to ask TSB to refund her, this means  
she could potentially benefit twice from this fraud so I dont think its fair or reasonable to ask 
TSB to do this. Im also not going  to ask TSB to remove the default.  Because of the date this 
was lodged, this will now have been  removed automatically from Miss Rs credit record as 
more than six years has passed.
This must have been a very distressing time for Miss R and Im only sorry that I cant assist 
her further.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is not to uphold Miss Rs complaint against TSB 
Bank plc.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 December 2020.
