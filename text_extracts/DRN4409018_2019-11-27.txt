K822xcomplaint
Mr S is unhappy with the increases in premiums on his home insurance with UK Insurance
Limited (UKI). His son, Mr S1, has made the complaint  on his fathers behalf.  
background
Mr Ss home insurance (buildings and contents) policy  was taken out in 1982. We dont have 
information on what the premiums were  in the early  years of the policy. The earliest  record  
we have is from 1991 and I can see the premium was £369.96 for that year.   
The premiums increased over the years and by 2015 the total premiums charged were 
£1,341.78. Mr S1 was shocked to discover how much his father was being  charged for his 
home insurance. Mr S subsequently called UKI in January  2016  and cancelled the policy  
saying he was unhappy with the price. Mr S1 thinks UKI has taken advantage of his father 
by unfairly increasing  the cost of the policy every year for no reason. He says his father  was 
charged too much and he should be compensated for the extra he had paid over the years. 
He also says he was quoted a much cheaper  premium online for a policy  in 2016 which  he 
has now taken out. 
I note that Mr S made  several claims on the policy between 1991 and 2001  for various 
reasons including theft, subsidence and storm damage. In 2007 the policy  was amended  to 
include accidental damage  and the premium  increased from £558.80 to £762.18. I can see 
two further claims were made on the policy in 2010  and 2011  for theft, escape of water  and 
storm damage. The claims made on Mr Ss home insurance since 1991  total just above 
£85,000. 
UKI offered Mr S £2,600  to settle the complaint. Our adjudicator  believed  this was a fair
way to resolve Mr Ss complaint. 
Mr S disagreed and didnt  think the offer was fair. He says the increases are not justified and 
that its not fair to increase the premiums  because of claims made years previously.  
my findings 
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont have the power to tell a business  what its insurance should  have  cost.  I would be, in 
effect determining  or telling a business how it should  operate  and thats not my role. But I 
can look at whether UKI has treated Mr S fairly throughout the period he held his insurance 
policy. If I find that UKI hasnt treated Mr S fairly,  I will look to see what compensation  would 
be fair. Based on what Ive seen I think UKIs offer is fair in this case. Ill explain why. 
Mr Ss policy  started in 1982  but weve only been  able to obtain premium  history going back 
as far as 1991.  This isnt surprising considering  the length of time thats passed. In 1991 the 
policy cost £369.96  for the year. The premium increased over the years, and in 2015 was 
£1,341.78. Mr S1 says his father  asked him to review  his documents  and was shocked to 
discover how much UKI were charging  for his home insurance. Following this, Mr S called 
UKI in January  2016 and cancelled the policy saying he was unhappy with the cost.  
Ref: DRN44090182Between 1991 and 2001 Mr S made  numerous  claims totalling just over £32,473  and I think 
the most  likely cause of the price increases will be down to these claims  in this time the 
policy increased in cost from £369.96  to £752.04.  Often when someone makes  a claim, that 
will increase  their risk of claiming again,  so the cost of insurance at renewals goes up. In 
Mr Ss case, I think the price increases around  this time were fair due to his claims. 
After this, the cost of the policy went both up and down, but I think some  of these changes 
were because Mr S held a different type of policy for a few years. In 2007  I can see that 
accidental damage  cover was added to the policy as well as it changing back  to a full 
buildings and contents policy, which most  likely was the reason that the premium increased 
from £559.80 (2007)  to £762.18 (2008).
From 2009,  the policy continued to increase every year until it was cancelled.  I can see that 
there were three substantial claims made  in 2010  and 2011  for theft,  escape  of water and 
storm damage totalling just over £52,548. This again  wouldve had an impact on the 
premiums charged.  So around this time I think the price increases were most likely risk 
related due to his claims so I cannot  say UKI increased the price unfairly here. No further 
claims or amendments appear to have been  made to the policy after 2011. 
If Mr S didnt engage with UKI about  the cost of his premium, and UKI only increased the 
price of the insurance  because of this - that wouldnt be fair. UKI has offered to refund some  
of the premiums paid for the final few years of the policy. Its offered £2,600 to put things 
right. I think this is fair as it makes sure Mr S hasnt lost out if UKI did increase the price just 
because he didnt engage at each renewal  in these later years.
Mr S1 is unhappy with the offer and says he doesnt  think its fair for UKI to use old claims as 
a reason to increase the premium in the later years of the policy. Just because the amount 
claimed on the policy exceeded  the amount Mr S paid for the policy  dont necessarily mean 
UKI didnt  overcharge him for the policy. But the claims are something I do have to take into 
account - and as Ive said I think some of the price increases will be down to risk related 
reasons.
In particular, Mr S1 doesnt  agree  with the increase in premiums  between 2011 and 2012.  
He thinks the 2011  claim  was linked to the 1999  claim  relating  to escape of water  so it 
shouldnt impact the premium in 2012  which shouldve been  resolved in 1999. The premium 
in 2011 was £1,020.27  and increased  in 2012 to £1,056.16   a relatively modest increase of 
£35.89. So regardless  of the escape  of water claim  for £20,717.13  that UKI has recorded  as 
being paid in 2011, I wouldnt say the increase in premium between 2011 and 2012  was 
unreasonable.   
Mr S1 also points to the fact they were  able to find much cheaper home insurance when they 
looked online in 2016. New business  premiums  often  have  discounts  built into them   to 
effectively attract customers. As this was a new policy  being  quoted  in 2016, its likely Mr S1 
received a discount on the premium cost as well. So it wouldnt be fair for UKI to use this 
different policy  cost when  working out its offer. 
Mr S1 has also asked for our service to look at how his fathers policy  cost changed  over 
time compared to other, similar polices.  But I dont think that would be helpful  here as the 
claims history  means any changes of price  arent  just due to the passage of time.  
Mr S1 says the policy started in 1982 so this is when the refund should be calculated  from. 
Unfortunately, the earliest premium history  we have for Mr S is from 1991  so I dont know 
what happened with his premiums before then and I dont  think its reasonable to ask them  
Ref: DRN44090183to refund some of the premiums during  this time.  And, from what I know about the insurance 
industry, its likely  an introductory discount wouldve been applied  to Mr Ss policy  when it 
was originally set up  as is often  the case. I dont think its unfair  for an insurer to seek  to 
recoup that cost over the first few years. I think thats likely to be the reason for any increase 
in premiums in the early  years of the policy.  
Having considered UKIs offer,  I think its fair. It ensures Mr S hasnt lost out if UKI had 
treated him unfairly by increasing his premiums just because he hadnt been engaging at 
renewal during the later years of the policy.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, UK Insurance Limiteds offer is fair, and I dont think  it needs  to
do any more.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or
reject my decision  before 27 December  2019.
