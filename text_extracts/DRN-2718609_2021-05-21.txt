The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as R, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly 
declined its application for a new account. This meant R couldnt go on to apply for a 
Bounce Back Loan.
 
Rs director, Mr L, brings the complaint on its behalf.
What happened
R wanted to apply for a Bounce Back Loan. For it to do so, NatWest asked that it first apply 
for either a business current account or a Bounce Back Loan feeder account.
 
R applied for a feeder account. These accounts were used solely to draw down the loan 
funds and transfer them onward.
The application was declined, so Mr L complained about the decision. He said R was being 
prevented from accessing the support it needed. Mr L also set out that NatWest had 
repeatedly asked R for more information, and R had incurred costs as a result of the time the 
application had taken. 
In its final response, NatWest said its decision to decline Rs application remained the same. 
It acknowledged it had taken some time to reach a decision, and that it had asked R to 
provide more information on more than one occasion. But it explained this was a necessary 
part of the application process. Finally, NatWest said it had investigated other possibilities to 
assist R  but there was nothing further it could do. 
Mr L remained unhappy, so he referred Rs complaint to our service. An investigator here 
considered what had happened, but he didnt think NatWest had done anything wrong. In 
summary, he said:
Requiring applicants to open an account first allowed for anti-money laundering and 
Know Your Customer checks to be completed, in line with NatWests legal and 
regulatory obligations and as required under the Scheme;
NatWest could assess new account applications against its own criteria, and Rs had 
been assessed fairly. Additionally, NatWests requests for further information hadnt 
been unreasonable; and
NatWest wasnt obliged to provide any more information than it already had about the 
rationale for its decision.
Mr L disagreed with the investigator. He said, in summary, that he still felt NatWest had 
unfairly declined Rs application and been deliberately obstructive in making repeated 
requests for more information. He wanted R to be paid compensation for NatWests handling 
of the application and the length of time things had taken, as well as being reimbursed for 
the costs he said R had incurred.
 
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In support of his complaint, Mr L has made several detailed points. Ive summarised things in 
far less detail, and I may not have commented on everything Mr L has raised. I dont mean 
any discourtesy by this. Rather, my summary of Mr Ls concerns reflects the informal nature 
of our service.
Mr L has a personal account with NatWest  but he doesnt use it to run his business, R. 
Given R didnt have an existing business relationship with NatWest it was required  like any 
new customer  to open an account before it could apply for a Bounce Back Loan. And I 
think thats reasonable. I say that because the Scheme allowed NatWest the discretion to 
decide how it accepted applications from new customers. And by following an account 
opening process first, NatWest could complete anti-money laundering and Know Your 
Customer checks. These checks are an important legal and regulatory requirement, which 
were necessary under the Scheme rules.
Mr L was unhappy with NatWests repeated requests for more information about R 
throughout the application  and I can understand how this couldve been frustrating at the 
time. It also seems that, at first, NatWest mistakenly thought Mr L wished to switch Rs 
banking from its current provider. So its unfortunate there was some initial confusion over 
Rs application.
Having said that, I dont think NatWest unreasonably delayed Rs application or applied any 
unnecessary scrutiny toward it. NatWest has shown it had some legitimate questions over 
Rs application, specifically about Rs turnover. The bank requested some supporting 
documentation to corroborate what Mr L had outlined when he initially submitted the feeder 
account application. And because R wasnt an existing customer, I dont think that was 
unreasonable.
 
As a result of the time NatWest took to reach its decision Mr L wants it to pay R 
compensation, and he wants it to cover the costs he says R incurred while the application 
process was ongoing. But for the reasons Ive set out above, I dont think NatWest did 
anything wrong in how it handled Rs application. So I cant fairly require NatWest to pay R 
compensation or reimburse any costs it may have incurred.
Looking at the decision to decline the account application, NatWest has confirmed that this 
was assessed against its criteria. On that basis, Im satisfied it treated R fairly and not any 
differently to another new customer. And so, as Ive seen from NatWests records that Rs 
application didnt meet its criteria, I dont think it was wrong not to offer R an account.
  
I know Mr L is frustrated that NatWest wont explain in more detail why it declined Rs 
application. But as the investigator set out, NatWest isnt obliged to provide any more 
information than it already has. So, I cant fairly require that it does so.
To sum up, I dont think NatWest did anything wrong in how it handled Rs feeder account 
application  so Im not requiring it take any further action.My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask R to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 June 2021.
