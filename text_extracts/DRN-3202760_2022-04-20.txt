The complaint
Mr J complains that MBNA Limited increased the balance outstanding on his account when 
a promotional offer period ended.
What happened
Mr J had a credit card account with MBNA. He says that when a promotional rate finished at 
the end of May 2021 and start of June 2021 his total debt rose from £11,482.65 to 
£11,517.72. He says this shouldnt have happened. He says that when the promotional deal 
ended the sum of payments he made plus the interest should have resulted in his total 
indebtedness decreasing. He complained to MBNA.
MBNA investigated his complaint. It said that the promotional rate on his card ended on 6 
June 2021. The statement was produced on 27 June 2021. This meant that there was 21 
days interest added. That was why the outstanding balance increased.
Mr J didnt accept this. He said there was a merry go round of balance transfers which 
didnt work in the way that was advertised because it didnt allow consumers to get out of 
debt. Mr J said that due to his personal circumstances this matter had not only caused him 
financial loss but had also affected his mental health. He referred his complaint to our 
service.
Our investigator looked into his complaint. He considered the statements thatd been sent to 
Mr J. He noted that Mr Js balance had decreased every month during the period when the 
promotional offer had applied. There were two balance transfer promotional offers that 
applied  both were 0% interest. The first deal expired on 31 May 2021 and the second deal 
ended on 6 June 2021. Once the deals ended the standard rate applied. He said the reason 
why the outstanding balance on Mr Js account had increased was because the promotional 
rates both ended during the period since the previous statement had been issued and the 
new rate had been applied. He didnt think MBNA had done anything wrong.
Mr J didnt agree. He said that even if he was to do nothing when the 0% deals ended and 
his account moved to standard rates the sum of the payments received plus interest should 
still not result in the total indebtedness increasing.
Our investigator considered what Mr J said but he didnt change his view. So, the complaint 
has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the statements issued to Mr J on 26 May 2021 and 27 June 2021. 
The statement issued on 26 May 2021
This statement shows the opening balance was £11,065.21. After payments and other 
transactions during the period from 26 April to 26 May had been taken into account the 
balance was £11,473.02. 
MBNA then added interest of £9.63 (that was the interest charged for the period of the 
statement)  making the outstanding balance £11,482.65. Mr J was told that the minimum 
payment he should make was £124.46 and he should make that payment by 21 June 2021.
The statement also provides a breakdown of the balance and what interest rates apply to 
each element of the balance and the expiry date for any promotional interest rates. Mr Js 
statement showed that his balance was made up of four balance transfer amounts. Two of 
these amounts were at 0% interest. One expired on 31 May 2021 and another expired on 6 
June 2021. Mr J hasnt disputed the breakdown on the statement or the expiry dates stated 
there.
The statement includes a Summary Box which provides further information about interest 
charging and how the minimum repayment is calculated. It says:
There is no interest free period for balance transfers or money transfers (if 
available) when these are outside promotional offers.
We calculate interest daily based on the total amount you owe. We add together all 
the daily interest amounts in each statement period and add the total to your 
balance on your statement date.
Your monthly minimum payment will be an amount equal to the higher of £25 or the 
total of any interest charged.and 1% of the balance you owe shown in your 
statement..
So, the Summary Box information makes clear that once an interest free period on a balance 
transfer expires the standard rate will apply. It also makes clear that interest is calculated 
daily and these daily amounts are then added to the total balance on the following statement 
date. 
The May statement estimated that the interest which would be added to Mr Js statement at 
the following statement date would be £160.06. That estimate took into account the fact that 
the two 0% deals would be expiring before the next statement date.
The amount Mr J was asked to pay by 21 June 2021 was the minimum repayment of 
£124.46. Looking at the Summary Box information, that amount was calculated by adding
 
the interest charged on 26 May 2021 - £9.63 and 
1% of the balance outstanding on 26 May. 1% of the balance outstanding at 
that date was £114.83.
So, the minimum repayment requested was £124.46 (£9.63 + £114.83 = £124.46).  
Mr J says that even if he did nothing when his 0% deals ended the sum of the payments 
received plus interest should still result in the total indebtedness decreasing. But, having 
looked at the terms and conditions and the information on the Summary Box, Im not 
persuaded that this is correct. Because the minimum payment due on 21 June 2021 
(£124.46) was less than the estimated interest (£160.06) which would be applied on 27 June 
2021 (the next statement date) it was the case that his total indebtedness would increase on 
27 June 2021 unless he paid an amount greater than the minimum payment. He didnt do 
that.The statement issued on 27 June 2021
The opening balance was the same as the closing balance on the May statement. 
Mr J made the minimum repayment on 21 June 2021. The interest charged was £159.53. 
This was slightly less than the estimate which had appeared on the previous statement. But, 
it was greater than the minimum repayment which Mr J made on 21 June 2021. Thats why 
the total balance outstanding had increased. The interest charged was calculated in line with 
the interest rates which applied to the account during the period  as set out on the 
statement. 
The minimum payment due to be paid on or before 22 July 2021 included the interest 
charged on 27 June 2021. That was in line with the terms and conditions.
Having looked at everything here, Im satisfied MBNA didnt do anything wrong when it 
charged interest, at the standard rate after the promotional offer periods expired, and added 
it to the balance outstanding. In these circumstances, I dont require MBNA to have to do 
anything more to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold this complaint about MBNA Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 May 2022.
