The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) wouldnt let him withdraw 
cash at a branch.
What happened
In November 2020, Mr B tried to withdraw £3500 at a branch of NatWest. Hed forgotten his 
PIN number. He had ID on him. NatWest wouldnt cash the money. He went to another 
branch of NatWest and cashed £2500 later that day.
Mr B complained that hed been discriminated against. A customer ahead of him had also 
forgotten their PIN number but got their cash. And why was it that the second branch of 
NatWest were able to give him cash, when the first one wasnt?
NatWest said that in cases where large amounts of cash are being withdrawn, it comes 
down to branch discretion whether they allow it to take place or not  where its necessary to 
identify a customer. They agreed that Mr B had been inconvenienced and paid 
compensation of £100. NatWest said theyre a diverse organisation  and embrace different 
races, nationalities and religions. They confirmed their staff would never discriminate against 
customers or other staff.
Mr B brought his complaint to us. Our investigator looked at what had happened. She said 
that Mr B had forgotten his PIN. And - the branch didnt have a copy of Mr Bs signature, so 
they couldnt verify him that way. When that happens, NatWests procedures are that it was 
down to managerial discretion whether to provide the cash, or not. She couldnt comment on 
what happened at the second branch  as that wasnt part of Mr Bs complaint. Nor could 
she comment on how the other customer in the queue was treated  as she didnt know the 
details of that. She agreed that NatWests service couldve been better  and thought that 
NatWests compensation of £100 was fair and reasonable.
Mr B asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see where Mr B is coming from. He needed the cash and had transferred money into 
his NatWest account for that reason. He made a trip to the branch. But hed forgotten his 
PIN. He saw that a person in front of him had also forgotten their PIN but got their cash. He 
had a lot of ID documents with him. But the branch manager wouldnt allow him to get the 
cash. He went to another branch later that day and withdrew £2500. He says he suffers with 
mental health problems and what happened had made that worse.
So  he asks  why wasnt he allowed to make the withdrawal at the first branch, but he was 
at the second? He feels that this shows there was discrimination against him at the first 
branch.
Ive thought about Mr Bs complaint a lot, and our investigator asked a lot of questions of 
NatWest  as we wanted to be certain of what happened here. In cases like this, NatWest 
have processes they follow  to protect all customers. Mr B had forgotten his PIN, and 
NatWest didnt have a copy of his signature. So  in those circumstances, NatWest say they 
leave it to the manager to use his discretion whether to cash the money or not. There 
wouldve been a limit above which that would apply  NatWest cant tell us (or anyone else) 
what that is as its commercially sensitive. In this case, the manager at the first branch didnt 
feel able to agree. But as Mr B said, the manager at the second branch took a different view. 
Weve taken a testimony from the manager and staff at the first branch  and they say they 
simply followed processes. And there didnt seem to be anything out of the ordinary when 
they did. I cant comment on what happened with the other customer in the queue  they 
may have been cashing a lower amount, for example.
Mr B has asked why  given the processes  NatWests manager didnt suggest to him that 
a smaller amount of cash be withdrawn, which the manager might have agreed to. I can see 
his point  in an ideal world, this might have happened. But equally of course, it might not 
have helped  as Mr B had asked for £3500 cash, not anything less.
Ultimately, NatWests managers are paid to make judgments like this  but they are just that, 
and I can see that they can sometimes vary between managers  and I think thats whats 
happened here. Ive looked at the file and seen nothing to suggest there was any form of 
discrimination against Mr B. And NatWest have made it clear to us  and to Mr B  that 
theyd never discriminate against customers or staff. And while I wasnt at the branch when 
the incident happened, Im sure thats right. 
I was very sorry to learn of the inconvenience and distress caused to M B. I can see that he 
feels strongly. But Ive reviewed what happened and I believe that NatWests apology, and 
their compensation of £100 is what this service would expect to see. So  and I can 
appreciate that Mr B will be disappointed by this  I wont be asking NatWest to do anymore 
here. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 May 2021.
