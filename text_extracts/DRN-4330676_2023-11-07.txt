The complaint
Mrs C complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) wont remove the 
restrictions placed on her account without receipt of personal documentation relating to her 
husband whose card details had been added to the account. Mrs C wants her account 
restored or closed without providing the documentation requested. 
What happened
Mrs C holds a PayPal account. Mrs C added her husbands card details to the account. 
Following a review of Mrs Cs account PayPal added a limitation to Mrs Cs account and 
emailed her requesting a number of personal documents from Mrs Cs husband in order to 
verify his identity. Mrs Cs husband didnt want to provide the details requested due to data 
security concerns so Mrs C asked PayPal to delete his card or close her account  which 
PayPal refused to do.
PayPal says it has an obligation to comply with regulatory and banking policies and says it 
will only remove Mrs Cs husbands card or close the account once it receives the relevant 
documentation requested as it needs to verify certain information about her and users listed 
on her account. PayPal say it is acting in accordance with its user agreement and hasnt 
done anything wrong.
Mrs C was dissatisfied with this. She says the decision to suspend her account was taken 
out of the blue and not in response to her husbands card being added  as his card was 
added several years ago. She says PayPal are being unreasonable in not removing her 
husbands card or not closing the account and feels stuck in limbo. Mrs C brought her 
complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked into Mrs Cs concerns and reached the conclusion that 
PayPal was being unreasonably rigid in the application of its user agreement and that it was 
unreasonable for it not to remove Mrs Cs husbands card from the account especially as it is 
demanding personal information from someone who is not its customer. They thought 
PayPal should just remove the husbands card or close the account. 
PayPal disagreed. It says it is acting in accordance with its user agreement and hasnt done 
anything wrong and have asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My role here is to look at problems that Mrs C has experienced and see if PayPal have done 
anything wrong or treated Mrs C unfairly. Mrs C complains that PayPal are being 
unreasonable and treating her unfairly by refusing to remove her husbands card from her 
account or to close her account without receiving the documentation it requested.
And having considered everything provided, I have to agree. 
I fully appreciate PayPals need to ensure it complies with its regulatory and banking policies 
 in this case PayPal says it needs to satisfy itself of its users identity (including Mrs Cs 
husband) - and usually Id agree. But in this case Mrs Cs husband is not the account holder 
or customer using the account and Mrs C is asking that her husbands card be removed. So 
I fail to see why PayPal has the need to see or retain any of Mrs Cs husbands personal 
information. Indeed, by holding on to it this may be a breach of other regulations and laws.
I accept that by asking for this information PayPal have not done anything wrong and that 
initially when it carried out its review PayPal may well have needed this information. But 
things have now moved on and Mrs C is asking that as her husband wont authorise her to 
provide his personal information that PayPal just remove his card from the account or close 
the account.
PayPal has been offered a practical solution to resolve its customers complaint and for 
reasons that are unclear it refuses to move from its stance and resolve the matter. I think this 
is unreasonable and I dont think its fair to ask Mrs C to provide information which she isnt 
authorised to provide and which Im not satisfied PayPal needs. 
So it follows that I uphold Mrs Cs complaint and direct PayPal either remove Mrs Cs 
husband from her account and lift the limitations imposed or close the account. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained Ive decided to uphold Mrs Cs complaint and direct PayPal 
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA put things right as outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 December 2023.
