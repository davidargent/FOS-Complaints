The complaint
Mr S complains that The Co-operative Bank plc wont refund to him the £5,375 that he paid 
for a holiday club membership. 
What happened
Mr S and his wife entered into a purchase agreement to buy a holiday club membership in 
November 2010 and Mr S used his Co-op Bank credit card to pay £700.04 towards the 
purchase price of £5,375. Their then representative made claims to Co-op Bank in October 
2018 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1975 including that there had 
been a breach of contract, the timeshare had been misrepresented and that the relationship 
between Co-op Bank and Mr S was unfair. 
Co-op Bank said that the claim was time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980. Mr S wasnt 
satisfied with its response so a complaint was then made to this service. The complaint form 
said that a proper assessment of Mr Ss ability to afford the loan wasnt conducted, a 
commission was paid to the timeshare company which wasnt declared to Mr S and Mr S 
and his wife were unduly pressured into entering into contracts, all of which rendered the 
agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A. 
Mr S then provided information about three other related timeshare purchases that hed 
made. Our investigator said that the complaint had been made to Co-op Bank about the 
November 2010 purchase so he was unable to consider complaints arising from the other 
purchases as part of this complaint. Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ss complaint 
about the claims relating to the November 2010 purchase should be upheld. He thought that 
the claim under 75 was made outside of the time limits in the Limitation Act so it was fair for 
Co-op Bank to turn down that claim. He believed that it was unlikely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair debtorcreditor relationship so he didnt think that he could 
fairly say that Co-op Bank should accept Mr Ss claim under section 140A.
Mr S has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that the 
timeshare was mis-sold and that he and his wife were then roped into buying more 
timeshares.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ss complaint is that Co-op Bank turned down the Consumer Credit Act claims 
that hed made and I accept that he referred his complaint to our service within six 
years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to 
his claims;
Im not determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that, but Im considering whether or not Co-op Banks response to his 
claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Ss claims were made under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 
and the claims that were made to Co-op Bank and the complaint that was then made 
to this service clearly related to the purchase agreement that Mr S and his wife had 
entered into in November 2010;
Mr S has also entered into other agreements with the timeshare company but, as his 
claims to Co-op Bank didnt include claims about those agreements, Im unable to 
consider a complaint about those agreements in this decision  Mr S has made more 
recent claims about those agreements and they are being dealt with separately so, in 
this decision, Im only considering the complaint that Mr S has made about Co-op 
Banks response to his claims about the November 2010 purchase agreement;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ss claims under section 75 are that the timeshare was misrepresented to him 
and his wife and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to 
them and that theres been a breach of contract - if the criteria for those claim under 
section 75 were met, Co-op Bank would be expected to consider those claims unless 
they were brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case 
it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claims;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr S could have made a claim to the timeshare company or Co-op 
Bank about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife into buying 
the timeshare when they entered into the purchase agreement in November 2010 as 
that was when Mr S says that they entered into an agreement based on the 
misrepresentations of the timeshare company and suffered a loss as they used credit 
provided by Co-op Bank to pay part of the purchase price;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or Co-op Bank 
 but their claim wasnt made to Co-op Bank until October 2018, nearly eight years 
later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider 
that Mr Ss section 75 claim about the timeshare being misrepresented to him and his 
wife is now time-barred;
the time limit for a breach of contract claim in these circumstances is also six years 
from the date on which the cause of action accrued and I consider that Mr S would 
have known, or ought reasonably to have known, about the alleged breach of 
contract in 2011 but a claim wasnt made to Co-op Bank until October 2018  which 
was more than six years later and was outside of the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act so I consider that Mr Ss section 75 claim about a breach of contract is 
also time-barred;Mr S and his wifes then representative said that there was an unfair relationship 
between Mr S and Co-op Bank and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst 
other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
Ive not been provided with enough evidence to show that Mr Ss section 140A claim 
is time barred in these circumstances so I consider that Co-op Bank should have 
considered that part of his claim but, if it had done so, I consider it to be more likely 
than not that it would have concluded that the claim shouldnt be upheld;
Mr S chose to use his credit card to make a payment to the timeshare company and 
Ive seen no evidence to show that Co-op Bank paid a commission to the timeshare 
company  and even if it had done so I consider it to be unlikely that any commission 
would have been enough to cause the relationship between Mr S and Co-op Bank to 
be unfair;
Mr S and his wifes representative has referred to an overseas court judgment and 
says that the timeshare lasts for more than 50 years so Mr S and his wife are entitled 
to rescind the contract and that the agreement is in breach of European laws  but 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the agreement was 
illegal when it was entered into or that the timeshare company has breached any 
laws or regulations for which Co-op Bank would be liable under section 140A and I 
dont consider that the judgement causes the relationship between Mr S and Co-op 
Bank to be unfair;
Mr S and his wifes representative says that an affordability assessments wasnt 
conducted before Co-op Bank provided credit to Mr S - but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that the credit wasnt unaffordable for him and Ive seen no evidence to show 
that Mr S complained to Co-op Bank about the affordability of the credit before 
October 2018  and it appears to me from the credit card statements that Mr S has 
provided that his credit card account was well managed;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr S and his wife were 
unduly pressured into buying the timeshare or that the timeshare company used 
unacceptable commercial practices against them  they didnt complain to Co-op 
Bank about those issues before October 2018 and its clear that they entered into 
other purchase agreements with the timeshare company  if theyd been unduly 
pressurised by the timeshare company into entering into the November 2010 
purchase agreement I consider it to be unlikely that they would have then entered 
into other purchase agreements with the timeshare company;
Im not persuaded that its likely that a court would conclude that the relationship 
between Co-op Bank and Mr S was unfair in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr S and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their 
timeshare and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair 
or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Co-op Bank to refund to Mr S 
any of the money that he paid for the timeshare, to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 October 2022.
