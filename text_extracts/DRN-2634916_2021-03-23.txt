The complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain that they were given incorrect information in 2019 by National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) about a Reward Platinum Account (RPA) they held, and 
they lost out as a result.
What happened
Mr and Mrs B say that NatWest told them in a phone call in May 2019 that their sons mobile 
phone was covered under the insurance policy they had through their RPA. But when they 
tried to claim on the policy, the claim was declined.
NatWest says it has no record of the call. It also says that it provided written information 
about the RPA that made it clear that Mr and Mrs Bs sons phone would not be covered.
Our adjudicator did not uphold Mr and Mrs Bs complaint. Mr and Mrs B disagree so it has 
come to me to consider.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my view, NatWest has provided reasonable evidence that its more likely than not it gave 
the correct information about the mobile phone insurance policy to Mr and Mrs B in writing 
when they took out the RPA and later reminded them correctly, also in writing, of the cover 
they were entitled to.
I note Mr and Mrs Bs comments about what they think Nat West has said to them about the 
call they believe they made in May 2019. But NatWest has not agreed it gave them incorrect 
information about the RPA otherwise it would not have defended this case.
NatWest has provided evidence that it has no record of a call from Mr B or Mrs Bs phone 
numbers. Mr and Mrs B say they didnt have any other phones and they havent provided 
any further information that would enable the call to be identified. 
So, I think its more likely than not that Mr and Mrs B didnt speak to NatWest in May 2019 
and hence NatWest has only given them the correct information about their policy which was 
in writing as described above.
So, in my view, I cant make a finding that NatWest did anything wrong.
For completeness, this complaint was against NatWest and I can only review the evidence 
that NatWest can provide. If Mr and Mrs B believe they may alternatively have spoken to one 
of the benefit providers in May 2019, they can still raise a complaint against that party, and if 
that is unresolved it could be brought to this service as a separate case.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr and Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B and Mr B to 
accept or reject my decision before 20 April 2021.
