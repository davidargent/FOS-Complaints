The complaint
Mr S entered into a 120-month Fixed Sum Loan Agreement in September 2017 with a 
financial services provider. This loan was then taken over by another provider, which 
subsequently changed its name to Propensio Finance Limited. During 2021, Ms S asked 
Propensio for an early settlement figure  which, when provided, he thought was too high. 
Mr S complained to Propensio and, after consideration, it offered him a revised (reduced) 
figure. But he thinks the revised figure is still too high, and he wants Propensio to accept a 
further reduced figure. 
What happened
Mr Ss loan was for £20,000. He made all the regular monthly repayments in the period 
before asking Propensio for an early settlement figure. He said these repayments totalled 
roundly £13,000. 
Propensio said that Mr Ss loan agreement required it to follow the appropriate early 
settlement regulations, when it calculated the rebate to be included in his settlement figure. 
The first figure, provided by Propensio in August 2021, was a little under £19,000  which 
Mr S challenged. 
In September 2021, Propensio offered a revised settlement figure of a little over £15,000, 
which it said was well over £3,000 less than the contractual figure. This figure reduced to just 
under £15,000 in October 2021 (because of a monthly repayment made by Mr S).  
But Mr S suggested that Propensio should accept a payment £10,000 in full and final 
settlement. Propensio did not accept, and so Mr S referred his complaint to us later in 
October 2021. 
In his complaint form, Mr S made us aware of recent family difficulties, including the death of 
one close relative, and the very serious illness affecting another close relative. Propensio 
responded to these difficulties in late February 2022, by offering to accept a full and final 
settlement of £12,500, and by adding that any subsequent monthly repayments made by 
Mr S would be deducted from this figure.
Our investigator concluded that Propensios most recent offer was very reasonable, and that 
it would not be fair to ask it to go any further. Mr S disagreed with our investigator, and so 
this complaint was referred for review by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I sympathise with Mr S. Propensio said his family had suffered tragic events, and I share this 
view.
But Mr S agreed to borrow £20,000 from Propensio, to be repaid over 120 months  and, in 
order to do so, he agreed to pay credit charges of a little under £26,000. His monthly 
repayments were a little under £400, and he should have made 47 payments between 
September 2017 and August 2021. These total just under £18,000. 
The August 2021 figure of a little under £19,000 to settle Mr Ss agreement account included 
a credit charges rebate of a little under £15,000. The credit charges (and the rebate) reflect 
the relatively high interest rate offered by the original financial services provider (unchanged 
by Propensio) and accepted by Mr S. 
The agreement still had more than 60% of its term to go in August 2021, while the rebate 
was less than 60% of the credit charges. But this reflects the way that interest, as opposed 
to the £20,000 principal, is repaid in such agreements.  
In August 2021, Propensio worked out what the contractual settlement figure should be, and 
then in September 2021 it offered to reduce the figure. And in February 2022, it offered to 
further reduce the figure.
Propensio is not asking Mr S to make the settlement payment. Mr Ss agreement says that 
he continues to make the stipulated monthly repayments until September 2027. If Mr S has 
financial difficulties in making these repayments, then he should tell Propensio and ask it to 
help him. Propensio is required to respond sympathetically and positively to such requests.
Mr S is saying that the February 2022 settlement offer of £12,500 is too high, and that 
Propensio should accept a payment £10,000. But I must take into account the figures in 
Mr Ss agreement with it, as outlined above. 
So, I find that Propensio has acknowledged Mr Ss family difficulties, and that it has made an 
appropriate offer to discount the contractual settlement figure. This means that I have come 
to the same conclusion as our investigator, for similar reasons. 
(I also need to note that the February 2022 settlement offer reduces in each month that Mr S 
makes a repayment, by the amount of that repayment. The offer could be less than £10,000 
in September 2022.)  
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision before 30 September 2022.
