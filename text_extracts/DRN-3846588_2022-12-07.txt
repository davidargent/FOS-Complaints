The complaint
Mrs S complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money irresponsibly 
provided her with a credit card and increased the credit limit when she was unable to afford 
the repayments.
What happened
Mrs S was provided with a credit card by 118 118 Money on 9 February 2021. It had an 
initial limit of £1,200. She didnt use the card until November 2021. The credit limit was 
increased by 118 118 Money (i.e. not by her application) to £1,700 on 10 February 2022. 
She complained to 118 118 Money that it should never have issued the card to her. In 2021 
she earned an income of £1,200 a month and said she had outgoings of over £3,300. 
Overall, she said she had debts of over £20,000. She also said that in February 2022 when 
118 118 Money increased the limit it should have noticed that she was only making minimum 
payments and had markers for late payments.
118 118 Money pointed out that Mrs S had declared an income of £2,015 a month. It 
explained that its application was very detailed and it carried out a credit check when she 
took out the card and when the limit was increased. It pointed out that she had signed a 
declaration that her answers on the application form were true and accurate.
On referral to the Financial Ombudsman Service our adjudicator said that 118 118 Money 
should have done further checks on Mrs Ss expenditure but without this information he 
couldnt uphold the complaint.
Mrs S provided bank statements for the months leading up to and including the dates of 
issue of the card and the credit limit increase. However our adjudicator said that the 
expenditure shown on the statements didnt show the card to be unaffordable. He pointed 
out that 118 118 Money wasnt required by the rules to review bank statements so it was 
reasonable for it to rely on Mrs Ss statement regarding her income, even though the bank 
statements showed a much lower amount.
I issued a provisional decision. In it I said I didnt think that 118 118 Money should have 
issued the credit card or increased the limit.
Neither party responded to my provisional findings.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My provisional findings are set out below in italics:
Considering the relevant rules, guidance, and good industry practice, I think the questions I 
need to consider in deciding whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint are:
Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mrs S would be able to repay the credit advanced in a sustainable way?
If not, would those checks have shown that Mrs S would have been able to do so?
Bearing in mind the circumstances at the time of each application, was there a point 
where 118 118 Money ought reasonably to have realised it was increasing Mrs Ss 
indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and so shouldnt 
have provided further credit?
issue of the card
At the time of Mrs S applying for the credit card 118 118 Money relied on a detailed 
application and a credit check to assess whether the credit was affordable to her. As far as I 
can see it didnt verify her income, which she said was £2,015 a month. Yet in the bank 
statements she has subsequently shown us this was actually around £1,200 a month.  If she 
had declared this figure then the credit card would clearly have been unaffordable.
The credit report showed that Mrs S had four credit cards with total balances of around 
£1,260. One had three missed payments. She had a mail order account with a balance of 
£2,115, and her bank account was overdarawn by around £280. She also had a County 
Court Judgement (CCJ) against her in the sum of £2,224, which didnt appear to have any 
provision for payment. If I allow 5% payments of the balances on the credit cards and for the 
CCJ and mail order accounts, I calculate that she would have been paying around £550 and 
allowing for the minimum payment on the full amount of credit now being given to her this 
would still have been about 29% of the declared income, which in my view was high.
Bearing in mind her overdraft, the number of credit cards she already had and the fact that 
she had an undischarged CCJ, I think 118 118 Money should have carried out more 
investigation of her financial circumstances. And whilst 118 118 Money isnt required by the 
Consumer Credit (CONC) rules to consider bank statements, CONC 5.2.A.16 does state:
For the purpose of considering the customers income under CONC 5.2A 15R it is not 
generally sufficient to rely solely on a statement of current income made by the customers 
without independent evidence.
Im not persuaded in this case that it was sufficient to rely on Mrs Ss own statement of what 
her income was, and that 118 118 Money would have been alerted to carry out more 
investigation of Mrs Ss circumstances.  And if 118 118 Money had verified her income, as 
Ive set above its most likely that the credit wouldnt have been affordable. So I dont think 
that 118 118 Money acted fairly in issuing the card.
increase in credit limit
Mrs S didnt use the card until November 2021 when she spent £1,113 in a month. I see 
from the credit report that she now had five credit cards with balances on them, including the 
118 118 Money card and a card that was apparently issued on the same day which had a 
balance of £956. Her credit commitments had increased to around £930 a month though this 
allows a payment towards the CCJ which it looked like was still outstanding without any 
arrangement to pay. 118 118 Money didnt update Mrs Ss income and expenditure, so it will 
have assumed it remained the same. But even allowing for an income of £2,015 a month 
Mrs Ss credit commitments would still be over 46% of her income, and almost all of her 
actual income.
It goes without saying that if 118 118 Money shouldnt have issued the card it clearly couldnt be increasing the credit limit. With the sort of figures mentioned even if Mrs S had 
approached 118 118 Money for a new credit card at this time it would have been clearly 
unaffordable.
So, I think 118 118 Money shouldnt have issued the credit card or increased the limit.
As neither party has responded to my provisional findings, those findings are now final and 
form part of this final decision.
Putting things right
As I dont think 118 118 Money ought to have opened the account, I dont think its fair for it 
to be able to charge any interest or charges under the credit agreement. But I think Mrs S 
should pay back the amounts they have borrowed. Therefore, 118 118 Money should:
Rework the account removing all interest and charges that have been applied. 
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Mrs S along with 8% 
simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the date of 
settlement. 118 118 Money should also remove all adverse information regarding this 
account from Mrs Ss credit file. 
Or, if after the rework there is still an outstanding balance, 118 118 Money should 
arrange an affordable repayment plan with Mrs S for the remaining amount. Once Mrs S 
has cleared the balance, any adverse information in relation to the account should be 
removed from their credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to deduct tax from any award of interest. 
It must give Mrs S a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if she asks for one. 
If it intends to apply the refund to reduce an outstanding balance, it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
My final decision
I uphold the complaint and require Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money to 
carry out the remedy set out under Putting things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2023.
