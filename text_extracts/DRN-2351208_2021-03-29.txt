DRN-2351208
The complaint
Mr D is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA hasnt provided a refund under its 
Buyer Protection scheme.
What happened
In December 2019 Mr D bought a watch and paid for it using his PayPal account. This meant 
the item came with 180 days of Buyer Protection under the account terms. Mr D wasnt 
happy with the watch when it arrived, so he contacted the seller to ask for a refund  but 
didnt get a reply. In January 2020 Mr D approached PayPal for help in recovering the 
amount paid for the watch  saying it wasnt authentic and the date dial didnt work. PayPal 
raised a dispute with the seller, who offered a partial refund. But Mr D rejected that offer.
After making enquiries with the seller, PayPal contacted Mr D at the start of February 2020 
to say he was entitled to a full refund as the item was deemed significantly different from 
originally described. PayPal asked that the watch be returned to the seller, with proof of 
postage sent through to the resolution centre, before 11 February 2020. 
PayPal sent Mr D a generic message on 4 February that said If you have additional 
information, please send it to us. Mr D responded on the same day to say the watch had 
been returned to the seller. On 8 February PayPal sent the same generic Provide additional 
information message, and Mr D repeated that the item had already been returned.
On 11 February 2020 PayPal notified Mr D that it had found in favour of the seller and closed 
the dispute, as proof of the watch being returned hadnt been received by the deadline. Mr D 
replied shortly after with proof that the item had been posted on 4 February, but PayPal said 
it wouldnt re-open the dispute. He raised a complaint about the decision, but PayPals 
response was that its procedures had been followed correctly. Mr D wasnt happy with 
PayPals answer, so he referred the complaint to our service for review.
An investigator here thought PayPal had acted unfairly by not re-opening the dispute once 
proof of postage was received. He accepted that PayPal had certain procedures in place to 
progress disputes, but as everything had happened within the 180-day period he thought 
PayPal should refund the cost of the item to Mr D. PayPal didnt agree  it said Mr D hadnt 
complied with the terms requiring co-operation in timely manner by not sending the proof 
before the deadline. That meant they were entitled to closed the dispute in the sellers 
favour.
As PayPal didnt accept the investigators view the case was passed to me for a final 
decision the matter.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding Mr Ds complaint  and for broadly the same reasons given 
by the investigator.
PayPals Buyer Protection policy terms say a dispute must be raised within 180 days, and I 
can see Mr D did that in this case. There isnt a set time limit on when a dispute must be 
settled once initiated  but there are terms requiring both the buyer and payment recipient to 
provide documentary evidence to support their position in a timely manner. Its on this basis 
that PayPal closed the dispute in the sellers favour, having agreed that Mr D was entitled to 
a refund under the scheme provisions. I dont think that was fair or reasonable in the 
circumstances  and Ive explained why below.
I appreciate why PayPal would want to progress disputes in a timely manner, and that it sets 
deadlines to help achieve that. I also accept that the message giving the deadline, from the 
start of February 2020, was clear on what needed to be sent by then. But PayPal said it 
would only close the claim without giving Mr D a refund if it didnt hear from him before the 
deadline  and it did hear from him, twice.
Mr D responded to both generic reminders sent by PayPal, and was clearly engaged in the 
dispute but unsure about what PayPal still needed to see. PayPals messages said it needed 
additional information, but not what that was  so I can understand why Mr D was confused. 
As soon as PayPal specified that the proof of postage was what had been outstanding 
(when it told Mr D it had settled the dispute in the sellers favour), he replied with that 
evidence straightaway. So I think PayPal ought to have realised Mr D hadnt understood its 
generic messages, and would have otherwise provided what was required in time.  
PayPal has said it needed to be fair to both parties, which is why it had to verify the seller 
received the item back. But not providing proof of postage by the deadline in this case did 
not prejudice the seller  as Mr D was able to demonstrate the item had already been 
returned. So I dont think it was fair or reasonable that PayPal decided not to re-open the 
dispute in the circumstances. Therefore PayPal should now pay the refund amount as if it 
had been re-opened, and add interest for the time Mr D has been without those funds.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ds complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, 
and direct it to:
refund the transaction value ($72) to Mr Ds account, and
pay 8% yearly simple interest on that refund amount  calculated from the date proof 
of postage was provided (12 February 2020) until the date settlement is paid to Mr D.
If PayPal considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to withhold income tax from 
the interest, it should tell Mr D how much its taken off. It should also give Mr D a tax 
deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2021.
