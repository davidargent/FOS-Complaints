K821x#15Complaint
Mr T has complained about short-term  loans granted  to him by CashEuroNet  UK LLC trading 
as QuickQuid. Mr T says he couldnt  afford these loans and that QuickQuid  didnt take 
appropriate steps to check whether he could afford them when he took them out. 
Background
QuickQuid agreed 20 short-term loans for Mr T between April 2014 and December 2017. 
Each loan was repayable over between one and three months,  with the exception of loans 4 
and 5. Loans 4 and 5 were flexible credit  agreements (flex-credit).  These were credit facilities 
that allowed  Mr T to draw down money  up to a pre-agreed credit  limit, with a view to 
repaying them  potentially over a period of up to 10 months.
Several of Mr Ts loans were topped up, sometimes on more  than one occasion  - this is 
where Mr T took out further  borrowing under the same  agreement,  before paying  back  the 
initial amount  borrowed.  He also re-financed  loan 7 - this is where  he took out further 
borrowing under  the same  agreement,  before paying back the initial amount borrowed, and 
agreed a new repayment  schedule. 
Ive set out a summary of the lending below.

One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Ts complaint already and recommended  the 
complaint be upheld. He felt the checks QuickQuid carried out on all of the loans were not 
proportionate. He thought  that had QuickQuid  carried out proportionate checks on these 
loans, it wouldve likely  concluded that they wouldve all been unaffordable for Mr T, and 
therefore, as a responsible lender, would not have  agreed to them
Mr T accepted the adjudicators findings  and raised  no new arguments  in response to the 
opinion. QuickQuid however, rejected the findings.  So as no agreements been  reached at 
this stage, the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
QuickQuid initially said it carried out appropriate and proportionate checks when  Mr T 
applied for his loans,  which included validation  of Mr Ts income. It also said,  both in its final 
response, and in response to the adjudicators assessment, that starting 1 March 2015, 
before Mr T borrowed his sixth loan,  it had implemented an affordability assessment that 
was consistent  with the FCA Handbook  and that was in place at the time it received 
authorisation by the FCA. It says this confirms  its assessments were  conducted  properly and 
individually for these applications.  
QuickQuid has raised  this generic argument across  many cases  brought  to our service. And 
this service has addressed this  specific point by QuickQuid  in several previous decisions, so I 
wont expand on it any further  here.  As by now, QuickQuid will be aware  that my role is to 
look not only into the rules  and regulations  set by the regulator  at the time of borrowing, but 
also the law, good industry  practice  and all the available evidence and arguments, to help 
decide whether  I think what  the business  has done is right or not. So my decision will focus  
on the specifics of Mr Ts complaint and what both parties have said about this.
Having looked  at this case,  I dont think QuickQuid was right to provide Mr T with any of the 
loans it gave him, including all top-ups and re-finances of those loans. Ill explain why.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr T 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and Mr Ts income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN96741333But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Ts complaint.  These questions are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr T would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr T would  have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Ts indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
1. Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  
itself that Mr T would be able to repay  in a sustainable way?  If not, would those  checks  have 
shown that Mr T would have been able to do so?
When QuickQuid provided  Mr T with his first two loans, it seems to have  taken details about 
Mr Ts income  before agreeing to lend. However given the amounts  Mr T was borrowing 
(£150 and £250) against the monthly income  hed declared of £1,200, I think QuickQuid 
shouldve also made enquiries into Mr Ts regular  financial commitments and living costs 
before agreeing to lend to him at this stage. 
Had it done so, I think  it wouldve seen that at the time Mr T applied for loans 1 and 2, his 
monthly living costs came  to around  £900. It wouldve also seen that he had regular monthly 
credit commitments  that totalled  almost £200, putting his total monthly  outgoings close to 
£1,100. This meant that when he applied for loans 1 and 2, his monthly disposable income  
was in the region of just £100, which was insufficient  to meet the repayments  on both 
loans 1 and 2, which were £173  and £300 respectively. So as a responsible lender, I dont 
think QuickQuid wouldve agreed  to loans 1 and 2 had it carried  out proportionate checks. 
Loan 3 was for £150, and was taken out the day after loan 2 was settled, and then topped 
up by a further £100 just four days later. Given  how soon this loan had been  taken  out after 
loan 2 was settled, I think that QuickQuid should not only have asked Mr T about  his regular 
monthly income and expenditure  at this point, but shouldve also enquired  specifically into 
whether he had any other short-term credit owing at this point as well. And I think  it 
shouldve done  this for loan 3, the top-up  on loan 3, and loan 4 (the flex-credit  account).
Ref: DRN96741334Had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks for loans 3, 3a and 4, it wouldve seen  that 
while Mr T didnt  appear to have any other short-term credit outstanding, he was still 
spending in the region of £900 a month on his regular monthly living costs, and owed around 
£200 a month towards his regular credit  commitments. So this again left him with around  
£100 a month in disposable income.
The highest  monthly repayments Mr T was due to repay on loans 3 - 4 loans were  £300 and 
£225 respectively.  So with a disposable  income of around just £100, proportionate  checks  
wouldve revealed to QuickQuid that loans  3 and 4 were not sustainably affordable for Mr T, 
and as a responsible lender I dont  think it wouldve  agreed to these knowing this.
Loan 5 was again a flexible credit facility. This facility came with a £750 credit limit and a 
highest potential  monthly repayment  of £257.  Given this was now Mr Ts fifth loan, I think by 
this point, QuickQuid  shouldve been building a full picture of Mr Ts financial  position and 
verifying the information it was given before agreeing to lend any further.
Had QuickQuid carried out a full review of Mr Ts financial  circumstances,  it wouldve  seen  
that when Mr T applied for loan 5 (his second  flex-credit account), his monthly income was a 
little higher than hed declared, and he was earning  around £1,360  a month.  It wouldve also 
seen that while his living costs were around £900  a month, his monthly  credit  commitments 
had increased  considerably to over £700  a month. So proportionate checks  wouldve shown 
QuickQuid, that at the time Mr T took out loan 5, his monthly outgoings already exceed his 
monthly income, and he was in no position  to commit to any further  credit  at this time.  
2. Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ts indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at which 
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think that this point 
was reached by the time he applied for loan 6. I say this because:
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid at this point. 
And was in effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an 
extended period
the amount  Mr T was borrowing had steadily been increasing, and QuickQuid ought 
to have realised it was likely his indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably 
I think that Mr T lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ts 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
Ref: DRN96741335So Im upholding  Mr Ts complaint about loan 6 onwards,  because  the overall  pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr T in some 
other way.  
In summary,  I dont think QuickQuid should have approved loans  1 to 20 for Mr T, and I think 
Mr T has lost out as a result. 
What QuickQuid needs to do to put things right 
I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  approved  loans 1 to 20 for Mr T. So it needs to refund 
all the interest and charges Mr T paid towards  these.
Specifically, it should:
-refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  1  20, including  all top-ups and 
re-finances of these loans;
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple  from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*; 
-remove any negative information  about loans 1 - 5, including all top-ups and 
re-finances of these loans from Mr Ts credit  file;
-the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 20, including all top-ups and 
re-finances of these loans should  be removed from Mr Ts credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr T a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mr Ts complaint. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 August 2019.
