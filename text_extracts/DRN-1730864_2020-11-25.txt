The complaint
 Mr B has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) sold his debt without 
telling him and incorrectly reported additional defaults on his accounts to the credit reference 
agencies. 
Background
Mr B told our service he called NatWest in January 2017 to discuss the overdraft charges on 
two of his accounts. Mr B said that after talking through some options, he asked NatWest to 
get back in contact with him  but it didnt. Mr B travelled abroad in April 2017. On his return 
to the UK he found the accounts had been defaulted and passed to NatWests agent, who Ill 
refer to as W, to manage.
Mr B called NatWest but has said he was told to speak to W instead. Mr B did as he was 
asked and agreed a payment plan of Â£50 per month with W.
Shortly after, Mr B began looking for rental accommodation, but as there were defaults on 
his credit file, the rental company told him hed need a guarantor, or to pay an additional 
deposit. Mr B wasnt able to do either of these things at the time and so approached 
NatWest once more. NatWest again asked him to speak with W, the company that managed 
the debt.
Mr B has said W was unwilling to discuss a settlement with him despite having previously 
sent letters about it. Hes said he sent a cheque and a letter to W for the amount he believed 
was still outstanding. Some time after, he noticed the accounts change from defaulted to 
settled status on his credit file. He believed this meant the cheque had been accepted.
However, when later checking his credit file, he noticed the defaults had reappeared and the 
file was now showing four defaults instead of two. It was around this time he found out that 
the debt had been sold to a third-party company, who Ill call C.
Mr B complained to NatWest about the handling of his debt. NatWest responded to say it 
was unable to agree the accounts had been sold incorrectly. NatWest said that when it 
transferred the ownership of the accounts to C, it reported the accounts to the credit 
reference agencies as satisfied and assigned as sold with a default showing on each of 
the two accounts.
NatWest told Mr B that C had confirmed it hadnt reported new defaults on his file  only a 
continuation of the defaults already applied by NatWest. It reiterated that duplicate defaults 
hadnt been reported on either of the accounts. 
Mr B remained dissatisfied with NatWests response and so our services investigator looked 
into Mr Bs complaint. She thought NatWest had done enough to make Mr B aware of the 
defaults and the sale of the accounts. She also said that NatWest wouldnt be able to 
remove the defaults from his account as its required to report accurate information to the 
credit reference agencies. She added that if Mr B felt C had incorrectly reported defaults on 
his credit file, hed need to approach C directly. 
Mr B didnt accept the investigators view. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint and so its been passed to me to consider. During this time, the investigator 
contacted the credit reference agency to ask if defaulted accounts ever show up twice on a 
credit report. It explained it was possible for a default to appear twice if the account had 
been sold to another company, as in Mr Bs case. It said the NatWest entries have remained 
on the credit file to show where the debt originated from and no longer impacted Mr Bs 
credit score.
Our investigator forwarded its comments to Mr B, however he hasnt responded and so Ive 
continued to look into his complaint.
Findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not going to ask NatWest to do any more in relation to Mr Bs complaint 
and Id like to explain why.
Ive first considered whether NatWest acted fairly when recording Mr Bs accounts as being 
in default. 
NatWests contact notes indicate Mr B called towards the end of December 2016. The notes 
state the adviser explained that because Mr Bs overdraft accounts hadnt been used for 
over 12 months, theyd need to be repaid. The note goes on to say the adviser gave Mr B 
seven days to get back in contact and that hed been made aware of the consequences of 
not doing so. Ive seen no further records of Mr B calling NatWest until 21 October 2017.
I appreciate Mr B told our service he asked NatWest to get back in contact with him, but the 
notes from around that time indicate otherwise. While its possible there was a 
miscommunication between the adviser and Mr B, Ive had to think about the strength of the 
evidence on file. As Mr Bs recollections are from three years ago, but NatWests contact 
note was created at the time of the call, I think its more likely that the contact notes more 
accurately reflects what was said during the call. 
And, as it seems Mr B didnt call NatWest back within seven days  as the note says he was 
asked to  I dont think NatWest acted unfairly when it took steps to default the account.
The Consumer Credit Act 1974 requires a business to send a default notice before taking 
measures, such as terminating the agreement, or demanding earlier payment of any sum. 
Section 88 of the Act says the default notice must specify the following things:
a) the nature of the alleged breach;
b) if the breach is capable of remedy, what action is required to remedy it and the     
date before which that action is to be taken; 
c) if the breach is not capable of remedy, the sum (if any) required to be paid as 
compensation for the breach, and the date before which it is to be paid. 
NatWest has provided a copy of the default notice it sent in January 2017. It appears to meet 
the requirements quoted above and is correctly addressed. NatWests contact notes show the entries: Default Notice Issued on 6 January 2017 and 
Formal Demand issued on 6 February 2017. While Mr B has said he didnt receive any 
letters in relation to the default, I think it more likely than not, given the correctly addressed 
default notice and the system notes, that they were sent. Because of this, I think itd be 
unfair to hold NatWest responsible for the letters not being delivered, as it appears to have 
done everything Id reasonably expect it to do under the circumstances. 
NatWests terms allow it to sell debt under certain conditions. Section 11.5  Transferring 
rights or obligations under this agreement  states;
We may transfer our rights or responsibilities under this agreement to another 
person or organisation in the future. Well only do this if we reasonably believe that 
youll be treated to a similar standard after the transfer as we treated you 
beforehand.
NatWest sold Mr Bs debt in 2019, more than two years after the default notice was issued. 
Mr B said hed sent a cheque for what he thought was the outstanding amount, despite no 
formal settlement agreement being reached between himself and W. Under these 
circumstances, I dont think it unreasonable to expect Mr B make enquiries with W as to 
whether the debt was settled. But it appears the debt remained outstanding and was later 
sold by NatWest in line with its terms. So I dont think NatWest has done anything wrong in 
this respect either.
Ive also thought about Mr Bs complaint point that four defaults showed on his credit file 
instead of two. NatWest has confirmed it only reported two defaults  one on each account. 
It said it checked with C, the buyer of the debt, as to whether more defaults were added. 
According to NatWest, C hasnt reported any additional defaults, but is obliged to report a 
continuation of the defaults already recorded. Because of this, C is reporting the defaults on 
NatWests behalf.
Mr B provided a screenshot which he believes show four defaults have been reported. As 
mentioned above, the credit reference agency has said that while it may appear this way, it 
isnt the case, and C is reporting the original defaults to show where the debt originated 
from. So, based on this, I dont think NatWest incorrectly reported additional defaults on 
Mr Bs account to the credit reference agencies. 
While I understand how disappointed Mr B is, for the reasons set out above Im unable to 
find that NatWest made an error in how it reported the defaults or sold Mr Bs debt, and so 
Im unable to uphold his complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint against 
National Westminster Bank Plc.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 December 2020.
