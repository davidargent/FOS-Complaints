The complaint
Mr J complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) refused his request to 
withdraw cash in branch. 
What happened
In May 2021 £9,000 was credited to Mr Js current account with NatWest. The following day, 
Mr J visited a NatWest branch and asked to withdraw £7,500. Mr J says NatWest asked him 
questions about the deposit and withdrawal and he explained he intended to purchase a car. 
NatWest also asked Mr J for identification and he provided a drivers licence. But the 
address on the drivers licence didnt match the one on NatWests systems. 
Mr J has told us that NatWest declined his withdrawal request and said hed need to wait 24 
hours to proceed. Mr J says his address was amended in branch and he was able to 
withdraw £8,500 the following day. 
Mr J complained and NatWest sent him a final response. NatWest didnt uphold Mr Js 
complaint and said its branch staff had to complete additional checks when processing the 
withdrawal request and that its account terms allow it to decline a transaction. NatWest said 
the step was taken to protect Mr Js account and apologised for any inconvenience caused. 
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Js complaint but thought NatWest had acted 
reasonably by completing further checks before approving a large cash withdrawal. In 
response, Mr J said he was concerned that branch staffs actions were racially motivated 
and discriminatory. The investigator went back to NatWest which confirmed Mr Js address 
didnt match his identification during his visit and that additional steps are required for all 
withdrawals over £2,000. 
Mr J asked to appeal, so his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr J has told us he has carried out similar withdrawals in the past to purchase and sell cars 
and was surprised that he was unable to proceed in branch. I understand Mr J intended to 
buy a car with the hope of selling it on at a profit. And the branchs decision not to approve 
his withdrawal impacted that. I can appreciate why Mr J found the process to be frustrating. 
Whilst I can see there was some inconvenience for Mr J, I have to balance that against 
NatWests responsibility to protect customer accounts. NatWest has provided a link to its 
website that sets out how it deals with cash withdrawals of over £2,000 in branch. The 
website says: 
Our primary aim is to keep customers safe and secure, and out branches follow our 
processes carefully to achieve this. 
This will include asking you questions about the purpose of your cash withdrawal, and in 
some cases, for supporting documentation such as an invoice. This helps us validate the 
withdrawal as genuine and protect you against fraud and scams. 
The website goes on to copy the specific section of its terms and conditions that says it can 
decline a cash withdrawal in certain circumstances. It says: 
In some instances, we may choose to decline the cash withdrawal based on the information 
provided surrounding the transaction. This would only ever be in situations where we need to 
safeguard our customers and will be at the branchs own discretion 
The guidance goes on to say that when attending the branch customers should take 
identification, paperwork to support the payment purpose and be prepared for staff to ask 
questions that can take up to 30 minutes. 
Im satisfied the guidance NatWest provides along with its account terms set out that the 
process for completing large cash withdrawals is reasonably involved. And its clear the 
normal process involves asking pointed questions about the transactions and purpose of the 
withdrawal. 
Mr J has told us branch staffs actions went beyond the questions it needed to ask and that 
he felt racially profiled. I can understand why Mr J feels that way, but having looked at the 
evidence I dont think NatWest has acted unfairly. As Ive set out above, large cash 
withdrawals are subject to detailed checks and question for all customers. Ive considered 
whether Mr J was treated differently to other customers, but the information Ive seen shows 
NatWest followed the normal approach it applies generally. 
We asked NatWest to give a more detailed picture of why it declined the withdrawal request. 
NatWest said that the transaction was unusual in terms of Mr Js account history. I can see 
other large transactions in the past, but I think NatWest makes a reasonable point when it 
says its not something thats seen in Mr Js day to day banking. In addition, the larger debits 
I can see in 2019 and 2020 werent made in cash. I can see the use of branch payments and 
Mr Js debit card for previous withdrawals, but not cash. 
NatWest also said the address history didnt match his identification so had to be updated. 
Mr J went on to amend his address so it was in line with his drivers licence. Further, 
NatWests branch staff said Mr J was unable to provide any evidence to support what he 
was saying about the intention to buy a car. NatWest has also highlighted that Mr Js 
account had a large credit of £9,000 less than 24 hours before the withdrawal request was 
made.  
Taken together, I havent been persuaded that NatWest acted unfairly by declining Mr Js 
withdrawal request. As noted above, NatWests website and account terms say it will carry 
out additional checks on withdrawals over £2,000. Im satisfied thats whats occurred in this 
case and the withdrawal was reasonably declined. Mr J has confirmed he was able to 
withdraw funds the following day. But at that point, his drivers licence matched the address 
on NatWests systems and it was able to complete the relevant checks. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr J but as Im satisfied NatWest dealt with his complaint fairly Im not 
telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Js complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 August 2022.
