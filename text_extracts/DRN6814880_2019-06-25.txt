K821x#15complaint
Miss K complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) lent money to her that 
she couldnt afford to repay.
background
Based on the information received, QuickQuid provided 14 loans to Miss K between March 
2010 and August 2018. The first loan was provided  more than six years before the complaint 
was raised and Miss K has confirmed she is not complaining about  this loan. This decision 
therefore relates to loans  two to 14.

Miss K says that at the time of loans two to 14 she was struggling financially and that she 
was taking our new loans to repay previous loans as well as borrowing from family and 
friends. She says QuickQuid should have realised  that lending  to her was irresponsible and 
that the loans  were  unaffordable.
QuickQuid says that Miss K told it about  her financial difficulties in October 2018 after which  
no new loans were  provided. It says before this there wasnt evidence  that Miss K was 
dependent on the loans  as the amounts lent were  decreasing and there were gaps in her 
borrowing. It says it carried out affordability checks that were in line with the regulations and 
that it validated  Miss Ks income and expenses.  
Our adjudicator said that there wasnt  enough evidence to say that QuickQuid acted unfairly  
by providing loans two, three or loan 14. He didnt  think that loans four to 13 or the top up of 
loan 14 shouldve been provided.  He noted that the highest repayment due on loans four to 
six were substantial compared to Miss Ks income. From loan seven he thought Miss Ks 
overall pattern  of borrowing  suggested she had become  persistently  reliant  on short-term 
loans. 
There was a gap of 14 months  between the repayment of loan 13 and loan 14 and so our 
adjudicator considered this as a new lending chain.  He thought  it reasonable that loan 14 
was provided but given  the size of the repayment  required  after the top up was given the top 
up loan was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN68148802QuickQuid didnt accept  our adjudicators view. It noted that Miss K was able to repay  a 
number of her loans early  and said she didnt exhibit signs  of financial difficulty. It said 
Miss K had sufficient disposable income  to make her repayments  and that there were gaps 
of 102 days between  loans five and six, 45 days between loans 10 and 11, and 428 days  
between loans 13 and 14, which didnt suggest a dependency on short term credit.
As a resolution has not been  agreed  this case has been passed to me, an ombudsman,  for a 
decision.
my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Miss K could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These  checks  could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts  and 
the consumer's  income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Miss K could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ref: DRN68148803Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ks complaint.
Miss K entered into loan two in November 2015. She then continued to borrow  without any 
significant gaps  in until her 13th loan was provided on 12 June 2017. I note the comments  
made about gaps  between  loans  in this lending chain but I dont think  it would have been 
reasonable for QuickQuid to conclude these  were any indication that Miss Ks finances had 
moved on from whatever  situation had required her previous loans.
There was a substantial  gap between the repayment of loan 13 and when loan 14 was 
provided and so I agree that this should be treated as a separate  lending chain.
Before the loans were  provided information  about  Miss Ks income  and expenses  was 
gathered. Considering the lending chain including  loans  two to 13, I agree that there isnt 
enough evidence  to say that loans two and three shouldnt have been provided. 
Loan four was for £1,050 and had a highest  repayment amount of £1,285. This was a 
substantial amount compared to Miss Ks monthly income of £2,400. I also note that at this 
time Miss K had expenses recorded as £1,300. This left a disposable  income of £1,100  
which was less than the final repayment  amount.  Because of this I do not find that this loan 
should have been considered affordable and so shouldnt have been provided  to Miss K.
Loan five was for a larger amount, £1,500.  At this time Miss Ks expenses  had reduced to 
£1,000. However  the final monthly  repayment  amount for this loan was £1,860 which again 
was higher than Miss Ks disposable monthly income.
I note QuickQuids comments  about  Miss K being able to save income  from previous months 
to meet  the repayment amount however I dont think this is reasonable. I find that QuickQuid 
shouldnt have lent money where a monthly  repayment amount was higher than Miss Ks 
monthly disposable income.
The sixth loan was for a lower amount, £950.  This was taken out less than three weeks  after 
the previous loan had been provided and the largest  repayment  amount was substantial  
compared to Miss Ks income. Therefore I do not find this loan was sustainably affordable.
By loan seven, I agree with our adjudicator  that the overall pattern of borrowing suggested 
Miss K was dependent on short term borrowing. Miss K had been borrowing for a number of 
months and although the amounts were fluctuating new loans were being taken out shortly 
after previous loans were  provided. Given this I think that loan seven and the remaining 
loans in this lending chain shouldnt have been  provided.
Loan 14 was the start of a new lending  chain and I agree that based  on the information 
provided I cannot say that the initial loan of £500  was unfairly  provided.  However  this loan 
was then topped up with a further £350 on 3 October 2018. The resulted in the highest 
repayment amount  being over £1,000. This was a substantial amount compared to Miss Ks 
income. This combined with her borrowing history  should have raised concerns and I think 
that QuickQuid should  have realised  that this topped  up loan wasnt sustainably  affordable.
Since Miss K raised her complaint, QuickQuid  has said it would write off the balance on her 
outstanding loan. It has confirmed this has happened and there is no longer an outstanding 
balance on her account.
Ref: DRN68148804my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  four to 13 and the top up 
on loan 14. CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) should:
refund  all interest and charges that Miss K paid on loans four to thirteen and loan 
fourteen top-up;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans four, five and six from Miss K's credit 
file;
the number  of loans taken from loan seven means any information recorded about  
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  seven onwards should be removed from 
Miss K's credit file.
QuickQuid has written  off Miss Ks outstanding balance,  therefore I find it reasonable that 
any refund  provided  due to this decision can be offset by the capital amount written  off. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss K a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 July 2019.
