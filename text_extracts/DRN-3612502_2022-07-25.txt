The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) shared his personal 
information with a third party without consent. Mr B also complains that NatWest failed to 
send him credit agreements when requested.
 
What happened
Mr B had two credit cards and a loan with NatWest. Mr B has told us he was unsuccessful in 
arranging a debt consolidation loan with NatWest. His accounts fell into arrears and were 
subsequently closed in default by NatWest. The accounts were passed to a third party 
business Ill call A. 
Mr B contacted NatWest and asked it to provide copies of his original credit agreements for 
the debts that had been sold to A. NatWest says it forwarded the credit agreements to A on 
Mr Bs behalf in August 2021 and did so again, more recently, in March 2022.
Mr B complained to NatWest and it issued final responses but didnt agree it had acted 
unfairly. NatWest said Mr Bs credit agreements allowed it to share his information when 
assigning a debt to a third party.
An investigator at this service looked into Mr Bs complaint but thought NatWest had dealt 
with it fairly. Mr B asked to apply, so his complaint was passed to me to make a decision. I 
recently issued a decision that confirmed time limits impacted the issues were able to 
consider. My decision confirmed we could look into Mr Bs complaints as set out above. This 
follow up decision covers the points not previously dealt with.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like thank Mr B for his patience whilst weve been dealing with his complaint. I understand 
Mr B remains disappointed that we cant consider all of the complaint points referred. But my 
previous decision set out our limits and the issues the Financial Ombudsman Service can 
comment on. 
Ive looked into Mr Bs complaint about the way his information was shared. The relevant 
terms and conditions say: 
We may give to anyone any information about you or this Agreement in connection with any 
proposed transfer of, or financial arrangement by reference to, this agreement. 
We may allow any person or organisation to take over any of our rights and duties under this 
Agreement
Whilst I understand Mr Bs view that his loan and credit cards were unfairly terminated by 
NatWest, Im satisfied its terms and conditions does allow for sharing of personal 
information. As the terms say, NatWest can share information with third parties in connection 
with a proposed transfer of the debts. In this case, NatWest shared private information about 
Mr B with A, but Im satisfied it was in connection with the transfer of his accounts and 
carried out in line with the relevant terms. Im sorry to disappoint Mr B, but I havent found 
that NatWest acted unfairly by sharing his information. 
Mr B also complains that credit agreements werent supplied in good time. NatWest has 
confirmed it sent A the relevant credit agreements in August 2021 and sent another copy in 
March 2022. Mr B should now have access to his credit agreements. But if he doesnt he 
can contact A for the copies NatWest has forwarded. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr B but as Im satisfied NatWest dealt with his complaint fairly Im 
not telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 August 2022.
