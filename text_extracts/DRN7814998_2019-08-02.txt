Loan 4 was topped-up (loan  4a) and the same loan was then refinanced into a new loan 
(loan 5) with a longer  term.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Ts complaint as she didnt think  Mr T had been treated  
unfairly. Mr T disagreed  and asked for an ombudsman  to make a decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Quick Quid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out reasonable checks  to understand whether 
Mr T could  repay his loan in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less thorough  in terms of 
how much  information  it gathers and what it does to verify that information  in the early  
stages of a lending relationship. 
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, the consumers income  was low or 
the amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the 
risk of it becoming unsustainable  and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed 
expect a lender  to be able to show that it hasnt continued to provide these loans to a 
consumer irresponsibly. 
Ref: DRN7814998QuickQuid has said before it agreed to lend any of the loans to Mr T, it searched his credit  
file, asked him for information about his monthly income and normal living costs. QuickQuid 
also says that before  it lent loan 1, it requested Mr Ts bank statement and payslips.
 
QuickQuid has provided copies of the bank statement and a payslip it obtained in 2016 and 
there isnt anything within that information that shouldve concerned QuickQuid about 
lending. I can also see that Mr Ts declared  income was £2,100 for loans 1 to 3 and £1,850 
for loan 4. Mr Ts living  expenses for loans 1 to 3 was recorded  as £925 and £1,040 for loan 
4. From  what  Ive seen, there wasnt anything within these checks that shouldve  concerned  
QuickQuid about  Mr Ts ability to afford these loans and Mr T had sufficient income to repay 
the loans.
Given the loan amounts  and the relatively  short lending  relationship,  I dont think it was 
unreasonable for QuickQuid to rely on the information Mr T provided.  So I think its decision 
to approve these loans  was wrong.   
There was a break of around eight months between loans 3 and 4 was, I think  that gap was 
sufficient to allow QuickQuid reasonably  believe that Mr T wasnt reliant on these loans and 
he wasnt repeatedly  borrowing.
Loan 4 was topped  up and then refinanced into a new loan  loan 5, but given that these 
advances were early in the new lending chain and the loan amounts were low compared to 
Mr Ts declared  income, I dont think  QuickQuid  needed to take its checks further.
Mr Ts representative  disagreed with the adjudicator because of the number of loans. I agree 
with the adjudicator that neither the number  of loans nor the loan history  on their own is 
enough to say that Mr T shouldnt have been lent the loans. From QuickQuids proportionate 
checks, there was no suggestion that Mr T would  struggle to repay  the loan and the lending 
relationship wasnt  continuous over an extended  period of time that a pattern of dependency 
had been established.
So I dont  think QuickQuid  did anything wrong  by lending any of the loans to Mr T.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ts complaint and make no award against 
CashEuroNet UK LLC.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 September 2019.
