The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc returned a payment of £540 to its 
sender without his authority.
What happened
Mr P had an account with NatWest. On 21 April 2022, Mr P received a payment of £540 into 
his account. But NatWest received a report that the payment was the proceeds of fraud, and 
so it blocked Mr Ps account while it looked into things. NatWest completed its review on 29 
April 2022  and decided to return the funds to the remitter.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Like all financial businesses, NatWest is required to have processes in place to tackle fraud 
and financial crime. This means that when it receives a report that a payment into an 
account is fraudulent, it may need to block the account while it looks into things.
Here, Mr P received a payment of £540 into his account. The next day, NatWest received a 
scam report from the sender. So it blocked Mr Ps account while it looked into things. Based 
on what Ive seen, Im satisfied NatWest was acting in line with its legal and regulatory 
requirements when it blocked the account.
NatWest then carried out the review. Id expect NatWest to complete any review in a timely 
manner. Here, it appears NatWest received the report from the sending bank on 22 April 
2022, and completed its review on 29 April. The 22 April was a Friday. NatWest contacted 
Mr P to ask him for further information on 25 April, which was the Monday. But I see Mr P 
also had to provide a one-time code a couple of times before NatWest told him about its 
concerns, on the Tuesday. Mr P replied the same day with details of the transaction. On 27 
April, NatWest contacted Mr P again with further questions. Mr P replied, enclosing a copy of 
the payment confirmation. NatWest then completed the review on 29 April.
I accept that being without access to the account was inconvenient to Mr P. But NatWest 
had received a report about these funds from the sending bank  and I accept NatWest 
would have needed some time to complete any review. The week it took doesnt seem 
unreasonable, especially bearing in mind that NatWest required further information from 
Mr P. I dont accept that NatWest ought to have completed its review any faster than it in fact 
did.
Finally, Ive considered NatWests decision to return the funds to the remitter.
Id only expect NatWest to return funds if it wasnt satisfied Mr P was entitled to them. Weve 
asked Mr P about this payment. Hes told us he was renting a room for £550 a month  and 
the £540 he received was a deposit. Hes sent us copies of messages he says he received 
from the potential tenant. These show the potential tenant contacted Mr P to say hed take 
the room and asked how to pay the first deposit. The potential tenant then contacted Mr P to 
say that that he hadnt been able to make the payment from his current account  and so 
hed make the payment from his fathers account instead. The potential tenant then sent Mr 
P a proof that hed sent the funds  which described the payment as a rent deposit for a 
single bedroom from May to August 2022. 
But NatWest then received the report that these funds were paid as part of a scam. It asked 
Mr P for information about the transaction  but didnt find this satisfactory. It says that as it 
received an indemnity claim it was obliged to return the funds. Though I note NatWest told 
Mr P that this wasnt because they had concluded Mr P was guilty or involved in any scam  
rather, it was because the funds were still in Mr Ps account. It says that if Mr P wanted the 
funds back, hed need to raise this as a civil claim with the sender.
Weve asked Mr P for further details of the arrangement. Hes sent us the listing from the 
website he used to advertise the property. And I see he regularly received rent payments for 
similar amounts to the account.
That said, Mr P has told us there wasnt any written agreement between him and the 
potential tenant. Everything was agreed through emails and text exchanges. And although 
Mr P says he took the deposit to reserve the property, he says he wouldnt have signed any 
contract until the tenant was ready to move in.
Given the limited information Mr P has about the transaction and his entitlement to the funds, 
I cant say NatWest treated him unfairly here. In particular, its not clear that Mr P had yet 
entered into a tenancy agreement or on what basis hed receive or get to retain any deposit. 
NatWest had received a report from the sending bank about the payment, so it seems the 
sender  who was not the same person as the potential tenant  had concerns about this 
payment. In all the circumstances, I dont think what NatWest has done is unfair. It follows 
that I dont uphold the complaint and Im not going to tell NatWest to do anything further to 
put things right.
My final decision
I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2023.
