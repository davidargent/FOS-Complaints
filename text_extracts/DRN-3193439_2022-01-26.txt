The complaint
Mr V complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) didnt carry out appropriate checks when 
agreeing to lend to him. And that if it had, NewDay wouldve seen that the lending wasnt 
affordable for him.
Mr V is also unhappy with the way NewDay responded to his personal circumstances and
failed to treat him as a vulnerable customer.
Mr V wants NewDay to amend his credit file.
What happened
In June 2018, NewDay gave Mr V an Aqua credit card with a credit limit of £450. Mr V 
exceeded his credit limit later in the year. He went on to miss payments in 2019 and asked 
NewDay for help.
NewDay didnt think the lending was unaffordable. It said it carried out proportionate checks 
and that these showed Mr V could afford to repay what it lent to him.
When Mr V complained to this service, the investigator thought that NewDay had lent 
irresponsibly. He asked NewDay to refund interest and charges and remove the account 
from Mr Vs credit file.
NewDay disagreed with the investigators recommendation. It said Mr V declared an annual
income of £30,000. The search it carried out didnt reveal any negative information and there 
was no indication of financial strain.
As NewDay didnt agree with the proposed outcome, the complaint came to me to make a 
final decision.
My provisional findings
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr V 
and to NewDay on 8 November 2021. I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise that Ive summarised this complaint in less detail than the parties and Ive done so
using my own words. Im not responding to every single point made by the parties involved. I
dont intend any discourtesy by this. Instead Ive concentrated on what I consider to be the 
key issues. The rules that govern this service allow me to do this.
Weve set out our approach to unaffordable and irresponsible lending complaints on our 
website  including the key relevant rules, guidance, good industry practice and law. Ive
considered this approach when deciding Mr Vs complaint.
Before deciding to lend, NewDay needed to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks
to make sure Mr V could afford to repay his borrowing in a sustainable way. These checks 
had to be borrower focussed. NewDay needed to consider the impact of any credit 
repayments on Mr V  not just whether it was likely to get its money back from him.
There was no set list of checks NewDay needed to complete. But the checks had to be
proportionate in the circumstances. This could vary depending on the amount of credit, the
duration, the total amount repayable and the consumers individual circumstances, including
their lending history.
NewDay says that Mr V declared an annual income of £30,000 and that its checks showed
no arrears, defaults, or county court judgments. NewDay says that it doesnt require 
evidence
of income and expenditure by way of bank statement for example. Instead, it relies on data
given to it by the applicant and external credit reference information including data that gives
an estimate of expenditure. NewDay is satisfied that it was reasonable to lend to Mr V based
on what it knew about his circumstances at the time.
The investigator disagreed with NewDays assessment of Mr Vs affordability because he
thought it hadnt taken proper account of some areas of concern on Mr Vs credit file. The
investigator noted that NewDay could see two payday loans on Mr Vs credit file. And that
these shouldve alerted NewDay to possible issues about affordability.
However, Im not persuaded that NewDay was aware of the two payday loans. In its final
response to Mr V, NewDay said there wasnt any evidence of payday lending in the checks it
carried out. This is reflected in the affordability spreadsheet that NewDay has given this
service. At the time that NewDay agreed Mr Vs credit card, there is a 0 against the
number of active payday loans.
NewDay has also given this service an underwriting document on which the entry next to
payday loans has a -2. This is a default entry that its system inputs because there wasnt
any data available and/or no data was received. Its not an indication that NewDay was
aware that Mr V had two payday loans at the time.
Mr Vs credit limit was a modest £450 against a declared annual income of £30,000.
NewDay couldnt see any evidence of late or missing payments on its credit search and
there were no defaults. It appeared that Mr V had outstanding credit of £100  again, a 
modest amount.
Although NewDays checks showed that there had been three credit searches carried out
against Mr V in the past 12 months, I dont consider this was excessive or a cause for
concern. I wouldnt have expected NewDay to go further with its checks based on what it
knew about Mr Vs circumstances.
I appreciate that Mr Vs financial situation was worse than he told NewDay, but I dont
consider proportionate checks wouldve revealed this. Its for this reason that I dont intend
requiring NewDay to do anything in response to Mr Vs complaint.
Mr V has also expressed concern about the way in which NewDay responded to his financial 
difficulties. The investigator dealt with these concerns in some detail and I dont have much
more to add to what he has already told Mr V.
I appreciate that Mr Vs personal situation and restrictions placed on him by the terms of his 
visa, made it difficult for him to claim additional support. But Im satisfied that NewDayresponded reasonably to his financial circumstances. It offered short-term help and 
suggested charities that might be able to assist him. I wouldnt have expected NewDay to do
more than this. It follows that I dont require it to compensate Mr V for this aspect of his
complaint.
Overall, Im not persuaded that it was unreasonable of NewDay to lend to Mr V based on
what it knew about his circumstances. And I consider that once Mr V was unable to keep up
with his repayments, it treated him fairly. I would just remind NewDay of its ongoing duty to
treat Mr V reasonably and sympathetically.
As I dont intend upholding this complaint, it follows that I wont require NewDay to refund
any money to Mr V or amend his credit file. Im sorry that this is likely to come as a
disappointment.
Further submissions
NewDay didnt respond to my provisional decision but Mr V was unhappy with my provisional 
decision. He made several submissions which I summarise as follows:
From four successful credit card applications, NewDay was the only lender to give 
him a credit limit of £450. The other lenders gave him a credit limit of £250 or less.
Mr V doesnt consider a £450 credit limit to be modest.
Mr Vs primary goal is to have the default removed from his credit file.
Mr V points out that he has a limited residential history and that his credit history 
didnt start until November 2018 (although I think Mr V meant to say November 
2017). He thinks this shouldve prompted Aqua to carry out additional checks and 
has referred to guidance from the Financial Conduct Authority in support.
Mr V thinks NewDay shouldve placed a hold on his account when he lost his job in 
2019. And that this wouldve allowed him to avoid the default and resume payments 
when he was back in full time employment  as evidenced by what he did with 
another credit card company.
Mr V says the default has had a negative impact on his life and ability to apply for 
further credit
Mr V says that NewDay hasnt given him a copy of its policy regarding vulnerable 
customers despite asking for this; and 
Mr V asks whether NewDays checks take account of the fact he cant access the 
benefits system because of his visa restrictions
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that Mr V has gone to a great deal of effort to respond to my provisional findings, 
but it hasnt changed my decision not to uphold his complaint. I appreciate that my reference to £450 being a modest credit limit might be subjective, but I 
was thinking about this in relation to Mr Vs declared annual income of £30,000. The fact that 
other credit card companies gave Mr V lower credit limits doesnt mean that NewDay was 
wrong to offer a higher limit based on what it knew about him.
I understand Mr Vs point that he had a limited residency and credit history. But I cant say 
that this means NewDay was wrong to agree to lend. I cant speak for all the factors NewDay 
took account of when considering his credit card application. But NewDay wasnt alone in 
agreeing to lend to Mr V based on his credit history and financial information. According to 
his credit report, Mr V was able to open two bank accounts since June 2017 and other credit 
card companies agreed to lend to him around the same time as NewDay. This all makes it 
hard for me to say that NewDay made a mistake or that its affordability checks should have 
been more rigorous than they were.
As Mr V couldnt keep up with his repayments, I cant conclude that NewDay was wrong to 
default his account. I appreciate that this makes things difficult for Mr V but NewDay has an 
obligation to record accurate information about the way he managed his account. 
Mr V has sent this service some links to information about the difficulties faced by people 
who cant access public funds due to conditions attached to their visa. I sympathise with    
Mr Vs position, but I cant see how NewDay wouldve been aware of this limitation when    
Mr V applied for credit. And the question of a lack of support for those finding themselves 
without access to public funds isnt one that I would expect NewDay to answer  it seems 
more suited to intervention by the government.
I still think NewDay responded reasonably to Mr Vs financial problems by giving him some 
short-term assistance and signposting him to further help. I have already told Mr V that I felt 
the investigator had dealt with these concerns in some detail. So, I dont have anything 
further to add. 
Although I appreciate the impact that the default has had and continues to have on Mr V, for 
all the reasons Ive outlined, I dont uphold his complaint. This means I cant require NewDay 
to convert the default into a payment arrangement as Mr V would like. But I do of course 
remind NewDay to treat Mr V reasonably and sympathetically should he make any offers to 
settle the debt.
Finally, Mr V would like to see NewDays policy on supporting vulnerable customers. If 
NewDay has such a policy, I dont see why it cant send Mr V a copy, but this doesnt change 
my decision not to uphold his complaint. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 February 2022.
