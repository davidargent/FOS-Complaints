The complaint
Mr L complains that ScoresMatter Limited has been taking money out of his account without 
his permission.
What happened
Mr L says he found out ScoresMatter has been taking just under £20 from his account for 
the last couple of years. He says he didnt sign up to receive anything from ScoresMatter 
and isnt aware of what it does. Mr L says the contract must be illegal and wants his money 
refunded. He accepts applying for a loan with a different company at the time but says he 
didnt receive any contact from the company and doesnt check his bank statements.
ScoresMatter says Mr L signed up to a service from it when it advertised on a partner 
website loan application page. It says Mr L selected more information from it and provided 
his details including his account card number, security number and provided authentication 
information. ScoresMatter says the contract was for just under £20 a month and it would 
have been obvious payments were being taken. It also says it sent a number of e-mails to 
Mr L including its terms and conditions but says it will refund just under £200.
Mr L brought his complaint to us, but our investigator didnt uphold it and thought Mr L must 
have provided his account details and agreed to the account terms and conditions. The 
investigator thought Mr L ought to have checked his bank account as payments were taken 
for about two years and didnt think there was any evidence a third party had given Mr Ls 
account details to ScoresMatter.
Mr L doesnt accept that view and says his details must have been passed to ScoresMatter 
and says he didnt receive any e-mails from it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that ScoresMatter has dealt fairly with this 
complaint and hasnt made a mistake. I realise Mr L will be disappointed by my decision.
I have looked at the online process new customers of ScoresMatter have to follow to set up 
an account with it. Im satisfied that a prospective customer has to click on the ScoresMatter 
link and to set up an account must provide personal information including payment details. I 
dont think there is any other way that Mr Ls account could have been set up without him 
providing that information and I can also see that the payment was subject to a third-party 
authentication process that ScoresMatter is not responsible for or has any control over. So, 
Im satisfied Mr L opened the account with ScoresMatter and in doing so agreed to its terms 
and conditions which included a monthly payment. It follows that I dont think ScoresMatter 
made a mistake by charging Mr L.
I appreciate that Mr L may have made a mistake in setting up the account but that doesnt 
mean I can fairly hold ScoresMatter responsible for that. I also think Mr L ought to have 
noticed the payment leaving his account every month and I think on balance it likely he 
would have received a number of e-mails from ScoresMatter about his account. 
Im satisfied that overall ScoresMatter hasnt made a mistake or that a third-party company 
would have provided it with Mr Ls personal details. But I can see that ScoresMatter has 
fairly accepted Mr L may have made a mistake and has offered to refund just under £200 of 
fees. I appreciate that Mr L doesnt wish to accept that offer and that of course is his choice, 
but Im satisfied that ScoresMatter has acted fairly in circumstances where I dont find it 
made a mistake.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2020.
