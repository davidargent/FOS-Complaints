Miss D says Oakam  Ltd lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I sent Miss D and Oakam my provisional findings  on this complaint on 28 May 2020.  A copy 
is attached and it forms part of this final decision.  I explained to both parties  why I planned  to 
uphold this complaint in part and asked them to let me know if they had anything  further  they 
wanted me to consider. Neither  Miss D nor Oakam  sent me anything  else to consider.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party sent me anything else to consider, my final decision is the same  as my 
provisional decision, for the same reasons  and so Oakam must put things right as set out 
in my attached provisional decision.
my final decision
I uphold Miss Ds complaint in part. Oakam  Ltd must put things right as set out in my 
attached provisional decision.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 August 2020.

complaint
Miss D says Oakam Ltd lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss D had 14 loans with Oakam. Ive set out some information Oakam provided about the loans in 
the appendix to this decision. An adjudicator considered  Miss Ds complaint and thought  it should be 
upheld. The adjudicator  didnt think Oakam should have provided loans 
4 to 14. Oakam didnt agree.  It made a number of general and case-specific points. Its general  points 
included:
It provides instalment loans (as opposed to payday loans) which  can be structured  in a way 
which is affordable.
The loans  are amortising which means  each repayment includes a repayment towards the 
principal  and so its customers dont just service interest over a long period of time.
Given  the above, its unlikely a consumer would need to reborrow  in order to meet their debt 
obligations.
Oakam doesnt charge  extra interest  to cover missed  repayments.
Oakam only extends credit to customer who are not in arrears.
Oakam aims to help customers transition from higher-cost  shorter-term credit products, to longer-
term lower-cost  products,  helping  them repair their credit  history and eventually migrate to 
mainstream lenders.
Oakam also sought to draw  comparisons between Miss Ds complaint and a previous case  this 
service dealt with in 2016.  
On Miss Ds specific complaint, Oakam said:
Miss D repaid her loans without  undue  difficulty,  as demonstrated by the small  number of late 
repayments over a period  of five years and four months.
Miss Ds credit  history improved over time.
Miss D met her repayments out of her disposable income.
Miss Ds applications were on several occasions subject to more in-depth checks, including  
looking at her bank statements.
Oakam carried out face-to-face interviews to get a wider picture of Miss Ds circumstances.
Miss D was not using  a significant portion of her income to service her credit commitments.
As there  was no agreement, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
Regulatory background
From the start of the period of lending until 1 April 2015,  Oakam  was regulated by the Office of Fair 
Training (OFT). Relevant guidance for responsible lending during  this period was set out in the OFTs  
irresponsible lending guidance for creditors (ILG).  From 1 April 2015 onwards, regulation transferred  
Ref: DRN76188353to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), whose  regulation and guidance is mainly  set out in the 
Consumer Credit  Sourcebook (CONC). The ILG and CONC provided similar guidance on 
irresponsible lending at the times Oakam lent to Miss D.
The ILG included the following guidance for regulated  consumer  credit firms:  
In the OFT's view,  all assessments of affordability should involve a consideration of the potential  for 
the credit commitment to adversely impact  on the borrower's financial  situation,  taking account of 
information that the creditor  is aware of at the time the credit is granted.

In our view this is likely to involve more  than solely  assessing the likelihood of the borrower being  able 
to repay the credit in question. We consider that before granting credit,  significantly increasing the 
amount of credit, or significantly increasing  the credit  limit under an agreement for running account 
credit, creditors  should  take reasonable steps to assess a borrower's  likely ability to be able to meet 
repayments under the credit  agreement  in a sustainable manner.
The concept  of sustainably was discussed as follows:
The OFT regards 'in a sustainable manner' in this context as meaning credit that can be repaid by the 
borrower:
without undue difficulty  in particular  without incurring  or increasing  problem indebtedness
over the life of the credit  agreement  or, in the case  of open-end agreements, within a reasonable 
period of time
out of income and/or  available savings, without  having  to realise security  or assets.
The OFT would regard 'without undue difficulty' in this context as meaning the borrower being  able to 
make repayments (in the absence of changes in personal circumstances that were  not reasonably 
foreseeable at the time the credit was granted):
 while also meeting other debt repayments and other normal/reasonable outgoings and
 without having to borrow  further to meet these repayments.
And specific irresponsible lending  practices included:
Inappropriately encouraging borrowers  to increase,  aggregate  or roll over existing debt to 
unsustainable levels.
The FCAs  rules and guidance in CONC set out similar and sometimes more  detailed guidance on the 
concept of sustainability. CONC also referred back to the ILG and so the ILG remains relevant  
throughout the whole period of lending.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about 
irresponsible lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good industry practice  - on our 
website. 
Taking into account the relevant rules,  guidance and law, I think the overarching questions  I need to 
consider in deciding whats fair and reasonable  in the circumstances of this complaint are:
 Did Oakam,  each time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself 
that Miss D would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those  checks have shown 
that Miss D wouldve  been  able to do so?
Ref: DRN76188354 Bearing  in mind the circumstances,  at the time of each application, was there a point where  
Oakam ought reasonably  to have realised  it was increasing Miss Ds indebtedness in a way that 
was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful and so shouldnt have  provided further loans?
 Did Oakam act unfairly  or unreasonably in some other way?
Did Oakam, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that Miss 
D would be able to repay in a sustainable way?
In its final response letter, Oakam offered  to uphold  loan 1 as it didnt think it had been processed 
within acceptable standards. But it didnt  pay Miss D anything, as it said she hadnt paid any interest. I 
dont agree. Each repayment made by Miss D included  both capital and interest. That Miss D repaid 
less than the total capital she borrowed, because the loan was refinanced before shed repaid the 
whole loan, is irrelevant.  So I intend to uphold the complaint about  loan 1 and to tell Oakam to refund 
the interest Miss D paid on this loan.
For loan 2, Oakam  recorded  Miss Ds income  as £1,373 per month  made up of child benefit,  tax 
credit and other benefits which are not defined. Miss Ds outgoings  are recorded as £600  including 
£100 for rent, £150 for housekeeping and £0 for other credit. This left Miss D with a net disposable 
income of £773 per month. The notes for the loan say a low touch top-up criterion was applied, 
which I assume is because only two months had passed since loan 1 was granted.
Oakam had, according to its notes, checked Miss Ds income against her bank statements. 
I think  it was right that Oakam did that  Miss D had significant adverse credit  history, including 
multiple active CCJs and her only income  was from benefits. I havent actually seen  Miss Ds bank 
statements, as neither  party  has provided copies.  In the circumstances, this means theres  nothing  
much to undermine what Oakam has recorded about Miss Ds income and Im prepared  to accept  
what it has recorded.
Im more sceptical about what Oakam has recorded about Miss Ds outgoings. They  seem very low 
for a household with children. And it cant really  be correct to say Miss D had no other credit 
commitments when she had unsatisfied CCJs  (the costs of which are not recorded  elsewhere). And 
£773 seems  very high as a monthly disposable income  figure in Miss Ds circumstances. Miss D was 
looking to borrow amounts  equal  to or less than her monthly disposable income  and then to repay 
those amounts over six months to a year. So I think Miss Ds monthly expenditure also ought to have 
been checked  against  Miss Ds bank statements. Oakams  notes dont suggest it did this in a 
thorough way. But again,  as I dont have access to those  statements,  I cant say the outgoings figures  
are incorrect,  or that the loan was unaffordable. So I dont intend to uphold  the complaint about loan 
2.
Ive reached much the same finding for loans  3 to 5. Throughout this period, Oakam recorded Miss 
Ds income as £1,450-£1,820, her expenditure as £600-£900 and her monthly disposable income as 
£540-£1,222. It continued to record that Miss D had no other credit commitments,  although  Oakams 
credit checks suggested otherwise. As Ive said above,  I think  the disposable  income recorded was 
very high, bearing  in mind Miss Ds personal circumstances.  The monthly  disposable income figure  
recorded for loan 3, for example, was £1,222  per month  but for loan 3 Miss D received £500 cash 
in-hand. Its not clear  to me from the information Oakam obtained why Miss D would need to borrow 
£500, at such high cost, to buy clothes (as recorded on the loan application) when she could 
apparently easily afford this expenditure without borrowing at all. So for loans 3 to 5, I continue to 
think Oakam  ought to have taken a closer look at Miss Ds bank statements or taken  other additional 
steps to verify  her expenditure. But as with loan 2, I dont have enough information to show me what  
such checks would likely have shown for loans 3 to 5. So Im not planning  to uphold  the complaint  
about these loans.
Bearing in mind  the circumstances, at the time of each application, was there a point  where Oakam 
ought reasonably to have realised it was increasing  Miss Ds indebtedness in a way that was 
unsustainable or otherwise  harmful  and so shouldnt have  provided further  loans?
Ref: DRN76188355Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Miss Ds lending history with Oakam, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Oakam should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Oakam should have realised  that it shouldnt  have 
provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ds case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6  Ill 
explain why.
I appreciate that Oakam considers the nature  of its loans  means its unlikely  Miss D was borrowing in 
a way which was unsustainable. But I think thats exactly what was happening. Oakam  is right that 
Miss D was, for the most  part, taking out longer-term  loans, rather than payday type loans (although 
six of Miss Ds loans do meet the FCAs definition  of high-cost short-term  credit).  But Miss D wasnt 
repaying her loans over the long-term.  Almost all of Miss Ds loans were  refinanced into the next loan 
in the chain. All of the loans up to loan six were refinanced in this way. By the time of loan 6, Miss D 
had already been borrowing from Oakam for about a year, so was taking about one loan every two 
months on average. 
This means   contrary to what  Oakam  has said  that Miss D was really only repaying the interest on 
her loans. On a 12-18 month  amortising  loan, the first few repayments  would be weighted heavily 
towards repaying interest. This is demonstrated  in my table below,  which shows that each time the 
loans were refinanced,  the amount still owed  had barely  decreased from the figure  at the outset.  And 
each time Miss D refinanced a loan, it was to borrow  more.  If that pattern continued,  Miss Ds 
indebtedness to Oakam would  be extended over a significant period, as it indeed was  for over six 
years.
So while I appreciate Miss D may have made most of her repayments  on time and that her credit 
rating may also have  improved, I dont think this means the lending from loans six onwards was 
sustainable and I dont think Oakam acted fairly and reasonably by continually increasing and 
extending Miss Ds indebtedness.
Ive quoted  above OFT guidance which  states  it wasnt fair to inappropriately encourage  borrowers to 
increase, aggregate  or roll over existing debt to unsustainable levels. I havent seen enough  evidence  
to safely  say Miss D was inappropriately  encouraged  to roll over her debts, but I do think, from the 
pattern of lending, that Miss Ds debt was allowed to aggregate  and roll over into levels which were, 
on balance, unsustainable.
That Miss Ds debts were  unsustainable is borne out by the fact she didnt make  any real inroads into 
reducing the amount she owed over time. Miss Ds debt increased consistently over the six-year  
period Ive looked at and she paid largely  only interest before refinancing her loans. So Miss D, in 
effect paid large amounts  of interest  to Oakam, in effect,  to service a debt to it over an extended 
period.
For these  reasons, I intend to uphold  Miss Ds complaint about loans 6 to 14, in addition to loan 1.
Did Oakam act unfairly or unreasonably in some  other  way?
I do think Oakam  has unfairly suggested it doesnt owe Miss D redress for loan 1, despite agreeing to 
uphold the complaint about it. But apart  from that, I do not think  Oakam  has acted unfairly  in any other 
way.
Finally  Ive considered the points Oakam  has made about a different case. We decide  each case on 
its individual merits and comparisons with other cases arent always  useful.  
I think  Oakam is aware of the approach this service takes to complaints about affordability  weve 
published substantial  details about this on our website  and the regulator  has highlighted key decisions 
to the high-cost credit  industry. Additionally,  from what I can see the case Oakam mentions included 
an offer from Oakam to write off a substantial  amount  of interest and capital  and thats not the case  
here. This is a substantial difference  between  the two complaints.
Ref: DRN76188356putting things  right
My redress  proposal assumes some loans are still outstanding. If this is wrong,  Oakam  should  let me 
know.
Oakam shouldnt  have given Miss D loan 1, or loans 6 to 14.
If Oakam  has sold the outstanding debts it should buy these back if it is able to do so and then take 
the following steps.  If Oakam is not able to buy the debts back then Oakam should  liaise  with the new 
debt owner  to achieve the results  outlined  below.
A)Oakam should add together the total of the repayments made  by Miss D towards interest, fees 
and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything it has 
already refunded.
B)Oakam should calculate  8% simple interest* on the individual  payments made by Miss D which 
were considered  as part of A, calculated  from the date Miss D originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled.
C)Oakam should remove all interest,  fees and charges  from the balance on any upheld outstanding  
loans, and treat any repayments made by Miss D as though  they had been repayments of the 
principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Miss D having  made overpayments then 
Oakam should  refund  these overpayments with 8% simple  interest* calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is 
settled. Oakam should then refund the amounts  calculated  in A and B and move to step E.
D)If there is still an outstanding balance  then the amounts calculated in A and B should be used to 
repay any balance  remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus  then the surplus 
should be paid to Miss D. However if there is still an outstanding balance then Oakam should try to 
agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss D. Oakam shouldnt pursue outstanding  balances 
made up of principal  it has already  written-off.
E)Oakam should remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Ds credit file in relation to loan 
1. The overall  pattern of Miss Ds borrowing  for loans  6 to 14 means any information  recorded  
about them is adverse,  so Oakam should  remove these loans  entirely from Miss Ds credit file. 
Oakam does not have to remove  any outstanding loans from Miss Ds credit file until these have 
been repaid,  but Oakam  should still remove any adverse information  recorded about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Oakam  to deduct tax from this interest. Oakam should  give Miss D 
a certificate showing how much tax youve  deducted,  if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  given  above  I intend to uphold Miss Ds complaint in part and to tell 
Oakam Ltd to put things right by taking the steps set out above.
Ref: DRN76188357Appendix  loan table  and notes
The table below sets out some information  Oakam provided about the loans. This information  was 
provided on 18 October 2018 and so some  of the information about the loans which were outstanding 
at the time (11 and 14) may now be out of date.
The Cash to Miss D column sets out how much cash Miss D actually received in hand at the 
time she took out the loan  to help show clearly how much was used to settle the previous loan 
(where relevant).
The End balance  column sets out the balance of the loan at the point it was refinanced  where the 
balance is £0, the loan was repaid  in full, rather than refinanced.
This table and the associated  notes  are for information  only and the information  within should  not be 
considered definitive nor should it be used to calculate  any proposed redress.

I note our adjudicator  said Miss D had one more loan, on 21 June 2018.  This was because  in its final 
response letter Oakam  said:
We have reviewed the application [Miss D] has taken with Oakam  on 21 June 2018. For this loan we 
note our usual affordability checks  were  carried  out but acknowledge they were not processed within 
our acceptable standards. Thus, we will be able to uphold  her complaint for this loan. For this loan, 
Miss Ds loan has received  £300 in credit
However, in its response to the adjudication,  Oakam said no such  loan exists. Ive seen no agreement  
for such a loan. I think this was simply an error  in Oakams final response letter and it intended to 
refer to loan 1 on 21 June  2012. Oakam offered to uphold that loan in its final response, so it now 
forms part of my proposed  redress. If my assumption is wrong, Oakam should let me know.**
[**since my provisional decision, Oakam has confirmed the reference to 21 June 2018 was an error]
