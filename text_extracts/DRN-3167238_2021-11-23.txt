The complaint
Mr H complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) have effectively blocked his 
account, as he isnt able to use it without a mobile phone. 
 
What happened
Mr H has held a PayPal account for 15 years. He says he has been unable to access it since 
May 2020. This is because PayPal now use two-factor authentication which requires a 
mobile phone. 
Mr H doesnt have a mobile phone, he doesnt want one and would prefer to use his landline 
number to authenticate his account. Mr H thinks that PayPal should enable him to use his 
landline to complete the authentication process as this is more secure. 
Mr H complained to PayPal about this. 
 
PayPal explained to Mr H that the problems he is experiencing are related to the introduction 
of the Second Payment Services Directive (P2D2) which is a new EU Directive regulating 
payment services in the European Economic Area. One of the requirements is that they use 
two-factor authentication for electronic payments. PayPals system currently uses mobile 
phones as one of the authentication methods. They said that they were aware that there was 
an issue preventing customers from using their landlines to complete authentication and they 
were working to try and resolve this. 
To assist Mr H in the short term, PayPal bypassed authentication for 48 hours to allow Mr H 
to withdraw his funds and advised him that he could install an authenticator app on his 
computer to allow for the two-factor authentication. They suggested some apps he could use 
for this purpose.
  
Mr H was unhappy with this as he thought he should be able to use his landline as it is 
secure, and he didnt want to give his details to a third-party app provider. Mr H complained 
to us, and our investigator looked into the complaint, but she thought that PayPal had acted 
reasonably in this case.  
Mr H disagreed with our investigators view and has asked for an ombudsmans decision 
which is why it has come to me to review.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I will explain my reasons below. 
When Mr H took out his PayPal account, he indicated his consent to the PayPal User 
Agreement.  
Part of this agreement concerns that safety and security of the account and says We may 
require you to authenticate any instruction relating to your account (i.e. Give us information 
that we need to be sure that its you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct 
log in information.  this could include your e mail address and password) and otherwise 
successfully log into your PayPal account to provide us your instruction.
So, Mr H has consented to comply with any requirements PayPal put in place to authenticate 
his account.
 
In September 2019 new European Union rules came into effect that required banks and 
payment services to enhance the security for customers and limit fraud by putting in place 
Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). To comply with this, PayPal put in place a two-factor 
authentication process.  
For most people one of those steps will be to receive a code to their mobile phone. However, 
as Mr H doesnt have a mobile phone, this isnt an option, and he has been unable to make 
the system work using his landline. 
PayPal have acknowledged that they have had some technical issues which prevented 
customers from using their landlines and advised that they have worked hard and are 
continuing to work to resolve this issue. 
I appreciate that it is frustrating for Mr H not to be able to access the account in a way that 
he wants to.  However, I think that PayPal have shown that they are trying to resolve this 
issue, and they have offered an alternative solution to Mr H which is the use of an 
authentication app. They have provided recommendations for types of app that are 
compatible with their system. This means that a mobile phone is not required as the apps 
can be used from a desktop computer and so not being in possession of a mobile phone 
isnt disadvantaging Mr H in accessing his account.
I dont therefore think that PayPal have unfairly restricted their service to Mr H, even though 
its not operating in the way that he would prefer, and I therefore find that PayPal havent 
done anything wrong here. 
My final decision
My decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA do not need to do anything further.  
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2021.
