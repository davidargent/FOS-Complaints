Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ts complaint about loans 6 onwards and thought these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr T could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN32797422the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Mr Ts complaint about loans 1  5 should be upheld. Mr T 
appears to have accepted these findings,  so as these loans are no longer in dispute, I 
havent considered these  further. However, I have thought about these loans when looking 
at Mr Ts overall lending relationship with Sunny. 
Sunny says it carried out an affordability  check before allowing Mr T to take out any of these 
loans  which involved it requesting information  about Mr Ts income and expenditure. But 
by the time Mr T was applying for his sixth loan, I think Sunny shouldve carried  out a more 
thorough and proportional check of his financial situation. A proportionate check  for loan 6 
would most  likely have  shown that Mr T had short-term loans with other  providers and was 
regularly overdrawn in his current account.  
This evidence suggests Mr T was having problems managing  his money and may have  had 
problems repaying  his loans in a sustainable manor. And so a properly carried  our 
affordability assessment  was likely  to lead to a responsible  lender  to conclude that the loan  
or any subsequent  ones  - was not affordable  for an applicant in that situation.  So, I dont 
think Sunny  shouldve lent Mr T loan 6.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  Our adjudicator  felt that this point had been
reached by loan 6, however given the fact that these loans  were  all taken out within  the
space of five months, I dont think it had yet reached the point  considering how long these
loans were meant to run for - to suggest that a pattern  of lending had developed.
However, given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ts case, I think that this point was 
reached by loan 7. I say this because:
Ref: DRN32797423At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr T was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr T had taken out seven  loans within  seven months,  and Mr T was 
indebted to Sunny  for almost  the whole time. So Sunny ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr T was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Ts indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr T initially took out a flexible  credit facility followed  by five loans ranging from £350  
to £500. But by loan 7 Mr T was requesting around  £750.  And I think at this point  
Sunny ought to have known that Mr T was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  9 was 
taken out a year after Mr Ts borrowing began with Sunny and the amounts borrowed 
wasnt significantly reducing. So, Mr T had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, 
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 onwards and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  6 - 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 6 from Mr Ts credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  7 - 9 should be removed from 
Mr Ts credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ts complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mr T compensation as set out above.
Ref: DRN32797424Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 March  2020.
