The complaint
Mr W is a business customer of PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA. He complains, on behalf of 
his company F, that without warning, PayPal reduced the available balance on his sales 
account from £19,000 to £800. 
What happened
On 8 August 2019, Mr W was notified that the available balance on his PayPal selling 
account was being reduced. This meant any payments over £800 were held as pending, and 
not immediately available to him.
Mr W said he mainly runs his business via eBay and PayPal, and was reliant on the cash 
flow generated by sales through the account. He believed the reduction had been applied to 
the account on 1 August - meaning he wasnt given any notice.
Mr W contacted PayPal as he wasnt able to run his business through the account freely, 
owing to the reduced limit. He didnt think this was fair.
PayPal said theyd lowered the limit because of an increase in the number of buyer disputes 
opened against Mr W. And once the disputes were resolved, theyd be able to review his 
account again.
Mr W brought his complaint to us. He felt PayPal had acted unfairly, as he didnt believe a 
large number of the disputes were his fault. He said the new limit had made it very difficult 
for him to manage his business. PayPal had also taken payments to cover a loan he had to 
provide him with working capital. This is a scheme under which the account holder selects 
the percentage they want to pay each month from sales going into the account. Together 
with the reduced limit, Mr W thought PayPals restriction was unfair. 
PayPal provided their final response in September. As Mr W had by that stage resolved a 
number of the disputes on the account, PayPal raised the limit to £10,000. PayPal offered Mr 
W £150 to compensate him for the unsatisfactory customer service hed received when hed 
contacted them about the matter.
Our investigators view was Mr Ws complaint shouldnt be upheld. He noted PayPals 
system worked on an algorithm. This meant any action on the account happened 
automatically if PayPal received information about a rise in the level of disputes on the 
account. Therefore, the nature of the disputes against Mr W wasnt something PayPal were 
able to consider. As PayPal had provided evidence of a sharp increase in the number of 
claims against F, this would account for the action taken by PayPal. 
As Mr W didnt agree with our investigator, the case was given to me to review. 
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 2 June 2020. I indicated that I intended 
to uphold the complaint and award Mr W £650 compensation. 
Mr W has confirmed he accepted my provisional decision in general, but said he thought his 
business had suffered additional financial loss owing to the actions of PayPal. 
PayPal confirmed they had received my provisional decision but had no further comments. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I thank both parties for their replies to my provisional decision. But as no new information 
has been provided, I see no reason to alter my provisional decision. Its largely repeated 
within my final decision which is set out below. Im satisfied the remedy is fair and reflects 
the time and trouble cause to Mr W. Ill explain why. 
Im aware Mr W has raised a number of additional points throughout the life of his complaint. 
While I dont propose to address every point, I want to reassure him Ive considered 
everything hes said. 
PayPals account restriction
The agreement between PayPal and Mr W allows PayPal to restrict the availability of funds. 
It doesnt require PayPal to give Mr W advance notice of the intention to restrict funds. I 
understand the impact of a sudden restriction, as Mr W wasnt able to use the account as 
freely as he wanted. However, that is ultimately in the nature of a restriction. That said, the 
discretion the agreement affords PayPal doesnt mean it can exercise that discretion without 
due regard for the impact on the service user. That could result in unfairness, contrary to key 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) principles.
I can see from PayPals system notes that it introduced the restriction on Mr Ws account 
from 8 August. Although Mr W initially believed the decrease took place slightly earlier, I 
havent seen anything to support this.
Its accepted by both parties that in the weeks leading up to the restriction, Mr Ws account 
had a high number of disputes. PayPals actions appear to have been based on this data, 
and I can see how the information suggested Mr Ws account had become a greater risk to 
PayPal. Viewed in that light, PayPals decision to apply a restriction doesnt strike me as 
inherently unfair.
Mr W acknowledges there was an issue with fulfilling customer orders at the material time, 
and my impression is that he understands the need for a restriction. His main point 
throughout has been that setting the restriction at £800 meant he was unable to manage the 
cashflow of his business. I can appreciate it was a significant reduction, and its not 
immediately clear how PayPal calculated the amount it considered appropriate as a 
restriction. 
As Ive observed, the power to exercise discretion doesnt override the obligation to treat 
customers fairly. The consequential impact on a business customer is a factor that PayPal 
ought to be aware of, and take into account, when exercising its discretion. It seems to me 
that PayPal could have made more enquiries of Mr W and the issues he was having with his 
business before taking the action it did. That would have enabled PayPal to take a more 
considered view on the risks it was facing  much as it did when Mr W spoke with its 
representative the following month.
I could understand taking such a restrictive approach where repeated efforts to contact the 
service user had been unsuccessful, perhaps to stimulate some sort of action in response. 
But as a first step, I think PayPals action was unreasonable. It could have alerted Mr W to 
the need to resolve his customer disputes while restricting available funds to an amount that 
enabled him to continue to operate his business. It is of note Mr W took the necessary action promptly and that once this was done, PayPal 
raised the available funds to a level that enabled Mr W to operate effectively. I havent seen 
anything from either party that leads me to think he would not have taken similar action if 
PayPal had discussed the situation with him and imposed a less stringent restriction to his 
available funds.
There is also the issue of Mr Ws efforts to contact PayPal to discuss the restriction. He has 
described in some detail how difficult he found it to engage in a constructive discussion with 
PayPal about the impact its decision was having on his business. PayPal has acknowledged 
this as a separate matter in its letter of 23 September 2019. It did to some extent sought to 
recognise its customer service shortcomings with a £150 compensation offer. But it would be 
reassuring to know that it is looking to improve the way it corresponds with customers who 
find themselves in Mr Ws situation.
Overall, while Im conscious of the reasons for PayPals decision to restrict availability of 
funds, I think the way it went about this could have been better handled and has caused 
unnecessary difficulty and concern to Mr W. I intend to award him compensation for this, 
which I assess at £500. This is in addition to the £150 PayPal offered for its customer 
service issues, which it has acknowledged as a separate issue.
Other account deductions
Mr W has questioned the payments taken by PayPal while he was under the restriction in 
relation to the loan he had to provide working capital, and to trading fees. I can see why this 
made Mr Ws situation more difficult, given he was already stretched by the restriction. But to 
my mind, the way to rectify this was for PayPal to have taken a more considered approach to 
the level of the restriction, rather than putting PayPal under an obligation to waive or 
suspend these deductions. I dont propose any further action or award in respect of this 
issue.
My final decision
For the reasons I have outlined Im upholding this complaint. To settle it, I direct PayPal 
Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay Mr W £650 in total.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask F to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 October 2020.
