K820x#14complaint
A, a limited  company, complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA did not apply a 
merchant rate for its transaction fees.
background
A set up a business  account with PayPal  at the start of 2014. In 2018,  A says that it 
reviewed its fees and then realised  that it had been eligible for the lower merchant rate. It 
applied to PayPal  for this in November 2018 and is now paying lower  transaction fees. A 
says that it should  not have had to apply for this separately and PayPal should have made 
its fees clearer. PayPal  offered  to pay A £500  as a gesture of goodwill.
Our investigator did not recommend that PayPal do anything more  than this. Under the 
terms and conditions of the account,  the merchant rate had to be applied for separately 
online. There would then be reductions  to transaction fees provided that total transactions 
were at least £1,500  a month. PayPal had not made a mistake  and its terms were sufficiently 
clear. We did not have a role in saying what its business practices should be.
A did not agree. It said that the UK is toothless against large organisations. And other  
businesses will be affected by this. The customer  services agent at PayPal seemed to know  
about this issue.  There was nothing to help calculate the percentages on the account to 
check they were right.  A said that this would not be something that a mainstream bank in the 
UK would do. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This service provides informal dispute  resolution.  So we dont  have a role in saying how 
PayPal runs its business generally  or sets transaction prices. And I am only looking at the 
impact of what happened here for A. 
PayPal has shown that its user agreement sets out that the merchant rates have to be 
applied for. And its also referred us to part of its website which states  that You can apply for 
these merchant rates if youve received  more  than £1,500 GBP  in PayPal payments in the 
previous calendar  month. The standard transaction rate as I understand it is 3.4 percent 
plus £0.20 for each  transaction.  But this falls in tiers on the merchant rate. And its said that 
A is eligible for a rate of 2.4 percent plus £0.20.
Ive not seen any evidence that A applied for this rate before November 2018.  And I dont 
think that there was any requirement for PayPal to highlight that A could have paid less. Or 
for it to have given greater  detail for each  of the fees it applied. When A did contact  PayPal 
about the rates my understanding is that it was given a correct  explanation. 
I appreciate that A now realises  that its missed out on what  could  have been  a significant 
reduction in fees over a number of years. It said that this came  to light when it was doing a 
particularly close review  of its business.  PayPal has offered a one off payment  of £500 to 
reflect what  happened. 
Ref: DRN24583732I dont find that PayPal has made an error  or acted unreasonably. It has made  an offer to 
settle the complaint and I dont have  a basis to require it to do anything  more. 
my final decision
PayPal has already made an offer to pay £500  to settle the complaint and I think that this 
offer is fair in all the circumstances. So my decision  is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
should pay A £500.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 September  2019.
