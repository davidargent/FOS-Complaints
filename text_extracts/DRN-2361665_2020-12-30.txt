The complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has resolved a dispute against him 
despite him providing evidence of the delivery of an item.
What happened
Mr M says he sold a telephone for Â£300 and received the payment via PayPal. He says he 
sent the item to the buyer by registered post, but a dispute was raised by the buyer that the 
item hadnt been delivered. Mr M says he gave PayPal evidence of the delivery receipt and 
that the item had been signed for. But PayPal found against him and has refunded the 
money and he is without the telephone. He would like the buyer investigated and his money 
refunded.
PayPal says Mr M didnt provide evidence of delivery to the buyer and says he sent the item 
to a different address to the one on its records. It says to be eligible for its Sellers Protection 
that Mr M had to send the item to the registered address on the transaction page, but he 
didnt do so.
Mr M brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator thought PayPal was entitled to conclude Mr M wasnt entitled to the protection 
scheme as he sent the item to a different address.
Mr M says that is unfair and would like a review of that decision by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that PayPal has dealt fairly with this 
complaint and hasnt made a mistake. I appreciate that Mr M will be disappointed by my 
decision and I realise that he has lost the money and the telephone. I think it likely Mr M was 
sadly the victim of fraud and I am sympathetic to his position, but I dont think PayPal is 
responsible for what took place.
I have looked at PayPals eligibility for its Seller Protection Scheme and am satisfied that it is 
clearly stated that the seller must provide evidence of shipment or delivery to the address 
contained on the transaction details section. I can see that the address of the buyer is not 
the address Mr M sent the item to and so I find that in those circumstances Mr M wasnt 
entitled to the protection scheme as he didnt keep to the terms of that agreement.
I can see from the evidence provided by Mr M that he raised that issue and was told that the 
buyer no longer lived at the address. But I think Mr M ought to have sent the item to the 
address on the transaction section and it likely the change of address was part of a fraud. 
I dont think it matters that Mr M provided evidence to PayPal that he sent the item as I can 
see the address on the receipt was not the address on PayPals records or on the 
transaction details section.
Overall, Im satisfied PayPal has acted fairly here, and of course Mr M will no doubt consider 
reporting his complaint to a different organisation if he considers he has been the victim of a 
fraud. In those circumstances I cant fairly order PayPal to refund the money to Mr M that he 
has lost.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 January 2021.
