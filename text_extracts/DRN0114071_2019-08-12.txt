K820x#14complaint
Mr D complains that although NewDay Ltd has passed his debt to a collection agency, its 
still asking him for money. He doesnt  want to be charged interest, and he doesnt  want  to be 
charged twice.
background
Mr D contacted us because he thought something  had gone  wrong  with payments to a credit  
card he held, which was operated  by NewDay. The debt had been  put in the hands of a debt 
collector, so Mr D didnt think he should be charged  interest any more, and he didnt think 
that NewDay should still be asking him for money. He didnt want to pay twice, and he didnt 
think this debt was anything to do with NewDay any more. 
Our investigator didnt  think this complaint  should  be upheld. He said that he thought  that the 
debt collection agency was only collecting money for NewDay, but Mr D still owed NewDay 
money. And he couldnt see that NewDay was charging Mr D any interest.  
Mr D said that wasnt  right, if a debt goes to a debt recovery company then its nothing  to do 
with the original people any more. Our investigator  wrote to him to say that he thought  
NewDay was asking  another  company to collect the debt for him, and it was allowed  to do 
that under  the terms of Mr Ds account. 
Mr D still didnt agree, so the case was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive reached the same overall conclusion  
as our investigator, and for broadly  the same reasons.
Mr D started to have trouble with his credit  card account late in 2018. The account is now 
suspended. He was last charged interest on 16 December 2018. Ive looked at Mr Ds 
statements, and the online  banking screenshots he showed us, and I cant  see that NewDay  
has charged any interest on this account since December  2018. I dont think  NewDay  is 
asking Mr D to pay interest on this debt. 
Mr D also said that the account had been  passed to a debt collection agency,  so he didnt  
think it was anything to do with NewDay any more. But thats not right. 
This debt hasnt been sold.  Although  it might  be sold in the future, at the moment, Mr D still 
owes money to NewDay. 
But NewDay  doesnt want to keep asking Mr D for the money  itself.  So its told a different 
organisation, the debt collection agency, to collect its money  for it. That means Mr D should 
continue to pay that agency,  and it will pass the money on to NewDay.  
Because Mr D still owes the money to NewDay, its not wrong  for NewDay to write  to him 
and tell him how much he owes  it. I dont  think NewDay has made  a mistake about that. 
I know that Mr D will be disappointed, but I dont think  that his complaint should be upheld.

I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 September  2019.
