The complaint
Mrs K complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) has taken 300 USD from 
her account.
What happened
On 4 July 2022 Mrs K received a payment of 150 USD to her PayPal business account from 
someone in the USA. The sender of the payment then opened a dispute on 6 July 2022, 
saying that the funds were sent in error to the wrong merchant. PayPal notified Mrs K that 
the funds would be reversed the following day and asked her to ensure her PayPal balance 
was sufficient to cover the debit by 15 July 2022. The reversal of the payment left Mrs Ks 
account in a negative balance. The position was made worse on 4 August 2022 when 
PayPal made a mistake and deducted an additional 150 USD from Mrs Ks account. PayPal 
credited Mrs Ks account with 150 USD on 20 September 2022.
Mrs K received some payments from other customers of hers but despite this her account 
still had a negative balance of around 59 USD. PayPal communicated with Mrs K about the 
debt and ultimately passed the debt to an outside collection agency. When Mrs K raised a 
complaint with this service in November 2022 PayPal suspended all collections and took Mrs 
Ks account back from the collection agency.
Mrs K is unhappy with PayPals decision to reverse the payment in July 2002. She says she 
provided PayPal with evidence that she provided a service to the sender of the payment, so 
the payment wasnt made in error. The issue was that after shed done most of the work that 
had been agreed the sender of the funds tried to change the scope of the work to something 
much more complex. Mrs K believes that PayPal didnt review the evidence or take into 
account the fact that she has invoiced customers for significant sums and never had a 
dispute raised before. 
Mrs K is also unhappy that the reversal took her account to a negative balance, the fact 
PayPal took 150 USD twice, the service provided by PayPal and its decision to suspend her 
account and chase her for a debt that she doesnt consider she is responsible for.
Mrs K says the impact of PayPals actions has been wide-ranging. She spent a lot of time 
trying to resolve matters with PayPal without success so had to bring a complaint to our 
service. PayPal kept telling her it was escalating her concerns but didnt do anything. Mrs K 
also says that she can no longer receive funds in respect of her business and so her 
business has failed. She believes PayPal has closed the account although I understand this 
isnt the case. In addition to this, Mrs K will have to spend a significant amount of money to 
build a new website. She would like PayPal to compensate her.
Our investigation so far
While the complaint was with this service PayPal made an offer of £150 in full and final 
settlement of the complaint. Mrs K rejected the offer and said she wont settle for less than 
25,000 USD.
The investigator who considered this complaint recommended that it be upheld in part. She 
said that PayPal could have done more for Mrs K, particularly given that she provided 
evidence that a service was provided (and given that PayPal didnt provide any evidence of 
the dispute that was raised against Mrs K). Overall, the investigator said that PayPal 
shouldnt have reversed the 150 USD payment without thoroughly investigating the case. To 
put things right PayPal should reimburse this payment. In terms of the second payment, the 
investigator noted that PayPal rectified this error as soon as it was aware of it, but this still 
left the account with a negative balance.
The investigator went on to say that whilst the removal of 150 USD by PayPal resulted in a 
negative balance, Mrs K was aware of this and could have mitigated the losses she says 
flow from PayPals mistake by clearing the balance until the matter was resolved. She also 
said that PayPal has confirmed the account can be used again as soon as the balance is 
restored. In terms of compensation, the investigator said an award of £150 was fair and that 
it wasnt reasonable to apply an hourly rate to the time spent trying to resolve the matter. 
PayPal agreed to make the payments the investigator recommended. Mrs K was unhappy 
with the investigators findings. In summary, she said:
- PayPal refunded her customer without considering her detailed evidence to show she 
provided a quality service. This left her account with a negative balance.  
- PayPal withdrew the amount twice, increasing the negative balance. 
- Customers made further purchases and the payments were used to reduce the 
negative balance. Mrs K was then left with a negative balance of -57 USD.
- She spent ten months trying to resolve the issue with PayPal. During this period Mrs 
K asked for her dispute to be escalated and said she was involving this service, but 
PayPal refused to escalate it. 
- PayPal has denied her access to its chat function to support her complaint.  
- PayPal closed her account which has destroyed her business. 
- She has had no compensation for the loss of her business and the loss of revenue, 
or for the time spent trying to resolve the issue with PayPal. 
- Shed like PayPal to learn a lesson about customer service.
The complaint has been passed to me to issue a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The starting point here is the dispute that was raised in July 2022. PayPal say it had to follow 
a particular process in respect of remittance transfers and a regulation that allows the sender 
of such a transfer to dispute the transaction for specified reasons (including that the funds 
were sent in error). PayPal say that under these regulations it was required to reverse the 
transaction. And seller protection cant apply because no goods or services were bought and 
sold (given the dispute reason). In any event, PayPal says that it has discretion as to 
whether seller protection applies. 
Like the investigator, I dont consider PayPal has treated Mrs K fairly. She has provided 
evidence to show a service was provided to the person who sent funds and then raised a 
dispute. Removing seller protection, that it seems would have applied were it not for the type 
of dispute the seller chose to raise, without any investigation or opportunity for a customer to 
defend themselves, doesnt seem fair. So, I consider PayPal should reimburse 150 USD to 
Mrs Ks account because it didnt look into things further. 
Its clear that PayPal made a mistake in deducting the payment twice. I can see from 
PayPals communications with Mrs K that she raised the issue on 3 September 2022 and 
PayPal rectified the issue on 20 September 2022. I appreciate the mistake should never 
have happened, but I think PayPal did what it should have done to put things right (although it could have done so more quickly). Mrs Ks account would have a negative balance without 
this additional deduction though. 
I turn now to the service provided by PayPal and to the losses Mrs K says shes incurred as 
a result of PayPals action/inaction. 
PayPal informed Mrs K about the reversal on 7 July 2022 and communicated regularly with 
her throughout August 2022:
4 August  Your PayPal account is showing an amount owing to us
10 August  Reminder to resolve your balance
If you dont resolve restore your balance, you may not be able to fully use your PayPal 
account and we may continue with efforts to collect the amount.
17 August  as on 10 August
24 August  Your PayPal account needs attentionif you dont restore your balance, we 
may involve an external collection agency to recover this amount.
31 August  as above
So, I consider PayPal made the position clear to Mrs K and was open about the 
consequences of not resolving the balance issue. 
On 1 September 2022 Mrs K first contacted PayPals chat function. She said PayPal had 
closed a dispute in the other partys favour when she had provided proof the job was done. 
Mrs K agreed to send the conversation to a customer support agent. The following day she 
received a response to say that she received a correction of 150 USD on 5 August 2022. It 
was at this stage that Mrs K realised the amount had been taken from her account twice and 
asked PayPal to resolve the issue. The issue of the double debit was escalated on 4 
September when it was raised with PayPal and the following day Mrs K said shed also like 
PayPal to re-investigate the dispute. The following day Mrs K was told that once a dispute 
has been closed PayPal cant reopen it and that the funds were reversed after a detailed 
investigation. Mrs K was advised to call PayPal and told that due to the type of dispute 
PayPal couldnt discuss it further in the chat function. 
On 17 September 2022 Mrs K contacted PayPal via its chat again and said she would make 
a complaint to this service if the funds werent returned. The following day Mrs K was again 
told the dispute was closed but also that shed be kept updated. On 20 September a 
supervisor at PayPal told Mrs K a payment had been reversed and they would look into the 
fact the amount had been debited twice. Mrs K again said shed provided evidence but was 
told the case was closed. Mrs K then brought a complaint to this service.
I can appreciate Mrs Ks frustration. PayPals responses were unhelpful and on occasion 
contradictory. So Im satisfied that its fair to award Mrs K some compensation. But I dont 
consider PayPal should be held liable for the losses Mrs K has asked it to pay. I think it 
would have been reasonable for Mrs K to temporarily credit her business account so that 
there was no longer a negative balance. This would have meant Mrs K could continue to 
operate her business as normal until such a time as her dispute was resolved. I dont 
consider the losses Mrs K is claiming were reasonably foreseeable following PayPals 
decision to reverse the 150 USD transaction. 
On balance, I think the £150 compensation the investigator recommended is fair and 
reasonable in this case. Sometimes customers are compelled to bring a complaint to this 
service to consider, but we dont award compensation based on an hourly rate that could be 
earned.
My role is to look at the individual circumstances of Mrs Ks complaint. I cant punish PayPal 
or ask it to change the way it deals with customers. My final decision
For the reasons given, I require PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to:
- Refund 150 USD; and
- Pay interest on the above amount at the rate of 8% simple per year from the date the 
transaction was reversed until the date of settlement; and
- Pay Mrs K £150 compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 January 2024.
