Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ms complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 
onwards shouldnt have been given because it looked like she wasnt managing her money 
and was becoming reliant on this type of lending. CashFloat disagreed. It said Miss M was 
earning a high wage and her debt-to-income was low, so it felt the checks it had done were 
proportionate to her income and the amount she was borrowing. 
As CashFloat asked for an ombudsmans decision, the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
CashFloat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure      
Miss M could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that CashFloat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashFloat was required to establish 
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as 
being without undue difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on 
time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to 
meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint. 
There was a significant break in Miss Ms borrowing from CashFloat. There was a gap of 
around seven months between loans 6 and 7. I think it would be reasonable for CashFloat to 
view this gap as an indication that Miss Ms finances had stabilised after whatever the 
circumstances were that had caused her to take out her previous loans. So, I will look at 
Miss Ms borrowing in two separate lending chains. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Miss Ms complaint about loans 1 to 3. Miss M didnt respond 
to the adjudicators opinion. As there appears to no longer be a dispute about these loans, I 
wont be making any further findings on them. This leaves loan 4 onwards for me to 
consider.
 
 
Chain one  loans 4 to 6As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate check for loan 4 would most likely have shown 
that Miss M had borrowing from other short-term lenders. The repayments to these other 
lenders were increasing her monthly outgoings. This was also Miss Ms fourth loan in eight 
months, and she had been in debt with CashFloat for all this time, with only very small 
breaks between loans. And she had been increasing the amount she was borrowing each 
time. All this behaviour seemed to indicate that Miss M was in a cycle of debt and borrowing 
money to repay current borrowing. In the circumstances there was a risk that by allowing 
Miss M to take on further loans she wouldnt be able to sustainably make the repayments. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of CashFloats lending history with Miss M, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which CashFloat should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so CashFloat should have realised 
that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Miss Ms case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because: 
At this point CashFloat ought to have realised Miss M was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss M had taken out six loans within 16 months. So CashFloat 
ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss M was having to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Ms indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ms first loan was for £400 and loan 6 was for £950.  At this point CashFloat 
ought to have known that it was unlikely Miss M was borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in her income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
Miss M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed CashFloat. As 
mentioned above, loan 6 was taken out 16 months after Miss Ms first. And it was for 
a much larger amount. Miss M had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service 
a debt to CashFloat over an extended period.
 
I think that Miss M lost out because CashFloat continued to provide borrowing at loan 6 
because:
this loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Miss M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Miss Ms ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans. 
 
Chain two  loan 7
CashFloat says it carried out checks before it lent loan 7 to Miss M and the results of these 
checks didnt raise any concerns. It has provided us with a copy of the results of the checks. 
Looking at these, I can see that Miss M had a significant amount of credit commitments and 
adverse markings. I think this information ought to have prompted CashFloat to verify what 
Miss M was telling it about her financial circumstances  such as asking for copies of her 
bank statements and to see her payslips and/or bills. 
Had CashFloat done this, its likely to have found Miss M had multiple outstanding loans with 
other short-term lenders. This - added to her other significant credit commitments - would 
have shown that Miss M was in a debt-cycle and was borrowing further to repay other 
borrowing.  And CashFloat ought to have known that this kind of behaviour would have been difficult for Miss M to sustain. I think this has been proven by the fact the balance on loan 7 
remains outstanding. 
So, Im upholding Miss Ms complaint about loans 4 to 7 and CashFloat should put things 
right.
Putting things right
If CashFloat has sold the outstanding debt CashFloat should buy this back if CashFloat is 
able to do so and then take the following steps. If CashFloat cant buy the debt back, then 
CashFloat should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) CashFloat should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss M towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything CashFloat has already refunded.
B) CashFloat should calculate 8% simple interest on the individual payments made by Miss 
M which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss M originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) CashFloat should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on loan 7, and 
treat any repayments made by Miss M as though they had been repayments of the principal 
on this loan. If this results in Miss M having made overpayments then CashFloat should 
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from 
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. CashFloat 
should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on loan 7. If this results in a surplus, then the 
surplus should be paid to Miss M. However, if there is still an outstanding balance then 
CashFloat should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss M. CashFloat 
shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal CashFloat has already written-
off.
E) CashFloat should remove any adverse information recorded on Miss Ms credit file in 
relation to loans 4, 5 and 7.  Any information recorded about loan 6 is adverse, so CashFloat 
should remove this loan entirely from Miss Ms credit file. CashFloat does not have to 
remove loan 7 from Miss Ms credit file until this has been repaid, but CashFloat should still 
remove any adverse information recorded about the loan.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashFloat to take off tax from this interest. CashFloat 
must give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
My final decision
Im partially upholding Miss Ms complaint. Western Circle Ltd should put things right as set 
out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 August 2020.
