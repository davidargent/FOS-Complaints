The complaint
Mr and Mrs A complain about the way that a conservatory, that they paid for using a fixed 
sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank Limited, was sold to them. Theyre being 
represented in their complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr and Mrs A used a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank that they 
electronically signed in December 2018 to pay for a conservatory. The loan was for £9,376 
which they agreed to repay by 120 monthly instalments of £170.76. They also signed the 
suppliers purchase order.
Mr and Mrs As representative complained to Shawbrook Bank in October 2019 about the 
way that the conservatory and the loan agreement were sold to Mr and Mrs A. Shawbrook 
Bank set out in detail its reasons for rejecting their complaint but Mr and Mrs A werent 
satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. She considered 
Shawbrook Banks response to Mr and Mrs As claim under section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974. She didnt agree that Shawbrook Bank had acted unfairly. Nor did she 
agree that Shawbrook Bank should rescind the agreement or refund the repayments that Mr 
and Mrs A had made. 
Mr and Mrs As representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. Their representative says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
the supplier wasnt unauthorised to be a credit broker and the loan agreement shows 
the credit intermediary as being a company that was related to the supplier but had 
stopped trading;
the related company was taken to court in June 2016, and convicted in June 2017, of 
using high-pressure sales tactics but continued to use banned sales practices and 
Shawbrook Bank would have been aware of that;
Mr and Mrs A were given incorrect information by the supplier and if theyd been 
given the correct information they wouldnt have agreed to buy the conservatory and 
they havent been allowed a proper choice;
the documentation used by Shawbrook Bank breaches section 61(1) of the 
Consumer Credit Act because its not accurate or in line with the sales contract 
signed by Mr and Mrs A; and
Mr and Mrs A were told by the supplier that theyd qualify for a cashback card which 
would provide some money towards the payment of the loan but theyve used the 
card and not received any cashback.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr and Mrs A used credit provider by Shawbrook Bank to pay for the conservatory 
and, in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim 
against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr and Mrs As complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
of the conservatory and that Shawbrook Banks response to their claim under section 
75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs As 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr and Mrs A signed the suppliers purchase order form which showed a contract 
price of £10,646 for the conservatory, an account subsidy of £1,270 reduced the 
account option price to £9,376 and the account option had been selected on the 
form;
Mr and Mrs A also signed a feature home agreement and subsidy analysis in which 
they agreed to participate in a feature home promotion and it set out a two year fixed 
cost of the conservatory of £12,700 and the total marketing subsidy of £3,175 which 
reduced the price to £9,525  which was £149 more than the amount shown on the 
purchase order and the loan agreement;
Mr and Mrs A electronically signed the fixed sum loan agreement in December 2018 
and it set out that the total price of the conservatory and the amount of credit as 
£9,376 - and it also set out the other required information including the interest rate, 
the total amount payable and the number and the amount of the monthly 
repayments;
the loan agreement said that the credit intermediary was a company that had 
stopped trading and which was related to the supplier  that was clearly incorrect but 
the supplier was correctly identified on the order form and was using a trading style 
that used part of the name of the related company;
Mr and Mrs As representative has provided a report about some legal proceedings 
against the related company in which it was convicted of using high-pressure sales 
tactics  but it hasnt provided a copy of the court judgment so Ive not been able to 
fully consider those proceedings  but those legal proceedings are about the related 
company and not the supplier and they arent enough to show that the supplier used 
those high-pressure sales tactics when selling the conservatory to Mr and Mrs A;
I consider that Mr and Mrs A would have known, or ought reasonably to have known, 
that the supplier was the company identified on the order form and that the loan was 
being provided to them by Shawbrook Bank  even though the credit intermediary 
was incorrectly shown on the loan agreement - and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that they were induced into making the order, or entering 
into the loan agreement by a misrepresentation about the identity of the supplier;
Mr and Mrs As representative says that the loan agreement isnt accurate so doesnt 
comply with section 61(1) of the Consumer Credit Act  but Mr and Mrs A had agreed 
to pay £9,376 for the conservatory which was the amount of credit provided to them 
under the loan agreement, and Im not persuaded that the error about the credit 
intermediary would be enough to cause the loan agreement not to comply with 
section 61(1) or not to have been properly executed (but that would be for a court to 
decide); the conservatory was installed so Mr and Mrs A received the conservatory that theyd 
agreed to pay for  and they say that they dont have any problem with the 
conservatory and are still advertising for the supplier with its poster in their window - 
but theyve complained about the sales tactics that were used by the supplier;
Mr and Mrs A agreed to pay £9,376 for the conservatory as described on the 
purchase order, which included the subsidies that were shown on the order form and 
the feature home agreement, and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that the supplier misrepresented the conservatory or the loan agreement to Mr 
and Mrs A at that time or that it used sales tactics for which Shawbrook Bank would 
have any liability under section 75;
the order form said that the supplier would accept a cancellation of the contract if it 
received notice in writing within 7 days and the loan agreement said that Mr and 
Mrs A could withdraw from the loan agreement within 14 days  but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that Mr and Mrs A tried to cancel the order or withdraw from the 
loan within those periods and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to 
have tried to do so if they were concerned about the way that the conservatory had 
been sold to them;
Mr and Mrs A says that they were told by the supplier that theyd qualify for a 
cashback card which would provide some money towards the payment of the loan 
but theyve used the card and not received any cashback and the card provider says 
that it wasnt working with the supplier at that time;
Shawbrook Bank says that theres no evidence of the cashback card being included 
in the paperwork but I consider it to be more likely than not that Mr and Mrs A were 
given some information about the cashback card by the supplier  though theres no 
documentary evidence to show what that information was;
I acknowledge the attraction for Mr and Mrs A of receiving some cashback but I dont 
consider it to be likely that they were induced into making the order, or entering into 
the loan agreement, by a misrepresentation about the cashback card and I consider 
it to be more likely than not that theyd have made the order and entered into the loan 
agreement even if the cashback card hadnt been mentioned;
Mr A has also made a complaint about the way that some replacement windows 
were sold to him  and that complaint is being dealt with separately  but if he wasnt 
happy with the way that the replacement windows had been sold to him I consider it 
to be unlikely that hed have then ordered a conservatory from the supplier about five 
weeks later;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances  Mr and Mrs As representative has made many 
detailed points in support of Mr and Mrs As complaint  Ive considered all of those 
points but if I havent specifically referred to one of those points its because Ive 
referred to the ones on which I consider that I need to make a finding to reach a 
decision on their complaint;
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs A for the way that they clearly feel about their dealings 
with the supplier, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier; and
I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to their section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for 
me to require it to end the loan agreement, to refund any of their monthly payments 
to Mr and Mrs A, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to their complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs A to 
accept or reject my decision before 14 March 2022.
