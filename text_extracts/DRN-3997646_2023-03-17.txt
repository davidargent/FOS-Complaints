The complaint
Mrs G complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) has refused to refund the money she has 
lost following her falling victim to a scam. 
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to all parties, so I wont repeat what 
happened in detail.
In summary Mrs G received a message on WhatsApp from a business called 11 Street (X) 
that offered her an opportunity to make money. Mrs G caried out an internet search on X and 
found sone videos on YouTube explaining the opportunity.
Believing X was genuine Mrs G relied to the massage and was sent a link to the messaging 
platform Telegram which gave step by step instructions to set up an account with X.
X walked Mrs G through how to set up an account with the legitimate cryptocurrency 
exchange Binance which she was required to make payments through into the investment.
Mrs G was able to make a small withdrawal from her account with X which gave her further 
confidence the opportunity was genuine.
As Mrs G saw her returns increase, she was encouraged to deposit more money to earn 
higher returns. Mrs G was also encouraged to recruit more people to the platform to increase 
her returns which she also did.
When Mrs G later attempted to make a larger withdrawal, she was unable to.  First explained 
there were delays due to the high demand for withdrawals. Then X explained Mrs Gs 
account had been frozen. She would have to make further deposits and recruit more people 
to the platform to release her funds.
It soon became clear that Mrs G had been the victim of a scam and she has been unable to 
recover any furth funds from X.
Mrs G made the following payments using her Visa debit card to X via the legitimate 
cryptocurrency exchange Binance:
1. 13 January 2022 - £202
2. 13 January 2022 - £31

Our Investigator considered Mrs Gs complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Mrs G 
disagreed, she thought HSBC should have done more to protect her from the scam.
As Mrs G disagreed this complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The circumstances of this complaint are not in dispute and the evidence provided by both 
Mrs G and HSBC set out what happened well. What is in dispute is whether HSBC should 
refund any of the money Mrs G has lost because of this scam.
HSBC was unable to process a chargeback for the payments Mrs G made in relation to this 
scam to Binance via her debit card.
The chargeback scheme is a voluntary scheme set up to resolve card payment disputes
between merchants and cardholders. The card scheme operator ultimately helps settle 
disputes that cant be resolved between the merchant and the cardholder.
Such arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme, meaning there are only limited
grounds and limited forms of evidence that will be accepted for a chargeback to be
considered valid, and potentially succeed. Time limits also apply.
Mrs G was dealing with X, which was the business that instigated the scam. But Mrs G didnt 
make the debit card payment to X directly, she paid a separate cryptocurrency exchange 
(Binance). This is important because HSBC was only able to process chargeback claims 
against the merchant she paid (Binance), not another party (such as X).
The service provided by Binance would have been to convert or facilitate conversion of
Mrs Gs payments into cryptocurrency. Therefore, Binance provided the service that was 
requested; that being the purchase of the cryptocurrency.
The fact that the cryptocurrency was later transferred elsewhere  to the scammer  doesnt
give rise to a valid chargeback claim against the merchant Mrs G paid. As X provided the 
requested service to Mrs G any chargeback attempt would likely fail.
I think its most likely Mrs G authorised the payments that were made from her account with 
HSBC, albeit on Xs instruction. So, the starting point here is that Mrs G is responsible. 
However, banks and other Payment Services Providers (PSPs) do have a duty to protect against the risk of financial loss due to fraud and/or to undertake due diligence on large 
transactions to guard against money laundering.
The question here is whether HSBC should have been aware of the scam and stepped in to 
prevent the payments from being made.
All the payments Mrs G made to Binance were for relatively low amounts. So, although Mrs 
G was paying a new business, I dont think the amounts would have triggered HSBCs fraud 
prevention systems. It wouldnt be reasonable for me to say HSBC should stop every 
payment a customer makes to a new business.
And while Mrs G made some of the payments the same day it wasnt unusual for Mr G to 
make multiple payments to the same business in a single day. So, I dont think this would 
have been considered irregular activity on Mrs Gs account either.
With the above in mind, I dont think the payments Mrs G made in relation to the scam would 
have reasonably triggered HSBCs fraud prevention systems. So, it wouldnt have been 
aware the scam was taking place and wouldnt have been able to stop it. For these reasons 
HSBC is not responsible for Mrs Gs loss and does not have to refund any of the payments 
Mrs G made in relation to the scam.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 April 2023.
