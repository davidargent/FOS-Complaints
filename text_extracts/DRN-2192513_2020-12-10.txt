The complaint
This is a complaint that AXA France IARD mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) to 
Mr B. AXA didnt actually sell the policy, but it has taken responsibility for the sale. So Ill 
refer to it as the seller. 
What happened
This complaint is about a PPI policy taken out in 2002 alongside a store credit account. Mr B 
was sold the policy at the same time that he applied for the account.
Our adjudicator recommended that the complaint be upheld. AXA didnt agree with the 
adjudicators opinion, so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding this case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Bs complaint. This is because I dont think AXA gave Mr B enough 
clear information about certain aspects of the PPI policy. Mr B had been diagnosed with a 
chronic medical condition; and hed have been unable to make a claim under the policy if it 
was caused by this pre-existing condition. The particular condition that Mr B suffers from is 
a potentially serious one; it runs the risk of causing a number of serious secondary medical 
conditions. Even if Mr B had the condition under control at the time, hes likely to have been 
aware of the risk of complications. 
There was no information about this on the application form, and I think its unlikely he was 
given clear information about this restriction in any other way. I dont think Mr B would have 
agreed to the policy, if hed had this limitation properly drawn to his attention.
Putting things right
AXA France IARD should put Mr B in the financial position hed be in now if he hadnt taken 
out PPI.
A. AXA should find out how much Mr B would have owed when he closed his credit 
account if the policy hadnt been added.
So, it should remove the PPI premiums added, as well as any interest charged on those 
premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused by the mis-sale of the 
PPI  as well as any interest added to those charges. 
AXA should then refund the difference between what Mr B owed when he closed his 
account and what he would have owed if he hadnt had PPI.
If Mr B made a successful claim under the PPI policy, AXA can take off what he got for 
the claim from the amount it owes him.
B. AXA should add simple interest on the difference between what Mr B would have owed 
when he closed his account from when he closed it until the point when Mr B wouldve 
owed something on his credit card. The interest rate should be 8% a year.
C. If  when AXA works out what Mr B would have owed each month without PPI  Mr B 
paid more than enough to clear his balance, AXA should also pay simple interest on the 
extra Mr B paid. And it should carry on paying interest until the point when Mr B 
wouldve owed AXA something on his credit. The interest rate should be 8% a year.
D.AXA should tell Mr B what its done to work out A, B and C.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires AXA to take off tax from this interest. AXA must give 
Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
If the lender has already repaid any commission amount to Mr B that relates to this PPI sale, 
that sum can be deducted by AXA from the redress shown above.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, Im upholding Mr Bs complaint. I require AXA France IARD 
to pay compensation as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 January 2021.
