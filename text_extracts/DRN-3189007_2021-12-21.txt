DRN-3189007
The complaint
Ms L complains that Topaz Finance Limited trading as Heliodor sent the results of her 
subject access request (SAR) to the wrong address.
What happened
Ms L made a SAR to Heliodor. She told Heliodor when she didnt receive the information she 
was expecting. It said that it hadnt updated her address correctly and that it had sent all of 
her information to her old address. 
The investigator said that Heliodors offer of £250 was fair in the circumstances. Ms L didnt 
agree. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It isnt in dispute that Heliodor made a mistake here. It was sending all of the information it 
held about Ms L to her. That would contain confidential financial information. So Heliodor 
should have taken care to make sure the information reached the intended recipient. 
Where a business has made a mistake, we look to put the affected party back in the position 
they would have been in had the mistake not occurred. Ms L hasnt given us any evidence 
that she suffered any financial loss because of what happened. 
I accept that it will have caused Ms L worry that her information has got into the wrong 
hands. But there is no evidence that it has or that it has led to Ms L being the victim of 
financial crime or anything that would have added to her distress and inconvenience. 
Overall, I consider that Heliodors offer of £250 is fair and reasonable. 
My final decision
Topaz Finance Limited has already made an offer to pay £250 to settle the complaint and I 
think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
My decision is that Topaz Finance Limited should pay Ms L £250 if it has not already done 
so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 January 2022.
