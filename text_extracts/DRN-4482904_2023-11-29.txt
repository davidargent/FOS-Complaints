The complaint
Mr O complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) restricted his account in 
May 2022 and withheld his payment for a property purchase. 
Mr O says NatWests actions caused him substantial financial loss and he should be 
compensated for this.  
What happened
Mr O instructed NatWest to send around £74,000 by CHAPS to his nominated solicitors 
account on 12 May 2022. Shortly after, NatWest carried out a review, and blocked his 
account and the payment. 
Mr O says he had informed and provided evidence to NatWest upfront of what he was doing. 
As the payment didnt reach the solicitor, Mr O was concerned he would breach the contract 
to buy the property. As it was the final day before completion and he worried he would incur 
financial penalties. Mr O says he called NatWest but was told they couldnt discuss what had 
happened. He adds that he was told hed get a call back, but this never happened. 
As Mr O was concerned about not being able to complete on the purchase, and that he 
would incur substantive financial penalties and loose his deposit, he took out a loan with 
another financial business.   
On 18 May 2022, NatWest completed its review and removed any restrictions from Mr Os 
account. The CHAPS payment subsequently debited the account on 19 May 2022. Mr O 
says he had to pay the loan company a redemption amount, an amount to draw down the 
loan, and interest payments per month before it was cleared. He says altogether this cost 
him over £5,300.   
Unhappy with NatWests actions, Mr O complained. NatWest did not uphold Mr Os 
complaint about the payment being delayed as it was following its security procedures. 
NatWest also pointed Mr O to the terms and conditions of the account, in that there are 
circumstances in which it may suspend or restrict the use of his account. It also said it had 
complied with its regulatory obligations in doing so, and its not required to give an 
explanation.  
NatWest also apologised that Mr O was incorrectly advised he would receive a call or letter 
from it about the payment not being made. NatWest offered Mr O £50 because of this, but 
he didnt accept. 
Mr O referred his complaint to this service. One of our Investigators looked into it, and made 
the following findings: 
- NatWest acted in line with its legal and regulatory obligations when it blocked Mr Os 
account to carry out checks and it doesnt need to give an explanation. Nor did it 
need to give Mr O prior notice of this
- Given the large amount that was being sent, they could see why NatWest needed to 
carry out checks in line with the terms and conditions of the account  
- The review was carried out in a reasonable timeframe, and the offer of £50 for poor 
service is fair 
Mr O didnt agree with what our Investigator said. And said he had provided evidence of the 
costs he incurred. Mr O also sent in further evidence about the property purchase, and the 
costs he incurred in taking out the loan. 
As Mr O didnt agree, this complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to not uphold this complaint. Ill explain why. 
Banks in the UK, like NatWest, are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to 
meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to 
restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts. This also means it may 
need to review individual payments. 
NatWest have explained why it took the actions of reviewing Mr Os account, alongside 
restricting it, and withholding the payment he was trying to make to a solicitor. Having 
carefully considered this, Im satisfied it was acting in line with its obligations. So I dont think 
NatWest did anything wrong here. 
Ive also carefully reviewed the terms of the account, and I note there are certain reasons 
why NatWest may limit the use of the account or delay acting on its customers instructions. 
Having considered this against NatWests reasons for doing so, Im also satisfied it acted in 
line with the terms of the account. I know Mr O would like an explanation as to why NatWest 
acted in this way, but Im not aware of any obligation under which it must. 
Mr O says this matter has caused him significant financial loss as he had to take out a loan 
to cover the money for the property purchase. I dont doubt what Mr O says about this but 
given I dont think NatWest did anything wrong by blocking the account and payment, I see 
no basis to make such an award of compensation. For the same reasons, I wont be 
awarding compensation for any distress and inconvenience this may have caused Mr O. 
NatWest accepts it erroneously told Mr O he would receive a call back or letter about the 
payment being delayed. And for this poor customer service it offered Mr O £50 
compensation. I dont think it needs to do anymore. 
My final decision
For the reasons above I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 December 2023.
