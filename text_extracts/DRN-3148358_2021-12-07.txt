The complaint
X feels that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has acted unfairly by applying interest 
and charges to her account. Shes said she was not aware of the interest and charges or 
that the interest would be increasing.
What happened
X complained to NatWest about overdraft interest and charges applied to her account. She 
says she was not aware the charges and interest would be applied or of how high the 
interest was, she was also unhappy with incorrect information about the interest rate that 
was given to her on the phone.
NatWest looked at Xs complaint, it felt the charges and interest applied to her account were 
fair. NatWest explained that the terms and conditions of the account allow it to apply interest 
and charges, and that the change in the interest rate applying to the account was notified via 
email to X in 2020. Nat West apologised for the incorrect information X was given on the 
phone and paid her £50 as compensation. 
X remained unhappy and so referred her complaint to us.
One of our adjudicators looked into Xs concerns, he explained that he didnt think NatWest 
had acted unfairly in applying the charges to Xs account. X disagreed and so the complaint 
was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about charges applied to overdrafts -
including the key rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having considered everything provided, Ive decided not to uphold Xs complaint, Ill explain 
why.
Im satisfied that NatWest did what it was required to do to ensure that X knew about what 
was happening with her account. The interest rate change in 2020  when the rate increased 
to over 35% - was notified to all customers and theres nothing that leads me to believe X 
wouldnt also have received that notification given that NatWest held accurate contact details 
for her. X has said she thought her account was fee free and has provided a letter from 2004 
which states this. I note though that it also details that she would be required to pay interest 
on her arranged overdraft, so X would have been aware that interest applied to her arranged 
borrowing from at least then. And regarding any separate overdraft charges for arranged 
borrowing, NatWest has told us Xs account has been a standard fee charging account for 
over ten years. And given that any charges would have been evident on Xs bank statements 
since they first started being charged, I think X would have been aware that they were being 
applied. I know that X has said she doesnt look at her bank statements, but that is her 
decision. And while I appreciate that she has dealt with some difficult personal 
circumstances over the years, it is still her responsibility to monitor her account.
With this in mind, I would only be able to find that NatWest had acted inappropriately or 
unfairly in applying the charges if I thought that NatWest was aware  or ought reasonably to 
have been aware  that X was experiencing financial difficulties. But from looking at Xs 
statements, while I can see that she did regularly use her overdraft, I can also see that X 
was receiving regular credits to her account throughout this period, and her account did see 
a credit balance on occasion. So on the face of it I dont think that NatWest would have seen 
anything to suggest that X needed help or to prompt it to proactively offer her help with her 
account.
With everything Ive seen, I dont think that NatWest has done anything wrong here. I also 
think that the £50 NatWest has paid to X is appropriate compensation for any inaccurate 
information she was given about the interest rate on the phone, so I dont think NatWest 
needs to do anything more in the circumstances. If X now needs help with reducing her 
overdraft, then she should contact NatWests collections team for advice, as suggested in 
NatWests final response letter.
I note that X has recently suggested that the increases in her overdraft limit over the years 
were unaffordable or unsustainable, but this is not a complaint that has previously been 
made to NatWest. So, in the first instance, X will need to contact NatWest with those 
concerns, if she is unhappy with its response, she may then be able to refer those concerns 
to us as a new complaint. I also note that X has said she thinks NatWest should provide her 
with a breakdown of the charges applied to her account for the last ten years, but there is no 
requirement for businesses to keep that kind of data for more than six years, so we wouldnt 
expect NatWest to go back any further than that.
I appreciate that this will be very disappointing for X, but Im satisfied that NatWest hasnt 
treated her unfairly, and so I dont think it needs to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask X to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2022.
