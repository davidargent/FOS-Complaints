K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains National Westminster Bank  Plc didnt transfer money to his joint account 
and then caused him unnecessary distress  and inconvenience.
background
Mr M has an account with NatWest in his sole name. He also has a joint account with them.
Mr M wanted to transfer money from his NatWest  account into his joint account so that his 
wife could pay some bills. Mr M says that the transfer initially  showed as having  been 
successful but that it ultimately didnt go through. He says that NatWest  then blocked his 
account and told him that hed have to take ID to his home branch in order to get the account 
unblocked. Mr M says this caused him significant  distress and inconvenience and that he 
incurred costs too. He complained to NatWest  asking  for compensation as well as a refund 
of approximately  Â£1,300s  worth of costs.
NatWest investigated  Mr Ms complaint and said that the initial  transfer had been flagged 
and it hadnt received a response to a text message it had sent. NatWest said that Mr M had 
then failed security questions when theyd spoken  to him on the phone, and that as a result  
of this hed been told hed have  to take ID to a branch in order to get the payment he wanted  
to make unblocked. So it didnt agree to refund the costs  Mr M had incurred  it did, 
however, agree to refund the cost of the calls made. Mr M was unhappy with this saying that 
he hadnt received  the text message and that the security questions hed been asked werent 
the ones hed given for his account. He also said he wasnt  told he could go to any branch. 
So he complained to us.
One of our investigators  looked into Mr Ms complaint. They didnt  uphold  the complaint 
saying that it was his responsibility to update his contact details and that he didnt have to 
travel back  to his home branch. They said that the steps NatWest had already taken  to 
refund the cost of calls made  were  fair and reasonable. Mr M disagreed  and asked for a 
decision from an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Ms wife has now been granted third party authority so that she can deal with Mr Ms 
account. Prior to that Mr Ms wife had been  helping him make transfers including the transfer 
that Mr M has complained  about.  Everyone accepts  that the transfer in question  was a 
genuine one. Indeed,  Mr M regularly moved  money from his account  into the joint account  in 
question. NatWest does, however, have systems in place that will flag potentially  suspicious 
transactions. Thats what happened in this case,  and had the mobile number  on the file 
being up to date NatWest would have  quickly discovered that the transaction was a genuine  
one. Unfortunately it wasnt. From the evidence Ive seen, it appears Mr M had a new mobile  
number and hadnt given this to NatWest. There was another opportunity for the transaction 
to go through,  and that was when  Mr M spoke to NatWest. Unfortunately  he wasnt  able to 
answer the security  questions NatWest asked properly. I know Mr M is unhappy with the 
questions he was asked   from what hes told us he seems to have been asked about recent 
transactions etc rather than answers to security  questions he would  have given when he 
originally opened  the account.  NatWest would, however, have asked these questions to 
Ref: DRN13509352make sure that the account  hadnt  become comprised  given that it already had concerns. So 
I cant say NatWest did anything wrong here.
Having been unable to answer  the security  questions that NatWest asked, Mr M says he 
was told hed have  to go to his local branch with ID in order to get his account unblocked. He 
was away at the time and says that this meant he had to return home, abandoning his plans 
and incurring costs.  I dont think, given  everything Ive seen, that I can say that NatWest  told 
Mr M hed have to go to his local branch. I think its more likely than not that Mr M was told 
that he could go to any branch, but he needed  to go back home as he didnt  have the 
necessary ID with him. Thats  unfortunate for Mr M, but its not something I can say is 
NatWests fault. So I agree  with our investigator  that it wouldnt be right to tell NatWest that it 
should be refunding the costs Mr M incurred returning home, or the expenditure he says he 
wasted.
I can see that Mr Ms joint account went overdrawn because the transfer  Ive mentioned  
didnt go through  until he went to his local branch  with ID. I can also see that Mr M incurred 
charges as a result  of this. Having checked with NatWest, I can see that it offered  to refund 
these charges and has done so too. I can see that NatWest also offered to refund call costs 
 on the basis  that Mr M and his wife spent three hours on the phone   and has done so too. 
I think that was helpful  of NatWest. I dont think it would be fair to ask NatWest  to do more 
than this given  that I cant  say it did anything wrong.  So Im not going  to uphold  this 
complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that Im not going to tell National Westminster Bank PLC to do more than 
it already has done.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 August 2019.
