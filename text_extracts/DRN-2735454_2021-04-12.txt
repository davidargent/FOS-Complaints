The complaint
Ms E complains that Homeserve Membership Limited should refund premiums she paid for a
home emergency policy.
 
What happened
The Financial Ombudsman Service deals with a consumer complaint against one insurance
company or other regulated financial firm at a time. In our final decision we name that firm,
but we dont identify any other party.
From at least February 2017, Ms E had a Homeserve policy that covered breakdown of a
central heating boiler and an annual service. Strictly speaking, an insurance company was
responsible for dealing with claims.
From July 2018, Ms E had cover from another insurance company. It covered breakdown of
a central heating boiler and an annual service.
In June 2020, Ms E complained to Homeserve that shed cancelled its policy on 7 February
2018, but it had continued to take payments by direct debit.
By a final response dated 9 July 2020, Homeserve said it had no record of Ms E cancelling
the policy, so it wouldnt refund her. Unhappy with that, Ms E brought her complaint to us in
early August 2020.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator dealt with the complaint as a complaint against the insurance company that
was responsible for dealing with claims under the Homeserve policy. She recommended that
the complaint should be upheld. She didnt think it was fair that Ms E had been paying two
premiums for the same cover. The investigator didnt think that the insurance company had
been on risk to pay any claims since Ms E took out the other policy.
The investigator recommended that the insurance company should refund Ms Es premiums
since July 2018.
Homeserve said the complaint should be recorded against Homeserve as it is responsible 
for all cancellations.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Ms E 
and to Homeserve on 3 March 2021. I summarise my findings:
I found that Ms E has shown that she had two policies covering the same boiler for 
the period from 9 July 2019 to about 24 June 2020 when she cancelled the 
Homeserve policy. And Homeserve had said she hadnt claimed on its policy.
So  notwithstanding that it hadnt done anything wrong to cause this period of dual
insurance  I was minded to find it fair and reasonable to direct Homeserve to refund 
Ms E the instalment payments she paid to it for cover in that period.
Subject to any further information from Ms E or from Homeserve, my provisional decision 
was that I was minded to uphold this complaint in part. I intended to direct Homeserve 
Membership Limited to refund Ms E the instalment payments she paid to it for cover in the 
period from 9 July 2019 to its cancellation on about 24 June 2020.
Ms E agreed with the provisional decision. She says, in summary, that:
She is still residing in temporary accommodation. For this reason, she still doesnt 
have access to any further correspondence to support her case. 
She hopes that the final decision can be kept to the Ombudsman's opinion. 
Homeserve disagreed with the provisional decision. It says, in summary, that:
There is no evidence Ms E contacted Homeserve to cancel the policy when she took 
out a new policy with another provider. The policy terms are clear what action must 
be taken if a customer wishes to cancel a policy. 
As it has done nothing wrong by continuing the policy, it doesnt agree it is fair to 
refund the premiums paid. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen a Homeserve renewal letter to Ms E dated 12 January 2018. It bears the logos of
Homeserve and a boiler manufacturer. It said the cost for the previous year (from 9 February
2017) had been £329.64. It said that the cost for the year from 9 February 2018 would be
£337.20. It said monthly instalments would be taken by direct debit on the 23rd day of each
month from an account ending 32.
The letter is addressed to Ms E at a farm. I find it more likely than not that Homeserve
posted the letter to that address. The letter had a schedule that identified the manufacturer,
model and identification number of the boiler.
The renewal letter said that the boiler manufacturer would be in touch about doing the
annual service, usually between April and September.
Ms E says she rang to cancel the Homeserve policy in February 2018. She has sent us an
itemised list of calls and highlighted one on 12 February (it doesnt specify the year 2018) to
an 0330 number. Ms E has also sent us an undated letter from the boiler manufacturer
inviting her to ring the same 0330 number to arrange an annual service.
So I accept that Ms E rang the boiler manufacturer on 12 February 2018. But Im not
persuaded that her call was about cancelation  or that the boiler manufacturer couldve
dealt with cancellation of the Homeserve policy.
Ms E didnt complain in 2018 that Homeserve took direct debits for the increased
instalments.Ms E has sent us copies of documents from the other insurance company. On close
inspection, these are for not one but two other policies.
One is a policy number ending 410. It relates to a boiler made by the same manufacturer.
The policy document said the boiler was at a lodge on the farm. The policy is for one year
from July 2018.
It said monthly instalments of £19.00 would be taken by direct debit on the 9th day of each
month from August 2018 from an account ending 5032 until 9 July 2019. Ms E has sent us
evidence of a payment of £19.00 on that date. So I accept that she had that policy for that
period.
I havent seen the Homeserve renewal letter in January 2019. But Ms E rang Homeserve in
January 2019. Ive listened to the call recording. Ms E said she had received the renewal
letter and was unhappy with the proposed increase in the cost. Homeserve reduced the cost
to £315.76 and Ms E confirmed that she was happy to continue with the cover at that cost.
I think the conversation wouldve been rather different in January 2019 if Ms E had already
rung to cancel in February 2018. So I find that Ms E hadnt asked Homeserve to cancel the
policy in February 2018. Also, Ms E didnt complain in 2019 that Homeserve took direct
debits at the new rate.
In any event, I dont find that Homeserve did anything wrong in relation to the renewals in
February 2018 and February 2019.
As the Homeserve policy related to the farm and the other policy related to the lodge, I
consider that Ms E has fallen short of showing that she had two policies covering the same 
boiler for the year February 2018 to February 2019.
For those reasons, I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Homeserve to refund Ms E for 
its policy for the year February 2018 to February 2019. But I think the position changed in 
July 2019.
The second policy from the other insurer is a policy number ending 324. The document
says cover started on 9 July 2019. And Ms E has shown us evidence of payments of £22.69
between 9 August 2019 and 9 July 2020. So I accept that she had that policy for that period.
It relates to a boiler made by the same manufacturer. The policy document says the boiler is
at the farm.
Ive seen a Homeserve renewal letter dated 13 January 2020. It bears the logos of
Homeserve and the boiler manufacturer. It said the premium would increase from £315.76 to
£429.60. As it is a business letter, I find it likely that Homeserve sent it. As she didnt
respond as before, I accept Ms Es statement that she didnt receive it.
Ms E contacted Homeserve in June 2020. That wouldve been around the time when the
other insurer wouldve contacted Ms E about renewing its policy.
The other insurers policy document (for the policy number ending 324) said monthly
instalments of £25.12 would be taken by direct debit on the 9th day of each month from 9
August 2020 from an account ending 9018. And Ms E has shown us evidence of a
payment of £25.12 from an account ending 90...on 9 November 2020. So I accept that she
had that policy for that period.
I havent found that Homeserve did anything wrong in relation to the renewals in February2018 and February 2019. And Ive found that Ms E has fallen short of showing that she had 
two policies covering the same boiler for the year February 2018 to February 2019.
However, I find that Ms E has shown that she had two policies covering the same boiler for
the period from 9 July 2019 to about 24 June 2020 when she cancelled the Homeserve 
policy. And Homeserve has said she hadnt claimed on its policy.
 
Putting things right
So  notwithstanding that it hasnt done anything wrong to cause this period of dual
insurance  I find it fair and reasonable to direct Homeserve to refund Ms E the instalment 
payments she paid to it for cover in that period.
 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Homeserve Membership Limited to refund Ms E the instalment payments she paid to it 
for cover in the period from 9 July 2019 to its cancellation on about 24 June 2020. 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms E to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 May 2021.
