The complaint
This complaint is about a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy taken out at the same 
time as taking a credit card in 1996. Mrs H says National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
mis-sold her the PPI.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Hs case.
Having done this, Ive decided the policy wasnt mis-sold. Ill explain why. 
Mrs H says she wasnt aware the PPI was optional. NatWest says it would have been made 
clear it was optional and it has provided a copy of Mrs Hs application form. 
Looking at the form, I can see it asks applicants to sign in the section heading Credit Card 
Repayment Protection if they want the policy and then sign separately for the credit facility. 
And there isnt anything to suggest that the PPI was compulsory. On Mrs Hs form, she has 
signed to take the PPI. If she didnt want the policy, she could have left the section blank. 
So, I think NatWest made it clear she didnt have to have the policy and she chose to take it.
Mrs H says NatWest recommend the policy to her. NatWest says it didnt recommend the 
PPI to Mrs H. Ive noted Mrs Hs comments about the wording saying NatWest strongly 
recommended that applicants took the policy, but this was a generic statement and not 
NatWest making a tailored recommendation for Mrs H. 
If NatWest didnt recommend the policy, it didnt have to check if it was right for her. But it did 
have to make sure Mrs H got the information she needed to decide if it was right for her. 
Looking at everything Ive been given, its possible the information NatWest gave Mrs H 
about the PPI wasnt as clear as it should have been. But based on what Ive seen of her 
circumstances at the time it doesnt look like she was affected by any of the exclusions to or 
limits on the PPI cover. And the PPI would have paid out on top of any sick pay Mrs H was 
entitled to, as well as helping her cover her repayments if she lost her job. So I think it would 
have been useful for her if something went wrong. It also looks like the PPI was affordable. 
So I dont think better information about the PPI would have put her off taking out the cover.
This all means NatWest doesnt have to pay back all of the cost of the PPI to Mrs H. But 
NatWest has paid back some of the cost of the PPI to Mrs H because:
NatWest got a high level of commission and profit share (more than 50% of the PPI 
premium) - so it should have told Mrs H about that. Because NatWest didnt tell Mrs H, 
that was unfair. 
To put that right, NatWest has paid back the amount of commission and profit share that 
was above 50% of the PPI premium - and I think that is fair in this case.
Ive thought carefully about everything Mrs H has said. But for the reasons explained above, 
these points dont change my decision. 
My final decision
The PPI policy wasnt mis-sold  so National Westminster Bank Plc does not have to pay 
back all of the cost of the PPI to Mrs H.
But National Westminster Bank Plc does have to pay back to Mrs H any commission and 
profit share it got that was more than 50% of the PPI premium. I understand it has already 
done this, so I dont award any further compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 February 2021.
