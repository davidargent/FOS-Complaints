The complaint
Mr M complains that he couldnt cancel an eCheque issued by PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA (PayPal).
What happened
In September 2020, Mr M wanted to send some money to a relative. He wanted this to be 
done quickly. He instructed a payment to be made from his PayPal account. There werent 
enough funds in the account. PayPal issued an eCheque and sent this. Mr M tried to cancel 
the eCheque but couldnt. 
Mr M complained. He wanted his relative to get the money quickly, but the eCheque would 
take 7 business days to clear. He called PayPal within an hour to cancel it, but they said they 
couldnt as the payment for it had already been requested from Mr Ms bank. Mr M said he 
wanted to complain to PayPal  but they didnt log his complaint effectively. And they 
wouldnt provide a UK address for him to complain to. He said that there had been various 
regulatory failings by PayPal in dealing with his complaint. He said PayPal had to reply to his 
complaint within 24 hours. He asked for compensation of Â£250,000.
PayPal said that an eCheque was issued because there wasnt enough money in Mr Ms 
PayPal account to meet the payment request  so there was a risk that the corresponding 
transfer from Mr Ms bank would fail. They said their terms and conditions cover this. They 
couldnt cancel the eCheque  as the payment request had already been sent to Mr Ms 
bank under the direct debit scheme. They said the agreed complaints process allows for 
eight weeks to respond to a complaint. They referred to their Luxembourg address and their 
regulators on their website. They acknowledged that Mr M had made a data access request. 
They didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Mr M brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said that PayPal told us that 
there had been several failed transfers from Mr Ms bank to PayPal  so there was a risk that 
this might happen again. So, PayPal sent an eCheque. This was in its terms and conditions. 
PayPal couldnt cancel the eCheque a- s the request for payment for it had been sent to Mr 
Ms bank. So, the only way to stop the eCheque was for Mr M to cancel the direct debit 
authority with his bank. And this is what happened  as Mr M did this on 14 September 
2020. She couldnt comment on the service provided by PayPal as the recordings of the 
calls werent available.
Mr M asked that his complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My role here is to decide whether PayPal acted correctly and fairly, and within their terms 
and conditions. This service cannot tell a company to change its policies and processes  
those are commercial issues for it to decide upon. Also, Mr M has made various complaints 
that PayPal showed various regulatory failings in dealing with his complaint. This service is 
not a regulator, and Mr M should contact the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) and 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with the points he wishes to make. I can comment on one 
aspect  Mr M complained that PayPal shouldve responded to his complaint within 24 hours 
 this is not the case. Under the FCAs DISP rules (2.8), a payments business (like PayPal) 
has 15 business days to reply. In this case, we asked PayPal to issue its final response on 
28 October 2020. They wrote to Mr M on 23 November 2020  18 working days.
Mr Ms main complaint is that PayPal issued an eCheque  rather than making an electronic 
payment to his relative, who needed the money urgently. And when he realised what had 
happened, and he wanted to make the payment another way - PayPal couldnt cancel the 
eCheque.
Ive looked at PayPals terms and conditions  and they do say that they can issue an 
eCheque. They say: When we receive a payment from your funding source we may store 
the resulting electronic money in your reserve account for as long as we have reason to 
believe that there is risk of reversal by the funding source provider. This is because we do 
not have all the information necessary to place the funds from your payment at your disposal 
in your PayPal balance while there is such a risk of reversal.
 When you instruct us to make a payment from your account to another user funded by a 
payment from your bank account and we store the resulting electronic money in this way, we 
call this type of payment from your bank account as an eCheque payment
Because Mr Ms PayPal account was in debit at the time  and PayPal have told us there 
had been some failed payments from his bank  they were concerned the direct debit from 
his bank would not be made. So, issuing an eCheque meant they could reduce that risk. Ive 
seen Mr Ms PayPal account and it was overdrawn. Given the circumstances, I think that 
was a reasonable thing for PayPal to do.
And  as soon as PayPal issued the eCheque, they sent a payment request to Mr Ms bank 
 and couldnt cancel this. Only Mr M could  which he later did, and the eCheque was then 
cancelled. So that seems reasonable to me. Mr M then repaid the balance owed on his 
PayPal account and closed it.
Mr M told us that PayPal handled his questions about cancelling the eCheque badly. And 
when he wanted to complain  they didnt properly record this or deal with it. We asked 
PayPal for the calls so we could make a judgement. But unfortunately, theyve been deleted 
in the normal course of business. So  theres nothing we can do here.
I can see that Mr M feels strongly about what happened. And so, I know hell be 
disappointed by my decision, but I wont be asking PayPal to do anymore here.
My final decisionI do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 April 2021.
