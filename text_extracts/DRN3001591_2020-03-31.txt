K821x#15complaint
Ms I says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny)  irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about nine instalment loans Sunny provided  to Ms I between November 
2018 and February  2019. Ms Is borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Max Repayment
1 04/11/2018 11/01/2019 6 £100.00 £27.25
2 01/01/2019 25/01/2019 6 £250.00 £100.42
3 07/01/2019 25/01/2019 6 £250.00 £170.84
4 10/01/2019 25/01/2019 6 £50.00 £184.68
5 12/01/2019 25/01/2019 6 £50.00 £171.25
6 25/01/2019 17/04/2019 6 £250.00 £73.72
7 28/01/2019 02/02/2019 6 £300.00 £161.55
8 30/01/2019 02/02/2019 6 £50.00 £176.02
9 04/02/2019 Outstanding 6 £400.00 £186.30
At the time of writing  this decision, there is an outstanding balance remaining on loan 9. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Ms Is complaint  and thought  the loans from loan 2 onwards 
shouldnt have been given as they thought Ms I wouldnt be able to make her repayments  
sustainably without borrowing more  and the pattern of borrowing indicated Ms I was reliant 
on short-term loans.  Sunny disagreed but offered  to uphold from loan 6 onwards instead.   
Ms I didnt respond to Sunnys offer so, the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms I could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN30015912the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms I could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Ms Is complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to more when it approved  loan 1. Ms I didnt 
respond to the view.  As there no longer appears  to be a dispute about this loan,  I won be 
making further findings on it.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 2 to Ms I and the results of these  checks  
didnt raise any concerns.  Part of these checks involved gathering information on Ms Is 
income and expenditure. For loan 2, Ms Is declared income was £1,900 and she declared 
her outgoings as £1,793. This would  have left her with a disposable  income of £107  to cover 
her loan 2 repayment  of £73.17, as well as any other expenditures. Given her income  and 
expenditure, I think its unlikely that Ms I would have  been able to sustain her loan 
repayments without  having to borrow again.  This was proven when Ms I borrowed again just 
six days after shed taken  out loan 2. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Ms I, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Ms Is case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Ms I was not managing  to repay  her loans 
sustainably. Ms I had taken out six loans in just under  three months. So Sunny ought  
to have realised it was more likely than not Ms I was having to borrow further to cover 
Ref: DRN30015913the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances  and that Ms Is 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ms Is first loan was for £100  and loan 6 was for £250.  At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that it was unlikely that Ms I was borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  
in her income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Ms I was provided  with a new loan within  days  of taking out the 
previous one. 
Ms I wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 9 was 
taken out exactly  three months  after Ms Is first. And it was for a much  larger  amount. 
Ms I had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Ms I lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Is indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Ms I borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Ms Is ability to access mainstream  credit  and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debt Sunny should buy it back  if Sunny is able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If Sunny cant buy the debt back,  then Sunny should  liaise  
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made by Ms I towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by 
Ms I which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms I originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should  remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Ms I as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Ms I having made 
overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Ms I. However, if there is still an outstanding balance  then 
Sunny should  try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Ms I. Sunny shouldnt  pursue  
outstanding balances made  up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
Ref: DRN30015914E) Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  recorded on Ms Is credit  file in relation to 
loans 2 to 5. The overall pattern of Ms Is borrowing for loans 6 to 9 means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove  these loans entirely from Ms Is 
credit file. Sunny does  not have to remove any outstanding loans from Ms Is credit file until 
these have been repaid, but Sunny should still remove any adverse information  recorded 
about these loans.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Ms I a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Is complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms I to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 May 2020.
