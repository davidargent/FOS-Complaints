The complaint
The estate of the late Mrs R complains about how National Westminster Bank Plc dealt with 
a request to pay funeral expenses, and to close the late Mrs Rs account.
What happened
Mr R is both the sole executor, and one of the main beneficiaries, of the estate of his late 
mother, Mrs R. He told us that he paid the funeral costs, because NatWest had told him that 
he could then ask for the money to cover these costs to be released from the account. But 
Mr R said NatWest didnt do what it had promised, and it caused delays in releasing money 
from his late mothers account. Mr R said he incurred costs on his credit card and overdraft 
because of this, and he wanted NatWest to pay those back. 
NatWest has apologised for incorrect information given to Mr R, and for delays in the 
process of closing Mrs Rs account. It sent him some flowers and a hamper. But Mr R said 
he couldnt pay his credit card bill with that. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said that payments on Mr 
Rs credit card were made before he went to a branch so she thought that these costs 
wouldve been incurred anyway. For that reason she didnt think NatWest had to pay Mr R 
the interest hed incurred. She said NatWest had sent Mr R the form he needed to close his 
late mothers account on 4 July. This didnt reach him, but she didnt think that was 
NatWests fault. When the form did reach him, and was returned, it was processed within the 
7-10 day timescale that NatWest gives for this. So she thought that the hamper Mr R had 
been sent provided fair compensation for this. 
Our investigator said NatWest had acknowledged Mr R had been given wrong information 
about its policy on reimbursing funeral expenses. But she couldnt see that it had dealt with 
the misinformation Mr R was given about closing his late mothers account. Hed been told 
on a number of calls that requests would be actioned within 48 hours. She thought the 
conflicting information Mr R had been given wouldve caused him distress, and led to him 
making repeated phone calls and visits to the branch, at an upsetting time. For those 
reasons, she suggested NatWest pay a further £100.
Mr R accepted hed made a payment to a funeral director before speaking to NatWest, but 
he said if NatWest had actioned his requests promptly, then he wouldve received the money 
much earlier. So he would still have been able to clear his credit card and overdraft. 
And Mr R didnt accept that NatWest had written to him on 4 July. He said no other post had 
ever gone astray. He asked if the letter was recorded. 
Our investigator didnt change her mind. She was satisfied the letter of 4 July was sent by 
NatWest. And she said she was also aware that Mr R had closed an account held by his late 
mother at a different bank, which contained much more money. He couldve used this money 
to clear the funeral expenses. Mr R didnt agree. He said our decision largely exonerated NatWest for its misinformation 
and the costs to him that resulted. He said hed agreed with the other main beneficiary to 
use the money in the NatWest account to cover funeral expenses, and then had divided the 
money held at a different bank between himself and the other beneficiary. He still thought 
that NatWests inaction, wrong instructions and delay had caused significant cost to him. 
NatWest agreed to pay the additional £100. But because Mr R didnt agree with our 
investigator, the case was passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I didnt propose to 
uphold it. This is what I said then: 
Id like to start by saying Im sorry to hear of Mrs Rs death. I realise this will have been 
a difficult time for Mr R with the loss of his mother, so any delays he had in resolving 
things will have only added to that. I hope were now able to bring this to a close for 
him. But before I begin, I need to set out the basis on which Im considering this 
complaint.
Mrs R was a customer of NatWest. Under the rules that govern our service, customers 
are able to complain to us. Once a customer has passed away, the right to bring a 
complaint passes to their estate. 
Mr R is the sole executor acting for Mrs R. He can act on behalf of the estate. When 
he is acting on behalf of the estate, he can complain about what NatWest did with Mrs 
Rs account. He can complain about the effect this had on the estate. 
Mr R isnt a customer of NatWest himself. And the rules of our service mean that he 
cant complain about any matters personal to him which he thinks NatWest is 
responsible for. 
This is unfortunately the unavoidable result of how our rules operate. The rules allow 
me, where appropriate, to award compensation for inconvenience caused to the 
estate. They dont allow me to award compensation to Mr R personally, for distress he 
has faced in his own personal capacity. I need to bear this in mind, when Im 
considering this complaint. 
I also need to set out my understanding of how estates are normally administered. Its 
my understanding that funeral costs would usually constitute a liability of the estate. 
That means these should be settled before any remaining money is paid out to the 
beneficiaries. 
In this case, I need to consider if its fair to ask NatWest to cover the costs of 
borrowing to pay funeral expenses, in circumstances when other money was available 
to the estate, and had been paid out to beneficiaries instead of being used to meet 
those costs.
I understand that Mr R took what he considered to be a practical decision, to pay 
funeral expenses with the contents of one account and to split the money in the other 
account with the other beneficiary. But Mr R has chosen to act outside of the usual 
order of payments. And other money was available to Mr R which could have been 
used to pay for funeral expenses. For those reasons I dont think it would be fair to say 
that any resulting costs to Mr R from the choices hes made in how the available money is used, should be paid by NatWest, even if I did hold it responsible for the 
delay. 
I also note that Mr R made at least some of the payments on his credit card for the 
funeral before he spoke to NatWest. So he didnt advance that money because of 
anything NatWest said. He paid the funeral director half the costs in advance, because 
that funeral director told him this could be claimed back from his late mothers bank. 
NatWest has told us it issued a letter to Mr R as executor on 4 July, telling him how he 
could close the account. Mr R says this letter didnt arrive. He doesnt believe it was 
sent. But Ive seen a copy. And I can hear on call recordings with Mr R, that NatWest 
refers to this letter which it sent at the start of July. He was concerned that it might 
have been sent to his late mothers address, but NatWest confirmed that this was sent 
to his address. Thats consistent with the letter Ive seen. So Im satisfied the letter 
was sent, and to the right address. I dont think it was sent recorded delivery, but I 
wouldnt expect NatWest to do that. So I dont think its NatWests fault if this didnt 
arrive. 
Mr R was given incorrect information about how funds would be released, and 
misleading information about how long it would take NatWest to process his request 
for account closure. He also told us that NatWest repeatedly promised to get back in 
touch with him, which didnt happen. Mr R was left chasing NatWest repeatedly to see 
what was happening. 
NatWest also doesnt seem to have picked up promptly on the fact that its letter of 4 
July clearly hadnt been received. I think this caused considerable additional work for 
Mr R. And I think that he was doing this work in his capacity as executor of the estate. 
So I think that it is reasonable, and more importantly, within my legal powers, to ask 
NatWest to pay the £100 in compensation that our investigator suggested. This money 
would be paid to Mr R on behalf of the estate of the late Mrs R, and in his capacity as 
executor. 
I understand that Mr R will be disappointed by this decision, but I dont think NatWest 
has to do more than that.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
NatWest said it had nothing to add. Mr R replied to object. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I havent changed my mind.
Mr R set out what he considered to be the key facts. He said that his mother had sadly 
passed away, leaving her estate to him and one other beneficiary. Her estate consisted of 
two bank accounts, and her home. Mr R said NatWest told him to pay the funeral expenses, 
and present all collated receipts for payment at any NatWest branch. Mr R and the other 
beneficiary agreed that he would pay the funeral expenses, against NatWests promised 
reimbursement. He paid about 50% of the funeral costs before visiting NatWest. 
Mr R said he never got the account closure form allegedly posted by NatWest, he eventually 
got a copy by email. He handed that form in, but NatWest further delayed the settlement of 
his late mothers account. Mr R said that the failure by NatWest to pay funeral expenses and its delay in closing his late 
mothers account resulted in him being charged. He said with hindsight he couldve paid 
these expenses from the other bank account, but he had followed NatWests advice. He said 
he was still out of pocket, through no failure on his part. He expected a sensible 
compensation figure, and for NatWest to review its bereavement procedures, so no one else 
had to go through the same thing. 
I do still think NatWest made mistakes in this case. And I understand Mr Rs frustration and 
upset at NatWest having let him down during an upsetting time. But I still dont think thats 
why hes out of pocket now. I think that happened because he paid money out of the estate 
to himself and to the other beneficiary, before meeting the liabilities of the estate. And he 
didnt need to do that. 
I know that NatWest made mistakes in this case, and I accept that those caused difficulties 
for Mr R and delayed the payment of money to the estate. But I dont think those mistakes 
are what caused Mr R to be out of pocket. So I dont think NatWest has to pay him back the 
money that he has lost. 
Mr R also wanted us to tell NatWest to review its bereavement procedures. Unfortunately, 
our service doesnt have powers to do that. We can only look at individual complaints.
Although I appreciate that Mr R wont agree, I still think that asking NatWest to pay £100 in 
compensation to the estate provides a fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint.  
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must pay £100 in compensation to 
the estate of the late Mrs R.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mrs R 
to accept or reject my decision before 2 July 2020.
