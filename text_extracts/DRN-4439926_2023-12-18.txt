The complaint
Mr H complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) has been unhelpful to him when he has been 
trying to use and activate his credit card. 
What happened
Mr H has a NewDay credit card account which he opened in January 2021. He never 
activated or used the card. In March 2023 NewDay wrote to Mr H to let him know if he didnt 
use the card before 4 June 2023 it would close for dormancy reasons.
Mr H tried to use the card on two separate occasions, 9 April and 12 May 2023. Both 
attempts were declined.
On 9 April 2023 Mr H raised a complaint about this through a third-party complaint platform. 
NewDay didnt respond to Mr Hs complaint and so he referred it to this service.
While our investigator was looking into Mr Hs complaint NewDay made an offer. It said:
it was sorry it hadnt responded sooner to Mr Hs complaint and offered £25 to 
recognise this. 
Mr Hs attempts to use the card had been declined because the card hadnt been 
activated and he needed to do this first.
Mr Hs credit card account remained open and so he could activate it now and begin 
to use it.
Our Investigator thought this was a fair offer and put this to Mr H. Mr H accepted the offer 
but wanted a contact email address to be provided to him for NewDay or a link to a secure 
portal to activate his card. NewDay needed Mr Hs correct email address confirmed to be 
able to send him a code to set his online account up.
Mr Hs email address was provided to NewDay and it confirmed it sent Mr H an online 
registration number to his email address on 21 September 2023, to allow him to set up an 
online account. Mr H seems to have had further issues setting the account up and so asked 
for his complaint to be referred to an Ombudsman to decide. The matter has now been 
passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise that Ive summarised this complaint in less detail than the parties and Ive done so
using my own words. Ive concentrated on what I consider to be the key issues. The rules 
that govern this service allow me to do so. But this doesnt mean that Ive not considered
everything that both parties have given to me. 
NewDay has confirmed it hasnt closed his account and if he activates his card, he will be 
able to use it. Mr H was sent the card activation details in a letter when he first opened the 
account. I cant hold NewDay responsible for him not doing that. This is what led to him not 
being able to use the card when he tried in April and May 2023. So, I dont think NewDay did 
anything wrong here.
NewDay has confirmed it has resent Mr H an online registration number to set up his online 
account manager, (its version of an online secure portal) so he can activate the card. It sent 
this to his email address, which he confirmed was the correct one, on 21 September 2023. 
So, it is now for Mr H to set his online account manager up and activate his card.
Mr H has had expressed he has found this difficult to do but hasnt been clear what it is that 
he is finding difficult. So, I have taken a look at NewDays website and can see there are 
instructions to help him which he can find here. If he clicks on the need help section, there 
is a video explaining how to register his account online. There is also a phone number he 
can use to contact NewDay if he needs further assistance or would prefer to activate his 
card by telephone.
Mr H has asked for an email address to be provided to him, but NewDay dont communicate 
with its customers in this way. I cant say this is unfair as its a business own commercial 
decision how it communicates with its customers and it does have an online alternative in 
the online account manager. So, I dont think NewDay needs to provide him with an email 
address to communicate.
NewDay recognises that it didnt respond to Mr Hs complaint from April 2023 and offered 
£25 to recognise this. In the circumstances I think this is fair.
 
Putting things right
Upon acceptance of this decision NewDay should pay Mr H the £25 it has offered.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I currently uphold this complaint and I require NewDay Ltd to 
carry out the actions as set out under the Putting things right section of this decision
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 January 2024.
