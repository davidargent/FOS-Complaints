The complaint
Miss O complains that National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) blocked and closed her 
accounts, without explaining why. And delayed releasing the account funds to her after it 
closed her accounts.
What happened
In July 2020, NatWest blocked Miss Os accounts while it carried out a review. When 
NatWest completed its review, it sent Miss O a letter dated 31 July 2020, giving her 14 days 
notice of its intention to close her accounts. It sent her a form to complete to arrange for the 
account balances to be released, and ultimately sent the funds to her on 21 August 2020.
Miss O called NatWest several times to find out what was happening, but she wasnt given 
any more information. Miss O told NatWest she couldnt feed her children without access to 
her funds or pay basic bills like electricity. But she was simply told shed need to wait for 
NatWest to complete its process, which can take up to 60 days. So, Miss O complained.
NatWest issued its final response to Miss Os complaint on 14 August 2020, saying it had 
followed its processes correctly and couldnt disclose the reasons for its actions. Miss O 
remained unhappy, so she brought her complaint to our service.
Our investigator upheld Miss Os complaint in part. She said NatWest was entitled to block 
and close Miss Os accounts, that it didnt have to explain the reasons for its decision, and 
that she was satisfied it had released Miss Os funds in a reasonable timeframe.
But she didnt think NatWest had given Miss O sufficient notice of its intention to close her 
accounts, so she awarded Miss O £200 for the distress and inconvenience she experienced 
as a result.
Miss O didnt accept our investigators outcome. She said she had experienced hardship as 
a result of NatWest withholding her money, and that shed had to borrow £1,000 to get by. 
She felt £200 was inadequate compensation, so she asked for an ombudsman to review the 
matter afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Account block
The banking industry is heavily regulated and all banks in the UK have numerous legal and 
regulatory obligations, with which they must comply. As part of those obligations, sometimes 
banks have to review their customers accounts and request certain information or 
documents. While the review is ongoing, theyre entitled to block the accounts. 
Having looked at all of the evidence, Im satisfied NatWest was entitled to take the actions it 
did. NatWest has explained that it was acting in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
Miss Os accounts and, having reviewed the same, Im satisfied that it was and that it was 
complying with its legal and regulatory obligations in doing so.
I understand Miss O wants to know why NatWest blocked her accounts, but NatWest isnt 
obliged to disclose the reasons for the block and review, so I cant say it did anything wrong 
by not telling Miss O when it first blocked the account, or when she subsequently chased 
NatWest for updates.
Its not the case that I dont recognise the impact the account freeze had on Miss O, its 
simply that NatWest was complying with its legal and regulatory obligations and the terms 
and conditions of Miss Os account, when it blocked and reviewed her accounts. And 
because I cant say NatWest did anything wrong, I cant reasonably tell it to take actions to 
put things right for Miss O.
NatWest completed its review promptly and communicated the outcome to Miss O as soon 
as it had done so. It also followed its process to release the account funds to Miss O, and Im 
satisfied it did so within its usual timescales.
If, having looked at NatWests file, I felt it had delayed matters or taken longer than it should 
have, Id ask it to compensate Miss O for any delay. However, while I cant tell Miss O what 
was happening during the block and while it was releasing funds, I am satisfied that NatWest 
didnt cause any delays that would warrant an award of compensation.
Account closure
A bank is entitled to close an account with a customer, so long as it does so in a way that 
complies with the terms and conditions of the customers account. 
The terms and conditions of Miss Os accounts  with which both NatWest and Miss O had 
to comply  say that NatWest could close the accounts at any time by giving 60 days notice, 
or immediately and without notice, under certain circumstances. 
Ive looked at the evidence NatWest has submitted to our service to explain why it closed 
Miss Os account without 60 days notice. And, while I can see why it decided to close Miss 
Os account with less notice, Im not persuaded by the evidence it has submitted that it was 
reasonable for it to do so. So, I think NatWest should pay Miss O compensation to put things 
right.
I need to be clear though that, for the reasons Ive set out above, Im not asking NatWest to 
compensate Miss O for the distress and inconvenience she experienced as a result of the 
time it took to release her funds. And that the compensation Im asking NatWest to pay 
relates only to the problems caused by having to make alternative banking arrangements at 
short notice. So, while I accept the surrounding issues will have exacerbated things for Miss 
O, I agree with our investigator that £200 is fair compensation in recognition of the shortened 
notice period.
I know this isnt the answer Miss O was hoping for, and I appreciate the limited information 
Ive given her wont answer many of the questions she had. But I hope she can take some 
comfort from what Ive said and in light of an independent third-party reviewing NatWests 
actions.My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank PLC must pay Miss O £200.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss O to accept 
or reject my decision before 23 September 2022.
