The complaint
Mr W has complained about the way ManyPets Ltd dealt with the renewal of his pet 
insurance policy. 
What happened
Before Mr Ws insurance policy was due for renewal on 31 October 2022, he contacted 
ManyPets and made some adjustments to the policy in order to reduce the price of the 
premium. ManyPets wrote to Mr W and told him his new premium would be £29.18 a month 
and it would set up a new direct debit for that amount.
In June 2023 Mr W noticed that ManyPets had failed to take any payments from him. 
ManyPets told him this was due to a system error on its part and asked him to pay the 
outstanding premiums. Mr W paid two months premiums at that time. ManyPets tried to 
collect all the outstanding premiums by direct debit but Mr W cancelled the mandate to 
ensure the payments werent taken. Mr W thinks he should have been offered a payment 
plan.
After Mr W brought his complaint to this service, ManyPets apologised and said he had up to 
the next renewal date to pay the outstanding premiums. It also said it was sending him a 
voucher of £30 as a gesture of goodwill. Mr W has since paid the amount due but told us 
having to pay over £200 in one go was difficult for him. 
Our Investigator thought the offer of compensation from ManyPets was fair and in line with 
our guidelines.
As Mr W didnt agree, the matter has been referred to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have to decide whether ManyPets acted fairly and reasonably in response to the mistakes 
it made. These were not collecting the monthly payments of the premium by direct debit. 
Also when Mr W pointed out this mistake, it didnt give him the option of a payment plan for 
the outstanding premiums. I think it did act fairly and Ill explain why.
I dont penalise financial businesses for their failings. So when determining complaints of this 
nature, it isnt the mistake itself that I consider but the impact this had on the consumer. In 
this case Im sorry to hear about the difficulties Mr W had in sorting out this mistake which 
involved several phone calls and the inconvenience of having to pay a relatively large 
amount of money in one go rather than having the payments spread by way of a payment 
plan. 
Although I appreciate that it falls below Mr Ws expectations, Im satisfied that ManyPets 
apology and compensation offer was a fair and reasonable reflection of the impact its poor 
service had on Mr W. In the circumstances I dont think there are grounds for me to require 
ManyPets to do any more.
My final decision
ManyPets Ltd has already made an offer of a voucher for £30 to settle the complaint and I 
think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So my decision is that ManyPets Ltd should pay Mr W £30 in vouchers if it has not already 
done so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2023.
