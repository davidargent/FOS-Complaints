Mr A believed he was in a genuine relationship with B. He realised he had been scammed 
when he heard a radio programme in 2023  which described a romance scam, and he then 
realised that was had happened to him. He says he couldnt face up to things before then as 
he was in shock.
Mr A says he was caring for his mother at the time and was vulnerable. He feels ashamed 
and frightened after what happened to him. He says firstdirect didnt stop any of the 
payments or ask him any questions when he called to make them. He says firstdirect 
shouldve done more to protect him. He says firstdirect should therefore refund some of the 
payments he made.
What firstdirect said:
Firstdirect said they couldnt listen to the calls made by Mr A when he made the phone 
payments - as these were a long time ago. But because the amounts paid were of a low 
value, they wouldnt have been flagged for fraud checks. They didnt uphold Mr As 
complaint.Our investigation so far:
Mr A brought his complaint to us. Our investigator didnt uphold it. She said the amounts 
paid were too low to have expected firstdirect to have stopped them and question Mr A. 
They were similar to Mr As normal pattern of spending. Firstdirect had tried to recover the 
amounts paid, but without success.
Mr A didnt agree. He said the guidance for when firstdirect should intervene meant that it 
was only richer people, paying larger sums of money away  were protected. He said 
firstdirect shouldve intervened and protected him. He asked that an ombudsman look at his 
complaint, and so it has come to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Ombudsman service is bound by the Financial Conduct Authoritys rules 
covering complaints, known as DISP rules (DISP 2.8.2). They state that we cant consider a 
complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the event complained about, or if 
later, three years from the point from which the complainant ought reasonably to have been 
aware they had cause to complain.
I considered the application of the six-year rule to Mr As complaint. He complained to 
firstdirect on 30 August 2023 (I listened to the call). So  applying the six-year rule to the 
payments, that means we cant consider the 53 payments made before 30 August 2017.
But Ive then considered whether Mr A complained within three years from when he became 
aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware that he had cause to complain. We put 
this to firstdirect who didnt agree that Mr A had done so and didnt give us permission to 
look at the 53 payments in question. 
But Ive considered this  and Mr A told us that he only realised he had been the victim of a 
romance scam when he heard a similar case being discussed on the radio  in 2023. So  I 
consider that was when he ought reasonably to have been aware he had cause to complain. 
And  as he then complained to firstdirect in August 2023 -  I consider he did bring his 
complaint in time, and within the three-year part of the rule.
So, all the payments made can be considered here; and I went on to look at what happened. 
Im sorry to hear that Mr A has lost money in a cruel scam. Its not in question that he 
authorised and consented to the payments in this case. So although Mr A didnt intend for 
the money to go to a scammer, he is presumed to be liable for the loss in the first instance. 
So, in broad terms, the starting position at law is that a bank is expected to process 
payments and withdrawals that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance with the 
Payment Services Regulations and the terms and conditions of the customers account. And 
I have taken that into account when deciding what is fair and reasonable in this case.
But that is not the end of the story. Taking into account the law, regulators rules and 
guidance, relevant codes of practice and what I consider to have been good industry 
practice at the time, I consider firstdirect should fairly and reasonably:
Have been monitoring accounts and any payments made or received to counter 
various risks, including anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, 
and preventing fraud and scams.Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that 
might indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (among other things). This is 
particularly so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, 
which banks are generally more familiar with than the average customer.  
In some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken 
additional steps, or make additional checks, before processing a payment, or in some 
cases declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect customers from the 
possibility of financial harm from fraud.
The Lending Standards Board Contingent Reimbursement Model Code (CRM Code) doesnt 
apply in this case. That is because it came into effect in May 2019  after the payments in 
question.
I need to decide whether firstdirect acted fairly and reasonably in its dealings with Mr A when 
he made the payments, or whether it should have done more than it did. I have considered 
the position carefully.
Were the payments unusual?: I looked at Mr As bank statements. He used his account for 
everyday spending and income. And so  the payments he made to the scammer (ranging 
between £1.90 and £300; with an average of £63)  didnt stand out to firstdirect, and 
therefore they didnt stop them or question them. If they had been of a much higher value, 
and were made in rapid succession, then we wouldve expected firstdirect to have stepped 
in. But here - that wasnt the case, and I cant reasonably say firstdirect shouldve stopped 
the payments, even though I accept they had a significant impact on Mr A personally.
The important point here is - theres a balance to be struck: firstdirect has reasonable 
obligations to be alert to fraud and scams and to act in their customers best interests, but 
they cant be involved in every transaction as this would cause unnecessary disruption to 
legitimate payments. In this case, I think firstdirect acted reasonably in processing the 
payments.
Recovery: We expect firms to quickly attempt to recover funds from recipient banks when a 
scam takes place. I looked at whether firstdirect took the necessary steps in contacting the 
bank that received the funds  in an effort to recover the money. Firstdirect showed us that 
they contacted the recipient bank, and no funds remained to be repaid. Given that the scam 
took place between 2016 and 2018, and Mr A complained to firstdirect in August 2023  this 
wasnt a surprise. I say that as normally in such scams, funds are removed from the recipient 
bank immediately. But  I can see that firstdirect did what they could here.
Mr A has lost a lot of money. Hes explained why the money was important to him, and the 
impact his losses have had. I was sorry to learn of his circumstances. He will therefore be 
disappointed by my decision, but Im not going to ask firstdirect to do anything here.
(continued)
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 January 2024.
