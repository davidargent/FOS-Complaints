The complaint
Ms W complains that NewDay Limited failed to credit to her account a payment she sent to it 
by cheque. 
What happened
Ms W had a credit account with NewDay. In December 2018 she sent NewDay a cheque for 
£250 to reduce the amount she owed it. In accordance with NewDays payment instructions 
she included her NewDay account number as part of the payee shown on the account.
Although the outgoing payment appeared on Ms Ws bank account, NewDay said it had no 
record of having received the cheque, and charged Ms W a £12 late payment fee. When 
she complained to NewDay, it refunded the late payment fee as a gesture of goodwill and 
asked that her bank carry out a trace on the payment.
Ms Ws bank discussed the issue with NewDays bank. They agreed that Ms Ws cheque to 
NewDay was included in a batch of cheques paid by NewDay into its own bank in December 
2018, and that NewDay had been credited with those funds, including Ms Ws payment.
Ms Ws bank said that NewDay might have credited the payment to another of its customers 
instead of Ms W. So it would have to go back to its records to ascertain which account it had 
applied the £250 to.
Ms W passed this information on to NewDay. It responded that it still didnt have enough 
information to find where the payment had gone in its system. Without this, it wasnt willing to 
credit the payment to Ms Ws account.
Our investigator recommended that this complaint should be upheld. He said the evidence 
Ms W had provided showed she had made the payment correctly, as she had included her 
account number on the cheque. 
The evidence her bank had provided showed the payment had reached NewDays bank and 
had been credited to NewDay. Ms W had passed on further batch number details and 
references which the investigator thought NewDay should be able to use to trace the 
payment.
He thought Ms W had provided satisfactory evidence to show receipt of the payment. He 
didnt think Ms W should be held responsible if NewDay couldnt locate it. He recommended 
that NewDay:
credit Ms Ws account with £250; and
pay Ms W compensation of £250 for the distress and inconvenience it had caused 
her.
 
Ms W accepted the investigators recommendation. NewDay responded to say, in summary, 
that it was still unable to locate the payment in its systems. It wasnt willing to compensate Ms W until the funds had been found and it was satisfied the misplacement was a NewDay 
error. It wanted Ms W to go back to her bank and ask for more information. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im satisfied that Ms W:
made out her cheque correctly and sent it to NewDay; 
it reached NewDay who paid it into its bank; and
NewDay was credited with the funds on 20 December 2018.
 
At NewDays request Ms W has also sought further information from her own bank about the 
circumstances of the payment arrangements between the two banks, and has passed this 
on to NewDay.
NewDay says it still cant trace the payment in its own systems. It wants Ms W to try to get 
more information from her bank, and wont credit her account until it has found the payment 
in its systems.
I think this is unreasonable. Ms W has made the payment - as long ago as December 2018. 
It reached NewDay then. Theres no evidence Ms W has done anything wrong whatsoever.
She tried to help NewDay by obtaining information about the payment from her own bank. I 
don't think it's fair for NewDay to refuse to credit the payment to Ms W's account until 
NewDay has found the payment within its systems.
Putting things right
In the circumstances I've described above, I think NewDay should credit Ms Ws account 
with the payment without further delay, and compensate her, and take the other action, as 
set out more fully below. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint, and order NewDay Limited to:
1. credit Ms Ws account with £250 without further delay. For the purpose of calculating 
interest on her account NewDay should treat the payment as if it had been credited 
to her account on 20 December 2018 and, if appropriate, recalculate the interest it 
has charged her ;
 
2. pay Ms W compensation of £250 (in addition to the compensation of £50 it has 
already paid her for poor complaint handling) for the distress and inconvenience it 
has caused her; and
 
3. remove any adverse information on her credit file about the late payment.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 April 2020.
