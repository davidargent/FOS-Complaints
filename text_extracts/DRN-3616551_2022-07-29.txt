The complaint
Mr B complains that he paid off his mortgage with National Westminster Bank Plc but the
payment was mislaid between NatWest, the mortgage provider, and his own bank
What happened
Mr B had a mortgage with NatWest and wanted to pay it off in full. Mr B wrote a cheque for
£60,720 drawn on his own bank, dated 1 April 2021, payable to NatWest and sent by post
on 31 March. NatWest received the cheque and began the process of redeeming the
mortgage when apparently for security reasons, Mr Bs bank stopped the cheque. Mr B then
confirmed his authority to his bank to pay the cheque and his bank says that it was 
represented on 9 April and the money taken from his account on 13 April. But on 14/15 April
NatWest told Mr B that it was still waiting on funds to redeem the mortgage. Following that
there was an impasse with Mr Bs bank telling him that NatWest had the cheque and
NatWest telling him that his bank continued to retain the money.
Mr B, assisted by his parents, main contact thereafter was with his own bank but wasnt
made aware until 13 May by his bank that his funds had been credited to the NatWest
mortgage account on 30 April 2021. NatWest said that it wasnt responsible for losing the
money but could have dealt with Mr Bs enquiries better and offered compensation initially of
£150 and backdated the redemption date so that Mr B had no extra interest to pay. It then
raised its offer to £300 which our investigator considered to be fair. Mr B disagreed and 
asked for a review.
my provisional findings
I obtained further information from NatWest which led me to a different conclusion to our 
investigator. As I disagreed in part with our investigators view, I issued a provisional 
decision which I set out below:
This was a substantial payment that Mr B made to discharge his mortgage. But he lost track
of the payment between 8/9 April when he instructed his bank that it could pay NatWest and
the 13 May 2021 when it became clear that it was in an account with NatWest from at least
30 April. NatWests position has been that it took from 16 April to 30 April for Mr Bs bank to
re-present the redemption cheque.
I made some further enquiries from NatWest who tell me that the cheque was in fact
presented into an internal suspense account on 20 April 2021, then into a cash and cheque
suspense account and then into another suspense account which presumably was the
suspense account that Mr Bs bank was able to see as having been credited on 30 April.
Mr B also brought a complaint to us against his own bank which has been investigated by
us. There is some documentation on that file relevant to this complaint. That gives some
assistance in this complaint as we can see the transaction form both sides. Mr Bs bank
emailed NatWest on 8 April to say:
Cheque was unpaid in error; customer would like the cheque to be paid in to pay National
Westminster Bank PLC are you able to accept credit?
NatWest replies on 8 April Please send funds thanks 
Mr Bs bank replies We are performing settle and close 
Mr B says that his account with his own bank was debited the redemption money on 13
April. I note that there is no query from NatWest about the money not being sent and with Mr
Bs account was debited, I believe that its reasonable to say that the funds were then
received by NatWest at this time. As I say NatWest has said that the money appears in an
internal suspense account on 20 April. Its not clear to me where it may have been
beforehand and whether it could have been lodged to another suspense account. In any
case its clear that the money was with NatWest earlier than the 30 April which was its
original position.
So, NatWest had the redemption moneys from about the 13 April and certainly by the 20
April. Mr B received confusing messages from NatWest. He was told his cheque had been
returned, then got a letter dated 10 April from NatWest saying that the mortgage had been
paid and then when he contacted NatWest on 19 April was told again that the cheque had
bounced back as unpaid. Mr B contacted NatWest again on 20 April and was told that
because the cheque hadnt cleared that the mortgage hadnt been paid off.
NatWest has now told us that they had this money from 20 April, the day that Mr B was told
that the mortgage hadnt been paid and he then directed his enquiries to his own bank to see
what had happened. Mr B in the meantime raised a complaint with NatWest and contacted it
on a regular basis to see what happened his money. It was not until 13 May that NatWest
after being prompted by Mr Bs bank checked the suspense account again and confirmed
that it held the money.
The evidence points to NatWest having this money a good deal sooner than 30 April. What I
find difficult to understand is that having raised the issue with Mr B on 14/15 April and Mr B
telling NatWest that the cheque was being re-presented that NatWest never thereafter
contacted him to say that they had got the money. I can understand Mr B being stressed at
the time not knowing what happened to the redemption money and being bounced between
banks to see where his money had gone when NatWest should have been able to tell him
from at least 20 April that it had the money. But for some reason it didnt tell him that until it
was prompted to do so by Mr Bs bank on 13 May. In fact, it continued as if the money hadnt
been paid and the mortgage hadnt been redeemed which meant that Mr B went chasing his
own bank on the mistaken belief that his bank hadnt repaid the cheque to NatWest in early
April.
NatWest should have provided a better service than this and I recognise its failure to do so
would have caused Mr B significant stress and inconvenience over a period of weeks. I note
that Mr B suffered no financial loss, but I have to decide whats the appropriate level of
compensation for his distress and inconvenience. My view is that £500 is an appropriate
figure. I note that NatWest offered compensation of £300 but I understand that was based on
the assumption that the money had only gone into its account on 30 April when in fact it had
happened earlier and NatWest had failed to alert Mr B for a longer period, So, my intention is
to uphold this complaint on that basis. As this is a different outcome than our investigator, I
am issuing a Provisional Decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Following the issuing of my provisional decision I invited further submissions from Mr B and 
NatWest. Mr B says that he will accept the award of £500. The representative from NatWest 
says that it reviewed my provisional decision and that the bank is very sorry for the trouble 
and upset caused to Mr B and says that it has no further points to make. So, in the light of 
those comments, I have reviewed my provisional decision and believe that it represents a 
fair outcome to this complaint and so ill be upholding this complaint in the terms of that 
provisional decision.
Putting things right
National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr B £500.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and that National Westminster Bank
Plc should pay Mr B £500.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 August 2022.
