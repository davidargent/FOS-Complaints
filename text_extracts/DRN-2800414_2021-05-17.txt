The complaint
Ms K complains that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly when it approved two credit cards and 
increased her credit limit.   
What happened
Ms K applied for a credit card (card 1) with NewDay in October 2016 and was given a £500 
credit limit. In Ms Ks application, she told NewDay she was employed and earned around 
£1,250 a month. NewDay completed a credit search and says it found Ms K owed around 
£600 to other creditors with no adverse information found. 
Over the following period of around 18 months Ms K maintained her payments but exceeded 
her credit limit ten times. In May 2018 NewDay increased Ms Ks credit limit to £1,300. 
NewDay says it took her account history and credit file information into account. In June 
2018 Ms K exceeded her credit limit. 
In August 2018 Ms K applied for another credit card (card 2) with NewDay and it approved a 
credit limit of £900. In the application, Ms K told NewDay she earned around £1,600 a 
month. NewDay completed another credit search and found Ms K owed around £5,200 to 
unsecured creditors with no adverse information found. 
In November 2018 Ms K told NewDay she was experiencing financial difficulties and was 
referred to a third party debt advice charity. Ms Ks accounts were placed on hold. In 
January 2019 NewDay agreed to accept reduced payments to each credit card. The first 
credit card was terminated in January 2019 which meant no further interest was charged. 
NewDay has confirmed no default was reported. Ms Ks second credit card was terminated 
in April 2020 and NewDay has confirmed no default was reported. 
In June 2020 Ms K complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly. NewDay said it had lent 
responsibly for card 1 but upheld Ms Ks complaint about card 2. NewDay refunded interest 
and charges it had applied to the account. 
Ms K referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
thought NewDay had lent irresponsibly when it increased Ms Ks credit limit on card 1 and, a 
short time later, approved the application for card 2. The investigator asked NewDay to 
refund interest and charges applied above £500 to card 1. They also asked NewDay to 
remove any adverse information reported about both cards. NewDay didnt accept and 
asked to appeal so Ms Ks complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As there are two credit cards involved in this case Ill look at each in turn. Ms K complains 
that NewDay lent irresponsibly when it increased her credit limit from £500 to £1,300 in May 
2018. Before a lender increases a credit limit it needs to consider whether the borrowing is 
sustainable for its customer. Theres no set list of checks a lender has to complete. In this 
case, NewDay says it considered the original information Ms K had provided in her 
application, the account history and information on her credit file. NewDay says the increase 
was in line with its lending policy. 
Ive looked at the information NewDay considered but I havent been persuaded it carried out 
proportionate checks. I say this because Ms Ks account history she had exceeded her credit 
limit around 10 times in the period leading up to May 2018. Whilst the account was always 
brought back within the £500 credit limit, I think that shows signs Ms K was having difficulty 
managing the account. The credit limit increase was reasonably large, going from £500 to 
£800. Whilst Ms K was employed, her income was fairly modest. The credit file information 
NewDay has provided shows the number of credit commitments had increased substantially, 
from two to nine. I also note Ms K was quick to utilise her full credit limit. 
In my view, these factors shouldve caused NewDay to carry out more proportionate checks 
before deciding whether to increase the credit limit or not. And, had NewDay carried out 
more comprehensive checks, I dont think it wouldve offered Ms K the credit limit increase 
from £500 to £1,300. I say this because the available information shows Ms Ks position was 
becoming unmanageable and the level of unsecured borrowing appears to have increased 
at an unsustainable rate. 
As a result, I agree with the investigator that Ms Ks complaint about the credit limit increase 
of card 1 should be upheld. I also agree that NewDay should refund all interest and charges 
applied to balances over £500. In addition, NewDay should remove any information it has 
reported on Ms Ks credit file in relation to any balance over £500 (including any adverse 
information). 
Card 2 was approved around three months after NewDay increased the credit limit on card 
1. Given Ms K had only recently been given a substantial credit limit increase on card one 
within the previous few months I think NewDay shouldve carefully considered whether it was 
right to approve card 2 with a £900 credit limit. NewDay upheld Ms Ks complaint and 
accepted it shouldve have approved this credit card. Like the investigator, Im not persuaded 
NewDay carried out proportionate checks to ensure Ms K could afford to sustain 
repayments. And, had it done so, I think NewDay wouldve seen Ms K wasnt able to 
maintain repayments in the long term. I note Ms K gave NewDay a slightly higher income 
figure, but I think NewDay shouldve spotted the substantial increase in Ms Ks unsecured 
borrowing. And I also note Ms K exceeded her new card 1 credit limit shortly before she 
applied for card 2. 
NewDay has already refunded interest and charges to card 2. As Im satisfied NewDay lent 
irresponsibly, I agree with the investigator that it should remove all adverse credit it has 
reported in relation to this account from Ms Ks credit file. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay to settle as follows: 
- Refund all interest and charges applied to card 1 above balances of £500 from the 
date the credit limit was approved
- Remove all information reported about balances over £500 on Ms Ks credit file for 
card 1
- Remove all adverse information reported to the credit reference agencies from the 
date of card 1s credit limit increase onwards
- Remove all information reported to the credit reference agencies in relation to card 2- If NewDay cant amend the information reported in line with the above, it should stop 
reporting the credit cards on Ms Ks credit file altogether
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 June 2021.
