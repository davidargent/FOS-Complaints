K821x#15complaint
Mr A complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Specialist Motor Finance Limited  wasnt  of satisfactory quality.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr A under a hire purchase agreement  with Specialist 
Motor Finance that he signed in April 2018;
Specialist Motor Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that 
it was of satisfactory quality at that time - whether  or not it was of satisfactory quality 
will depend on a number  of factors,  including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr A was more than seven years old, had been driven 
for 74,335 miles and had a price of £10,989;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within  
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly  how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
there was an issue with some of the cars lights when  the car was supplied to Mr A  
the dealer paid for that to be fixed in July 2018 but Mr A says that the cars  bumper  
wasnt fitting properly  when the car was returned  to him;
the car was taken  to a manufacturers dealer for the bumper to be re-fitted but that 
dealer said that the car had been  damaged in an accident and it provided a video 
showing issues with the car;
Mr A complained to Specialist Motor  Finance  and it arranged  for the car to be 
inspected by an independent expert in January 2020   the inspection  report  recorded  
the cars  mileage as 86,749 and said that:  theres evidence  of damage behind  the 
replace headlamp, and the bumper  is out of line. The repair damage undoubtedly is 
below expected  industry standards ; but it said that the car had passed  two MOT 
tests since it was supplied  to Mr A and that it believed that the car was fit for purpose 
and of satisfactory quality;
Mr A complained to this service and our investigator thought that the evidence of 
previous accident  damage and below standard repairs caused  the car not to have 
been of satisfactory  quality at the point  of sale so Mr A had a right to reject  it  she 
recommended that Specialist Motor Finance should: unwind the credit agreement, 
ensuring no balance  was outstanding, and amend  the credit  file to reflect that; refund 
the deposit, with interest; and pay Mr A £100  compensation in recognition  of the 
frustration and inconvenience that he was caused;
Ref: DRN44225432Mr A has accepted those recommendations  and has confirmed  his acceptance of 
the agreement  being ended, the car being collected, his deposit being refunded, with 
interest, his credit  file being amended and a payment of £100  compensation - but 
Specialist Motor Finance has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman  it says that, on the balance of probability, the damage has been 
caused whilst the car was in Mr As possession, and it has provided additional 
comments from the dealer;
I consider it to be clear from the evidence that there was an issue with the cars  
headlight when  the car was supplied to Mr A and he complained to the dealer about it 
 the dealer paid for the headlight to be repaired by a manufacturers  dealer but that 
dealer identified further damage  to the car which  caused  issues with the bumper;
the link to the video made by the manufacturers dealer is no longer available  but our 
investigator was able to watch it and described  what it showed when she made  her 
recommendations on this complaint;
Ive reviewed the independent  experts  report but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence  to show that the car was of satisfactory quality when it was 
supplied to Mr A;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the damage to the headlight and bumper  
was caused before  the car was supplied to Mr A so it was present when the car was 
supplied to him and, for that reason, I consider it to be more likely than not that the 
car wasnt of satisfactory quality  when it was supplied to Mr A;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that the damage  was 
caused after the car was supplied to Mr A;
the dealer  has paid for the headlight to be repaired but the other damage hasnt been 
repaired and Mr A had described further  issues that he had with the car in December 
2018 which led to him paying £470  to have  a new starter motor fitted; and
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Mr A to be able 
to reject the car.
I find that Specialist  Motor  Finance  should end the hire purchase agreement  and arrange for 
the car to be collected from Mr A  both at no cost to him. I find that it should also remove 
any information about the agreement that its recorded on Mr As credit file.
The invoice for the car and the agreement show that Mr A paid a cash deposit  of £326 for 
the car. I find that it would  be fair and reasonable for Specialist Motor Finance to refund that 
deposit to him, with interest. Mr A has been  able to use the car so I dont consider that it 
would be fair or reasonable for me to require Specialist  Motor  Finance to refund to M A any 
of the monthly  payments that hes made  under the agreement  I consider that it can keep 
them as payment for the use that hes had from the car. 
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show that the starter  motor was faulty  
when the car was supplied to Mr A  so I find that it wouldnt  be fair or reasonable for me to 
require Specialist Motor  Finance to reimburse  him for the cost of the replacement  starter  
motor.
These events have clearly  caused distress and inconvenience for Mr A. I find that it would 
also be fair and reasonable for Specialist Motor  Finance to pay him £100 to compensate him 
for that distress and inconvenience.
Ref: DRN44225433my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold Mr As complaint and I order  Specialist Motor  Finance Limited to:
1.End the hire purchase agreement and arrange  for the car to be collected from 
Mr A  both at no cost to him.
2.Refund to Mr A the deposit that he paid for the car.
3.Pay interest on that amount at an annual rate of 8% simple from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement.
4.Remove any information about the agreement that its recorded on Mr As credit  
file.
5.Pay £100 to Mr A to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience  that hes 
been caused.
HM Revenue & Customs  requires Specialist Motor Finance to deduct tax from the interest 
payment referred  to at 3 above. Specialist Motor Finance must give Mr A a certificate  
showing how much  tax its deducted if he asks it for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 February  2021.
