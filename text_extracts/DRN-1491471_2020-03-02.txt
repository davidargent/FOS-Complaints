The complaint
Mrs B complains that AXA France IARD mis-sold her a payment protection insurance (PPI) 
policy. 
What happened
Mrs B took out the PPI in connection with a store card in 1992.
Our adjudicator didn't uphold the complaint. Mrs B disagreed with the adjudicator's 
conclusions, so the complaint has been passed to me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Bs case.
AXA has provided evidence to show that Mrs B didn't pay any premiums for the PPI. Its 
notes suggest the policy was cancelled shortly after Mrs B took it out. 
So even if I concluded that the PPI was mis-sold to Mrs B, AXA wouldn't be required to pay 
her any redress. That's because we would usually ask the business to refund any premiums 
paid by the customer, together with interest. But Mrs B didn't pay any premiums, so there is 
nothing to refund.
Mrs B says she didn't claim on the policy when she was made redundant, so she considers 
she's suffered financial loss. 
As I've already said, it seems Mrs B's policy may have been cancelled shortly after she took 
it out. So I can't safely say that Mrs B would've been able to make a successful claim on the 
policy when she was made redundant. 
But if Mrs B has any evidence to show that the policy remained in force at the relevant time, 
she may be able to explore with AXA whether or not it's possible to make a retrospective 
claim on the policy in connection with her redundancy. 
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 March 2020.
