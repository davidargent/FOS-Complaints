K821x#15complaint
Mr P complains about the short  term loans he took out with CashEuroNet  UK LLC (CEN)  
trading as QuickQuid  and Pounds  to Pocket. Mr P says that CEN lent to him irresponsibly. 
He says it shouldve  made better checks and found out that he was in financial difficulty. Mr 
P thinks it shouldnt have lent to him. 
background
Mr P took out 11 loans  between June 2015 and September 2018. Loans 1 to 8a and loan 11 
were QuickQuid payday loans, which were  due to be repaid over one, two or three months.  
Loans 9 and 10 were Pounds to Pocket instalment loans repayable  over six months.  Some 
of the information CEN has given us is shown  in the table below:

CEN has looked at Mr Ps complaint and said that it should be partially upheld. It said that it 
did appropriate checks for loans 1 to 8, and loans 10 and 11. And these  checks showed that 
the lending was affordable. It thought that Mr P had borrowed a high a proportion of his 
income for loan 9. It has offered  to refund the interest and charges  Mr P has paid on this 
loan, plus interest.   
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ps complaint  and recommended that CEN refund the 
interest and charges that he paid on loans  3 to 11c. CEN didnt agree with this 
recommendation, so the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Ref: DRN51850672Having done so, Ive decided to partially  uphold Mr Ps complaint. Having reviewed  the 
evidence I have available I think CEN  was wrong  to have given Mr P loans 3 to 11. Ill 
explain why.
QuickQuid approved payday loans  1 to 8, 11 and 12. Pounds  to Pocket  approved instalment 
loans 9 and 10. QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket are part of the same company  and I 
understand they share information.  So Pounds to Pocket shouldve been aware that Mr P 
had already taken  a large number of loans from QuickQuid when it approved  loans 9 and 10. 
And QuickQuid shouldve been  aware when it approved  loans 11 and 12, that there hadnt 
been a significant break  in lending since loan 8 was repaid, because of the loans Pounds to 
Pocket had approved.
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Mr P and CEN said.  She thought Mr Ps complaint 
should be partially upheld. She thought that it had made proportionate checks for loan 1, and 
that therefore its decision to lend was reasonable for this loan. 
She didnt  think that CEN had made proportionate checks  for loans 2 to 11c. She thought  if it 
had then it wouldnt have  agreed to lend Mr P money for loans 3 to 11c. This is because  she 
didnt think that Mr P could afford the repayments  for loans 3 to 6. And CEN  wouldve seen 
this had it completed better checks. She also thought that from loan 7 onwards the pattern of 
lending itself showed the lending was harmful to Mr P.  
CEN didnt  comment on our adjudicators findings  about the proportionality of its checks  or 
the affordability of the loans. It did say that it didnt agree that the pattern of lending  could be 
unsuitable without  greater evidence of repayment  problems.  It said Mr P didnt usually 
struggle to meet the loan repayments, other than once or twice.
It didnt provide any new information  for me to consider but it did say:
 In your assessment  you dont  think CashEuroNet should have provided Mr P with 
QuickQuid loans 3-9 and Pounds to Pocket  loans 1-2. In CashEuroNet UKs initial  response  
to FOS we provided detailed information  indicating why these loans were  responsibly lent to 
Mr P and attached  was the entire lending process  including all the checks that we perform  
prior to lending, the screenshots of customer applications as well as the sample 
acknowledgement from the contract that customers have to check  when their repayment 
amount is greater than their estimated disposable income. 
CEN first mentioned this argument in its business submissions to us in which  it said:
 We started implementing changes to affordability assessment in June  2014  and all the 
changes were completed by Feb 28th 2015. Starting 1st March  2015 before Mr P borrowed 
his first loan,  CashEuroNet UK had implemented an affordability review that is consistent 
with the FCA Handbook  and that was in place  at the time we received authorisation by the 
FCA. We confirm  that this assessment was conducted properly and individually each of 
these loans. 
It provided further detail  about the checks it had made when it approved  loans from 2015  
onwards in a document called CEU Lending Criteria and Proportional Checks.  And this 
response didnt  change our adjudicators opinion.
Ref: DRN51850673This service has responded to CEN on the generic argument made directly and through  
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to expand on this point any further here, though  I 
have considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. 
I would remind CEN  at this point  of the Financial  Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance in how 
complaints are to be dealt  with promptly and fairly  (my emphasis) by businesses.  In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman  are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent 
who handled  the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  
complaints received by the respondent and using this in training and development of 
the individuals dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA, other relevant regulators and the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  and communicating it to the individuals dealing  with 
complaints in the respondent. 
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Ps complaint  and what  both parties  have said 
about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr P borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in mind  
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect CEN  to be conversant with these  through previous ombudsman  decisions, 
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher  the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
Turning to the specifics of Mr Ps complaint.  Mr P has accepted our adjudicators opinion 
about loans 1 and 2. Because of this I dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about 
these loans. So I wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But they were part of the 
borrowing relationship  Mr P had with CEN.  So they are something I will take into account 
when considering the other loans he took.
CEN says: 
it recorded Mr Ps monthly income  as £1,172 before approving  loans 1 and 2; £6,317  
before loan 3; £9,317 before loans 4 to 7; £2,631 before loans 8 and 11 and £2,150 
before loans 9 and 10
it recorded his monthly expenditure as £425 up to loan 7, £914 before loan 8, £525 
before loans 9 and 10 and £964 before loan 11 
Ref: DRN51850674it validated the information it obtained using credit reference  agency data
it used the information  it had gained  from the credit reports to adjust the amounts Mr 
P had provided, to calculate what it called his estimated disposable income
why I dont  think CENs  checks were  proportionate for loans 3 to 11c
Ive carefully thought  about what CEN and Mr P have provided and what  both sides  have 
said. 
For loan 3 Mr P needed to make two repayments. The first was around £75 after a month, 
and the second was just under  £700 around six weeks after the start of the loan. And whilst 
a couple of the loans  were for smaller  amounts, in the main  they increased significantly 
going forward. For loan 6 he borrowed £700 and for loans 7 and 7a he borrowed £1,200 in 
total. The highest maximum repayment for loan 8 was not far short  of £2,000. And overall  Mr 
P and CEN had a lending relationship for over 3 years at this point (with  a break of eight 
months between loans 2 and 3, and seven months between  loans 9 and 10).
CENs records show that Mr P was employed  in the same way over all of this lending.  But its 
records show that Mr Ps income  increased  significantly  at loan 3 and again for loan 4, 
where CEN  recorded  his net monthly income  as being over £9,000.  It had recorded his 
monthly income as just under  £1,200  a relatively short time earlier. CEN seems  to have 
relied on this higher  income without further checks. But an increase of this magnitude,  over 
this time period,  seems very unlikely. 
So it shouldve verified the income amounts Mr P provided  assuming he did provide these 
amounts and this wasnt simply an error on CENs part. And had it done so, I think  CEN 
wouldve realised at that time that Mr P may have some longer term financial problems, 
rather than just using  the loans to help with a temporary cash  flow problem. CEN shouldve 
also become concerned  about whether it knew enough about Mr Ps true financial  situation.
So, given the length of the borrowing relationship, the size of the loans and the income figure  
declared, I think that it wouldve been proportionate to fully review Mr Ps finances. And CEN 
shouldve verified  this information as far as possible; to make  sure Mr P was in position to 
make the repayments  sustainably.
Although I havent  seen  the full details  of all CENs credit  checks,  it has provided me with its 
estimate of Mr Ps disposable income  (EDI).  I dont know  exactly  how CEN calculated Mr Ps 
EDI  but it has said that credit checks are one relevant factor. Because I dont know how 
CEN actually  worked out this figure, I cant say this reflects  a proportionate check. 
And CEN doesnt  seem to have  fully reviewed Mr Ps finances in any other way. So I need to 
think about what its likely proportionate  checks wouldve shown CEN had they been carried  
out. 
Ref: DRN51850675what I think proportionate checks would most  likely have  shown CEN  for loans  3 to 6
Mr P has provided some  information about  his financial circumstances, including  his recent  
credit file and his bank  statements. I accept that this isnt exactly what CEN wouldve  seen  at 
the time.  But I think it wouldve found  out similar information if it had made proportionate 
checks, so I think its reasonable to rely on it.
These show that when  CEN approved loan 3, Mr P was a student  and he received monthly 
bursary payment of £1,000. He also had other outstanding short term lending of just over 
£200. This gives him a disposable  income of around  £800. The highest  repayment for loan 3 
was just under £700. And his other  expenses seem  to be around  £800. which  seem  to be 
around £1,200  a month, I dont think he had enough  to sustainably repay this loan. 
Mr Ps income continued to consist of student loans  and a bursary over loans 4 to 6. He 
looks to have around £1,500 a month coming  in. But his expenses were around  the same  as 
before. So again he wouldnt have enough left over to make  the repayments  into these 
loans. Given the highest repayments  of between around £500 to over £800. 
And looking at his bank statements I can see signs of financial difficulty. He was now usually 
very overdrawn. And the amounts he was borrowing and repaying from other short  term 
lenders had increased. And as I said above the CEN loans were for significant  amounts. 
I think that CEN wouldve found  out this information if it had made proportionate checks. And 
I think it wouldve seen Mr P wouldnt  have  been  able repay the loans in a sustainable way. 
Its reasonable to say that Mr Ps situation  was materially different to that which  CEN 
recorded and relied on. So I think CEN  shouldnt have given loans 3 to 6 to Mr P and I think 
he lost out as a result  of this. So Im upholding  Mr Ps complaint about loans 3 to 6.
taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided,  did the overall 
pattern of lending increase  Mr Ps indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which CEN should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so CEN  should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any 
further lending.  Given the particular circumstances  of Mr Ps case, I think  that this point was 
reached by loan 7. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr P was borrowing were generally  increasing, and CEN ought to have  
realised it was likely his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. As I said earlier  
Mr P borrowed £1,000 for loan 7 and he continued to borrow high amounts
Mr P wasnt really  reducing the amount he owed CEN. He was in effect paying large 
amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended period
Mr P was demonstrating repayment difficulties, and he had problems repaying  loans  
7 and 8. And I think its relevant that he borrowed over a much longer period for loan 
9 which  I assume  was to reduce  the repayments. 
I think that Mr P lost out because CEN continued  to approve loans from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
Ref: DRN51850676the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ps 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im upholding  Mr Ps complaint about  loans 7 to 11c because the overall  pattern  of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful, 
and hes lost out as a result.
what CEN  should do to put things  right
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on loans 3 to 11c;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 to 6 from Mr Ps credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 means  any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 7 to 11c should be removed from Mr Ps credit  file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN to take off tax from this interest. CEN must give Mr 
P a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ps complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 May 2019
