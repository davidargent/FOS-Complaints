The complaint
Mr P believes is unhappy with several aspects of the service he received from PayPal 
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA.
What happened
Mr P referred a complaint about PayPal to this service on which a final decision was issued 
by an ombudsman in February 2023. Accordingly, as that was a final decision, I wont be 
commenting on any of the issues included within that earlier decision. 
However, in November 2022  which was after Mr P had referred his earlier complaint to this 
service, but before the final decision was issued in February 2023  Mr P asked for some 
further points of complaint against PayPal to be considered. PayPal didnt give their authority 
for those further points of complaint to be considered within the complaint that Mr P had 
already referred to us, and this meant that these further points of complaint had to be raised 
as a new complaint  which is the complaint under consideration here.
In his November 2022 correspondence, Mr P reiterated points of complaint that were already 
being investigated within the earlier complaint. But Mr P also said that PayPal hadnt sent 
him a copy of the credit agreement when hed open his credit account with them, and that 
PayPal hadnt sent him information pertaining to a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) in 
a font size that he could read.
PayPal responded to the new complaint and explained that they had resent the DSAR 
information to Mr P in a larger font in November 2022, the day after being notified of Mr Ps 
dissatisfaction. And PayPal also noted that the credit agreement had been made available to 
Mr P at the time the account was opened. 
One of our investigators looked at this new complaint, but didnt feel that PayPal had acted 
unfairly. Mr P wasnt satisfied with the view of this complaint put forwards by our investigator, 
so matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Id like to begin by confirming that this service isnt a regulatory body or a 
Court of Law and doesnt operate as such. Instead, this service is an informal, impartial 
dispute resolution service. And while we do take relevant law and regulation into account 
when arriving at our decisions, our remit is focussed on determining whether we feel a fair or 
unfair outcome has occurred  from an impartial perspective, after taking all the factors and 
circumstances of a complaint into consideration.
Additionally, as previously noted, I wont be commenting on any aspects of Mr Ps complaint 
that have already been considered within the previously issued final decision dated February 
2023. This means that Ill only be assessing whether I feel PayPal have acted unfairly 
regarding the further points of complaint that Mr P raised in November 2022.
The first of these points centres on PayPal sending information to Mr P in response to a 
DSAR that wasnt in a font size that Mr P could read. It doesnt seem fair to me that PayPal 
didnt issue this information in a suitable font size for Mr P. But I note that PayPal did reissue 
this information in a larger font size to Mr P in November 2022, the day after being made 
aware of his dissatisfaction. And I also note that PayPal reissued this information to Mr P in 
a digital format that enabled Mr P to resize the information to his convenience.
Accordingly, while PayPal did make an error here, Im satisfied that theyve already taken the 
corrective action needed to rectify that error, and that theres no further corrective 
instructions for me to issue to them. And given that PayPal acted as quickly as they did to 
correct their error, I dont feel that Mr P incurred a degree of trouble or upset here that would 
fairly merit an award of compensation in this specific instance. 
Mr P also believes that PayPal didnt provide a copy of the credit agreement to him when he 
opened the account. But Mr P would have needed to confirm his acceptance of the credit 
agreement when opening the account. And PayPal have confirmed to my satisfaction that a 
copy of the credit agreement was available for Mr P from the time that the account was 
opened. 
Additionally, Mr P raised his complaint about this point in November 2022. But the account 
had been closed the previous month, in October 2022, with the account charges that Mr P 
had previously complained about having been written off by PayPal. And so, Im satisfied 
that even if Mr P hadnt previously seen a copy of the credit agreement, there was no 
reasonable requirement for him to do so in November 2022, because his credit agreement 
with PayPal had already ended with no money being owed.
It therefore follows from the above that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing 
PayPal to take any further action. I realise this wont be the outcome Mr P was wanting, but I 
trust hell understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 October 2023.
