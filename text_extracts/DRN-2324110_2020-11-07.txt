The complaint
Miss R complains that lending made to her by NewDay Ltd was irresponsible.
What happened
Miss R had three credit cards with NewDay. She wanted us to look at all the lending that
NewDay had made to her.
Miss R applied for the first card in September 2017, a card carrying NewDays aqua brand.
That initially had a credit limit of £300, raised to £900 in March 2018. Ill call that Card 1.
Almost immediately after that, she applied for a card from NewDay branded with the name of
a clothing store that I wont mention here. That had a credit limit of £900. Ill call that Card 2.
Then in April 2019, Miss R applied for a third credit card, branded with the name of a
department store that I wont mention either. That also had a credit limit of £900. Ill call that
Card 3.
Miss R didnt think any of this lending was suitable for her.
NewDay said that it thought all the lending it had made was responsible. It acknowledged
that there had been some late payments during the lifetime of Card 1 and Card 2. It said
these happened after the limit increase it made on Card 1. And it didnt think these late
payments shouldve prevented the issue of Card 3.
NewDay said that all late payments had been brought up to date at the time Card 3 was
issued, and previous late payments wouldnt prevent Miss R from borrowing with it, or any
other lender.
NewDay said that Card 1 had been closed, at her request, and was being paid off. Card 2
was open, but Miss R hadnt used it since September 2018. This account was being paid off.
Card 3 was also open, but Miss R hadnt used it since September 2019. The last payment
on this card, which was due on 4 June 2020, hadnt been made, so at the time NewDay
wrote to us, the account for Card 3 was one month in arrears.
Our investigator didnt think that the initial lending made in September 2017, through Card 1
and Card 2 that NewDay gave Miss R then, was unsuitable for Miss R. And she didnt think
that NewDay shouldve realised in March 2018 that it would be irresponsible to offer Miss R
a higher credit limit on Card 1.
But our investigator did think that there were signs that Miss R was in financial difficulty
before Card 3 was given to her. She thought NewDay shouldve realised that this lending
was unsuitable for her. So she thought NewDay had to refund interest and fees applied to
this card.
Our investigator thought that NewDay hadnt suggested sources of support to Miss R when it
shouldve realised that she might be experiencing financial difficulties. Because of that, she
thought NewDay should make more limited refunds on Card 1 and Card 2 as well.
NewDay sent our service further evidence, which included some letters sent to Miss R that
did signpost her to sources of help if she was having financial difficulties. So our investigator
changed her mind about whether NewDay had to pay any refund on Card 1 and Card 2.
But she didnt change her mind about the lending made on Card 3, or the proposed
settlement on that card. She said Miss R had taken a number of payday loans in the six
months before she took out Card 3, and NewDay told us two of those were still active when
Card 3 was opened. Our investigator still thought NewDay should refund all interest and
charges on the Card 3 from opening to present, because our investigator didnt think Miss R
should have been given this account.
NewDay replied setting out its understanding of how Miss Rs two existing accounts had
been run in the months before Miss Rs Card 3 application. NewDay and our investigator
didnt agree, so the case was passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Ive looked at the information NewDay considered when it granted Miss Rs credit 
card applications for Card 1 and Card 2, and the subsequent limit increase on Card 
1. Like our investigator, I dont think that NewDay shouldve realised at the time that 
the lending on Card 1 and Card 2 was unaffordable for Miss R. And I can see that 
NewDay did signpost Miss R to sources of help on occasion when she seemed to be 
having difficulties clearing her debts. I dont think that NewDay has to make refunds 
on either Card 1 or Card 2.
I think the situation is different with Card 3. Ive considered carefully what NewDay 
said about how Miss R had managed Card 1 and Card 2 before Card 3 was opened. 
But, like our investigator, I think there were clear signs that Miss R wasnt managing 
her finances well at the time she made that third application.
NewDay has sought to minimise the significance of the late payments made by Miss 
R on her two pre-existing cards, before it approved her Card 3 application. Our 
investigator pointed out to NewDay that consecutively failing to meet repayments 
when due may indicate that a customer is in financial difficulties. I think thats right. I 
note that Miss R failed to meet repayments when due on Card 1, in January, 
February, March and April 2019. And she also failed to meet repayments when due 
on Card 2 in January and February 2019.
I appreciate that these payments werent missed entirely, and sometimes they were 
made very soon after they were due. But they were not made on time. That remains 
a cause for concern. And its not the only cause for concern at the time of Miss Rs 
Card 3 application. Failed direct debit payments on both Card 1 and Card 2 in the 
early part of the year are an additional cause for concern. That suggests that this is 
not a simple oversight, as NewDay had suggested, but a sign that Miss R didnt have 
enough money to meet her debts when they fell due.
The overlimit fees charged on Card 2 in January and February 2019 are yet another 
cause for concern.Looking at the situation overall, I think there was sufficient information available to 
NewDay to suggest that Miss R was not in control of her finances when it considered 
her application for Card 3. I dont think this card shouldve been granted.
I know that at the time NewDay updated us on the status of these accounts, only one 
was in arrears. But Ive considered the conduct of the three cards since Miss Rs third 
application was granted, and I dont think that demonstrates that NewDay was right 
to assert that this lending was affordable for Miss R. Miss R started to miss her due 
payment date on Card 3 almost straight away, and she then paid late for six months 
in a row.
I know that Miss R is no longer using Card 3, and hasnt done so for some time. I 
think that NewDay should close this card, and cease to charge interest on this debt. It 
should refund onto the account for Card 3, all the fees and interest charged on this 
card to date.
If that refund exceeds the amount Miss R owes, then NewDay should pay that money 
to Miss R, plus 8% simple interest. If there is still a debt outstanding, NewDay should 
work with Miss R to reach an agreement with Miss R to repay it.
This decision wouldnt prevent NewDay from recording late payments in future on 
Card 3, or defaulting that debt, if an agreement cant be reached and maintained. If 
Miss R feels NewDay is behaving unreasonably with regard to reaching that 
agreement, she can complain about this in future.
I also think that NewDays decision to lend to Miss R has caused her additional 
difficulties while she continues to struggle to manage her money. So I think NewDay 
should pay Miss R £100 in compensation.
Miss R still owes NewDay this money, so I dont think that it would be reasonable to 
require NewDay to remove all evidence of this debt from her credit file. And having 
seen Miss Rs credit file, it appears that NewDay hasnt recorded late payments for 
Miss Rs Card 3 account, so I dont think it has to remove any late payment markers.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both sides replied. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss R replied to say she had nothing to add. 
NewDay replied to say it had already started to implement my decision. It had refunded 
£497.24 onto Miss Rs card. It had closed the card account so no further interest would be 
charged. Miss R had a remaining balance of £219.91 to pay off. 
NewDay said it had ensured that there was no negative reflection from this card on Miss Rs 
credit file with the agencies it reports to. And NewDay said it would pay Miss R 
compensation when it got her bank details.
Ill now make the award I originally proposed, adjusted slightly solely to reflect that we now 
know the refund onto Miss Rs card leaves a small amount owing.My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must close the account for Miss Rs Card 3 account, 
and cease to charge interest on the debt. It should also refund onto this account all the fees 
and interest charged on Card 3 from opening to date. NewDay should work with Miss R to 
reach an agreement with Miss R to repay the outstanding debt.
And NewDay Ltd should also pay Miss R £100 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 December 2020.
