The complaint
Mr W complains that Shop Direct Finance Company Limited (Shop Direct) mishandled his 
payment arrangement.
What happened
Mr W had a very account with Shop Direct. Mr W lost his job in November 2019 and couldnt 
find another one due to the pandemic. Shop Direct were advised he was taking advice from 
a debt advice charity in April 2020 and stopped charges and interest from then. On the 
statement dated 25 April 2020, the arrears were £141.48 and balance £1,303.84. The limit 
was £1,125. On 16 July 2020, Mr W called Shop Direct to explain his situation, and Shop 
Direct agreed to suspend interest and charges for six months.  The statement dated 2 
January 2021 showed a balance of £1,396.99, with arrears of £666.15.
Mr W complained  he said his balance increased by more than £600 in the six-month 
period, despite the payment plan that Shop Direct agreed to. He offered to repay a balance 
of £700 if Shop Direct would waive the interest.
Shop Direct said theyd acted reasonably. They said theyd applied a six month hold to Mr 
Ws account when he called on 16 July 2020  after he had taken advice from the debt 
advice charity. This meant they didnt apply interest or charges but Buy Now Pay Later 
(BNPL) orders were still to be charged. No interest or charges were charged during the 
hold. They said they didnt expect payments to be made during the hold  but this still 
meant that arrears were building up.  The arrears were £231.37 in June 2020 and were 
£666.15 in January 2021. They apologised that on the call on 16 July 2020, it wasnt made 
clear to Mr W that arrears would still apply.
Mr W brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Shop Direct acted reasonably. 
Interest and charges hadnt been applied, other than BNPL interest applied for a previous 
purchase. But the arrears continued to build up on the account throughout the six months 
hold period.
Mr W didnt agree. He said he owed around £300, not the £1,400 arrears. He said Shop 
Direct werent clear with him in their communications. He said he was led to believe his 
account would be on hold and there would be no charges or interest. He asked that an 
ombudsman look at his complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We asked Shop Direct several further questions, and I also looked closely at Mr Ws 
statements  as I wanted to be clear what happened here.
Looking at Mr Ws complaint  Mr W says his balance increased because of the application 
of interest and fees; and that the arrears built up  and he says Shop Direct didnt treat him 
fairly. Its important to say that there are two things to consider here  Interest and charges; 
and monthly payments. 
Mr W lost his job in November 2019 and made his last payment to his Shop Direct account 
at that time. And so  he was in financial difficulty. He contacted a debt advice charity in April 
2020  and they notified Shop Direct then about his situation. He then called Shop Direct on 
16 July 2020 to say he was out of work and his prospects of finding another job at the time of 
the pandemic were slim. Shop Direct agreed to a payment hold and so no interest or 
charges were applied for six months, through to January 2021. That was the right thing to do 
in Mr Ws circumstances. 
Ive considered what Mr W has said about interest and charges  he says theyve been 
applied, despite what Shop Direct agreed. I looked at Mr Ws statements. On the statement 
dated 24 April 2020, the balance was £1,303.84. I can see that no interest or charges were 
applied to the account between then and January 2021  when the balance was £1,396.99. 
So  thats what Shop Direct agreed to do.
The difference of £93.15 was interest on a purchase made by Mr W in August 2019  and 
that interest charge was reduced from when Shop Direct were advised about Mr Ws 
circumstances in - April 2020. I listened to the call on 16 July 2020  and the call handler 
clearly stated that interest and fees would be stopped (for six months), but also that BNPL 
interest will apply. So  looking at interest and charges, Shop Direct acted reasonably and 
did what they said theyd do.
I then considered the arrears on the account. Under the terms of the account, payments had 
to be made every 28 days at a level of 7% of the outstanding balance. By April 2020, he was 
already in arrears by £141.48. Mr W didnt make any payments from November 2019 
through until January 2021  by when the arrears were £666.15. I listened to the call on 16 
July 2020 to hear what was said. On it, the call handler called the arrangement was a 
payment hold  which implies no payments had to be made. And that was the case  as 
Shop Direct have said. No payments had to be made, but they would still count as arrears if 
they werent. And here, the call handler couldve been clearer. She said Mr Ws shopping 
would be suspended while he was in arrears. She said the arrears would show on his credit 
file.  Shop Direct didnt say anything wrong here - but ideally, she shouldve gone further and 
said that arrears would increase if Mr W didnt pay the required amount  but she didnt. So 
 I can see why Mr W was confused. So, Ive gone on to consider this further.
We asked Shop Direct for any letters or emails sent to Mr W about the arrangement, but 
they couldnt provide anything. But I looked at Mr Ws statements and they clearly show the 
arrears each month  on 18 July 2020, before Mr W called Shop Direct -  past due was 
£300.62;  on 15 August 2020, past due was £346.42; on 12 September 2020 past due 
£419.96. The regular statements continued through to 2 January 2021 when past due was 
£666.15, with a minimum payment due of £717.31. The balance then was £1,396.99. And 
each month stated, payment not received. I think its reasonable to expect Mr W to have 
seen the arrears on his statement and realised what they were  and if he didnt, then 
contact Shop Direct about it. But I couldnt see that he did. 
And so, I must reach a balanced decision here. Interest and charges were not charged - as 
Shop Direct agreed to. On the arrears, Shop Directs call handler didnt misinform Mr W  
but couldve gone further in describing the potential for the arrears to increase. And it 
wouldve been better if Shop Direct had written to Mr W about the payment hold. But  
because the arrears and non-payments were set out clearly on Mr Ws statements, I think 
that on balance, Shop Direct acted reasonably.I can see that Mr W feels strongly about his complaint and will therefore be disappointed by 
my decision, but Im not going to ask Shop Direct to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2022.
