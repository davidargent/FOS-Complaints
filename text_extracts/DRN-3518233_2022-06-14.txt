The complaint
Mr E complains that Shawbrook Bank Limited (Shawbrook) has rejected the claim he made 
under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the Act) in relation to a solar panel 
system he says was misrepresented to him by the supplier.
Mr E is represented by a claims management company (the CMC).
Background
In or around September 2016, Mr E and his wife were contacted by a representative of a 
company Ill call P to talk about purchasing a solar panel system (the system) to be 
installed at his home. After being visited by a representative of P, Mr and Mrs E decided to 
purchase the system and finance it through a 15 year fixed sum loan agreement with 
Shawbrook. Only Mr E signed the loan agreement. The system was subsequently installed.
In August 2020 the CMC made a claim to Shawbrook on Mr Es behalf under section 75 of 
the Act. The CMC said that, following a cold call, P had made a number of representations 
about the system that had turned out not to be true, and it was these misrepresentations that 
had induced Mr E to enter into the contract with P. The CMC said the following 
misrepresentations had been made:
the system would generate free electricity, which could be sold to the national grid;
the system would be self-funding within the term of the loan; and
the feed in tariff (FIT) and savings on his electricity bills would provide enough 
income to cover the monthly loan payments.
Shawbrook didnt agree the system had been misrepresented to Mr E or that there were any 
other reasons for the claim to be upheld. 
One of our adjudicators looked into what had happened. Having considered all the 
information and evidence provided, our adjudicator didnt think that P had misrepresented 
the system to Mr E and found no reason to uphold the complaint.
The CMC didnt agree with the adjudicators view for the following reasons:
the salesman had never shown Mr E the quotation document on which the 
adjudicator had relied;
a copy of the quotation had never been sent to him to read in his own time;
Mr E had therefore never had the opportunity to read it;
other customers have reported similar sales tactics, so Mr Es claims were credible;
where a person is unaware that a representation is false, the fact that they could 
have found out it was false by taking reasonable care is not a defence in law;
the system will actually take 55 years to pay for itself, not 15, strongly indicating that 
Mr E must have been misled by P.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the case has been passed to me for review.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I do not uphold it. I will explain why.
Relevant considerations
When considering whats fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account relevant law 
and regulations, relevant regulatory rules, guidance and standards and codes of practice, 
and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant 
time. In this case the relevant law includes sections 56 and 75 of the Act.
Section 75 provides protection for consumers for goods or services bought using credit. As 
Mr E paid for the system with a fixed sum loan agreement, Shawbrook agrees that section 
75 applies to this transaction. This means that Mr E could claim against Shawbrook (the 
creditor) for any misrepresentation or breach of contract by P in the same way he could have 
claimed against P (the supplier). So Ive taken section 75 into account when deciding what is 
fair in the circumstances of this case.
Section 56 is also relevant. This is because it says that any negotiations between Mr E and 
P, as the supplier, are deemed to have been conducted by P as an agent of Shawbrook.
Section 140A is about unequal relationships between the parties to a credit agreement. In 
this case, the CMC relies on the alleged misrepresentation of the system.
For the purpose of this decision Ive used the definition of a misrepresentation as an untrue 
statement of fact or law made by one party (or his agent) to a second party which induces 
that second party to enter the contract, thereby causing him loss.
What happened?
If there is a dispute about what happened, I must decide on the balance of probabilities  
that is, what I consider to have been most likely to have happened, given the evidence that 
is available and the wider surrounding circumstances.
Mr E says that during a sales meeting he was told that the system would be entirely self-
financing and come at no additional cost.
There are several documents that have been provided by both parties. These include the 
credit agreement and solar quote, titled Your Personal Solar Quotation. Ive considered 
these, along with Mr Es testimony and recollection of the sales meeting, to decide on 
balance what is most likely to have happened.
The quote is a detailed document that sets out key information about the system, the 
expected performance, financial benefits and technical information. P, via Shawbrook, has 
told this service that this formed a central part of the sales process and the representative of 
P would have discussed this in detail with Mr E, explaining any benefits of the system, prior 
to him agreeing to enter into the contract. Mr E appears to have signed it.
Having thought carefully about the available evidence, Im satisfied that on balance the 
quote did form a central part of the sales process and therefore accept that the salesperson 
went through it during the meeting. So, Ive taken this into account, along with Mr Es version 
of events, when considering if there have been any untrue statements of fact.The credit agreement sets out the amount being borrowed (i.e. the cash price of the system), 
the interest to be charged, the total amount payable, the term of the loan and the contractual 
monthly repayments.
FIT payments and savings
Mr E has said that he was told his monthly loan repayments would be covered, or self-
funded by the FIT payments and the savings on his energy bills. Ive considered the quote 
that was provided by P as well as Mr Es recollections of his meeting with Ps representative 
to decide what is most likely to have been said.
The system analysis page of the quote sets out the estimated income Mr E could expect to 
receive by way of FIT payments from the system. This is split out into the expected FIT 
payments in the first year and the expected average income over 20 years. The FIT scheme 
only provides payments for a 20-year period.
I think that the first of these tables is clear that Mr E could expect to receive a total FIT 
income in year one of £117.74, which results in an average monthly income of £9.81. Im 
satisfied that the same document set out that there would be a monthly loan repayment due 
of £85.04. As a result, Im not able to conclude that Mr E was told that the monthly loan 
repayments would be covered by the FIT payments alone.
The quote goes on to look at the electricity savings Mr E could expect from the system. The 
expected year one electricity savings is £205.06 and, when taking into account the optional 
extras chosen by Mr E, the combined income and savings in year one is shown as £624.05. 
This is shown in a table titled Putting it all together.
Theres a section headed Repayments with three tables showing repayments over 60 
months, 120 months and 180 months. Ive focused on the table for 180 months as this is the 
length of the loan that Mr E entered into with Shawbrook. This table shows the loan as 
repayable in 180 monthly payments of £85.04. (This is incorrect; the loan agreement gives 
the correct monthly figure of £86.44, but the difference  £1.40  is too small to have been 
misleading.) For each year of the 15 year loan it shows the expected grand total return from 
the system. It then averages that figure over 12 months, and subtracts the monthly loan 
repayment of £85.04, to give an average difference between the monthly return from the 
system and the monthly loan repayment in each year. This gives a negative figure for the 
first seven years of the loan, meaning that the system would take eight years to begin to 
make enough money to cover the loan payments. (This would actually have been nine 
years, not eight, if the correct repayment figure of £86.44 had been used.)
I think the quote clearly sets out the income Mr E could expect to receive from the system, 
by way of FIT payments and savings, as well as his expected contractual monthly loan 
repayments. Whilst I accept that the table doesnt simply compare the FIT income and 
savings to the monthly loan repayments, it does clearly set out that the overall income he 
could expect to receive by way of FIT income and any additional savings would not be 
immediately sufficient to cover the monthly loan repayments. (This supports my finding 
above that Mr E wasnt told that the FIT payments alone would cover the loan repayments.) 
Ive carefully thought about Mr Es version of events. However, as Ive found that the quote 
did form a central part of the sales process which the salesperson went through at the 
meeting, I dont think I can reasonably find that he was told that the monthly loan 
repayments would be covered by the FIT income and savings.
Self-funding
Ill now consider whether P told Mr E that the system would be self-funding from the outset. 
In doing so Ill again weigh all the available evidence to decide what is most likely to have 
happened.
Bearing in mind my finding on the central role the quote played in the sales meeting, Ive 
considered the table above which sets out the estimated average monthly income from the 
system, and the effect on that income of subtracting the monthly loan repayment. Im 
satisfied that the table is clear and easy to understand (notwithstanding the £1.40 
discrepancy in the monthly payments). That section of the quote appears to have been 
signed by Mr E, and I think it is more likely than not that it is his signature, so Im satisfied 
that P did enough to bring it to his attention. On balance Im also satisfied that the 
salesperson referred to the table at the meeting. After four years, Mr E may have just 
forgotten it.
As a result, I consider the salesperson did not make a representation that the system would 
be self-funding from the outset. Rather, I find that the salesperson went through the quote at 
the meeting which sets out that there would be a difference between the expected income 
and the monthly loan repayments.
Im of the view that this makes it clear that the system wouldnt be self-funding from the start. 
I think the quote is clear that there would be a difference between the expected income and 
monthly loan repayments.
That said, I do accept that Mr E was told by P that the system would be self-funding over a 
certain period of time.
The Key Facts page of the quote has a graph detailing the estimated performance over 25 
years. This shows that it would take 10 years for the overall benefits that Mr E could expect 
to receive to match the cash price of the system.I think the 10-year estimated payback time is clear and prominent, being in large print on 
page 2, and so I dont consider that it needed further explaining. This figure also appears in 
the Putting it all together section.
A later page of the quote has a table detailing the estimated performance of the system over 
25 years. This also shows that during year 10 the overall benefits that Mr E could expect to 
receive would reach the cash price of the system, £8,058.50.
 
(The same table shows that the total amount payable under the loan agreement, 
£15,659.20, would be reached early in year 15, although that amount is not shown in the 
quote but only in the loan agreement.)
As Ive set out above, Im satisfied that P told Mr E that the system would pay for its cash 
price in 10 years, and for the loan in about 15 years, as supported by the graph and the table 
above, which were included in the quote. If that were an untrue statement of fact, and Im 
satisfied that this was what induced him to enter into the contract, and he subsequently 
suffered a loss, then that could amount to a misrepresentation.
The CMC says it is untrue because it has calculated that it will actually take 55 years for the 
system to pay for itself. So Ive gone on to consider the performance of the system and 
whether this is in line with the contract between P and Mr E.
Performance
The MCS certificate and quote set out that the system is expected to produce 1,756 kWh a 
year. I have looked at Mr Es FIT statements and can see that his system, on average, has 
generated 2,758 kWh a year. This is massively more than estimated by P at the point of sale 
 157%  so Im satisfied that the system is performing much better than expected, in terms 
of energy generation, if not financially. This suggests that the estimated energy generation in 
the quote was in fact a significant under-estimate. So the reason Mr E has not seen the 
expected financial returns is certainly not because the system is defective, or because the 
quote over-stated how much energy the system would produce. It must be due to some 
other cause.
I have looked at the assumptions used by P, including the self-consumption rate, expected 
annual increase in utility prices (EPR) and expected annual RPI inflation increase. I am 
satisfied that Ps method for calculating these is fair and reasonable.
P used Office of National Statistics (ONS) data between 2006 and 2015 to calculate the 
utility price and RPI inflation. I have looked at the actual yearly increases between 2016 and 
2020, and the increases have been lower than predicted by P at the point of sale, and I think 
this explains why Mr E hasnt been receiving the financial returns he may have been 
expecting from the solar panels. Since actual energy prices have been lower than the 
modelling predicted, the savings achieved through the energy generated by the system have 
been correspondingly lower.
As I have explained, the assumptions used by P were based on the information available 
from the ONS at the time. And based on this, I dont consider it unreasonable for P to have 
used them as the basis for calculating the potential financial income Mr E could have 
expected to receive from the system. So, whilst I can appreciate that the returns may not 
have been as high as estimated at the point of sale, Im not persuaded that this was due to 
unreasonable assumptions being used by P at the time Mr E entered into the contract.
Summary
Having carefully considered the evidence provided by all parties in this complaint, Im
satisfied that there were no untrue statements of fact made by P that induced Mr E to enter 
into the contract for the system, and I have found no other reason to uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 July 2022.
