The complaint
 Mr W complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA refunded the buyer of an item he sold 
when it should not have done so.
What happened
Mr W sold an item to a buyer Ill call B for £450. The item was sold for collection and was
sold via an e-commerce website. B claimed the item arrived damaged. B referred the matter
to the e-commence website. The e-commerce website found in Mr Ws favour. B then told
PayPal that the item was not as described, and that he had returned it to Mr W.
Mr W disputed this and escalated this for PayPal to investigate. PayPal sent Mr W various
emails about the dispute, but he didnt respond. Mr W says this is because the emails went
to his spam folder and he didnt see them.
As it heard nothing back from Mr W PayPal found in Bs favour and refunded the purchase
price to B.
When Mr W hadnt heard anything, he contacted PayPal. He was told the case has been
closed in Bs favour because he failed to respond to PayPal. PayPal agreed to reopen the
case. The employee said to him: We can help you re-open this case if there is compelling
new evidence or new information to provide on this case. She also said PayPal would
conduct a review on how it was decided. Mr W then sent evidence to support his case.
PayPal, however, doesnt appear to have considered that evidence and has instead said that 
Mr W didnt respond in time.
The investigator recommended the complaint be upheld. She didnt think PayPal had done
anything wrong by closing the claim initially. But she didnt think it was fair for PayPal to
agree to re-open Mr Ws claim, but then to ignore the new evidence he provided. She
thought PayPal should review Mr Ws complaint again and consider the new evidence he
provided.
PayPal disagreed with the view. It said all customers both buyer and sellers have the right to
appeal however, as set out in its User Agreement, the only types of claims covered under
PayPal Seller Protection are, Item Not Received claim or Unauthorised claims.
Mr W agreed with the investigator. He also wanted it to be noted he escalated the issue and
PayPal ignored everything he put in the escalation.
My provisional decision
As I didnt agree with all the investigators view, I made a provisional decision. In it I said I 
agreed with the investigator that it was reasonable for PayPal to refund B given it didnt hear
back from Mr W initially despite sending chasing emails. I said this even though I 
appreciated that it was Mr W who escalated the issue. I didnt agree with Mr W that PayPal 
should have tried to contact him through a different method. I thought sending emails to the 
correct email address was enough.
Having looked at PayPals terms and conditions I couldnt see that once a buyer has been
refunded it was possible for the refund to be taken back. PayPal confirmed this. I said 
therefore in this context a review was never going to result in Mr W getting his money back. 
So, I thought that where PayPal went wrong was in telling Mr W it would conduct a review 
without making it clear what that entailed and that it wouldnt be looking at any evidence he 
provided about the item or that he would receive his money back.
I said it was very clear from what Mr W had said to PayPal and to this service how 
distressed and frustrated he was to have been told that PayPal would review the case only 
for the evidence he provided not to be considered. I thought PayPal let him down and given 
the level of Mr Ws frustration and disappointment it would be fair for PayPal to pay him £200 
for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Response to my provisional decision
Neither Mr W nor PayPal agreed with my provisional decision.
Mr W still wants the £450 back for the item stolen from him. He still doesnt understand why 
he had to reply to his own escalation to PayPal and thinks it is a very confusing and illogical 
process. He says emails from PayPal were placed into his spam folder, due to the high 
number of phishing emails received from that companys name. He does not understand 
why PayPal could not have contacted him in another way, as this is exactly what our 
investigator told him she would have done. He feels he has done everything he could to sell 
this item properly, fairly and competently, but it turns out that fraudsters and poorly run 
financial companies win the day.
PayPal said it followed its policies and the terms of its user agreement which Mr W agreed to 
when creating his account. It reminded me of its requirement that users must respond to 
PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested 
in its email correspondence or in its correspondence through its Resolution Centre. And that 
protection isnt given to a user who doesnt respond in the time requested. The appeal 
process is in place to revisit a claim and ensure it was worked correctly in line with its user 
agreement. It says as the claim was correctly decided the appeal outcome remained the 
same.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 I can understand Mr Ws disappointment with my provisional decision. I can see why he 
feels very let down by what has happened. I can also see why he feels the process PayPal 
uses is illogical and confusing. But I do think it was clear that Mr W needed to respond to 
PayPals emails. I understand why he didnt. But I dont think when he failed to respond 
PayPal was required to try to reach him another way. And I dont think it was wrong to refund 
the buyer when he hadnt responded to its emails.Where I think PayPal went wrong was in not making it clear to him when it said it would 
review his case what that would mean for him, that is that it wouldnt be looking at any 
evidence he provided about the item or that he would receive his money back. PayPal thinks 
that this is clear from its terms. But I dont think Mr W understood this at the time and I think 
it should have been clear to PayPal that he didnt understand from the correspondence he 
was having with it.
In this context I think it would be fair and reasonable for PayPal to compensate Mr W for the 
disappointment and inconvenience he suffered as a result of PayPal failing to take the 
opportunity to make things clear to him what reviewing his case meant for him.
Putting things right
 I feel the compensation I set out in my provisional decision remains fair.
My final decision
 I uphold this complaint and order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA pay Mr W £200 for the 
distress and inconvenience caused to him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 July 2021.
