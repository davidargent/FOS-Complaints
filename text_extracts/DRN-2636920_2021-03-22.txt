The complaint
Mr H complains that NewDay Ltd refused his credit limit increase application and hasnt 
explained why.
What happened
Mr H says he was given the option of increasing his credit limit via an online screen and 
applied but was told the credit limit would not be increased. He says he called NewDay and 
it couldnt provide him with the reasons for this. Mr H says he thinks NewDay holds incorrect 
data about him and says none of the reasons it gave for the rejected application apply to 
him. He would like compensation for the distress and upset he was caused and for NewDay 
to justify and explain the rejection reasons.
NewDay says it considers a number of factors when making lending decision and that Mr H 
didnt meet its lending criteria. It says it will not provide exact reasons which it says are 
commercially sensitive.
Mr H brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought it up to NewDay to decide to offer a credit limit increase and such lending decisions 
were likely to be commercially sensitive. The investigator didnt think NewDay was obliged to 
provide further information.
Mr H doesnt accept that view and says in summary that NewDay didnt provide an 
appropriate level of service when he called it and didnt provide him with further options 
during that call. He would like NewDay to improve its customer engagement and pay him a 
gesture of goodwill.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr H will be disappointed by my decision.
Im satisfied that its up to NewDay, when exercising its commercial judgement, to decide if it 
offers a customer a credit limit increase. Im also satisfied that NewDay, as any lender, is 
entitled to make such decisions and those decisions are not something I can fairly interfere 
in. I make clear to Mr H that any lender must carry out appropriate and proportionate checks 
before deciding to lend and a business is under no obligation to offer a credit facility or 
increase one.
I appreciate Mr H would like to know the reasons for the credit limit increase rejection. But 
Im satisfied that NewDay is under no obligation to provide such reasons and that any 
reasons or information about its lending criteria are likely to be commercially sensitive and 
not something its able to share with its customers or the wider public. I can see that NewDay 
has provided an example of the type of reasons that can lead to such a decision and no 
doubt Mr H can consider writing to NewDay about the information it holds about him.
So, Im satisfied that NewDay hasnt made a mistake or acted unfairly by refusing the credit 
limit increase and by not providing Mr H with the reasons for that decision. It follows that I 
cant fairly order NewDay to pay any compensation or a gesture of goodwill. In any event I 
dont think Mr H has suffered any financial loss here and I dont think a decision by NewDay 
to refuse a credit limit increase is likely to have caused any significant levels of distress that 
would justify compensation, even if I thought it made a mistake.
We are not NewDays regulator and so its not our role to order it to improve its engagement 
with its customers as Mr H would like. I have listened to the call between Mr H and NewDay 
and Im satisfied NewDay fairly explained that it couldnt provide any further information 
about the reasons why it rejected the application. Im satisfied that during the call Mr H said 
that the NewDay staff member had done a good job and appreciated his time and effort. 
Complaint handling is not something I can look into for the reasons the investigator has 
explained, and Im satisfied that NewDay has provided as much information as I would have 
expected about its decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 April 2021.
