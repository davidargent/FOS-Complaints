Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Ws complaint in part and thought  loans 5 to 14 shouldnt  have 
been given. Mr Lender disagreed so the complaint  has been  passed to me to make a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Miss W could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into 
account a number of different things, such as how much  was being lent, the repayment 
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages 
of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN54526692the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Miss W could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ws complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
Mr Lender needed  to do more when it approved loans 1 to 4. So I cant  conclude  Mr Lender  
was wrong to give loans  1 to 4 to Miss W.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of Mr Lenders  lending history with Miss W, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Mr Lender should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ws case, I think  that this point was reached  at 
loan 5. I say this because:
At this point Mr Lender  ought  to have realised  Miss W was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss W had taken out five loans in around seven months, typically  
borrowing within a couple of weeks of repaying  a previous loan. So Mr Lender ought  
to have realised it was more likely than not Miss W was having  to borrow  further  to 
cover the hole repaying the previous loan was leaving  in her finances and that Miss 
Ws indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Ref: DRN54526693From  loan 5 onwards  Miss W was provided with a new loan within weeks of settling a 
previous one.  
Miss W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Mr Lender. Loan  14 
was taken out 33 months after her first loan. And it was for larger amount. Miss W 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Mr Lender over an 
extended period.  
I think that Miss W lost out because  Mr Lender provided loans 5 to 14 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ws indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
giving  these loans  was likely to have had negative implications on Miss Ws ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
Ive carefully considered  Mr Lenders  response to the adjudicators  recommendations. It 
asked for more detail  and the reasons I have set out above should  help it to understand why, 
by the time of loan 5, the pattern  of lending itself ought to have alerted it that any further  
lending was most likely to be unsustainable  for Miss W. I note it has said that it carried out 
further assessments for loans 9 to 14, but this doesnt change my conclusion. As Ive 
explained, there was sufficient  evidence earlier in the relationship  to indicate that any further 
borrowing was likely  to be unsustainable. And Miss Ws ongoing use of high cost credit from 
Mr Lender over a 33-month period cant be described as being for the short-term time frame  
it is supposed to help people out for. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 14, and Mr Lender should  put things right. 
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss W paid on loans  5 to 14*;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 means  any information  recorded about loans 5 
to 15 is adverse, so the entries about loans 5 to 14 should be removed from Miss Ws 
credit file.
*I note Mr Lender highlighted  in its final response letter that Miss W cancelled loan 11 during  the first 
14 days. But it must be included in the redress  calculation as she still paid interest on it.  
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest.  Mr Lender must  give 
Miss W a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN54526694my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ws complaint. PDL Finance 
Limited (trading as Mr Lender) should pay Miss W compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 December 2019.
