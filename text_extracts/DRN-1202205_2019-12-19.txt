The complaint
Mr S complains about NewDay Ltd reducing the credit limit on his credit card and not 
explaining the reasons why.
What happened
Mr S has held a credit card with NewDay for several years. And in March this year 
NewDay wrote to him explaining his credit limit would be decreased by Â£500. Mr S 
complained to NewDay about this as he always repays his full balance, so he wanted to 
know the reasons why.
NewDay issued their final response and explained Mr S' credit limit was reduced following a 
review of his account. They said this was in line with the terms and conditions of his credit 
agreement, and listed a range of reasons Mr S' credit limit may have been reduced. 
NewDay also said Mr S could get his credit file from credit reference agencies to see copies 
of the information they'd reviewed and to ensure his credit score is in order. Mr S wasn't 
happy with NewDay's response, so he brought his complaint to our service.
Our investigator didn't uphold Mr S' complaint. He said NewDay had confirmed Mr S' credit 
limit had been reduced because he used a minimal amount of it. Our investigator didn't think 
this decision was unfair because it was in line with the terms and conditions of Mr S' credit 
card.
Mr S disagreed with our investigator. He said NewDay's final response letter had caused 
him distress because it made him believe there may have been adverse data on his credit 
file. He was also unhappy NewDay hadn't confirmed the reason for the credit limit decrease 
to him when they had given that information to us. Mr S also mentioned he had another 
credit card with a larger credit limit that hadn't been reduced despite him not utilising the full 
amount.
Our investigator wasn't persuaded NewDay had treated Mr S unfairly, so his complaint was 
passed to me to investigate.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It's clear Mr S is very disappointed in NewDay's decision to reduce his credit limit. And while 
I've noted his strength of feeling on the matter, I'm not persuaded to uphold his complaint. I 
know this isn't the outcome he wanted, but I'll explain my reasons below.
 
 
  
In reaching my decision, I've considered the terms and conditions of Mr S' credit card 
account. That's because they set out how the account should be managed by NewDay and 
Mr S. And in order for me to decide that NewDay has treated Mr S unfairly, I have to be 
persuaded that they acted outside the remit of this agreement.
The terms and conditions of Mr S' credit card account explain NewDay will review their 
customers accounts from time to time - and these review may result in credit limits being 
increased or decreased. The terms and conditions also list a number of reasons that could 
cause a credit limit to be decrease, and they include how the account is managed, 
information from credit reference agencies - to name a few.
Our service can't tell NewDay who they should or shouldn't lend to. We also can't tell them 
how much they should lend to their customers. All we can do is decide whether Mr S was 
treated the same as other customers with similar circumstances. NewDay told our service Mr 
S' credit limit was reduced because he didn't utilise the full amount. So they didn't think it 
would be a responsible lending decision for the credit limit to stay the same. Taking this into 
account, I'm persuaded Mr S has been treated fairly. That's because the terms and 
conditions of his account say NewDay can amend the credit limit following a review - and 
that can include how regularly the account is used and how it's managed. I appreciate Mr S 
pays his full balance each month. But ultimately it's for NewDay to ensure they lend to their 
customer's responsibly. And I don't consider NewDay acted unreasonably when they 
removed part of the credit limit Mr S didn't use.
Mr S is also unhappy NewDay didn't clearly explain why his credit limit had reduced. He said 
listing a variety of reasons and referring him to credit reference agencies caused him 
distress. I can see why it may have been distressing for Mr S to not understand why his 
credit limit was reduced. And I understand it may have caused him to believe there were 
adverse markers on his credit file. But I don't agree NewDay acted unfairly when they didn't 
give him a specific answer.
Lending decisions are based on commercially sensitive information. So it wouldn't be 
appropriate for businesses such as NewDay to share this with their customers. And it's for 
this reason we wouldn't have expected NewDay to give Mr S more information than what 
was provided in their final response letter. I appreciate it wasn't specific, but it did give Mr S 
an indication of the possible reasons - and in turn the opportunity to determine which reason 
best applied to his circumstances.
I know Mr S is disappointed NewDay provided us their reasoning before him. But like the 
consumers who use our service, businesses also have the right to send us information in 
confidence. And had our investigator not given Mr S the specific reasoning behind 
NewDay's decision, I may not have mentioned it in my final decision for the reasons stated 
above.
I've taken on board what Mr S has told us about his other credit card. But this is with a 
different provider. And it's down to individual credit card providers to  set their own criteria for 
lending. So the decision of Mr S' other credit card provider doesn't persuade me that 
NewDay have done anything wrong.
Having considered everything, I'm satisfied NewDay treated Mr S fairly. So I won't be asking 
NewDay to do anything to put things right.My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I'm not upholding Mr S' complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 January 2020.
