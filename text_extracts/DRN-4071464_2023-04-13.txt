Complaint
Mrs G has complained about personal loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) provided to her. 
She says the loans were unaffordable and therefore should not have been lent to her.
Background
118 118 Money initially provided Mrs G with a first loan for £3,500.00 in June 2017. The total 
amount to be repaid of £6,572.40, which included interest, fees and charges of £3,072.40, 
was due to be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of just under £275. Mrs G settled the loan in 
full in January 2018.
 
118 118 Money then provided Mrs G with a second loan for £2,500.00 in June 2018. The 
total amount to be repaid of £5,728.32, which included interest, fees and charges of 
£3,228.32, was due to be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of just under £240.
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mrs Gs complaint and she thought 118 118 Money ought 
to have realised that it shouldnt have provided Mrs G with either of these loans. So she 
thought that Mrs Gs complaint should be upheld. 
118 118 Money didnt respond to our adjudicators assessment. So the case was passed to 
an ombudsman for a final decision as per the next step of our dispute resolution process. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mrs Gs complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything Ive decided to uphold Mrs Gs complaint. Ill explain 
why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is 118 118 Money needed to carry out reasonable checks to be able to understand whether 
Mrs G could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
The information 118 118 Money has provided suggested that it carried out credit checks 
before both loans were provided. The results of which showed that a significant proportion of 
Mrs Gs monthly income would going towards credit repayments. And at the time of loan 2 
Mrs G owed more than she did at the time of loan 1 despite loan 1 having been taken to 
consolidate debts and improve her financial position.
All of this leaves me persuaded by what Mrs G has said about already being in a difficult 
financial position at the time of these loans. And while its possible Mrs Gs financial position 
wasnt as a result of financial difficulty, Id add that my experience of these types of cases 
suggest this is unlikely, in the absence of any reasonable or plausible arguments from 118 
118 Money, Ive been persuaded to accept Mrs Gs version of events here. 
As this is the case, I do think that Mrs Gs existing financial position meant that she was 
always unlikely to be able to afford the payments to these loans, without undue difficulty or 
borrowing further. 
And Im satisfied that, bearing in mind everything, reasonable and proportionate checks 
would more like than not have shown 118 118 Money that it shouldnt have provided these 
loans to Mrs G. As 118 118 Money provided Mrs G with these loans, notwithstanding this, 
Im satisfied it failed to act fairly and reasonably towards her. 
Mrs G ended up paying interest, fees and charges on loans she shouldnt have been 
provided with. So Im satisfied that Mrs G lost out because of what 118 118 Money did wrong 
and that it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Mrs G
Having thought about everything, 118 118 Money should put things right for Mrs G by:
refunding all interest, fees and charges Mrs G paid on her loans;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Mrs G to the date of settlement;
removing all adverse information it recorded on Mrs Gs credit file as a result of these 
loans. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mrs G a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for 
one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mrs Gs complaint. Madison CF UK Limited 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 May 2023.
