DRN-2719784
The complaint
Mr H is unhappy with how AXA Insurance UK Plc dealt with a claim he made under his 
motor insurance policy. 
 
What happened
The details of the case are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them in full again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
Mr H has made several complaints relating to this claim which are being dealt with under 
different references at this service.  This decision only relates to the poor service Mr H 
received from AXA in respect of the following:  incorrect information being provided about 
whether calls were recorded, questions he has raised about the claim havent been 
answered and AXA not logging a complaint about Mr Hs unhappiness with the liability 
decision made. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
AXA has admitted Mr H was given incorrect information on whether calls with its 
representatives were recorded. 
AXA has recognised its representative didnt address some of Mr Hs concerns about 
the claim. It has provided feedback to them, which I think is reasonable.
AXA has recognised the service it provided to Mr H on this occasion was poor, for 
the reasons above and because it didnt set up a complaint to address Mr Hs 
concerns, it offered Mr H Â£150 compensation. I think this is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances. 
For the reasons above, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Hs complaint against AXA Insurance UK Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2021.
