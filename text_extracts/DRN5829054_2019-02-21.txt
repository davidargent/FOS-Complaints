K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs B have  complained that after they paid money into their savings account, 
Santander UK Plc used it to discharge  their flexible mortgage.
background
In 2006 Mr and Mrs B took out an interest-only mortgage with Santander on the advice of a 
broker. They  borrowed £55,000 and chose  a Flexible Plus mortgage, over a 12-year period.
The Flexible Plus mortgage is a product  where any savings held are offset  against  the 
capital balance on the mortgage. For example, if there is a mortgage of £100,000 and 
savings of £40,000, mortgage  interest will only be charged on £60,000,  and no interest  is 
paid on the £40,000 in the savings pot.
The terms and conditions  of the account state that the savings must not exceed the initial 
mortgage balance.  If it does, then Santander is entitled to use the savings to discharge  the 
mortgage.
On 12 February 2018 a payment of £55,400  was received into the account and was applied 
as a redemption.  This left a shortfall of £336.10.  On  14 March 2018 the redemption  was 
reversed and the money was applied to the savings pot.
On 14 March 2018 the savings pot held £55,293.36, against  a mortgage balance  of 
£55,387.90. No direct debit was taken for 1 March 2018, because the redemption (later 
reversed) had been pending. Direct  debit  payments  resumed from 1 April 2018.
After the redemption was reversed, the capital balance was reinstated.  Interest calculated on 
the balance was £19.41  per month. But Santander  received payments for April-June 
inclusive totalling  £137.10. This resulted in a credit balance on the account of £23.15  on 
1 June 2018. 
Santanders system was set up so that, where the mortgage account was in credit against  
the savings, the amount required to clear  the initial mortgage balance was transferred and 
the credit  refunded. So on 15 June 2018  Mr and Mrs B received a refund of the £23.15, and 
their mortgage balance was reduced  to £0.00.
Santander wrote to Mr and Mrs B on 1 and 15 June 2018. In the letter of 1 June  2018  
Santander explained that it was refunding  the £23.15. Santander  said that the options  were 
either to close the mortgage account, or to keep it open to the end of the term, in case 
Mr and Mrs B decided  they wanted  to access the £55,499 before the term ended. On 15 
June 2018 Santander confirmed that the account  would be left open  to the end of the term.
Mr and Mrs B didnt  ask Santander  for a drawdown of any funds from the savings account. 
But they were unhappy  that Santander had used  the funds to close  the account. Santander 
said that the terms and conditions  of the account  allowed it to do this.
Mr and Mrs B brought their complaint to us where  it was considered by an adjudicator. She 
didnt think it should be upheld. Mr and Mrs B asked for an ombudsman  to review  the 
complaint.
Ref: DRN58290542my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not upholding it. 
These are my reasons.
The terms and conditions  of this account allow Santander to discharge the mortgage  where  
the savings pot exceeds  the mortgage  balance. By 1 June  2018  that position  had been 
reached. So Im satisfied  Santander didnt do anything wrong by initiating the transfer from 
the savings account to clear the mortgage  balance.
I see that when  it wrote  to Mr and Mrs B on 1 June 2015 Santander explained that the 
account would be held open until the end of its term, in case Mr and Mrs B wanted to initiate 
a drawdown. But Santander has also clarified  to us that, as this was an interest-only 
mortgage which had only six months left to run, it would have needed to see evidence of a 
repayment vehicle  to cover any withdrawal.  
Mr and Mrs B didnt  ask for a drawdown  prior to the end of the term. They  told us at the 
outset that theyd wanted to use the £55,400 transferred into the account  in February 2018 
for home improvements. It was always open to them to ask Santander for a drawdown, after 
1 June 2018, if theyd wanted  to use the money for home improvements. But if Mr and Mrs B 
had borrowed back the £55,400 theyd have  also needed to find another £55,000 to repay 
the interest-only mortgage on 1 December 2018,  and provide Santander with evidence  that 
they had this additional £55,000 available.
In all the circumstances of this case,  Im satisfied Santander acted in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of the mortgage  account and was entitled to use the savings pot to 
repay the mortgage balance.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision  before  21 March  2019.
