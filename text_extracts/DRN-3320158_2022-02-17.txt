The complaint
D complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA did not refund their money after a
customer refused to pay local custom charges on the items they ordered.
What happened
D received an order from a customer which was processed using PayPal for £254. Their
courier attempted to deliver the purchase to the customer who lived overseas, however, the
customer refused to pay the local taxes and declined to receive the order, despite Ds terms
and conditions stating the customer would be responsible for paying any local
taxes/charges. Ds customer asked PayPal to refund the full £254.
After PayPals investigations, they refunded the customer £254 and charged D a £12
administration fee. D says that PayPal should not have returned the money at all, but even if
they found in favour of the buyer, then PayPal should refund D at least the costs of the
shipping (£91.25) and they should not have charged D a £12 administration fee.
D complained to PayPal, however, PayPal did not uphold the complaint. PayPal said that D
had not met their definition of their proof of delivery requirements, as the information from
the courier did not show the parcel was delivered to the recipient and it was returned to D.
D brought their complaint to our service. Our investigator upheld Ds complaint. He said that
we knew the item was delivered as the customer refused to pay the local taxes, which wasnt
Ds fault. As the customer had broken the terms and conditions with D by not paying the
local taxes then a full refund should not have been given to the customer. Our investigator
said that PayPal should pay D £100 for inconvenience and refund the £12 administration
fee.
Both parties asked for an Ombudsman to review the complaint. PayPal said they had acted
correctly in line with their User Agreement and therefore no compensation should be paid to
D.
D said that they were still charged the courier fee and attached an invoice to prove the costs.
They said that their view is that PayPal should reimburse them £91.25 for courier costs, £12
for the administration fee refund and £100 for inconvenience. So D wanted PayPal to pay
them £203.25 in total.
As my findings differed in some respects from our investigators, I issued a provisional 
decision to give both parties the opportunity to consider things further. This is set out below:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered whether PayPal acted in line with their User Agreement during the dispute
and claims process. And Im satisfied they did act in line with it when they didnt allow D to
keep the proceeds of the sale. I say this as PayPal had not received information from the
courier with the status of delivered, which is one of the requirements to meet PayPals proof
of delivery in order for D to be eligible for seller protection.
So Im satisfied that PayPal were entitled, under the User Agreement of the account, to not
pay D, despite the information which they gave PayPal. But, I do need to think about whats
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of a complaint. In doing so, there will be times
that a strict application of any terms and conditions, will result in an unfair outcome for a
customer in the individual circumstances of a dispute.
In my view thats whats happened here. I say this as Ds terms and conditions show that the
buyer would be responsible to pay any local taxes/charges. As a result of Ds customer
refusing to pay the local taxes, then Ds customer broke the terms of the agreement. Its
clear from the information D had sent PayPal, that the items had been shipped. I checked
the registered address that PayPal had for Ds customer and the destination of the purchase
for Ds customer. Both addresses match, so Im satisfied that the items were to be delivered
to the correct same address, which would be part of the proof of delivery conditions of
PayPals User Agreement.
So Im persuaded that the only thing which stopped the courier showing a successfully
delivered status is because the customer refused the delivery. So I asked PayPal if they
could forward me any policy they had regarding customers refusing to accept items. PayPal
responded that for whatever reason if the item is not delivered to the recipient (whether it
was shipped to the wrong address, lost in transit, held by customs, or automatically returned
to sender) PayPal reserve the right to deny PayPal Seller Protection. But here it wasnt
automatically returned to the sender as the customer had refused to pay the local charges,
which they would have agreed to pay as part of their agreement with D. So Im persuaded
that this has resulted in an unfair outcome for D.
I say this as not only have they lost out on a sale which had been agreed with the customer,
but they would incur courier costs through no fault of their own. The customer of D would be
rewarded with a full refund, despite them breaking the agreement of the sale. Im persuaded
that PayPal should have realised that Ds customer did not meet the terms and conditions
they agreed to and that D had attempted to successfully delivered the purchase to their
customer, therefore this shouldnt have prompted PayPal to refund Ds customer the full
amount of the purchase.
So I need to consider what would be a fair outcome here. D have received their goods back.
So I dont think its proportionate to ask PayPal to refund them the full cost here. But there
was a courier cost involved for D of £91.25, which I do think PayPal should pay back to D. I
say this as D have had the item returned by the customer, through no fault of Ds actions
and therefore Im not persuaded D should incur these costs after PayPal have decided to
refund the full amount of the purchase to Ds customer. Thats not to say that PayPal should
always do this for every customer where PayPal had initially followed their User Agreement.
Its just that I think this would be fair given the circumstances here.
Ive then considered the £12 dispute fee. I know D feels this should be refunded as they feel
PayPal should have ruled in their favour. So I asked PayPal whether this fee would be
payable regardless of the outcome of the claim. PayPal responded and they said their User
Agreement says The Dispute fee applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with
PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank. It goes onto say
that The Dispute fee will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.
So here, the buyer (Ds customer) did pursue a claim directly with PayPal. As the wording
above shows, the dispute fee will be deducted from the PayPal account after the claim had
been decided, indicates that this fee would be payable regardless of whether PayPal found
in Ds favour, or Ds customers favour. It is for this reason that I cant ask PayPal to refundthe £12 dispute administration fee here, as this appears to have been fairly applied and
would be payable regardless of the outcome.
Ive then considered whether D should be awarded any compensation for inconvenience. I
agree with our investigator that £100 would be a fair level of compensation for PayPal to pay
D for inconvenience. I say this as it is clear from the information that D sent PayPal that D
had shipped the items and attempted to deliver these to the customer. The delivery address
matched the registered users address and D had followed their agreement in good faith by
trying to deliver the items to the customer, who had agreed to abide by their terms and
conditions.
Im persuaded that PayPal should have considered this at the time D provided the
information that Ds customer chose to break the agreement they made with D, by not
paying the local custom charges. And a fair outcome would have been to at least provide the
courier costs incurred by D at the time.
So, in summary, PayPal were entitled to find in the buyers favour after the conditions of the
seller protection had not been strictly met. But while they were entitled to strictly enforce the
terms and conditions of the account, in this particular instance, this led to an unfair outcome
based on Ds individual circumstances, as Ds customer broke their agreement but got a full
refund, despite D keeping to their side of the agreement.
So Im persuaded that what would be fair here, taking into account the individual
circumstances of this complaint, would be to refund D their courier costs of £91.25. I also
agree with our investigator that it would be fair for PayPal to pay D £100 for inconvenience
for the reasons Ive already given.
I invited both parties to let me have any further submissions before I reached a final 
decision. PayPal accepted the provisional decision. D said they had no further additional 
points to add to the provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party have provided me with any further information to consider, then my final 
decision and reasoning remains the same as in my provisional decision.
Putting things right
In my provisional decision I said I intend to ask PayPal to pay D £91.25 for the courier costs 
they incurred and £100 for inconvenience. Im still satisfied this is a fair outcome for the 
reasons given previously.
My final decision
I uphold the complaint. PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA should pay D £91.25 for the courier 
costs they incurred and £100 for inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 March 2022.
