The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that MotoNovo Finance Limited (MotoNovo) didnt reinstate his Direct 
Debit following a payment deferral. He complains this led to MotoNovo reporting adverse 
information to credit reference agencies.
What happened
Mr S acquired a car under a 49 month hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo in 
November 2018. The car cost £21,000. Under the agreement, Mr S was required to make 48 
payments of £309.78, followed by a final payment of £9,002.17 if he wanted to keep the car. 
Due to the impact of COVID-19, Mr S contacted MotoNovo and requested a payment 
deferral. It agreed a payment deferral for May, June and July 2020. In August 2020, Mr S 
made a manual payment of £929.34 which was the amount of arrears owed under the three 
month payment deferral. 
In November 2020, Mr S contacted MotoNovo as he said he received a notification from a 
credit reference agency letting him know he was in arrears with his MotoNovo account. Mr S 
says MotoNovo told him it would collect the monthly payments normally by Direct Debit after 
the payment deferral ended. However he says it didnt do this and neither did it notify Mr S 
that his account was arrears. Mr S complained to MotoNovo.
MotoNovo issued its response to Mr Ss complaint. It said the terms of the payment deferral 
meant that Mr S needed to contact MotoNovo at the end of it to restart his monthly 
repayments. And it said he didnt do this, meaning payments were missed from August, 
September and October 2020.
It confirmed it had received a payment of £929.34 from Mr S in August 2020 which was the 
total amount outstanding from the payment deferral. However, it didnt receive the monthly 
payments owed from the further missed payments until November 2020. And as a result of 
this, it said it correctly reported arrears markers to credit reference agencies.
Unhappy with this response, Mr S referred his complaint to our service. He said he wasnt 
aware that MotoNovo hadnt taken payments from him after the payment deferral had ended. 
He said he only became aware this hadnt restarted when a credit reference agency notified 
him he was in arrears with his MotoNovo account. He said he wanted MotoNovo to amend 
the information it had reported to credit reference agencies.
Our investigator looked into Mr Ss complaint and thought that MotoNovo hadnt clearly told 
Mr S that he would need to reactivate his Direct Debit after the payment deferral ended. He 
recommended that MotoNovo remove the late payment markers from Mr Ss credit file and 
pay him £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
MotoNovo disagreed and said that Mr S had cancelled the Direct Debit when the payment 
deferral started. And so it said it wouldnt have been able to reinstate it once the payment 
deferral ended. It agreed that the wording of the payment deferral email could have been 
clearer but said this was a standardised template it used. It said that Mr S was responsible 
for making sure he made repayments on time and so didnt think it was reasonable for it to 
amend his credit file.
As MotoNovo remains in disagreement, the case has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr S was supplied with a car under a hire purchase agreement. This is a regulated 
consumer credit agreement which means were able to look into complaints about it.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued temporary guidance on 24 April 2020, that 
came into effect on 27 April 2020, about customers who were faced with payment difficulties 
as a result of Covid-19. This allowed financial businesses such as MotoNovo to grant a 
three-month payment deferral to people like Mr S. The guidance said that a firm should 
grant the customer a payment deferral for 3 months unless the firm determines (acting 
reasonably) that it is obviously not in the customers interests to do so. The guidance also 
said that firms should not report a worsening arrears status on the customers credit file 
during the payment deferral period.
Mr S was granted a three month payment deferral between May 2020 and July 2020. It 
wrote to Mr S in May 2020 to set out the terms of the payment deferral and the next steps. 
Mr S has provided us a copy of this email. 
In this email MotoNovo said:
we are pleased to confirm that your request for a three month repayment deferral has been 
approved  Right now you dont need to do anything more. Just to make you aware, if you 
have a payment due in the next 8 days it will be taken as normal. The pause in payments will 
start after that. Its important to make it clear that this deferral (also known as a concession) 
is a temporary pause in your repayments and does not change or vary your Agreement in 
any way, so your next three monthly repayments have been put on hold, not cancelled  at 
the end of the deferral period, your normal repayment will start again.
Theres nothing in this email which explains Mr S would need to contact MotoNovo to restart 
the payments at the end of the payment deferral period. Instead the email says that the 
payment collection is on hold, not cancelled, and normal repayments would start again 
once the deferral period had ended.
Im not satisfied that this email clearly explains to Mr S that he would need to restart 
payments at the end of the payment deferral period. Instead, I think it suggests that 
payments will be collected as normal, without Mr S needing to take any further action, at the 
end of the payment deferral period. And Im satisfied from what he said that Mr S relied on 
this email to inform his actions.
MotoNovo said Mr S cancelled his DD  although it hasnt shown this was the case. But, 
even if this was correct, I still think the email above implies the payments would start again 
without Mr S taking further action. So, either way, this doesnt change my opinion.
MotoNovo has also said in its initial email to Mr S about the payment deferral, Well work 
with you to agree an appropriate arrangement to help you repay the deferred payments. 
However, in August 2020, Mr S repaid the repayments owed under the deferral period. So 
he didnt need to work with MotoNovo to agree an appropriate arrangement to repay the 
deferred payments. There isnt anything else in the email to suggest that Mr S would need to 
do anything further about reinstating his existing monthly repayments. And MotoNovo has 
already accepted the wording of the email could have been clearer. So I think MotoNovo 
didnt make it clear to Mr S that hed need to reinstate his Direct Debit after the payment deferral ended. And Im satisfied that Mr S acted reasonably by expecting MotoNovo to 
restart collection of the monthly payments, rather than contacting it to arrange this.
I understand MotoNovo says that it was down to Mr S to ensure he made repayments under 
his agreement. Whilst I appreciate this, I dont think there was anything to suggest that 
MotoNovo wouldnt collect the monthly repayments from Mr S after the payment deferral had 
ended. So I dont think it was unreasonable for Mr S to assume the repayments would be 
reinstated at the end of the payment deferral.
Overall, I dont think MotoNovo clearly told Mr S that he would need to set up his Direct Debit 
again after the payment deferral ended. So Im satisfied it was fair for Mr S to assume the 
monthly payments would reconvene after the payment deferral ended. And so I think 
MotoNovo should put things right by removing the late payment markers.
Ive also considered that Mr S was inconvenienced by what happened. This meant he had to 
contact MotoNovo to reactivate the Direct Debit. And Mr Ss credit file has been incorrectly 
reporting arrears since August 2020. I understand this has caused distress to Mr S. And so I 
think MotoNovo should compensate Mr S £100 for the distress and inconvenience caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that MotoNovo Finance Limited should do the following:
remove any adverse information reported to credit reference agencies about the 
payments due between August and November 2020 from Mr Ss credit file; and
pay Mr S £100 for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2022.
