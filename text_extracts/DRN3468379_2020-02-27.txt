K821x#15complaint
Mr K says Elevate Credit International Limited   trading as Sunny  irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 11 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr K between  April 2015 and 
February 2016. Mr Ks borrowing history  is as follows:
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ks complaint  and thought  the loans from loan 7 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the behaviour of his borrowing indicated he was reliant 
on short-term loans.  Sunny disagreed.
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr K could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid

Ref: DRN34683792the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr K could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 6. Mr K 
didnt respond  to the view. As there appears  to be no dispute with the adjudicators opinion 
about these loans, I wont be making any findings  on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 7 to Mr K and the results of these  checks 
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Ks seventh loan in as many  months,  I think 
Sunny should  have  been looking to build a clearer picture about  Mr Ks finances  before 
lending him this loan. 
Looking at Mr Ks history of borrowing, Mr Ks was showing  signs he was likely in a cycle of 
debt. He was borrowing  on the same day or within days of taking out his previous loan. He 
was coming back for more borrowing whilst  loans remained  outstanding or he was repaying 
loans early but then borrowing similar  amounts  again. 
I also think the fact Mr K repaid his loans much  earlier than planned should have caused 
some concern to Sunny.  As that might be the sort of behaviour  that would indicate someone  
was facing problems  managing their money and needing to refinance loans on a regular 
basis. 
In my view, this all pointed to there being a significant risk that Mr K would have been unable 
to make his repayments  sustainably.
Ref: DRN34683793Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr K, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ks case, I think that this point was reached by loan 9. I say 
this because: 
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr K was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr K had taken out nine loans within eight months and had been  
indebted to Sunny  for all that time. So Sunny ought to have realised  it was more 
likely than not Mr K was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Ks indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
From  loan 9 onwards  Mr K was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of taking out a 
previous one. 
Mr K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 11 was 
taken out ten months after Mr Ks first. Mr K had paid large  amounts  of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr K lost out because Sunny provided borrowing for loan 9 onwards because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ks indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Mr K borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ks ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans 7 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 7 and 8 from Mr Ks credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  9, 10 and 11 should be removed 
from Mr Ks credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited must give Mr K a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ks complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN34683794I understand Mr K is subject to a Bankruptcy  Order. Mr K should bear in mind his obligations 
to his insolvency trustee in respect  of any redress he receives. A copy  of this decision will be 
sent to the trustee.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 March  2020.
