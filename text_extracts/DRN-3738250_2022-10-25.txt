The complaint
Mr R complains that National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) closed his account after 50 
years with 60 days notice, without explaining why.
He wants to understand why NatWest closed his account, and to have the opportunity to put 
things right.
What happened
On 9 March 2022, NatWest wrote to Mr R telling him it intended to close his accounts in 60 
days time. It didnt explain why it had decided to close the accounts, and it didnt tell him 
later when he complained. NatWest issued its final response to Mr Rs complaint on 16 April 
2022, in which it again said it couldnt disclose the reasons for its decision, save to say that 
the accounts had been closed in accordance with s12.2 of the terms and conditions of Mr 
Rs accounts.
Mr R didnt accept NatWests response, so he brought his complaint to our service. Our 
investigator found that NatWest had acted in accordance with the terms and conditions of Mr 
Rs accounts, and explained NatWest isnt obliged to explain the reasons for its decision.
Mr R asked our investigator to tell him more about the closure and to explain why NatWest 
was entitled to take the actions it did. But out investigator couldnt expand further, so Mr R 
asked for an ombudsman to review the matter afresh and repeated his request for an 
explanation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to say that Im not going to tell NatWest to disclose any further information than it 
already has, and Im of the view that it acted fairly in closing Mr Rs accounts. 
Just as a customer may close an account with a bank, a bank is entitled to close an account 
with a customer. It doesnt always have to disclose the reason for its decision if it doesnt 
want to, but when it closes the account, it must do so in a way which complies with the terms 
and conditions of the account. So, Ive looked at the steps NatWest took to see if it acted 
fairly.
The terms of Mr Rs account, with which both NatWest and Mr R had to comply, say that 
NatWest can close Mr Rs accounts as long as it gives at least 60 days notice. And I can 
see NatWest gave Mr R 60 days notice in its letter dated 9 March 2022. 
The terms and conditions also state that NatWest wont always be able to explain the 
reasons for its decision to close an account. And, having reviewed the information NatWest 
has provided our service, Im satisfied it was entitled to take the action it did, and that its not 
obliged to divulge the reasons for its decision in the circumstances of this particular case.
NatWest has complied with its contractual obligations and hasnt treated Mr R unfairly. And 
so, I see no basis upon which I can reasonably make an award in Mr Rs favour. Mr 
I appreciate Mr Rs frustration, but for the reasons Ive set out above, I cant reasonably 
uphold his complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2022.
