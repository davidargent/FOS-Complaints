K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that Evergreen Finance London  Limited (trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk) didnt 
do enough checks before  lending him money and the loans were unaffordable to him.
background
Mr C had two loans  from MoneyBoat between February 2017 and April 2017 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 23 Feb 2017 £200 2m £132.08 24 Apr 2017 26 Apr 2017
2 26 Apr 2017 £400 4m £158.06 25 Aug 2017 27 April 2018
Mr C says MoneyBoat  should never have approved the loans. He says he was in a debt 
spiral and multiple late payments and defaults  should have been evident on his credit  file. He 
says these loans  have left him in hardship - both financially and personally.
MoneyBoat says it carried out a credit check and verified Mr Cs monthly  income before 
approving the loans.  It also asked him for information about  his expenditure and adjusted the 
figure based on what it saw in his credit file. MoneyBoat  found  Mr C had enough disposable 
income to cover the repayments on both loans.
MoneyBoat says Mr C repaid the first loan on time,  but cancelled the payment authority 
before the first payment  was due on the second  loan. MoneyBoat says Mr C advised it of a 
large council  tax bill he needed to prioritise, so it agreed to a reduced repayment of £60 per 
month, with no additional  interest charges. Mr C repaid the second loan on 27 April 2018.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He was satisfied that 
MoneyBoat had done enough checks before approving the loans and that the results of 
those checks indicated  the loans were affordable.
Mr C responded to say, in summary, that MoneyBoat should  have  done  further  checks when 
he applied  for the second loan the same day hed repaid the first, especially as it was for 
twice the amount. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
MoneyBoat was required to lend responsibly.  It should have made  checks to make  sure Mr 
C could afford to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr C was borrowing, and his lending  history.  But 
there was no set list of checks MoneyBoat had to do.
When Mr C applied for each of his loans, MoneyBoat asked him for information about  his 
income and expenditure and checked  his credit file. MoneyBoat  verified the income figure  
and the credit commitments  Mr C said he had. As the credit file indicated  a higher level of 
outstanding debt than Mr C had declared,  it also increased his expenditure in line with that. 
So the figures it calculated for Mr Cs disposable income were much lower  than hed 
declared  at around £580 for loan 1 and £770 for loan 2. But as the monthly repayments on 
each of the loans were  under £200,  MoneyBoat still found the loans were affordable.
Ref: DRN80252432Given the repayments were a small proportion of Mr Cs declared income and MoneyBoat 
found the credit check to be acceptable  to it, Im satisfied  its checks  were proportionate  in 
the circumstances. I have seen the results from the checks and I cant conclude MoneyBoat 
was wrong to approve either of the loans.
I accept what Mr C says about the timing  and amount of his second  loan, but this was only 
his second loan with MoneyBoat and I cant reasonably say that should have indicated a 
dependency on short-term lending. Indeed MoneyBoat did question  the reason for the loan 
and Mr C said it was for an unexpected bill. Based on that, and the other information 
MoneyBoat had about Mr Cs circumstances, I cant agree it should have done any further 
checks before approving  loan 2.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 March 2019.
