The complaint
Mr N complains that Homeserve Membership Limited mishandled his home emergency 
insurance policy.
What happened
The Financial Ombudsman Service deals with a consumer complaint against one insurance 
company or other regulated financial firm at a time. In our final decision, we name that firm, 
but we dont identify any other party. Where it is a complaint about a claim under an 
insurance policy, we deal with it as a complaint against the insurance company that was 
responsible for dealing with that claim.
Mr N had a Homeserve policy. It was an annual policy. Mr N paid the annual premium by 
instalments. Strictly speaking, an insurance company was responsible for dealing with 
claims.  
The policy contained provisions for automatic renewal. Homeserve wrote a renewal letter 
dated 16 April 2020. It said that it would renew the policy. It said the premium would be 
about £308.00. It said the previous year had been about £108.00.
Mr N responded to Homeserve on 27 April 2020. He complained about the increase. 
Homeserve automatically renewed the policy for a year from 9 May 2020.  
Homeserve wrote an email to Mr N dated 15 May 2020 and he replied on 19 May 2020. By a 
final response dated 12 June 2020, Homeserve declined the complaint. 
Mr N wrote further letters on 17 June 2020 and 1 July 2020. On 1 July 2020, Homeserve 
reiterated its final response. On 27 July 2020, Mr N wrote a chasing letter. On 3 August 
2020, Homeserve reiterated its final response.
On 14 and 27 August 2020, Mr N wrote to Homeserve requiring a refund of the instalments 
for the policy year from 9 May 2020.  On 8 September 2020, Homeserve reiterated its final 
response but said it had suspended the policy with effect from 21 August 2020.
Mr N brought the complaint to us on 11 September 2020. Our investigator dealt with it as a 
complaint against the insurance company. Our investigator didnt recommend that the 
complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that Homeserve had done anything wrong. 
Mr N disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says, in summary, that:
He is certain that he did very early in the saga attempt to cancel the Homeserve 
policy.
His wife clearly recalls overhearing at least one attempt at a phoned cancellation.
He is fairly certain that he made a telephone call to Homeserve reaffirming 
cancellation; and this initiated Homeserves letter dated 11 June 2020.
He replied on 17 June. 
Recorded phone conversations may not be currently available due to possibly phone 
diversions and some staff working from home.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As this complaint isnt about a claim but is mostly about automatic renewal (as well as 
Homeserves pricing) Ive dealt with it as a complaint against Homeserve rather than against 
the insurance company.
The renewal letter dated 16 April 2020 included the following:
If you need to make any changes, or you do not wish to renew, please give us a call 
on 0330 0247 999
Theres no evidence that Mr N rang that number. Instead he wrote his letter of 27 April 2020. 
Clearly, he wasnt happy with the increased premium. His final sentence was as follows:
Please kindly review the level of what you have offered and advise me further.
From his letter, I find that Mr N wanted the policy to continue but at a lower cost. He didnt 
say he no longer wanted the policy. So I dont consider that Homeserve did anything wrong 
by renewing the policy from 9 May 2020.
Homeserve treated his letter as a complaint about the increased premium. After any 
complaint, a firm has up to eight weeks to send a final response (under the Financial 
Conduct Authority dispute resolution rules (DISP). 
Ive listened to the recording of Homeserves call on 11 June 2020. I dont find that the 
Homeserve call-handler declined to discuss Mr Ns complaint by phone. Indeed, that is why 
Homeserve was ringing. But Mr N said he was just leaving his house and he asked for a 
written reply.
Apart from that call, Mr N hasnt given dates or times of any other call. And none of his 
letters refer to any other call. Im satisfied that Homeserve has made searches and shared 
the results with us. So I dont find it likely that there were any calls other than the one on 11 
June 2020.
Less than eight weeks passed before Homeserves reply dated 12 June 2020. So I cant say 
that it shouldve been sooner. 
Homeserve said the increase was because Mr N had made a claim and also because a 
discount for the previous year had come to an end. I havent seen enough evidence to 
suggest that Homeserve treated Mr N any less favourably than anyone else in such 
circumstances. So I cant say the increased premium was unfair.
Mr Ns letter of 17 June 2020 acknowledged Homeserves reply (but quoted its date as 11 
June). From the call recording, I dont find that Mr N was correct to say that:some member of your staff  called me some days ago and made the comment 
that the matter was not appropriate to be considered over the phone
Mr N and Homeserve each wrote letters dated 1 July 2020. Mr Ns referred back to his letter 
of 27 April as follows:
need for a review and adjustment on your suggested increase in service charges.
Mr Ns letter of 27 July 2020 complained that Homeserve hadnt given a detailed response to 
his letter of 27 April 2020. But Im satisfied that Homeserve had given a sufficient response. 
Up until mid-August 2020, I find that Mr Ns letters indicated that he wanted the policy to 
continue - but at a lower cost. He didnt say he no longer wanted the policy. Mr Ns letter 
dated 14 August 2020 was the first time he made it clear he no longer wanted the policy.
Homeserves letter of 8 September 2020 said it would suspend the policy with effect from 
21 August 2020 and account for any part of an instalment Mr N had paid for days when he 
wasnt covered. I find that in line with the policy terms. 
Mr Ns complaint form said that in July 2020 he had contacted his bank to eliminate future 
payments. So I dont find it likely that he had paid in advance for any days after 21 August 
2020.
Overall, I dont find that Homeserve did anything that was outside the policy terms or 
otherwise treated Mr N unfairly. So I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Homeserve to 
make any refund or to do any more in response to this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Homeserve Membership Limited to do any more in response to this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2021.
