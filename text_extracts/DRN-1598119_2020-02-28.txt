The complaint
Miss G is unhappy that Abacus Management Marketing Limited are charging her for a 
successful mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) claim. 
What happened
In April 2018 Miss G instructed Abacus to make a PPI claim against Lender B. Miss G had 
had a successful claim against Lender B in 2017, when she used the services of another 
claims management company (CMC B). Lender B paid her £1,366.72 compensation. 
Abacus submitted a claim to Lender B and wrote to Miss G telling her shed been successful, 
and would be receiving compensation of £1,366.72. They invoiced her for their fee of 
£590.42. But Miss G didnt receive any more compensation from Lender B. However, 
Abacus continued to chase her for their fee, and took legal action to recover this.
Miss G has complained that Abacus are chasing her for a fee on a successful claim they 
werent involved in.
Our investigator found that Abacus had acted unreasonably. Abacus didnt provide any 
evidence of any work theyd done on a successful claim against Lender B. Based on the 
evidence the investigator had seen (supplied by Miss G) there was nothing to show Abacus 
had submitted a successful claim. The investigator thought Abacus were charging a fee on 
the claim that was successful in 2017, even though they werent instructed to act until 2018.
The investigator recommended Abacus cancel their fee, and all associated costs incurred 
with chasing this. She also recommended that Abacus pay Miss G £150 to compensate her 
for the stress and upset theyd caused by chasing for a fee they werent entitled to.
Miss G agreed with the investigator, but Abacus didnt respond. Because of this, Miss Gs 
complaint has been passed to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, Ive reached the same 
overall conclusions as the investigator, and for broadly the same reasons.
Abacus wrote to Miss G on 11 July 2019, telling her shed had a successful claim. They 
enclosed an invoice confirming the value of the claim was £1,366.72. Based on a success 
fee of 36% plus VAT, Abacus asked Miss G to pay £590.42. Abacus chased Miss G for this 
on 3 September 2019. They sent her a Final Demand invoice on 17 October 2019, giving her 
seven days to pay in full, otherwise they would start legal action to recover their fee.The courts wrote to Miss G in December 2019, telling her Abacus had started proceedings 
against her for £328.01 plus interest and costs. The court paperwork says Miss G instructed 
Abacus on 11 April 2018, and the fee relates to a successful PPI claim on 11 July 2019. 
£328.01 is the equivalent of a success fee of 20% plus VAT on a successful claim of 
£1,366.72. The claims management regulator had imposed a fee cap of 20% plus VAT on all 
successful PPI claims where the customer had instructed a CMC on after 10 July 2018. 
While the fee cap didnt apply to Miss G, because shed instructed Abacus in April 2018, 
based on the specific amount being claimed for its clear this fee related to the successful 
claim of £1,366.72.
Miss G has supplied paperwork from CMC B dated 7 March 2017. This shows shed had a 
successful PPI claim against Lender B, and had been awarded £1,366.72 compensation. 
Because Miss G instructed CMC B to act for her in this claim, she paid them their fees.
Miss G has also supplied a letter from Lender B, dated 28 June 2019. This says Abacus had 
made a claim on her behalf, but all claims had already been successful. Enclosed with this 
letter was a letter dated 2 March 2017 saying Miss G would receive compensation for 
£1,366.72 following a claim made on her behalf by CMC B. Because Abacus were acting for 
Miss G in her latest claim, Lender B wouldve sent a copy of this letter, and the enclosure 
confirming the previous successful claim, to Abacus. 
Abacus hasnt provided any proof they made a successful claim to Lender B which resulted 
in compensation £1,366.72. Ive seen Miss G asked them for this proof as well, and they 
didnt provide her with anything either. Based upon this, and the evidence Ive referred to 
above, Im satisfied that Abacus cant provide this proof because it doesnt exist. 
So Im satisfied that Abacus didnt make a successful claim, instead they asked Miss G for 
their fee on a claim they knew from Lender B had previously been successful, and also knew 
theyd no involvement with. So Abacus had no justification for chasing Miss G for their fee of 
£590.42; or for taking her to court when this amount wasnt paid. They also caused Miss G 
unnecessary stress and upset by doing so. The investigator recommended Abacus pay Miss 
G £150 in recognition of this. Given the circumstances, I agree this amount is fair and 
reasonable.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I uphold Miss Gs complaint. Abacus Management Limited 
must cancel their invoice and waive or pay all associated non-payment costs (including any 
costs associated with taking the matter to court). They must also pay Miss G £150 to 
compensate her for the stress and upset of being chased for a fee she didnt owe. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 March 2020.
