The complaint
Miss W has complained that Loans 2 Go Limited (L2G) hasnt updated her credit file in a 
timely manner, and continues to show a default.
What happened
Miss W has a loan account with L2G. However, she became concerned that her credit file 
wasnt showing the most recent month. She was also concerned that a default was still 
showing.
One of our investigators looked into what had happened, but didnt think L2G had done 
anything wrong. As Miss W disagreed, her complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding this complaint. L2G updates the credit reference agencies 
each month, for the previous month. It can then take some weeks for the agencies to update 
their records. But this doesnt mean L2G hasnt provided timely updates. 
As regards the default marker, records remain on a credit file for six years from the event. 
So, a default would still be showing until this period is up.
My final decision
Its my final decision not to uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 January 2024.
