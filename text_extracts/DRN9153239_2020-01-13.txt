K821x#15complaint
Mr D has complained that Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Plc (RSA) has unfairly  increased 
his home  insurance  premiums and not offered cheaper, alternative cover.
background
Mr D took out home insurance through his employer, RSA, in 2006  for £328.36. The cost of 
his policy  increased  every year until 2014  when he was quoted £757.92. Mr D questioned  
the cost of the cover. Although RSA didnt offer cheaper cover, it did provide  Mr D a card 
that enabled him to get discounts at restaurants.  Mr D agreed  to continue with the insurance.
In 2015 RSA quoted  Mr D £800.13 for cover,  but he didnt accept this. This time RSA offered 
him cover through an alternative  policy that cost £271.72. As this was a different policy it 
didnt offer cover in exactly  the same  terms, but Mr D agreed to take out the lower priced 
policy. He then complained to RSA as he felt hed been overcharged  for a number of years 
as he should have been on the cheaper policy earlier.
RSA didnt uphold  Mr Ds complaint. It said the first policy had been priced correctly, so he 
wasnt over charged.  It also said that the second, newer policy  had a high new business 
discount, which meant the price charged wasnt a fair comparison to the actual cost of 
providing cover. RSA also pointed out that Mr D should have been  aware  of the newer, 
cheaper policy as it had been  advertised  at his place of work.
One of our investigators  considered the complaint and said there appeared to be risk based 
reasons that explained the increase in the price of the first policy. But she thought RSA 
should have made Mr D aware of the cheaper, alternative policy when he made contact  in 
2014. So she thought RSA should  pay the difference between  what Mr D paid in 2014 and 
what he paid the following  year when he switched policies, along  with interest.
Mr D agreed with our investigators view,  but RSA offered  something  different. It said it 
wanted to refund the difference between what Mr D paid in 2014 on his first policy  and what 
he went on to pay in 2019 when the second policy had increased  in price. This was because 
the cost of the policy in 2019  was more reflective of the real price  of the insurance once 
some of the new business discount  had been  removed.
As RSA didnt agree with our investigators  view, the complaint has been passed  to me for a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come  to the same  conclusion as our investigator for the same reasons.
Although both Mr D and RSA are now only disagreeing  about the cost of insurance  in 2014, I 
think it would  be helpful to set out my thoughts about the cost between  2006 and 2014. 
The Financial Ombudsman  Service was set up to resolve individual complaints between 
consumers and financial businesses. Or role isnt to regulate the insurance industry or tell a 
business what it should charge for insurance.  But I can look at whether  RSA has treated 
Ref: DRN91532392Mr D fairly  over the period he held insurance.  And if I didnt think  he was treated fairly, I 
would tell RSA what I thought it needed  to do to put right any unfairness.
If a consumer doesnt engage  with their insurer about the cost of insurance, its possible  that 
an insurer might  take advantage  of this to increase the price  of the policy. If I thought the 
main reason  the price was increasing was down to this, I might think  that wasnt fair. In 
Mr Ds case Ive considered how the cost of his insurance changed  over time, as well as his 
engagement with RSA and any other reasons  the price might  have increased.
When Mr D first took out his policy in 2006 the cost was £328.36. This increased  over time to 
£455.16 in 2011. From what  I know about  how insurance is priced, I think its most  likely that 
this increase is down  to RSA removing the new business  discount that is offered to new 
customers to make  policies appear  more  competitively priced. I dont think  there is anything 
wrong with RSA doing this or that the price increased in this period down to Mr D not 
engaging with the cost of cover.
Between January 2012 and December 2013, Mr D added three items of high priced jewellery  
to the policy  as well as moving home.  In this period  his insurance premiums  increased from 
£455.16 to £710.32. Every time Mr D added something to his policy the price would have 
been discussed and he agreed to take out the additional  cover.  I think its most likely that the 
increase in price  in this period was down to the changes in cover rather than because Mr S 
didnt engage  about the price.
But RSA did have a duty to communicate with Mr D in a way thats clear, fair and not 
misleading. When he questioned the price of the policy in 2014  he was offered a restaurant 
discount card. But I think RSA should  have given Mr D information about his options at that 
stage as he was clearly concerned with the price he was being  charged. 
There isnt a recording of the phone call that took place in 2014 available and Im not 
surprised by that given the time that has passed.  But RSA has told us that it introduced the 
cheaper, alternative cover in 2013,  so it would have been available  to Mr D when he called 
in 2014. And when  he was made  aware  of the alternative cover in 2015 he switched. That 
makes me think he wasnt told about the alternative cover in 2014  and, if he had been, I 
think he would have  wanted to take out the cheaper policy. For the avoidance of doubt,  I 
also dont think Mr D was aware  of the alternative cover through  adverts  at his place of work  
as, if he had been, I think he would have asked  about it. It follows I dont think  RSA gave 
Mr D the information  it should have done and I think it needs  to do something to put that 
right.
Our investigator thought RSA needed to refund the difference between what  Mr D paid in 
2014 (£757.92)  and what he paid in 2015 when he moved to the alternative  policy  (£271.72), 
plus interest. In response RSA offered to refund the difference between the 2014 cost and 
the cost of the alternative policy in 2019  (£385.54), plus interest.  It says this is a fairer price 
as the 2015 price was highly discounted and not reflective of the real policy  price.
Ive thought about what RSA said, but I think it should use the lower  2014 price. Its difficult 
to say what Mr D would have been quoted on the alternative policy in 2014, but I think  its 
likely he would have been entitled to similar  discounts in 2014 than he was able to get in 
2015. That means he would have been quoted something closer to the £271.72 he paid in 
2015 than the £385.54 he paid in 2019,  so I think its fair for RSA to use the lower price.  Had 
he taken the alternative  policy in 2014,  I do accept that its possible the tapering  of discounts 
he received could have happened  sooner,  so he might have been paying more  in 2019 than 
Ref: DRN91532393he actually did. But again, its difficult to say what his premium cost would  be today had he 
done something different in the past.  And looking at the complaint holistically, I think  its fair 
for RSA to use the figure  of £271.72 to work out compensation.
what RSA  needs to do to put things  right
I think RSA needs  to:
pay Mr D the difference  between  the premium cost in 2014 (£757.92) and in 2015  
(£271.72) - £486.20
add interest at the rate of 8% per year simple to that figure from when he paid his 
premium in 2014 to when he is paid compensation by RSA. RSA is required by HM 
Revenue & Customs to take off tax from any interest paid. Should Mr D request it, 
RSA should give him a certificate  showing how much tax has been taken off so he 
can reclaim it if appropriate.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ds complaint  against  Royall & Sun Alliance Insurance Plc and direct  it to pay 
the compensation set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 February  2020.
