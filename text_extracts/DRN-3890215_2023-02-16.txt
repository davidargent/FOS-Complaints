The complaint
Mr A complains NewDay Ltd declined his credit card application. 
What happened
Mr A held a John Lewis branded credit card. The credit was provided by a third party before 
NewDay took over and as a result a new application was required in order to continue with 
the card. Mr As application was declined. Mr A is unhappy. He wants to know why his 
account wont be continued. Hed like an apology and his card to continue.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She didnt think it was unreasonable NewDay 
carried out an affordability assessment. She said NewDay doesnt have to divulge the exact 
reasons for declining Mr As application. However she noted NewDay declined Mr As 
application as it needed further information from him and NewDay outlined what it needed to 
re-assess his application. So she thought NewDay had treated him fairly.
Mr A didnt agree so the case has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Mr A wanted his credit card to be transferred from the third party over to 
NewDay without the need for a new application. But as NewDay were taking on Mr A as a 
new customer, I dont think it was unreasonable that it carried out an affordability 
assessment to ensure they lent responsibly to Mr A. So I dont think NewDay did anything 
wrong in requiring Mr A to make an application or in carrying out checks.
Mr A wants to know why his account wont be continued. He says the soft search didnt 
explain what information was needed; his application was declined straight away. As our 
investigator outlined, a business decision whether or not to lend can be commercially 
sensitive and a business may not disclose the exact reasons why a lending application is 
declined. Although our service wouldnt interfere with this, we can look at whether NewDay 
treated Mr A fairly in the process.
I can see NewDay explained it couldnt verify sufficient information to accept Mr As online 
application. So I dont think it did anything wrong in declining it. In its letter dated 12 October 
2022, NewDay clearly outlined what information it needed to re-assess his application  
proof of income and accommodation costs. I find this request reasonable given the nature of 
an affordability assessment. So Im satisfied. NewDay did enough to support Mr As desire to 
continue with a John Lewis branded card. 
Mr A has said he works in the banking industry and that NewDay have breached the codes 
of treating customers fairly and expectations under the consumer duty requirements which 
will soon be in force. Mr A has also said NewDay are only seen to be taking on customers 
with an outstanding balance as theyll be more profitable. He has also said there is 
widespread dissatisfaction about NewDay. But my role here is to comment on the specifics 
of Mr As case. Having taken everything into consideration and for the reasons Ive outlined 
above, I think NewDay have treated Mr A fairly. 
Mr A has also complained the letter he received about the complaint handling process didnt 
include the leaflet for our service. Whilst I acknowledge this mustve been frustrating, Mr A 
was made aware of our service and did refer to his complaint to us in time, so I dont think 
hes been materially disadvantaged by not having the leaflet. 
I appreciate Mr As strength of feeling and that hes disappointed his card wont continue. I 
realise my decision will be disappointing for him, but Ive explained above why I dont think 
NewDay need to do anything more to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2023.
