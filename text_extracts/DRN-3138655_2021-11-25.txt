Mr K looks like he may have had some problems repaying his final two loans because STF 
has told this Service that outstanding balances remain.
The adjudicator, reviewed Mr Ks complaint and she thought STF had acted reasonably 
when it approved loans 1  5.
However, the adjudicator did uphold Mr Ks complaint about loans 6  27 because in her 
view the overall pattern of lending was now harmful for Mr K and so these loans ought to not 
have been provided. 
Mr K didnt disagree with the adjudicators findings. 
STF didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment. In response it said;
It doesnt believe it did anything wrong with the way it dealt with Mr K. 
It adhered to all relevant guidelines, regulations and its own procedures when it lent 
to Mr K. 
It has only been since November 2018 that it had the ability to accept and keep 
copies of any supporting evidence, such as bank statements, wage slips and bills. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
There doesnt appear to be any ongoing disagreement about the outcome the adjudicator 
reached for loans 1  5. So, I no longer think these loans are in dispute, so I wont be making 
a finding on them. But what I would add, is that I dont disagree with what the adjudicator 
said. Instead, this decision will focus on what happened when loans 6  27 were lent. But 
Ive kept in mind loans 1- 5 as they do form part of Mr Ks lending history with STF. 
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr K could
repay his loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might suggest STF should have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Mr K. These factors include: 
Mr K having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income); The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr K having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr K coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr K. The loan payments being 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.
When these loans were approved, STF was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, 
which has set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) that payments are 
sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in particular, made on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to make them. If a 
lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make 
their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those 
repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Ks complaint.
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 6 - 27 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. STF has been able to provide this Service with a copy of Mr Ks 
application forms. These application forms include details about the income and expenditure 
that Mr K declared and for later loans (from loan 19) what STF gathered from its credit 
checks.  
I would say, that based on the details in the application form and the later income and 
expenditure assessments, that STF couldve reasonably concluded that Mr K would be in a 
position to afford the repayments he was committed to making. 
But in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Mr K, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Mr K. Having looked at the overall pattern of STFs 
lending history with Mr K, I agree with our adjudicator that STF should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided loan 6. I 
say this because;
At this point STF ought to have realised Mr K was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. This was now the sixth loan in just under a year and Mr K had been 
indebted to STF for almost the entire time. Loan 6, was also Mr Ks joint largest loan 
to date. 
So STF ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr K was having to borrow 
further to cover an ongoing need and his indebtedness was increasingly 
unsustainably. It also seems that Mr Ks loan history up until this point clearly 
indicated that his underlying financial situation didnt seem to be improving, given his 
loan amounts were generally increasing. 
Mr Ks capital borrowing generally was increasing with each new loan. I accept that 
loan 5 was for a smaller amount, but loan 4 was still running, so actually, Mr Ks 
capital amount outstanding wouldve been larger at this time. This suggests to me 
that Mr Ks indebtedness was increasing unsustainably, and he was likely needing further borrowing to cover ongoing living costs, rather than as a means to cover one-
off purchases, for example. 
Mr K had developed a pattern of taking new loans around the same time previous 
ones were repaid, for example, loans 2 and 4. And at times Mr K had more than one 
loan running at the same time. This pattern continued within the lending relationship. 
So, STF ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr K, was having to 
borrow further to effectively cover a longer-term financial need. To me, this is also 
indicative of his indebtedness not being sustainable.
Mr K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed STF. Loan 27 was taken 
out more than four years after loan 1. And loan 27 was Mr Ks largest loan hed taken 
and was five times the value of Mr Ks first loan.  Mr K had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to STF over an extended period of time.
I think that Mr K lost out when STF provided loans 6 - 27 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ks indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans and the time in debt was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ks ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 - 27 and Ill go on to set out
what STF should do to put things right.  
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Mr K from loan 6 as I think it ought to.
 
Clearly there are several possibilities, and all hypothetical answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mr K may have simply left matters there and 
not tried to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed between 
him and STF which he may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, he may 
have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, he may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if he had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mr K in a compliant 
way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Mr K would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
STF shouldnt have given Mr K loans 6  27.If STF has sold the outstanding debts it should buy these back if it is able to do so and then 
take the following steps. If STF isnt able to buy the debts back then it should liaise with the 
new debt owner to achieve the results Ive outlined below. 
A. STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr K towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance. 
B. STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr K 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr K originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled. 
C. STF should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr K as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on the outstanding loans. If this results in Mr K having 
made overpayments then STF should refund these overpayments with 8% simple 
interest* calculated, from the date the overpayments wouldve arisen, to the date the 
complaint is settled. STF should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B 
and move to step E. 
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Mr K. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then STF should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with 
Mr K and Id remind STF of its obligation to treat Mr K fairly and with forbearance. 
E. The overall pattern of Mr Ks borrowing for loans 6 - 27 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so STF should remove these loans entirely from Mr 
Ks credit file. STF do not have to remove loans 26 and 27 from Mr Ks credit file until 
these have been repaid, but it should still remove any adverse information recorded 
about these loans. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Mr K a 
certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mr Ks complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 December 2021.
