The complaint
Mr B complains that Tandem Personal Loans Limited wont refund to him the money that he 
paid for a holiday club vacation week. His wife is also involved in his complaint and hes 
being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr B and his wife had bought a holiday product from a holiday company in May 2016. The 
price was £18,000 which they paid using a loan and Mr B says that they paid off the loan in 
October 2017. They then acquired a vacation week from the holiday company in October 
2017 and Mr B says that they traded in the holiday product that theyd bought in May 2016. 
The price was £35,000, they made a bank transfer of £10,500 and entered into a fixed sum 
loan agreement with a finance provider for a loan of £24,500. That loan was repaid in 
February 2018.
Mr B and his wife then entered into a membership application agreement in October 2018 to 
acquire another vacation week from the holiday company. The membership application price 
was £42,000 and they entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a different finance 
provider for a loan of £35,000. They agreed to make 179 monthly payments of £357.28 and 
a final payment of £358.44 to that finance provider. The remaining £7,000 was paid using 
another loan from the finance provider that had lent to them in October 2017. In this decision 
I will refer to the finance provider of the £35,000 loan as the Finance Provider and to the 
finance provider that lent to Mr B and his wife in October 2017 and also lent £7,000 to them 
in October 2018 as the other finance provider.
Mr Bs representative, on behalf of Mr B, made claims to the Finance Provider in January 
2022 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 about the October 2018 
acquisition. The claims include that: the vacation week was mis-sold to Mr B and his wife 
and, but for the misrepresentations made to them, they wouldnt have purchased it nor 
entered into the loan agreement; the holiday company was in liquidation and couldnt provide 
the services sold so was in breach of contract; the terms of the agreement are so egregious 
as to be unfair; the payment of commission was hidden from view; the vacation week was 
marketed as an investment in contravention of the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and 
Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 and was sold to Mr B and his wife under extreme 
sales pressure; proper affordability checks werent undertaken and Mr Bs relationship with 
the Finance Provider is unfair.
The Finance Provider said that the purchase price of the vacation week was £42,000 which 
placed Mr Bs claim outside the scope of section 75 as the cash price was more than 
£30,000. It also said that it was under no obligation to respond to or defend any matters 
arising from allegations made under section 140A, except for those pursuant to actions 
taken in a civil court having first received and responded to a letter before action. 
Mr B wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. His complaint form 
says that: the Finance Provider paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt 
declared to him; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to 
afford the loan; the vacation week was misrepresented to him and his wife; the holiday 
company unduly pressured them into entering into the purchase agreement and him into 
entering into the loan agreement and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure 
them; the holiday company is in liquidation so is in breach of contract; and they werent 
provided with key information necessary for them to be able to make an informed decision 
regarding the purchase; all rendering the loan agreement unfair under section 140A; and he 
says that his claim should also be considered under section 75.
The Finance Provider then transferred Mr Bs loan to another finance provider in August 
2022 and it provided information about the loan application that was made by Mr B in 
October 2018 and the reasons that the loan was assessed as affordable for him. The loan 
has since been transferred to Tandem Personal Loans. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Bs complaint should be upheld. She said that the 
purchase was for a single item with a cash price of £42,000 which wasnt within the limits for 
a claim under section 75 so section 75 didnt apply to the purchase. She said that she hadnt 
seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr B and the Finance Provider was 
unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the 
relationship was unfair. She said that shed not seen any information to confirm that any 
commission paid to the holiday company by the Finance Provider in relation to this purchase 
was of an amount that would create an unfair relationship. She didnt think that the checks 
carried out by the Finance Provider before it agreed to lend to Mr B in October 2018 were 
reasonable and proportionate but she wasnt persuaded that more detailed checks would 
have given it a reason to think that the lending was likely to have been unsustainable and 
unaffordable for him.
Mr Bs representative says that Mr B isnt accepting our investigators recommendation and 
would like the matter referred to an ombudsman for a decision. Mr B has provided 
documents about the acquisition that he and his wife made in October 2018 and he says that 
no checks were carried out by the Finance Provider (at least not ones that were "reasonable 
and proportionate" as he and his wife werent asked for any information about their income 
or outgoings and said clearly that the vacation week wasnt affordable for them). He says 
that their financial reports from that time show that all of their income was being spent and 
there was no spare money available to cover the additional loan repayments, which he says 
is supported by the decisions they had to take to keep on top of their finances by re-
mortgaging their house and pulling-down part of his pension.
Mr Bs representative has provided a document containing detailed submissions from it and 
Mr B in response to our investigators recommendation which says, in summary and 
amongst other things, that: the vacation week was sold to Mr B and his wife as an 
investment that was extremely desirable and could easily be resold at a profit; Mr B and his 
wife were responsible for paying maintenance charges and failure to pay them would result 
in termination of the membership with no refund; theres no viable secondary market for 
timeshares; the holiday company had a responsibility to give Mr B and his wife sufficient 
information for them to make an informed contractual decision, including the value on the 
open market of the product being purchased along with its likely value on the open market in 
the future; and our investigator has failed to properly assess Mr Bs claims under sections 75 
and 140A and, had she done so, they would have been upheld. It also described the 
reasons that they consider that the lending to Mr B was irresponsible.
Similar claims were also made to the other finance provider about the October 2017 and 
October 2018 acquisitions and a complaint was then made to this service. That complaint 
has been dealt with separately.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Bs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr B and his wife took out a loan to buy a holiday product from the holiday company 
in May 2016 and they say that they paid off the loan in October 2017 and Mr B says 
that they traded in that holiday product for a vacation week from the holiday company 
in October 2017 which they paid for using a loan from the other finance provider  
but that loan was repaid in February 2018 and neither of those loans form part of this 
complaint;
Mr B and his wife entered into a membership application agreement in October 2018 
to acquire another vacation week from the holiday company and the membership 
application agreement that they signed shows that they acquired a vacation week 
each year at a specified club and membership level during high season with a 
maximum occupancy of two and that the membership application fee was £42,000;
Mr B entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with the Finance Provider for a loan of 
£35,000 and Mr B and his wife entered into a separate loan agreement with the other 
finance provider for a loan of £7,000;
Mr Bs representative, on behalf of Mr B, made claims to the Finance Provider in 
January 2022 under sections 75 and 140A about the £35,000 loan - section 75 gives 
a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section are met) and section 
140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay  
any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an 
unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that section 75 doesnt apply to a 
claim that relates to any single item to which the supplier has attached a cash price 
not exceeding £100 or more than £30,000;
the cash price for the vacation week that Mr B and his wife acquired in October 2018 
was £42,000 which is more than the £30,000 maximum limit for a claim under section 
75 so I dont consider that Mr Bs claim relate to a single item to which the holiday 
company has attached a cash price exceeding £100 but not more than £30,000 so I 
find that hes unable to make a claim under section 75 about that acquisition;
although I cant make a finding in these circumstances on a breach of contract claim 
under section 75, I understand that the holiday company went into liquidation in May 
2020, but I also understand that a new management company has been appointed to 
provide the services in connection with the vacation week that Mr B and his wife had 
acquired and that its available for them to use;
Mr Bs complaint forms say that the Finance Provider paid a commission to the 
holiday company which wasnt declared to him; the holiday company failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan; the vacation week was 
misrepresented to Mr B and his wife; the holiday company unduly pressured them 
into entering into the purchase agreement and the loan agreement and used 
aggressive commercial practices to pressure them; the holiday company is in 
liquidation so is in breach of contract; and they werent provided with key information 
necessary for them to be able to make an informed decision regarding their 
purchase; all rendering the loan agreement unfair under section 140A;although I find that Mr B is unable to make a claim under section 75, he is able to 
make a claim under section 140A so in this decision Im considering whether or not 
the Finance Providers response to Mr Bs section 140A claim was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances (Im not determining the outcome of the claim that 
he's made under section 140A as only a court would be able to do that);
Mr Bs representatives January 2022 claims letter says that the payment of 
commission was hidden from view and Mr Bs complaint form says that the Finance 
Provider paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to him - 
but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was 
paid by the Finance Provider to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid, it 
tended to be low and of less than 15% and Im satisfied that the Finance Provider 
wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any 
regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these circumstances - 
and I dont consider that the level of commission that was normally paid in this type of 
situation was sufficiently high to mean that the Finance Provider should have 
appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr B risked the relationship being 
unfair under section 140A;
Mr Bs representatives January 2022 claims letter says that proper affordability 
checks werent undertaken and Mr Bs complaint form says that the holiday company 
failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan;
the Finance Provider has provided a copy of the loan application summary that was 
created in October 2018 for Mr Bs loan and which shows that Mr B was an employed 
home-owner with an annual income of £43,000 and a monthly mortgage payment of 
£463 and it also contained information about his other outgoings - the summary also 
shows that a credit search was made and that an affordability assessment was 
conducted;
the finance provider to which Mr Bs loan was transferred in August 2022 says that 
the Finance Provider calculated from Mr Bs stated income of £43,000 that he had a 
monthly net income of £2,718 which exceeded the minimum monthly net income 
needed to repay the loan;
it says that the Finance Provider used figures from the Office of National Statistics for 
Mr Bs household expenses which were calculated at £921.85 per month, of which 
74% (£682.17) was apportioned to Mr B as his wife had earnings of £12,000 per 
annum with a monthly net income of £961.89;
it says that Mr B had £384 per month of active credit commitments that required a 
regular monthly commitment and £124.89 of minimum payments needed on 
revolving credit balances and that, after paying for his credit commitments, the 
mortgage payment, his share of the household expenses and the loan repayment of 
£357.28, he would be left with £706.66 of disposable income each month which 
passed the Finance Providers affordability checks;
Mr B says that he and his wife werent asked for any information about their income 
or outgoings but I consider it to be more likely than not that Mr B did provide some 
information about his financial situation to the Finance Provider and that it used that 
information, with other information that it had obtained, to assess the affordability of 
the loan for him;
Mr B has provided bank account, credit card account and savings account 
statements and copies of credit reports for him and his wife and a detailed 
explanation of their financial situation  he says that they re-mortgaged their house in 
December 2017 to pay-off their May 2016 loan which provided an additional £53,000 and they used that to pay £22,320 to the other finance provider in February 2018 as 
the final payment on the October 2017 loan and £10,500 was paid to the holiday 
company as a deferred payment  and the re-mortgage resulted in their monthly 
mortgage payment increasing from £357.70 to £626.37;
Mr B says that he drew down £21,495.27 from his pension plan in November 2019 to 
help clear their debts and that he took out a personal loan for £18,500 in August 
2020 to ease some of their financial pressures and that they re-mortgaged again in 
May 2021 to clear outstanding loans and credit card bills which had built up due to 
the financial constraints of their loans which were costing them £448 each month - 
which provided them with £31,290 but resulted in their monthly mortgage payment 
increasing to £884.25;
if Mr B and his wife werent able to afford the loans that theyd taken out in May 2016 
and October 2017, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them not to have 
entered into the membership application agreement to acquire another vacation 
week in October 2018 at a total cost of a further £42,000;
Ive carefully considered all of the information that Mr B has provided about his and 
his wifes financial situation but I dont consider that it shows that they couldnt afford 
a loan with a monthly repayment of £357.28 and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr B when it was made 
to him in October 2018, the Finance Provider should have done more to assess the 
affordability of the loan for him, the Finance Provider lent to him irresponsibly, the 
loan was mis-sold to him or the Finance Provider has acted incorrectly in connection 
with the loan;
Mr Bs representatives January 2022 claims letter says that it was represented to 
Mr B and his wife that: they should consider making another purchase of a more 
premium product which would be easier to sell as part of the holiday company's re-
sale scheme and make a higher profit for them; and the product was available at a 
special price but only if purchased on that day;
Mr B says that he and his wife were told in October 2018 that the sales price for the 
unit that they were acquiring was expected to be in the region of £90,000 and that the 
holiday company was very clever at promoting the sale as an investment and the 
majority of the time that they were with its representatives was going through sales 
figures and investment figures rather than the benefits of the membership but all of 
the figures shown to them were removed and they werent allowed to take them with 
them;
in response to our investigators recommendation, Mr B has provided a copy of the 
membership application agreement that he and his wife signed in October 2018 
including the terms and conditions, a standard information form, an exchange 
contract, an initial disclosure document, a relinquishment form and a separate 
standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given to withdraw from the 
agreement;
Mr and Mrs B signed the standard information form which contained information 
about the vacation week and the costs, including the annual membership renewal fee 
and said that the membership would expire in December 2045;
it also says: The resale facility will be available five years from the membership start 
date. The Resale facility will be available to be applied for on a year to year basis and 
is subject to demand/offer and availability; and the   Rental Program is available 
to be applied for on a year to year basis and is subject to demand/offer and 
availability; they also signed the relinquishment form to relinquish their right to use or exchange 
their vacation weeks until the end of 2019 and the form says: We agree and accept 
by signing this form that no guarantees other than the first one year rental are 
included in this agreement and that we are able to financially support this 
Membership purchase;
other than the information described above, neither Mr B nor his representative has 
provided a detailed account of the circumstances in which the alleged 
misrepresentations were made, the conversations that took place or the information 
that was provided to Mr B and his wife before they entered into the membership 
application agreement in October 2018 or any documentary or other evidence in 
support of his claims about the representations that were made to them;
our investigator said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship 
between Mr B and the Finance Provider was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a 
court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair, and in responding 
to her recommendation, I dont consider that Mr B and his representative have 
provided further evidence to show that the vacation week that Mr B and his wife 
acquired in October 2018 was misrepresented to them;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the vacation week that 
Mr B and his wife acquired in October 2018 was misrepresented or mis-sold to them 
by the holiday company or that they were induced into entering into the membership 
application agreement by any such misrepresentations;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that that vacation week 
was marketed or sold to Mr B and his wife as an investment so I dont consider that 
theres been any breach of regulation as claimed by Mr Bs representative;
Mr Bs representatives January 2022 claim letter says that the vacation week was 
sold to Mr B and his wife under extreme sales pressure and Mr Bs complaint form 
says that the holiday company unduly pressured them into entering into the 
membership application agreement and the loan agreement and used aggressive 
commercial practices to pressure them - but Mr B and his wife have made the same 
claims to the other finance provider about their October 2017 acquisition - if theyd 
been subject to undue pressure and aggressive commercial practices that werent 
acceptable to them in October 2017, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
them not to have then entered into a membership application agreement to acquire 
another vacation week from the holiday company in October 2018;
Mr B and his wife had bought a holiday product from the holiday company in May 
2016 and had acquired a vacation week from the holiday company in October 2017 
so I would expect them to have been prepared for the sales tactics that might be 
used by the holiday company before they went into the sales presentation in October 
2018 and that, if they didnt want to acquire another vacation week, they would have 
made that clear to the holiday company at that time;
Mr B and his wife also signed a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that 
could be given to withdraw from the membership application agreement within 
fourteen calendar days without giving any reason and the loan agreement clearly set 
out Mr Bs right to withdraw from the loan agreement without giving any reason for 
fourteen days;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr  B and his wife tried to withdraw from the 
membership application agreement or that Mr B tried to withdraw from the loan 
agreement during the withdrawal periods and Mr B says that they didnt make use of 
the fourteen day cooling off period as they believed that they had made a good 
investment;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr B and his wife were 
unduly pressured into acquiring the vacation week in October 2018 or that Mr B was 
unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement at that time or that the holiday 
company used unacceptably aggressive commercial practices against them;
Mr Bs complaint form says that he and his wife werent provided with key information 
necessary for them to be able to make informed decisions regarding their purchase 
and the submission made in response to our investigators recommendation says 
that the holiday company had a responsibility to give them information about the 
value on the open market of the product being purchased and its likely future value 
on the open market  but Im not persuaded that the holiday company was required 
to give them those values;
neither of Mr B nor his representative has identified any other information that was 
necessary for Mr B and his wife to make an informed decision regarding the 
purchase but that wasnt provided to them by the holiday company and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of 
regulation as alleged;
Mr Bs representative says that the terms of the agreement are so egregious as to be 
unfair and the submission made in response to our investigators recommendation 
says that Mr B and his wife were responsible for paying maintenance charges and 
failure to pay them would result in termination of the membership with no refund but it 
hasnt identified which of the terms of the membership application agreement it 
considers to be unfair;
it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in the 
membership application agreement are unfair but I dont consider that the presence 
of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is likely to mean that a court would 
conclude that it created an unfair relationship between a debtor and a creditor as the 
court would consider how the term operated in practice and whether the operation of 
that term caused the relationship to be unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
membership application agreement have been applied or operated unfairly against 
Mr B and his wife and I consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these 
circumstances that the terms of the agreement created an unfair relationship 
between Mr B and the Finance Provider or Tandem Personal Loans;
having considered all of the information and evidence that Mr B and his 
representative have provided, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that Mr Bs relationships with the Finance Provider and Tandem Personal 
Loans are unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that 
those relationships are unfair;
I consider that the Finance Provider should have responded to the claims that had 
been made to it under section 140A so I cant say that its response to those claims 
was fair and reasonable  but, if it had properly considered those claims, I consider 
that it would have been fair and reasonable for it not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mr B for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
vacation week and the difficulties that hes described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair 
or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Tandem Personal Loans to 
refund to Mr B any of the money that hes paid under the loan agreement, to cancel 
the loan, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2024.
