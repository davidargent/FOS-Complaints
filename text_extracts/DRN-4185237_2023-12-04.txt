The complaint
Mr P complains about service provided by Paragon Bank Plc (Paragon).
What happened
In March 2019, Mr P had an easy access ISA with Paragon. In July 2018, there were two 
credits  one for £1, one for £19,116.05.
He wanted to close the easy access ISA by transfers to another provider (A) and to his 
nominated bank account. Between 14 January 2019 and 11 March 2019, three payments 
totalling £19,116.05 were transferred out of the account, leaving a balance of £1. 
The transfers out were:
- 14 January 2019: £2,250.05 (to bank account)
- 6 March 2019: £2,538.00 (to bank account)
- 11 March 2019: £14,328.00 (to bank A)
The balance of £1 remained on the account and so it didnt close. With accrued interest 
being credited to the easy access ISA, the balance was £154.31 in October 2022. 
In October 2022, he asked to open a one-year fixed cash ISA with Paragon and tried to 
transfer £10,000 into it. The payment was rejected by Paragon as the payment had come 
from an account which Paragon didnt recognise.
Mr P said that hed changed his current account provider in the meantime  so the 
nominated account held in Paragons records for the old account was different to that used 
by Mr P in October 2022. Mr P needed to re-advise Paragon of his new nominated account 
as a result.
Mr P complained. He said:
- He hadnt authorised the transfer of £1 to the easy access ISA from his main bank current 
account. 
- He couldnt see why Paragon hadnt transferred the (then) whole balance to provider A in 
March 2019 and closed the account. As a result, Mr P was inconvenienced as he needed to 
advise Paragon of new nominated account details in October 2022  and this took until 21 
November 2022 to do. He said Paragons processes to do this were slow and staff were 
pedantic. So  because the payment of £10,000 was rejected, and he intended to invest a 
further £4,500, he lost out on interest being earned for the intervening period  and wants 
this refunded to him. He also wants compensation for the stress and inconvenience 
experienced.
Paragon said the transfer request from provider A was for the previous tax years funds only 
and didnt therefore include the £1 payment  as this was counted as the current years 
funds. Therefore, the account remained open. The balance as of October 2022 was £154.31 
 with accrued interest.
Paragon had sent the necessary form to Mr P to complete to add a new nominated bank 
account, but this was delayed by a postal strike.
Paragon agreed that some of the email correspondence with Mr P couldve been clearer, 
and for that, paid compensation of £25.
Mr P brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Paragon didnt need to do anymore. 
He said hed seen the transfer request from provider A and it didnt ask Paragon to close the 
easy access account, so he didnt think Paragon were wrong to keep it open. 
He said there were delays in adding the new nominated account but he said this wasnt 
unreasonable and Paragon followed their processes in doing so. Paragon operated the easy 
access account online, and so Mr P didnt receive any paper statements  which meant that 
Mr P wasnt aware the old account was still open. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of Mr Ps complaint is how the transfers in and out of his account relate to the ISA 
allowances, and for which tax years. 
I asked to see the transfer request that Paragon received from bank A. It was dated 7 March 
2019.
It clearly stated that the current years subscriptions (i.e. tax year 2018/2019) were to be left 
with Paragon, and it was the prior years ISA subscription (i.e. tax year 2017/2018) that was 
to be transferred to bank A. 
Looking at Mr Ps Easy Access Cash ISA with Paragon:
£1  credited on 6 July 2018:
This was part of Mr Ps ISA allowance for the tax year 2018/2019. And it wasnt transferred 
out of Paragon because the transfer request from bank A asked for prior years subscriptions 
to be transferred. 
Mr P has said to us that he didnt subscribe to an ISA with Paragon for this tax year  but we 
asked Paragon about that and they showed us a letter dated 5 July 2018 and addressed to 
Mr P - which said:
Welcome to your new Paragon ISA Thank you for applying for a Paragon Easy Access 
Cash ISA. Were delighted youve chosen to save with us. In this pack youll find 
everything you need to manage your account online and get started.If you havent done 
so already, you need to make your opening payment as soon as possible. Remember you 
have 30 days from the date of your application to do this and then you can top up your 
savings whenever you like. Unfortunately if there is any delay with this, youll need to 
reapply for your account and the interest rate may have changed. So  its reasonable to 
say that Mr P did subscribe for an ISA with Paragon for that tax year.
The credit for £1 was then credited to the account on 6 July 2018  so was part of Mr Ps ISA allowance for the tax year 2018/2019. And as the transfer request asked for that current 
years subscriptions (i.e. tax year 2018/2019) to be left with Paragon, the amount of £1 was 
not transferred to bank A. 
Mr P has said he didnt authorise the payment of £1 to Paragon from his bank  but thats 
not a matter for Paragon  and Mr P must contact his bank about that. We can only expect 
Paragon to process the credits to Mr Ps Easy Access ISA, which is what they did.
£19,116.05 - credited on 17 July 2018:
Paragon told us that this was part of Mr Ps ISA subscription for the tax year 2017/2018  
this had been transferred to Paragon from another bank. We asked Paragon about this  
and they showed us evidence that the amount was part of Mr Ps ISA allowance for the tax 
year 2017/2018. 
Therefore, Im satisfied that Paragon did the right thing to transfer this amount to bank A, in 
accordance with the authority they received.
Transfer out: £14,328.00  11 March 2019:
This was transferred to bank A under the transfer request dated 7 March 2019. And as Ive 
said, it related to the tax year 2017/2018. 
Paragon explained that the form for Mr P to advise a new nominated bank account was 
delayed by a postal strike, which seem to me to be a reasonable explanation for the delay, 
and while this caused Mr P some frustration, we cant hold Paragon responsible for that.
I want to assure Mr P that weve looked closely at what happened here and have asked 
Paragon a number of further questions and sought more evidence. I can see that Mr P feels 
strongly about what happened here, and so will be disappointed by my decision, which is 
that I do not uphold his complaint.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 January 2024.
