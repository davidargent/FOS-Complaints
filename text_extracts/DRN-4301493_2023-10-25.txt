The complaint
Mr S is unhappy with the service hes received from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) surrounding a payment that was never received by the intended recipient.
What happened
Mr S instructed an international transfer from his NatWest account to an overseas recipient 
account using his NatWest mobile banking app. The payment left his NatWest account but 
was never received by the intended recipient. Mr S asked NatWest to help him locate the 
missing payment but NatWest repeatedly told him that they were waiting for the recipient 
bank to respond to their enquiries and that he should contact them again in a week. Mr S 
wasnt happy with the service he was receiving from NatWest, so he raised a complaint.
NatWest responded to Mr S and said that theyd processed the payment as per his 
instruction. NatWest also explained that they were trying to recover Mr Ss money for him but 
that they were dependent upon the recipient bank responding to their enquiries. However, 
NatWest did acknowledge that they could have looked to recover Mr Ss money sooner than 
they did, and they apologised to Mr S for this and made a payment of £100 to him and 
credited a further £25 to his account to cover their payment recall charge. Mr S wasnt 
satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel NatWest should fairly 
be asked to reimburse Mr S the missing payment amount as he would like, and that the 
response NatWest had issued to Mr S already represented a fair outomce. Mr S remained 
dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that something has gone wrong regarding the international payment that Mr S 
instructed. And I can appreciate that Mr S would like to understand what has happened to 
his money, which appears to have been lost at some point during the transfer chain.
However, it isnt within my remit to conduct a full investigation into what has happened here. 
This is because this is a complaint against NatWest, and this means that my remit is limited 
to the actions of NatWest and to whether I feel that NatWest have acted fairly or unfairly in 
how theyve managed the situation surrounding this complaint. 
To that end, the first thing Ive considered is whether NatWest processed the payment in 
accordance with the instructions given to them by Mr S. And having reviewed the information 
presented to this service, Im satisfied that NatWest did process the payment to the correct 
overseas account  the overseas account they were instructed to transfer the money to by 
Mr S  so that the transfer amount was sent by NatWest to that overseas bank such that the 
money left NatWest and so isnt now in any account owned or controlled by them.
It's also evident that NatWest have attempted to contact the intended recipient bank on 
multiple occasions at the request of Mr S to try to locate the missing money for him. But 
because the transferred money is no longer with NatWest and is presently held in an as-yet-
unknown third-party account, NatWest are dependent on the cooperation of the recipient 
bank to be able to assist them in this regard. But unfortunately, the recipient bank hasnt 
cooperated with NatWest as would generally be expected here.
All of which means that, while its clear that something has gone wrong with this transfer, I 
dont feel that NatWest have made any form or error or omission thats contributed or led to 
the transfer not completing as it should have. Rather, Im satisfied that NatWest have fulfilled 
their role in the transfer correctly and as expected. And this means that the error or omission 
that has led to Mr Ss money not being received by the intended recipient must, in all 
likelihood, have happened at some other point in the transfer chain.
I can appreciate from Mr Ss perspective that he wants his money found or to be reimbursed 
to him. But I hope that he can understand why I wont be upholding this complaint against 
NatWest or instructing them to take any further action here  because I dont feel it would be 
fair to instruct NatWest to reimburse Mr S as he would like, given that Im satisfied that the 
reason his money went missing isnt because of an error or omission by NatWest but rather 
because of the actions or inactions of another party at some other part of the transfer chain. 
NatWest apologised to Mr S for not offering to try to recover his money for him sooner than 
they did, and they paid £100 compensation to Mr S for this and also credited his account 
with £25 to cover their payment recall fee. NatWests actions here feel fair to me, and I dont 
feel that any further action is reasonably required of them in this regard.
Finally, I note that NatWest are now re-attempting to trace and recover Mr Ss money for 
him. But it must be reiterated that because the money is no longer with NatWest, they are 
dependent upon cooperation from other parties, and so any attempt that NatWest make for 
Mr S is on a best endeavours basis only.
I hope that Mr S can locate and recover the money that he transferred from whichever bank 
or financial institution it presently resides. But, as explained above, Im satisfied that 
NatWest didnt do anything wrong here regarding their role in the instructed transfer, and so I 
confirm that I do not uphold this complaint that Mr S has raised against them. I hope Mr S 
will understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2023.
