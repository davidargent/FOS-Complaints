The complaint
Mr E complains about problems accessing his National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
account.
What happened
Mr E says he had problems accessing online banking in 2020 and says his account card 
appeared to be blocked. He says he is concerned as he lives outside the United Kingdom 
and cant attend a branch. Mr E says his pension is paid into his NatWest account and says 
he spent some time on the telephone to NatWest about this issue and didnt receive 
promised call backs.
NatWest accepts that Mr E didnt receive promised call backs and that he spent some time 
on the telephone to it which involved passing the call to different departments. Its 
apologised and paid £60 compensation and paid £27 towards Mr Es call costs. NatWest 
says there are no restrictions on Mr Es account, and he is able to use his account. It says it 
has a record of Mr E using incorrect login details and suggests that may be the problem.
Mr E brought his complaint to us and our investigator thought NatWest had provided 
evidence that there were no account restrictions and that Mr E had used incorrect login 
details. The investigator accepted Mr E had received poor service when he called NatWest 
but thought the compensation fair and reasonable.
Mr E didnt accept that view and said the problems went back to the start of 2020 and says 
he has now been told the problem may have caused by him not receiving a new card reader.
The investigator thought these were new complaint points and asked NatWest for further 
information. NatWest maintains the problems were caused by the incorrect login details and 
the investigator came to the same view as he previously reached.
Mr E doesnt accept that view and has provided a background letter setting out his dispute 
areas and says the call costs are caused by his telephone provider not being able to 
distinguish 0800 numbers.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr E will be disappointed by my decision.
I have looked at NatWests records and am satisfied there is no record of any account 
restrictions or blocks placed on Mr Es account. I can also see NatWest has a record of Mr E 
using incorrect login details to access his account. So, I think on balance that NatWest has 
not placed any restrictions on Mr Es account and it more likely that the problems were 
caused by Mr E using incorrect login details. 
I appreciate Mr E says the problem has now been sorted out by use of the new card reader, 
but I can also see that NatWest says that shouldnt have affected the account usage. In 
those circumstances I cant fairly conclude NatWest has made a mistake here, but I am 
pleased the problem appears to have been sorted out. I also think Mr E makes clear the 
main part of his complaint is about account access which he now has.
There is no dispute that NatWest didnt deal appropriately with Mr E when he called it and 
that it didnt make promised call backs. I am sure that caused Mr E distress and 
inconvenience but Im satisfied NatWest has fairly apologised and paid what I think is a fair 
and reasonable compensation amount of £60. I also think NatWest has acted fairly by 
paying £27 towards Mr Es call costs. I appreciate Mr E says he made further calls to 
NatWest, but I have not seen evidence of those calls or evidence of the cost of them.
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest tried to help Mr E, but I cant fairly conclude its actions led 
to Mr Es account access problems. I appreciate Mr E was unable to attend a branch to 
discuss matters but that is not something I can fairly hold NatWest responsible for. I dont 
think Mr E has made clear what he would like NatWest to do to resolve this dispute apart 
from restore account access which it has done.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2021.
