The complaint
Mr M complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in August 2022 in which I described what 
had happened as follows:
Mr M and his wife entered into a purchase agreement with a holiday company to buy 
a holiday club membership in August 2009. Mr S also entered into a credit card 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance that he used to pay for the membership on 
buy now  pay later terms. Mr M then entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance that he signed in December 2009 to repay the credit card 
debt in February 2010. That loan was repaid in March 2013.
A claim was made to Barclays Partner Finance in October 2017 that the holiday 
company: didnt conduct a proper assessment of Mr Ms financial position and ability 
to repay the loan; applied considerable pressure to Mr M and his wife to procure their 
agreement to the loan; and breached EU law; and that Barclays Partner Finance had 
paid a commission to the holiday company that wasnt disclosed to Mr M. Although 
the claim letter was headed section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act it also referred 
to claims under section 75 of that Act for misrepresentation and breach of contract by 
the holiday company.
Barclays Partner Finance said that complaints regarding goods and services and the 
associated finance acquired are time barred under the Limitation Act 1980 after a six 
year period has elapsed so it had no obligation to investigate Mr Ms complaint. Mr M 
wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. He said that 
Mr Ms claim was made under section 140A and that the evidence available didnt 
appear to support his claim for a refund under the Consumer Credit Act. He said that 
Barclays Partner Finance had fairly investigated his claim so he wasnt going to ask it 
to do anything further to resolve his complaint.
Mr Ms representative, on his behalf, says that it doesnt agree with our investigators 
recommendation and has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says that Mr Ms response is that all the original paperwork was sent 
to it and he and his wife were told that they could sell the membership back to the 
holiday company after two years, with a profit, but they were never given anything in 
writing and that they tried to sell it back after that period and were told it didnt have, 
and never had had, the provisions for that.
I set out my provisional findings in that provisional decision which were that: I agree with our 
investigator that this complaint shouldnt be upheld for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ms complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down his claims under the 
Limitation Act and I accept that his complaint was referred to this service within six 
years of that happening - but I need to consider whether Barclays Partner Finance 
has acted fairly in saying that the Limitation Act applies to his claims;
Mr Ms claims are under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  in this 
decision Im not determining the outcome of those claims as only a court would be 
able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ms claim under section 75 is that the membership was misrepresented to him 
and his wife and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to 
them  and that theres been a breach of contract because the product lasts for a 
period in excess of 50 years and theres no fixed accommodation nor a fixed time to 
take it so the contract is illegal following a 2015 legal judgement;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr M could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the membership soon after they entered into the purchase agreement as 
that was when Mr M says that they entered into an agreement based on the alleged 
misrepresentations of the holiday company and Mr M suffered a loss as he entered 
into the credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance that he used to pay for 
the membership;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at about that time, so he would have had 
six years from then to bring a claim against either the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance  but he didnt make a claim against Barclays Partner Finance until 
October 2017, more than eight years later which was outside of the time limits set out 
in the Limitation Act  so I consider that his misrepresentation claim is time-barred;
even if Mr M only became aware that he could make a claim to Barclays Partner 
Finance after the legal judgment in 2015, that wouldnt help him with his claim as the 
alleged misrepresentation was made in August 2009 and he would have had to have 
made a claim within six years of then - when he had the knowledge to bring a claim 
doesnt assist him for the purposes of the Limitation Act (the time limits for a claim 
under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have 
knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that 
those sections are applicable to Mr Ms claims);the time limit for a breach of contract claim under the Limitation Act is six years from 
the date on which the cause of action accrued (which is when everything needed to 
make a claim had occurred);
Mr M and his wifes membership under the purchase agreement expired in 
December 2045 (so was for less than 50 years), the apartment number and week 
were specified in the purchase documents, the holiday club isnt in the country in 
which the 2015 legal judgment was issued and the holiday company isnt from that 
country either - so I dont consider that the 2015 legal judgment causes the purchase 
agreement to be illegal in these circumstances  and even if it did, Im not persuaded 
that the legal judgment is a breach of contract for which Barclays Partner Finance 
would be liable under section 75;
Mr Ms representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr M and 
Barclays Partner Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Mr M entered into the credit card agreement in August 2009, he entered into a fixed 
sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to repay the credit card debt and 
that loan was then repaid in March 2013  as Mr Ms claim was made to Barclays 
Partner Finance in October 2017 I consider that his claim was made within six years 
of the credit agreement ending so his claim under section 140A wasnt time-barred 
and I consider that Barclays Partner Finance should have properly considered that 
claim;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company and from what this service has 
seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less 
than 10% and I consider it be unlikely that Barclays Partner Finance breached any 
duty in making any such payment or was under any regulatory duty to disclose the 
amount of any commission paid in these circumstances;
I dont consider that the level of commission that was normally paid in this type of 
situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays Partner Finance should have 
appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr M risked the relationship being 
unfair under section 140A;
Mr Ms representative says that the holiday company didnt conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr Ms financial position and ability to repay the loan - Mr M used the 
Barclays Partner Finance credit card to pay for the membership, he entered into a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to repay the credit card 
debt and he repaid that loan in March 2013 - Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr 
M contacted Barclays Partner Finance about any financial difficulties or that he 
complained about the affordability checks until October 2017, which was more than 
eight years after hed used the credit card to pay for the membership, and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the credit wasnt affordable for 
him at the time that it was provided to him;
Mr M has provided information about the sale of the membership to him and his wife 
 and he says that they were told that they could sell the membership back to the 
holiday company after two years with a profit  but theres no documentary evidence to support his claim that they were told that they could sell the membership back to 
the holiday company;
Mr M says that all the original paperwork was sent to his representative but Ive not 
been provided with a copy of the purchase agreement  I have been provided with a 
copy of the acknowledgement form that he and his wife signed to confirm that theyd 
received the purchase agreement, financial forms, the holiday owners guide, the 
plan of their apartment, an information guide and other documents;
hes also provided evidence that shows that he and his wife asked to relinquish their 
membership and that the ownership of it was transferred out of their names in May 
2015 - but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they were 
told that they could sell their membership back to the holiday company after two 
years with a profit and, if that provision was important to them, I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect them to have checked that it was included in the documents 
that they signed;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr M and his wife were 
unduly pressurised into entering into the purchase agreement, that Mr M was unduly 
pressurised into entering into the credit card agreement, or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable commercial practices against them  Mr M didnt complain to 
Barclays Partner Finance about the way that the membership had been sold to them 
until October 2017 (which was more than eight years after theyd entered into the 
purchase agreement) and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to 
have complained to Barclays Partner Finance about any issues with the way that the 
membership was sold to them before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
has failed to comply with any legal requirements for which Barclays Partner Finance 
would be liable;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the relationship 
between Mr M and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair in these circumstances and I 
dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that the relationship was 
unfair;
I dont consider that Barclays Partner Finance properly responded to Mr Ms claims 
so I cant say that its acted fairly and reasonably  but I consider that it wouldnt have 
upheld the claims if it had properly considered them; and
I sympathise with Mr M and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their 
membership and the difficulties that Mr M has described, but I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance 
to refund to him any of the money that he paid under the purchase agreement, to pay 
him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint. 
Subject to any further representations by any of Mr M, his representative and Barclays 
Partner Finance, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to uphold this complaint. 
Barclays Partner Finance says that it has nothing further to add and Mr Ms representative 
says that after a comprehensive conversation with Mr M it will not be pursuing the matter any 
further.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I see no reason to change the findings that I set out in my provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 October 2022.
