K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains about the short term loans he took out with Casheuronet UK LLC trading as 
QuickQuid. Mr W says that the loans he took werent affordable  and they prevented him from 
meeting his essential living expenses. 
background
Mr W took out nine loans between July 2016  and July 2018. Some  of the information 
QuickQuid has given  us is shown in the table below:

QuickQuid has looked at Mr Ws complaint and said that it shouldnt  be upheld.  It said that it 
did appropriate checks for all of the loans. And these checks  showed  that the lending was 
affordable based  on Mr Ws declared monthly  income. It said that Mr W wasnt  dependent on 
short term lending as there were significant  breaks  between some of the loans.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ws complaint  and recommended that QuickQuid refund 
the interest and charges that he paid on loans 3 and 5 to 9. QuickQuid didnt agree with this 
recommendation and so the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Having done so, Ive decided to partially  uphold Mr Ws complaint. Having reviewed the 
evidence I have available I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  given Mr W loan 3 and loans 
5 to 9. Ill explain  why.
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Mr W and QuickQuid said. He thought Mr Ws 
complaint should  be partially upheld. He thought that QuickQuid had made  proportionate 
checks for loans 1 and 2. So he thought that QuickQuids  decisions to approve these loans 
were reasonable. 
Ref: DRN93706062He didnt think that QuickQuid had made proportionate checks  for loans 3 to 9. He thought if 
it had then it wouldnt have agreed to lend Mr W money for loans 3 and 5 to 9. This is 
because he didnt think that Mr W could  afford  the repayments. And QuickQuid  wouldve  
seen this had it completed  better checks. 
He thought QuickQuid would likely have seen  that Mr W wouldve been able to make  the 
repayments for loan 4.  
Mr W didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1, 2 and 4. Because of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. So I wont  be making a 
decision about them. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr W had with 
QuickQuid. So they are something  I will take into account when considering the other loans 
he took.
And QuickQuid didnt comment on our adjudicators findings about the proportionality of its 
checks or the affordability of the loans,  nor did it provide any new information for me to 
consider. It responded to our adjudication saying:
  In response to FOS assessment which recommends QuickQuid uphold  loans which  
were funded after March 2015, we regret to inform you that we cannot  agree to FOS 
recommendations. Please note that in QuickQuid's initial response to FOS we provided 
detailed information  indicating why the loans were responsibly lent to Mr W. Therefore, we 
kindly ask that you move this case to the ombudsman queue for a final decision  
QuickQuid first mentioned  this argument in its business submissions  to us in which  it said:
 We started implementing changes to affordability assessment in June  2014  and all the 
changes were completed by 28 February  2015. Starting 01 March  2015, much before Mr W 
borrowed his first loan, QuickQuid had implemented affordability review that is consistent 
with the FCA Handbook  and that was in place  at the time we received authorisation by the 
FCA. We confirm  that this assessment was conducted properly and individually for each of 
these loans 
It provided further detail  about the checks it had made when it approved  loans from 2015  
onwards in a document called CEU  Lending Criteria  and Proportional Checks.  And this 
response didnt  change our adjudicators opinion.
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument  directly and through 
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to expand on this point any further here, though  I 
have considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. 
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
Ref: DRN93706063ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman  are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent 
who handled  the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  
complaints received by the respondent and using this in training and development of 
the individuals dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA, other relevant regulators and the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  and communicating it to the individuals dealing  with 
complaints in the respondent. 
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Ws complaint and what both parties have said 
about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr W borrowed the loans in question.  Bearing in mind 
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher  the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
Turning to the specifics of Mr Ws complaint,
QuickQuid says: 
it recorded Mr Ws monthly income as being  £1,500 for loans 2 to 5, £2,000 for loans 
6 and 7 and £2,750  for loans 8 and 9 
it recorded his monthly expenditure as £302, for loan 1, £352  for loans 3 to 7 and 
£526 for loans  8 and 9
it validated the information it obtained using credit reference  agency data
it used the information  it had gained  from the credit reports to adjust the amounts 
Mr W had provided to calculated what it called his estimated disposable income (EDI)
why I dont  think QuickQuids checks were  proportionate for loans 3 to 9
For loan 3, Mr W needed to repay  just under  £700 the third month after taking it. He needed  
to make two smaller  repayments in the months  before.  That said this was a very large  
repayment compared with his income. And he had taken this loan very soon after loan 2.
And Mr W continued  to borrow going forward with very little break in between  the loans.  
Loan 5 started  off with a lower amount of £200  but it was increased very quickly. And the 
amounts he borrowed  for loans 6, 7 and 8 were very large at over £1,000  each time. Mr W 
borrowed £1,450  for loan 8 and he needed  to repay  over £1,800  two months  after it started.
Ref: DRN93706064So I think, by loan 3, given the size of the repayments in relation to his income QuickQuid 
shouldve realised at that time that Mr W mayve had some longer term financial problems 
and he wasnt just using  the loans to help with a temporary cash  flow problem. QuickQuid 
shouldve also become concerned about whether it knew enough about  Mr Ws true financial 
situation going forward.
So I think that before it approved loan 3 that it wouldve  been  proportionate to find out about 
Mr Ws normal monthly living costs and regular  financial commitments  including any existing 
short-term lending. And I think that from loan 5 onwards it needed to fully review his financial 
situation to make sure Mr W was in position  to make  the repayments sustainably.
Although I havent  seen  the full details  of all QuickQuids credit checks, it has provided me 
with its estimate of Mr Ws EDI. This is lower than deducting Mr Ws declared  expenditure  
from his declared income for loans 3 to 9. I dont know exactly how QuickQuid calculated
Mr Ws EDI  but it has said that credit  checks are one relevant factor.
But because I dont  know how QuickQuid actually  worked out the EDI, I cant say this 
reflects a proportionate check. So I cant safely say that QuickQuid found  out about  the other 
short term lending Mr W had and it doesnt seem to have fully reviewed his finances.  So I 
need to think about what its likely proportionate checks  wouldve shown QuickQuid if it had.
what I think proportionate checks would most  likely have  shown
Mr W has provided some information about his financial circumstances. This includes his 
bank statements and what  he says about  his income  and outgoings at the time.  I accept that 
this isnt exactly what QuickQuid wouldve seen at the time. But I think it wouldve found out 
similar information if it had made proportionate checks, so I think  its reasonable to rely on it.
For loan 3 QuickQuids  records  showed that Mr W had a disposable income of around 
£1,150. But his bank statements show that he had over £1,000 outstanding in other  short 
term loans. So I dont  think its reasonable to say that Mr W would be able to afford any of 
the repayments to this loan, even the lower ones. And the highest repayment, in the third 
month, was around  £700 which is much higher than what he would probably  have  had left 
over. 
Going forward the amounts  QuickQuid recorded  about Mr Ws income are similar to what  his 
bank statements show. There is some variation but not much.  But Mr Ws expenditure was 
higher than QuickQuid  recorded. His outgoings look to be nearer £1,000 for the earlier  loans 
and they increased  to £1,500 for the later loans. 
But Mr W continued to borrow and repay significant  amounts  from other short term lenders. 
And was also taking on other longer  term loans.  And by this stage, proportionate checks  
wouldve also shown QuickQuid that a substantial portion of Mr Ws income  was going on 
gambling. And I think that if QuickQuid wouldve seen all of this, it wouldnt have thought  it 
was responsible to lend to Mr W.
I think that QuickQuid wouldve found  out this information if it had made  proportionate  
checks.  And  I think QuickQuid wouldve seen Mr W wouldnt have been able repay the 
loans in a sustainable way. So I think that QuickQuid shouldnt  have given loans 3 and 5 to 9 
to Mr W and I think hes lost out as a result  of this.
Ref: DRN93706065So Im upholding  Mr Ws complaint about loan 3 and loans 5 to 9.
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
To put things right for Mr W, QuickQuid should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loans 3 and loans 5 to 8; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ws credit file about  these loans;
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
I understand there is an outstanding balance  on loan 9. For this loan QuickQuid should 
remove all the interest  and charges applied to the outstanding balance. QuickQuid should 
then re-work the account as if all payments made by Mr W went to towards  the principal. But 
importantly, QuickQuid needs to make  sure that Mr W doesnt repay more than the principal 
amount borrowed.
If after doing this Mr W hasnt repaid the principal he borrowed  QuickQuid  can deduct this 
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr W has already paid enough to repay  the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple  interest  from the 
date of payment  to the date of settlement
And if QuickQuid no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr W.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ws complaint.
Casheuronet UK LLC should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 April 2019.
