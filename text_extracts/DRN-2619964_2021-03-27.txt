The complaint
Mr S complains about how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) dealt with his 
chargeback.
 
What happened
Mr S says that he asked NatWest to raise a chargeback for accommodation and flights. He 
says NatWest took too long to deal with the request and lost information about the 
accommodation booking e-mails. Mr S says NatWests actions caused him distress and 
inconvenience as well as financial difficulties. He would like all of his money refunded.
NatWest says it refunded the accommodation cost but says it has to follow the chargeback 
rules and so asked Mr S for evidence the flight had been cancelled. It says the flight went 
ahead and so it had no chargeback rights. NatWest says the accommodation cost was 
refunded in April 2020 and doesnt consider that an excessive delay.
Mr S brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator thought the accommodation cost was refunded and within a reasonable length 
of time. The investigator thought Mr S didnt have any evidence that the flights were 
cancelled and thought the evidence she found showed the flight went ahead.
Mr S doesnt accept that view.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NatWest has dealt fairly with this 
complaint and hasnt made a mistake. I appreciate Mr S will be disappointed by my decision. 
I make clear to Mr S that I am only considering the chargeback in relation to the flights and 
accommodation and not the chargeback in respect of the insurance policy. I say that as Mr S 
has told us that his main complaint is about the flights and accommodation and the delay in 
dealing with his chargeback.
The chargeback rules are not set, as in this case, by NatWest but by the card providers. A 
chargeback is not a right but a voluntary scheme with no guarantee of a successful outcome. 
Im satisfied that NatWest refunded Mr Ss accommodation costs and within a reasonable 
time period of just over a month. So, I dont think that part of Mr Ss chargeback was badly 
handled, and I also think that NatWest dealt with that within a reasonable time period.
I have not seen any evidence that the flight Mr S booked and paid for was cancelled and I 
would have expected Mr S to have been able to have provided evidence from the airline that 
it had cancelled a flight. I have seen evidence that the flight did go ahead and so I think on 
balance that the flight went ahead and so NatWest correctly concluded that Mr S didnt have 
any chargeback rights for the flight. Im satisfied that NatWest correctly told Mr S that it 
couldnt take the chargeback forward in those circumstances and within a reasonable time 
period of a couple of months.
Overall, I find NatWest has dealt fairly with this complaint and hasnt made a mistake. It 
follows that I cant order NatWest to refund the flight costs.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 April 2021.
