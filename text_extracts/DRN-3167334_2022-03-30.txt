The complaint
Mr G complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refunded a buyer for an item he sold 
and then attempted to recover the money from him. Mr G is also unhappy his new PayPal 
account has been restricted so he is unable to access his funds. 
What happened
Mr G listed a new smartphone on an online marketplace in June 2020 which he sold for 
£925. The buyer paid for the item using PayPal. 
Mr G says the buyer filed a dispute with PayPal on the basis the phone was significantly not 
as described. Mr G says he was unable to respond to PayPal because his account was 
closed. Initially Mr G said he didnt receive any emails from PayPal and he was in hospital 
recovering from illness at the time of the investigation. 
Mr G says PayPal found in favour of the buyer and refunded him the cost of the phone 
placing his account £900 in debt. He says the buyer was also able to keep the phone. 
Mr G says PayPal initially instructed debt collectors to recover the cost of the refund from 
him. He was able to explain to the debt agency he had mental health issues and the debt 
was returned to PayPal. 
Mr G opened a second PayPal account which has a balance of around £200. He says the 
account was restricted by PayPal due to the balance owed on his other now closed account. 
He says he has tried to resolve this with PayPal but it has done nothing to help him so he 
made a complaint.
PayPal said it sent Mr G emails regarding the dispute over the smartphone. It told him it was 
essential for him to participate in the dispute process. It said if it didnt receive a response 
from Mr G the case would be closed and decided in the buyers favour. It said it told him that 
due to consumer protection laws it could not guarantee the phone would be returned.
PayPal said Mr G opened a second PayPal account in December 2020. It said since the 
accounts are linked and the old account has an outstanding balance it restricted the new 
account until the £900 debt is repaid. PayPal said the correct procedures had been followed 
and so Mr Gs complaint was not upheld. 
Mr G wasnt satisfied with PayPals response and so referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked into things. The investigator said he thought PayPal acted 
fairly and reasonably given their legal obligations and their agreement with Mr G. He said 
PayPal had written to Mr G to explain what would happen if it didnt hear from him, and it 
couldnt guarantee the phone would be returned to him. So the investigator didnt uphold the 
complaint. 
Mr G didnt agree. He said he was in hospital at the time PayPal emailed him and so couldnt 
respond to the email. So the complaint has been passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so am not upholding this complaint. I know Mr G will be disappointed by my 
decision and I appreciate his frustration that he has lost the money and the smartphone. But 
that doesnt mean PayPal is at fault for what took place for the reasons explained below. 
PayPal followed its processes and acted in line with its terms and conditions. It tried to 
communicate to Mr G that he needed to respond to the dispute and warned him that failure 
to do so would likely mean it would be resolved in the buyers favour. Initially Mr G said he 
didnt receive the emails, and then later said he was in hospital at the time and so couldnt 
respond to the emails. But PayPal wasnt aware of Mr Gs circumstances at the time.
Mr G received the money from the seller on 11 June 2020 and closed his account on 16 
June 2020. The buyer filed the dispute on 21 June 2020 and so even though Mr Gs account 
was closed the buyer filed the dispute in the time allowed to him by PayPals terms and 
conditions.
PayPal contacted Mr G. It told him if the dispute was found in favour of the buyer it couldnt 
guarantee the return of the item. PayPal told Mr G it was imperative Mr G engages with the 
investigation since his failure to do so would mean PayPal would find in the buyers favour 
and refund the money. PayPal said Mr G had until 12 July 2020 to file a response. Since 
PayPal didnt hear from Mr G it found in the buyers favour and refunded the money. Mr Gs 
closed account had no funds in it and so the refund meant the account was in debt. PayPal 
acted in line with its user agreement and followed its procedure. So I cant find PayPal was 
at fault when it refunded the buyer. 
I understand Mr G was affected by PayPal taking £925 from his account following the 
dispute. However, I think the terms of the user agreement are clear that a payment may be 
disputed up to 180 days later. And it is clear that funds will be required to cover the payment 
if the dispute is found in the buyers favour. The terms and conditions say, if there are 
insufficient funds in your balance to cover your liability, we reserve the right to collect the 
amount you owe to us by deducting the amount from a PayPal account held or controlled by 
you. So this is what it did.
I think PayPal made it clear what would happen if Mr G didnt respond. I note Mr G says he 
was in hospital at the time and so was unable to respond in the time given. I am sorry to 
hear Mr G has been unwell in hospital. I can see PayPal wasnt aware of this but it followed 
its dispute resolution process to comply with consumer protection laws.  And I cant see that 
Mr G responded to PayPal regarding the issue with the phone and his account until the new 
PayPal account was suspended 6 months later. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 April 2022.
