The complaint
 Ms H complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA mishandled her appeal under its 
Buyer Protection scheme and that it should now refund her for the loss she suffered as a 
result. 
What happened
 In February 2020 Ms H purchased a CV creation package for £80  through PayPal. The 
package came with a guarantee that Ms H says was important in her decision to go ahead 
with the purchase. 
But Ms H complains that the CV wasnt effective and when she went back to the business to 
ask for amendments, it wasnt willing to do the major changes she suggested and was only 
willing to make some minor amendments. Instead it offered her a months usage of an online 
platform that she hadnt asked for. Ms H left a negative review on social media about the 
business, following which it refused to work with her any more.
As Ms H felt that shed paid for a service she hadnt received, she complained to PayPal 
using its Buyer Protection scheme. Ms H says PayPal took the details but didnt ask for any 
additional details or evidence and a few weeks later, it emailed her to say her claim had 
been refused as the service had been provided. 
Ms H disagreed and, in July, PayPal agreed to open an appeal.  But Ms H says later that 
day she received an email from PayPal rejecting her appeal for the same reasons as it had 
given before.  Shes unhappy that PayPal didnt contact her for more information and doesnt 
feel it looked into her complaint properly. Shed now like it to refund her £80, being the cost 
of the disputed transaction.
PayPal said Ms H provided details about why she was unhappy with the service provided 
when she first lodged her claim. Following this, PayPal had contacted the merchant whod 
provided copies of all communications between them and Ms H.  It was satisfied that this 
showed the merchant had worked with Ms H to make all the requested alterations and that 
Ms H had received three interview requests when using this CV. On that basis, it was 
satisfied the service had been provided to Ms H.  And as Ms H hadnt provided any new 
information, the appeal was rejected for the same reason. It noted that external guarantees 
werent covered by the Buyer Protection scheme so this part of the transaction wasnt 
covered.
Our investigator upheld Ms Hs complaint. He said when Ms H raised her claim, PayPal was 
required to consider it in line with the terms and conditions of its Buyer Protection scheme. 
This stated that although PayPal said it could ask for more information if it felt it was 
necessary, it didnt say it would do so in every case. Hed seen that Ms H had the 
opportunity to provide details of her case over the online portal before the merchant was 
contacted, so he felt PayPal had acted reasonably in this respect
However, PayPal had then opened an appeal for Ms H but closed it on the same day without 
asking Ms H if she had any further information to be taken into account. He didnt consider 
that this was reasonable or fully in line with the terms and conditions of the Buyer Protection 
scheme. 
Hed seen that PayPal had said it already had sufficient information, but he didnt feel this 
took into account that Ms H wasnt complaining that she hadnt had the document but that it 
wasnt of the quality shed expected. For that reason, hed have expected PayPal to contact 
Ms H and take any additional information she might have into account in its assessment. It 
hadnt done so.  In the circumstances he recommended that PayPal pay Ms H £80, being 
the value of her claim. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive read and considered the whole file. But Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is 
relevant. If I dont mention any specific point, its not because Ive failed to take it on board 
and think about it, but because I dont think I need to comment on it to reach what I think is 
the right outcome. 
PayPals buyer protection guarantee is a voluntary scheme to provide buyers with additional 
protection. It offers the following terms:
When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a 
refund under PayPal Buyer Protection. When applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection 
entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original 
shipping costs you paid, if any. PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your 
claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection. PayPal's original determination is 
considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you 
have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination 
or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.
PayPal Buyer Protection may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a 
transaction:
You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an Item Not 
Received claim), or
You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a 
Significantly Not as Described claim).
In this case, Ms Hs claim was based on the fact that she considered the CV shed been 
provided with to have been inadequate and that she hadnt received the full support stated in 
the guarantee.
Ive seen that one of Ms Hs  concerns was that PayPal didnt contact her for more 
information when she first raised her claim. However, PayPal doesnt say it will contact the 
buyer in every case. And the question as to whether it needs to do so, will depend on the 
information thats been provided originally and what other information PayPal obtains from 
the seller.  In this case Ive seen that Ms H had the opportunity to provide the details of her 
claim when she first raised it. Ive also seen that PayPal then contacted the merchant who 
provided a copy of all the correspondence, showing the various amendments that had been 
made.  
I note PayPal says it felt it had sufficient information to show the service had been provided 
so it didnt need to ask for anything more. While I can see Ms H didnt agree with PayPals decision, I cant reasonably say it hadnt done what was required under the Buyer Protection 
scheme in this regard.
However, Ms H remained unhappy and PayPal agreed to open an appeal. I think its 
important to note here that Ms H had had difficulties in using the online appeal option and so 
shed had to contact PayPal via email and, for the same reason, any additional information 
she wanted to supply would have had to be done in the same way.
While the Buyer Protection scheme doesnt say that PayPal will always contact the parties 
for more information  it does state that there are only two reasons for raising an appeal and 
that is that there is new and compelling evidence that wasnt available at the time of the first 
decision or that there was an error in the decision making process. 
In agreeing to open an appeal therefore it had effectively accepted that one of those two 
options applied and, if that the case, then its difficult to see how it could decide the appeal 
fairly without also contacting the parties for more information. If it already believed it had all 
the information it required and that its original decision was fair, then its not clear why it 
agreed to open the appeal.
For that reason, I agree with the investigator that PayPal hasnt demonstrated that it dealt 
with Ms Hs appeal fairly or in line with the Buyer Protection scheme.
Putting things right
 I cant be certain that if PayPal had contacted Ms H that its decision would have been 
different. But as Ms H wasnt given the opportunity to submit additional information, I 
consider that she lost the opportunity to obtain the refund. For that reason Ive decided  that 
it would be fair and reasonable for PayPal to pay Ms H £80 to cover that loss.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Hs complaint and direct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA to pay her £80 for the impact of its poor service.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 April 2021.
